EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Good morning, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q. Did you review any documents last night for this depo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Talk to anybody other than lawyers about the deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went up the--Withdrawn. When you came down the 
stairs, picked up the golf cover bag and signaled to the limousine 
driver and then went inside the house, did you then turn on any 
lights? 
 
A: If the coach lights weren't on by then, I may have turned the 
coach lights on at that time. 
 
Q: Did you turn the coach lights on before you came out the door 
or after you went in the house? 
 
A: As I said, if they--possibly, if they weren't on then before then, I 
may have turned them on then. I don't recall.. 
 
Q: Before you actually stepped out? 
 
A: I don't recall if I did it before or as I turned and came back in. I 
just don't recall. 
 
Q: The light switch is on the inside? 
 
A: Yeah. And I may have done that, yes. 
 
Q: May have done what? 
 
A: Turned on the coach lights. 
 
Q: Before you picked up the golf bag and showed it to the limo 
driver or after? 
 
A: As I told you, I'm not sure if I did it before or after, but I may 
have. One or the other. 
 
Q; Was the entryway light on at that time when you came down the 
stairs? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: And did you turn that light on when you went in the house after 
you picked up the golf cover bag? 
 
A: I may have, but I know my lamp was on, so I may not have. 
 
Q: You have a separate lamp and a separate light in the entryway. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So your best recollection now is that you turned the coach lights 
on but not the entryway light? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: You may have. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You're just not sure. 
 
A: Just not sure. 
 
Q: And you are not sure if you turned it on before or after you 
came out of the house? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's asked and answered. You covered this all-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think I did, Mr. Baker, because I have 
a little notation here that I didn't. I was just trying to clarify this 
point. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. Go on. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you let him answer that question? 
 
MR. BAKER: Sure. Go ahead. 
 
THE WITNESS: I may have. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And you are not sure if you turned on 
the coach lights before or after you came out of the house. Is that 
correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Who was -- Withdrawn. At some point on the 13th of June 
when you were at the Rockingham property with Lange and your 
lawyers, Lange then left. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: At some point the police were gone, and you were in your home 
on the evening of June 13 without anybody from LAPD there. Is 
that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you were with some of your close friends and family. 
Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Who was there that evening with you? 
 
A: I'll just take a guess. My family, my immediate sisters and my 
mom 
 
Q: I need you to just give me the names. Your mother Eunice? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your sisters who? 
 
A: Carmelita and Shirley. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: My brother-in-law, Benny Baker. 
 
Q: First name? 
 
A: Benny Baker. 
 
Q: Benny? 
 
A: Baker. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I believe members of his family may have been there. I'm not 
sure. 
 
Q: Benny's married to Shirley? 
 
A: Yes. Nieces and stuff may have been there. 
 
Q: Their children, in other words? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: I believe, as the night went on, my son and my daughter. 
 
Q: Jason and Arnelle? 
 
A: Yes. I'm sure Cathy Randa was there. Bob Kardashian was 
there. And then there was just so many people coming in and out. 
 
Q: Who came in and out? 
 
A: I can't even recall all of them. I can't. Some of them--I think 
Ron Shipp was there. Joe Stellini I think I recall being there. I may 
have mentioned Kardashian. And there was just people coming and 
going. 
 
Q: Can you remember anybody else Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Not right now, no. 
 
Q: Who is Joe Stellini? 
 
A: A friend of mine. 
 
Q: For a number of years? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that the man who owns Stellini's? 
 
A: Used to, yes. 
 
Q: He doesn't own it anymore? 
 
A: I don't think it's open anymore. 
 
Q: You had a conversation with Ron Shipp that evening? 
 
A: I don't recall having a conversation with Ron other than general 
whatever everybody was saying to me. Oh, Kato was there. 
 
Q: Kato Kaelin? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Tell me what you said to Ron Shipp, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: I don't--Other than what everybody was asking me, how I was 
feeling, they were expressing their condolences, and it would have 
been in that vein. 
 
Q: Shipp was expressing his condolences to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For the loss of Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he had known Nicole himself. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you and he ever talk alone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you positive? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why are you so sure of that? 
 
A: Because my sister and my mom. l was with them all the time. 
When I went upstairs, it sort a was irritating that my sisters stayed 
with me, you know, and at times I got a little irritated. 
 
Q: At times you got irritated about what? 
 
A: Just irritated because you want to be alone, because I wanted to 
be alone and they wouldn't let me be alone. 
 
Q: Did you ask folks to leave? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went upstairs, you mean to your bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At any time that evening was Ron Shipp upstairs with you in 
your bedroom? 
 
A: I don't know. People --various people came up when they were 
leaving to say good-bye, and he may have been one of them. 
 
Q: And if he came up to say good-bye in your bedroom, were you 
and he alone at that time? A: If he were, no. 
 
Q: Who was with the two of you, you and Shipp? 
 
A: I don't know if he ever came up. 
 
MR. BAKER: Assuming that he ever came up. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know if he ever came up, so I can't say 
that. I just know my sister Shirley or my sister Carmelita were with 
me all the time. They just would not let me be alone. And my 
cousin -- and my brother-in-law Benny. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: They were with you all the time in the 
bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did they leave your bedroom? 
 
A: I don't think they ever did. 
 
Q: They slept there with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the same bed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where? On the floor? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there another bed in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where did they sleep? 
 
A: On the couch. 
 
Q: In your bedroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who slept on that couch that evening? 
 
A: My sister Shirley and Benny. I saw them from time to time. 
 
Q: Benny slept in the room, too? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did he sleep? 
 
A: On the couch 
 
Q: There are two couches? 
 
A: It's an L-shaped couch. 
 
Q: So the entire time you were up in your bedroom, from the 
moment you went up there until the moment you got up in the 
morning, your sister Shirley was with you. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was anyone else with you that entire time? 
 
A: I don't know -- For the entire time? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Oh, I don't know. I mean, there were people that came and 
went, as I told you before. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Shipp and you had a discussion that evening about a 
polygraph test? 
 
A: I don't recall that, no. 
 
Q: Is it your memory that that conversation did not occur? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you say to Ron Shipp something to the effect like, "How 
long does it take for the blood work to come back" or "blood tests 
to come back"? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversation with Shipp about blood tests or 
DNA tests? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're pretty clear on that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ask Shipp any questions about polygraph tests? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever taken a polygraph test? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I was going to say, since Nicole's death, have you taken a 
polygraph test? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you and Shipp discuss anything about polygraph tests? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell Ron Shipp, in reference to your statement to 
Vannatter and Lange about weird thoughts, that you were having 
weird thoughts that you might kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell Ron Shipp that you had had a dream about killing 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you say anything to Ron Shipp about dreams that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you say anything to Ron Shipp about having weird 
thoughts about Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The Ron Shipp you knew was a former police officer. Correct? 
 
A: I know --I knew he couldn't get back on the force, yes. 
 
Q: Why did you just add that? I didn't ask you that. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Well, Mr. Simpson, you appear to 
have some animosity toward Mr. Shipp. Is that correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either. He doesn't appear to have 
anything. Maybe he does in your eyes but not in mine. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have animosity towards Mr. 
Shipp right now? 
 
A: I feel sorry for Ron Shipp, yes. 
 
Q: Explain what you mean. 
 
A: I feel sorry that he's a troubled person, and I tried to help him 
before because he had some problems, and I tried to help him, and 
I feel the same way about him now. 
 
Q: Tell me what problems he has that you feel sorry for. 
 
A: Well, the problems I knew he had was drugs and alcohol, and 
now obviously I don't know. I haven't seen him in a year and a 
half, two years. 
 
Q: When did he have the drugs and alcohol problem that caused 
you to feel sorry for him?  
 
A: Previous to these incidences. 
 
Q: When was the last time that you knew or believed that he had a 
drug or alcohol problem.? 
 
A: Roughly a week or so before Nicole's murders. 
 
Q: How did you find that out? 
 
A: Because he was at my gate. 
 
Q: Uninvited? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which gate? 
 
A: The Ashford gate. 
 
Q: How did you see him there? 
 
A: I didn't see him 
 
Q: How do you know he was there? 
 
A:: He was on my intercom. 
 
Q: He buzzed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He asked if he could use my Jacuzzi. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: Told him, "Ron, I was in bed." 
 
Q: What time was it? 
 
A: I don't know. At night. 
 
Q: Were you alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was the housekeeper there? 
 
A: Maybe. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: What did he then say? 
 
A: He told me he had a big blond, a "Nicole type." quote, unquote. 
"You got to see this girl, OJ. Could he use the Jacuzzi told him I 
didn't think it was on. He told me it was on because he had been 
there earlier. 
 
Q: When you say you don't think it is on, you can simply turn it on, 
can't you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So then what happened? 
 
A: He kept saying, "I owe you, Juice. Please, man, I owe you. You 
got to see this girl." 
 
Q: What does that mean, he owes you? 
 
A: I guess if he owes me a favor. He will owe me a favor. 
 
Q: Oh, he will owe you if you give him this favor? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. Then what happened? 
 
A: Well, after he told me it was on, I pushed the gate button for 
him to come in and told him to watch the dog. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he knew that the Jacuzzi was on from earlier 
that day? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had he been out to your house? 
 
A: Evidently. 
 
Q: Did you know that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he have access to your property? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did he get on the property earlier that day? 
 
A: Well, one of the complaints that I've had previous that I had 
Cathy discuss with him through, because both Michelle and Gigi 
had concerns about it, is that he would show up at times, climb the 
wall and bring whoever group he was playing tennis with without 
telling anybody. When I was out of town also. 
 
Q: What wall would be climb? 
 
A: The Ashford wall. 
 
Q: Right next to this gate where the -- 
 
A: I don't know. I wasn't there to see what part of the wall he 
climbed. 
 
Q: You had told him he could come on your property and play 
tennis. Right? 
 
A: Only if he called first. As a matter of fact, I actually had Cathy 
have a conversation with him about that. 
 
Q: When did that conversation occur? 
 
A: In and around that time, and on previous times she's had to tell 
him,"Ron, you just can't show up at his house." 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, when you said you wanted him to call first, did 
you also want someone else to be home when he arrived? 
 
A: I would prefer that, yes. 
 
Q: So someone could let him in? 
 
A: No. So that -- I just don't like a lot of people on my property if 
I'm out of town, and I was gone most of the time, so -- and the 
housekeepers didn't --especially Gigi, because she was brand-new, 
she didn't know how to handle it, and she had mentioned it -- 
evidently she had mentioned it to Cathy, and then Cathy had 
mentioned it to me. 
 
Q: Did you tell Mr. Shipp that if no one was home and he wanted 
to play, he could jump the wall or -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: or get on the property? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So your understanding of your deal with him is that if -- that he 
shouldn't be jumping the wall and getting on the property to play 
tennis. Is that right? 
 
A: I had no deal with him. I don't think anybody should jump my 
wall without my permission. 
 
Q: And you told him so. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Through Randa. 
 
A: Right. And I told him myself. This was something that had 
happened before. 
 
Q: Now, when he came in and used the Jacuzzi, did you see him 
that evening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were in bed. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You came down to see him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Tell me -- 
 
A: At one point I did. 
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: He went to my intercom system out back, buzzed me -- 
 
Q: From the Jacuzzi? 
 
A: Well, in the backyard. And buzzed me and said, "Juice, please, 
man, you got to help me out here. I need a bottle of wine." I think I 
was speaking with Cathy Randa at that time and -- 
 
Q: On the phone? 
 
A: I said, "I'm on the phone, Ron." And he said once again this 
whole thing, and he described this girl as a "Nicole type." "You got 
to see her." 
 
And I said, "Ron, I don't even know if I have any wine." He said, 
"Ah, come on, Juice, please, man." So I got up. I went downstairs. 
I opened one of my patio doors. He walked in. I told him to look in 
the bar to see if there was some wine. I found a bottle that came in 
some -- one of the Christmas packages or some package somebody 
had sent me, and I opened it and --I gave it to him and, as he was 
opening it, he said, "Man, you should go see her." And I walked 
out back, and she was I wouldn't say a Nicole type, but she was a 
big blond, real tall, I would say 5-10,5-11 blond girl. And she was 
in the Jacuzzi, and she was talking about what a great property and 
that she could get used to being here, and asked me to get in the 
Jacuzzi. And then Ron was coming out at that period of time and 
said, "Come on, man, why don't you join us? And I said, "No, man, 
I got to get up early in the morning," and I went back upstairs. 
 
Q: Were you dressed? 
 
A: Had a robe on. 
 
Q: What color? 
 
A: Dark robe. 
 
Q: The robe you usually wore? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that robe taken by the police? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where was it? 
 
A: On the back door of my closet. 
 
Q: Is that a terry cloth robe? 
 
A; Yes, basically. 
 
Q: When you wear it, do you wear it open or closed? 
 
A: It depends. Obviously I didn't have it open because that girl was 
there, but I don't know. Sometimes open. Sometimes closed. 
 
Q: When you close it, do you tie it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How far down does it go? 
 
A: Almost--long robe, to my mid calf, I would say. 
 
Q: How long have you had that robe? 
 
A: Long time. 
 
Q: Where did you get it? 
 
A: Who knows. 
 
Q: Who gave it to you? 
 
A: Who knows. 
 
Q: Did you buy it? 
 
A: I doubt it. I never go to the store and buy robes, no. 
 
Q: What's a "Nicole type" mean? 
 
A: I would assume he was saying an athletic blond. 
 
Q: She didn't strike you as an athletic blond? 
 
A: She did, yes. 
 
Q: You said she didn't appear to be a Nicole type to you. 
 
A: In my opinion Nicole was much more attractive than she was, 
but outside of that, she was a big blond. 
 
Q: So a "Nicole type" to you met an attractive, athletic blond? 
 
A: Yeah, I think if I had to describe Nicole myself, I thought she 
was a gorgeous, athletic blond, yes. 
 
Q: When you went upstairs, is that the last you saw of Shipp? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how did you understand he would exit the property that 
evening? 
 
A: Out the gate, I would presume. 
 
Q: Did he know about how to get in and out of the Ashford gate by 
pushing it open, as you had described? 
 
A: I would assume so, but he also would have known probably to 
push the button. 
 
Q: Did Ron Shipp see you in the robe? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is this woman's name? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Did you ever see her again? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that the first time you had ever seen her? 
 
A: As far as I know, yes. 
 
Q: You said you don't go to the store to buy robes. Do you buy 
clothing in the stores? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What stores did you shop in to buy clothing three years before 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: I don't know. Hundreds of them. 
 
Q: Five years before? 
 
A: Hundreds of stores. 
 
Q: What clothing did you go and buy? 
 
A: Shirts, shoes, pants, suits. 
 
Q: You buy in Los Angeles clothing stores? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you ever make arrangements with the store to go there to 
shop when no one else is around? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: When it's closed or after hours? 
 
A: Never have in my life. 
 
Q: Before Nicole's death, when was the last time you had 
purchased clothing in a store? Do you remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you shop for clothing, do you shop alone? 
 
A: It depends. If somebody's with me, I'm with someone. If 
somebody's not, I'm not with anyone. 
 
Q: Did Paula ever buy you clothing from time to time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: They knew your sizes? 
 
A: Of some things. yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ever shop at any major department stores? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Name some. 
 
A: May Company, Emporium, Macy's 
 
Q: Emporium? 
 
A: Yeah. In New York, Bloomingdale's. What's the other big -- 
Gumbel's, Gump's -- 
 
Q: Gumbel's? 
 
A: Yeah. Gimbel's, Gumbel's. 
 
Q: Gimbel's. 
 
A: Gimbel's, Gump's, Neiman-Marcus. You name it. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever shop in these stores for you? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever shop in Bloomingdale's in New York for you? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Did you and she ever shop together at Bloomingdale's in New 
York? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Paula ever shop in Bloomingdale's in New York for you? 
 
A: For me? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: With you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your apartment in New York is not far from Bloomingdale's in

A: Correct. 
 
Q: Where exactly is your place in New York City? 
 
A: It's on 3rd and 65th. 
 
Q: 3rd and 65th Street? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where is the Bloomingdale's where you shopped and Nicole

A: It's on 59th, 60th, between Lexington and 3rd. 
 
Q: What clothing have you purchased at that Bloomingdale's in 
New York? 
 
A: Sweaters, suits -- no, I don't know if I ever bought a suit there. 
Overcoats. Probably slacks, shoes. That's all I can recall. 
 
Q: What items of clothing did Nicole purchase for you at 
Bloomingdale's? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And what about Paula? What did she purchase at that 
Bloomingdale's store for you? 
 
A: I don't know if she ever bought me anything from 
Bloomingdale's. 
 
Q: What kind of shoes did you purchase at Bloomingdale's in New 
York? 
 
A: Dress shoes, and at one point think I bought some winter boots. 
 
Q: Winter boots? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What kind of boots? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know the name? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're familiar with clothing manufacturers, aren't you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You're a fashion-conscious person. Right? A Yes. 
 
Q: You're in the public eye. Right? That's part of your career. 
Right? 
 
A: Being m the public eye?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 Q: You like to dress nicely. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you can't tell me the name of the company that made your 
winter boots? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Were they a brand name? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What about your dress shoes? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: Were they brand-name shoes? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What kind of dress shoes did you typically buy? 
 
A: Loafers. 
 
Q: Who made those loafers? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: You can't name a single company that made loafers that you 
owned? 
 
A: I've never walked into a shoe store in my life and asked for a 
pair of shoes by name, unless they were tennis shoes. 
 
Q: Well, I didn't ask that. 
 
A: Well -- 
 
Q: I didn't ask whether you asked for it by name. I asked whether 
you knew the name of any of the ] dress shoes that you have ever 
purchased. 
 
MR. BAKER: At the time he purchased them? Subsequently? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Any time, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe I've worn some Ballys. I believe I've 
had shoes called Ferragamos. I believe I've had -- I don't know if 
they would have been called Stacy Adams. I don't know if wing 
tips are a brand name or not or a style. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I am not limiting my question to 
loafers, by the way. Any kind of shoe. 
 
A: Other than that, I couldn't tell you. Reeboks, Nikes, Puma. I 
can't think of the name of the big golf company shoe right now. 
 
MR. BAKER: Foot-Joy. 
 
THE WITNESS: Foot-Joy. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. 
 
Q: Reeboks, Nikes, Puma. 
 
A: Foot-Joy. 
 
Q: Foot-Joy? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Ballys, Ferragamo, Stacy Adams, wing tips. 
 
A: Yeah, I'm sure I've owned those type of shoes before. 
 
Q: Wing tips is a style of shoe -- 
 
A: That's what I don't know, if it's a brand name or a type of style. I 
don't know. 
 
Q: Can you think of any other brand names of shoes that you have 
worn? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Are these the only brand-name shoes you have worn? 
 
A: I wouldn't know. 
 
Q: Have you worn shoes that you did not know the manufacturer 
of or the brand name? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: The answer is you have? 
 
A: I don't know. I would assume so. Since I don't know the names 
of the shoes, they could have been those. They could have been 
some other name. 
 
Q: Including Bruno Maglis. Correct? 
 
A: That would be in there, yes. I wouldn't know. I've never looked 
at -- I've never seen a pair of Bruno Magli shoes in my closet, and 
I've never looked for them. 
 
Q: But Bruno Magli shoes would be in there. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: In where? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I've never -- the only pair of -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what he said, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: But in where? Your question -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Bruno Magli shoes would be included 
in shoes that you have worn that you did not know the 
manufacturer of, the brand name. 
 
A: That's not correct at all. That's not correct at all. That's not what 
you asked either. That's not what you asked either. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me see the testimony, please. Let's not get 
excited. 
 
Q: "Question: I would" -- Let me go the one before. Let me ask 
you this. Let's go back-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Let's go back. Let's read these things. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I choose not to. 
 
MR. BAKER: I choose to. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It totally supports what said, but I choose not 
to. Would you like to have it read? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yes. I don't care what you think totally supports-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Would you like me to read it, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. I would like David to read it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, David, you read it to Mr. Baker. 
 
(Record read from Page 1301, Line 21 through Page 1302, Line 9.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't think it supports what you said, but that's in 
the eyes of the beholder. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't expect you to agree. 
 
Q: There are some shoes -- Withdrawn. There are shoes that you 
have worn --Withdrawn. I want to limit my questions prior to 
Nicole's death. Okay? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: There are shoes that you wore prior to Nicole's death that you 
did not know the name of the manufacturer or the brand name. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes, correct. 
 
Q: So you would not know whether such shoes that you did not 
know the name of were Bruno Maglis. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Has anyone purchased any shoes -- Did Nicole ever purchase 
shoes for you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anyone ever purchase shoes for you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: USC, the Buffalo Bills, and I can't think of anyone else. 
 
MR. BAKER: 49ers, Juice. 
 
THE WITNESS: 49ers. No. By then I was supplying my own 
shoes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Shoes for personal use and home use, 
I mean-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- not athletic shoes. 
 
A: No 
 
Q: No one but you bought shoes for yourself. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that true for five years before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever buy shoes that you knew were Bruno Magli 
shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because I know, if Bruno Magli makes shoes that look like the 
shoes they had in court that's involved in this case, I would have 
never owned those ugly-ass shoes. 
 
Q: You thought those were ugly-ass shoes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why were they ugly-ass shoes? 
 
A: Because in my mind they were. 
 
Q: What about them was ugly, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: The look of them, the style of them. 
 
Q: What about the style? 
 
A: I don't know. They were ugly to me. Aesthetically I felt they 
were ugly, and I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and to 
me they were ugly shoes. 
 
Q: Were they dress shoes? 
 
A: They didn't appear to be. 
 
Q: What did they appear to be? 
 
A: All-purpose casual shoes. 
 
Q: Did you own prior to June 12, 1994 all-purpose casual shoes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you own any dark all-purpose casual shoes? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't remember the all-purpose casual shoes that you 
owned as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Well, it's --"all-purpose" is what throws me. 
 
Q: That was your word. I'm using your word. 
 
A: Yeah. I would say no, I didn't. 
 
Q: You didn't what? 
 
A: Wear the type of shoe -- the type of shoe I saw in court. The 
Bruno Magli shoe I saw in court seemed to be the type of shoe you 
could wear in anything but rain. To me that's what they looked to 
be. 
 
Q: Why couldn't you wear it in rain? 
 
A: They didn't look like they were waterproof to me. But they also 
looked like shoes you can wear on a normal day also. 
 
Q: And you have shoes like that. Right? 
 
A: No. I think the type of shoes that I wear like that, I wear for rain 
and cold. 
 
Q: What casual shoes did you own as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I consider all my loafers casual shoes. 
 
Q: Loafers? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you own any shoes that were not loafers that were casual 
shoes of the type those Bruno Maglis were that you saw in court? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What I mean, "of the type," I don't mean that you couldn't wear 
them in rain or could wear them in rain, but just generally casual 
shoes, all-purpose casual shoes, excluding like fancy dress shoes.. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So all of your casual shoes that you owned as of June 12, 1994 
were loafers. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You owned no tie shoes? 
 
A: I do have tie shoes, yes. 
 
Q: But they're all dress shoes? 
 
A: For me they're dress shoes. When I wear tie shoes, they're for 
dress. 
 
Q: How many pairs of shoes did you own as of June 1994? 
 
A: A lot. 
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Give me your best approximation? 
 
A: 20 to 40. 
 
Q: Are you including the golf shoes? 
 
A: I guess you could throw those in there, yeah. 
 
Q: Would that increase the 20 to 40? 
 
A: I don't think so. Just all shoes, 20 to 40 pairs of shoes. 
 
Q: Let's exclude golf shoes. How many shoes did you own as of 
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I have absolutely no idea. 
 
Q: Let's exclude Reeboks and Nike and other tennis shoes. By 
tennis shoes I mean shoes that you could play tennis or basketball 
with. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How many shoes, excluding athletic shoes, did you own as of 
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Give me your best approximation, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: I can't. I can't. 
 
Q: 20 to 40? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Now, of those 20 to 40 shoes, how many were loafers? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: What is your best approximation? 
 
A: I couldn't give you an approximation. I would say the majority 
of them. 
 
Q: Of the 20 to 40 shoes. how many were dress shoes? 
 
A: I would say--I don't know. 
 
Q: Give me your best approximation? 
 
A: I can't. I can't. I can't do it. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I just can't recall. 
 
Q: Where were these shoes kept in your home? 
 
A: My closet. 
 
Q: The closet you've already described? 
 
A: Yeah. Now, you're talking about LA. Right? 
 
Q: Well did you have shoes in other locations? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: New York and Lagoon. 
 
Q: Have you ever bought shoes in Bloomingdale's in New York 
and taken them back to Los Angeles? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Including New York, Lagoon and Los Angeles, these shoes that 
you owned were roughly 20 to 40? 
 
A: I'm just guessing, yes. 
 
Q: And all the shoes in Los Angeles were kept in your closet. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In your bedroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: No shoes were in the garage or anywhere else. Is that right? 
 
A: They may have been. 
 
MR. BAKER: Excluding golf shoes again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excluding athletic shoes, golf shoes, yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: They may have been, but I don't know. But the 
majority-- the shoes that I wear are in my closet. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Was there anything about the color of 
the Bruno Magli shoes that you saw in court that you said made 
them ugly? 
 
A: I don't know. They were a bluish green, I believe, but no -- 
maybe. I guess aesthetically it was the whole thing together, they 
were not really attractive shoes. 
 
Q: It wasn't the color necessarily. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it the style of shoe? 
 
A: For the most part, yes. 
 
Q: And what about the style? 
 
A: Just aesthetically. I don't know. I looked at it. I didn't like it. I 
can look at a suit that's made by the same company and think it's 
ugly and look at another one and think it's gorgeous. To me, 
aesthetically I didn't like the shoe. Nothing specific. I didn't study 
it. I looked at it, and I didn't like the shoe. 
 
Q: Had you ever heard of Bruno Magli shoes as of June 12, 1994? 
A No 
 
Q: Did--The name meant nothing to you? A : Nothing. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: So if someone said "Bruno Magli" to you as of June 12, 1994, 
you would have no idea what that meant or what that referred to. Is 
that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now, you said the majority of your shoes were loafers. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the others were all shoes that tied. Correct? 
 
A: For the most part, yes. 
 
Q: Describe those shoes to me. 
 
A: They look like regular tie-up shoes. 
 
Q: Name all the brand-name shoes that you owned or the 
manufacturers of all the 20 to 40 shoes that you owned. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You can't do that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There's too many? 
 
A: I don't know the names of the shoes. 
 
Q: You have no recollection? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Can you positively... What size shoe does your son Jason wear? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Does he ever wear your shoes? 
 
A: He did in the past, yes. 
 
Q: And did you ever wear his shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not once? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: When you said, "He did in the past," what do you mean by that, 
A: In the past a couple of times when he was a teenager, he used to 
steal my clothes from time to time. 
 
Q: In the five years before Nicole's death, did he wear your shoes? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Did you ever buy any gloves at -- did you ever buy any gloves? 
 
A: I'm sure I did, yes. 
 
Q: You used gloves in the course of your work for television. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For example, in inclement weather at football games you might 
have to wear gloves when you're on the field interviewing athletes. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Or holding an umbrella. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What kind of gloves did you own for that purpose within the 
five years before Nicole's death? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Can you describe them to me? 
 
A: Nice gloves, blue--black gloves, brown gloves basically, and 
maybe once in a while some that's tan in there. 
 
Q: Did you buy those gloves yourself? 
 
A: I'm sure I have over the years, yes. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever buy any for you? 
 
A: I don't ever recall her buying me gloves, no. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever give you gloves for a gift? 
 
A: Not that I ever recall, no. 
 
Q: Did anyone ever give you gloves for a gift five years prior to 
Nicole's death? A: Not that I ever--well, no, not that I ever recall, 
no. 
 
Q: Can you positively say that Nicole never bought you gloves as a 
gift? 
 
A: I don't recall her ever buying me gloves as a gift. Yes, I think I 
can say that, yes. 
 
Q: You think you can say positively that she never did? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your size was extra large. Right? 
 
A: It depends. 
 
Q: Depends on what? 
 
A: Depends on the glove. 
 
Q: Some of the gloves were extra large sizes. Right? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: You owned gloves as of June 12, 1994, that were extra large 
size. Correct? 
 
A: I'm sure, yes. 
 
Q: How many pairs of gloves did you own as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Give me your best estimate. 
 
A: I couldn't. 
 
Q: More than 50? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: More than ]0? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: More than five? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Why don't you know? 
 
A: Because I lose gloves, and people -- NBC would have to get me 
gloves from time to time because I would lose gloves, and I didn't 
know if they were in New York or in LA. or where they might 
have been, so I don't really know what gloves I had. 
 
Q: Let's talk about gloves at Rockingham. How many gloves did 
you own and have at Rockingham as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: More than five? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Did you have so many that you can't remember? Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A: I just don't know what glove -- what ski gloves I had, what 
gloves are there. I didn't go in my closet and look for gloves and 
count gloves. 
 
Q: You wouldn't use ski gloves for work. Right? 
 
A: At times I did, yes. 
 
Q: You did? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You mean-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Have you been to Buffalo, Dan? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q: Where were all the gloves kept in your house at Rockingham 
that you owned as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: That I know of? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: In my closet, in another closet outside of my main closet. 
You're talking about Rockingham. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: My closet and my closet outside of my main closet. There's 
another closet that I keep mostly ski equipment. 
 
Q: Had you used the ski gloves for work within five years before 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: Those ski gloves? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: The ones at your Rockingham house? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Where is that closet? Is it outside your bedroom? 
 
A: No. It's in my bedroom, yes. 
 
Q: And the other closet is the big walk-in closet that apparently is 
cavernous. Right? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: And there is a place where gloves are filed--not filed. I've been 
working too long. A place where gloves are maintained there? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean in the big closet or the space next to the 
big closet? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The big closet. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think there's a drawer that they put my gloves 
in, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who is "they"? A Normally my 
housekeepers. 
 
Q: Where do they get the gloves from? 
 
A: If I brought them from New York -- when I get wet clothes, I 
bring back from New York, and they may have -- may not have 
been any gloves involved in that, they unpack for me and put them 
in various drawers and hang up various clothes. 
 
Q: Now, focusing on gloves, where would your housekeepers put 
your gloves? A: In a drawer. I can't recall if it's the top or second 
drawer in my bedroom. 
 
Q: Bedroom closet? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then is there another area where they would put gloves or 
where gloves were kept? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where is that? 
 
A: In a closet outside of my cavernous closet, as you described it. 
 
Q: Anyplace else? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: What were the names of the gloves or the manufacturers or 
brand names of the gloves that you owned as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Can't identify any? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Whatever they were, you just didn't know. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Were any of them Aris light Isotoner gloves? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know one way or the other. Right? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: In other words, they could have been. 
 
A: They could have been, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me mark some exhibits. I will mark what 
was trial Exhibit 606-E as Exhibit 54. I will mark as Exhibit 55 
trial Exhibit 606-F. I will mark as Exhibit 56 trial Exhibit 1371. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 56 through 58 were marked for identification 
by the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I have given you exhibits 54, 55 and 
56. We have to take 56 out of the wrapper so you can see the 
gloves. Now, looking first at exhibits 54 and 55, do you see the 
gloves that you're wearing in those photographs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you saw these photographs in court. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And those are brown leather gloves. Correct? 
 
A: They appear to be, yes. 
 
Q: The one in Exhibit 56 is black. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: A pair of black leather gloves. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: First of all, do you know the year in which the photos were 
taken here that's exhibits 54 and 55? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you give me your best estimate of the year in which you 
were conducting the interview that's depicted in those photos? 
 
A: '90. 
 
Q: 1990? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How do you know it's '90? 
 
A: Because Sam Wysch is in Cincinnati Bengal -- I don't know it's 
'90, I'm guessing it's '90. but he's in Cincinnati Bengal clothes. 
 
Q: So he would have had to be the coach of the Bengals. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that Boomer Esiason-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--next to him? Did I impress you, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: You did. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And what about the Exhibit 56? 
 
MR. BAKER: But you've been doing that for four and a half days. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What year is that, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Can you date it at all? 
 
A: After--1989 or after. 
 
Q: How do you know date that? 
 
A: Because I'm working for NBC. 
 
Q: When did you begin to work for him? 
 
A: 1989. 
 
Q: Do you know where the photo was taken, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell by looking at the coat, the tie, anything like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or the gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or the background, which you can't really see too well in this 
picture? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, focusing on exhibits 54 and 55, where you are wearing 
the brown leather gloves, do you know what the make of those 
gloves is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if they're Aris Isotoner gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would you have recognized Aris Isotoner gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know where you got the gloves that are depicted in 
exhibits 54 and 55? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who gave them to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether you bought them? 
 
A: I'm sure I must have, unless NBC did. 
 
Q: Why do you say you "must have"? 
 
A: Because I don't remember anybody else buying me gloves but 
NBC. 
 
Q: Did NBC buy them for you? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Do you know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you looked into that? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Have you asked NBC if they did? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What is the basis on which you say NBC possibly might have 
given you those brown leather gloves? 
 
A: Because on a few occasions we were in cold weather and I had 
lost my gloves, and the producer of whatever the show was would 
get a runner or somebody to get me some gloves, and on a few 
occasions the guy who pulls the string, the electrician, would give 
me his gloves. 
 
Q: And would you give them back after you completed the -- your 
use of them? 
 
A: If the electrician gave me his, I believe I gave him his back. The 
other ones, if they bought them for me, I just kept them. 
 
Q: Looking at the gloves in exhibits 54 and 55, is it your testimony 
that those gloves were given to you by an electrician? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if they were? 
 
A: I would say no. I would say no. 
 
Q: Those were gloves that you knew that you owned yourself. 
Correct? 
 
A: Well I'm saying I know the electrician didn't get me these. 
 
Q: However you got those gloves, those were gloves that were 
yours and remained yours. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: I am talking about the gloves in 54 and 55. 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: And the same thing for Exhibit 56. The black gloves you are 
wearing in Exhibit 56 were gloves that you owned. Correct? 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: And the black gloves in Exhibit 56 are not gloves you got from 
an electrician. Correct? 
 
A: I would believe they're not. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I don't think so. They were pretty beat up. 
 
Q: Now looking at the gloves in exhibits 54 and 55, the brown 
gloves-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --can you tell me where you got those gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me how you got those gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me in what city you obtained those gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In what store? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me how much they cost? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me when you acquired them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How you acquired them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me where they are now? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are they in your closet? 
 
A: I haven't seen them no. 
 
Q: Have you checked? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I assume the police checked. 
 
Q: Did the police find them? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: As of June l 2, were those gloves in your closet? 
 
MR. BAKER: And you are talking about in Los Angeles. Correct? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anywhere. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why don't you know? 
 
A: Because I wasn't looking for gloves on June 12. 
 
Q: So as of June 12, you were not looking for gloves on June 12? 
 
A: No. The weather here was very good. 
 
Q: As of June 12, 1994, do you know where the gloves that are 
depicted in exhibits 54 and 55 were located? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: If they were located in Rockingham, they would be in the areas 
you previously described: On the second floor in or near your 
bedroom. Correct? 
 
A: I would imagine so, yes. 
 
Q: Do you know what size those gloves are in exhibits 54 and 55? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you own gloves like these depicted in exhibits 54 and 55 on 
or about June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Why don't you know? 
 
A: Because I wasn't looking for gloves. 
 
Q: But did you know whether or not as of June 12, 1994 you 
owned gloves like the ones in exhibits 54 and 55? 
 
A: No, I don't know. 
 
Q: Can you positively say that you did not own those gloves as of 
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell us where you got the gloves depicted in Exhibit 
56? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell us how you got them> A: No. 
 
Q: When you got them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where you got them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell us who gave them to you? 
 
A: No. MR. BAKER: Assuming somebody gave them to him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Can you tell me, if you bought them, 
where you bought them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How much you paid? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me where they were located as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: No. MR. BAKER: Assuming that he-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Can you tell me, if they were at 
Rockingham, would they be in the areas that you described at or 
near your bedroom? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: Did you own gloves -- did you own those gloves depicted in 
Exhibit 56 as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you own gloves like the ones in Exhibit 56 as of June 12, 
1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Can you positively say you did not own the gloves depicted in 
Exhibit 56 as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you own more than one pair of gloves as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: You told me not to assume, so I can't assume. So I don't know 
how to answer that. 
 
Q: You don't know whether you owned more than one pair of 
gloves as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Well, you told me not to assume, so I can't -- I don't know how 
to-- 
 
Q: Do you believe you did? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you believe that you owned more than one pair of 
gloves as of June 12, 1994 like the ones depicted in Exhibit 54 and 
55? 
 
A: Like them? 
 
Q: Yes. MR. BAKER: Brown leather gloves. 
 
THE WITNESS: Or black gloves. Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And like the black gloves depicted in 
56? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Getting a lot of free legal advice here. 
 
MR. BAKER: And you were critical of me for passing notes 
yesterday. Come on. 
 
MR. KELLY: No one said it was free, Dan. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, do you know what sizes 
the gloves are in exhibit -- depicted in exhibits 54 and 55? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Extra large? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: That was your normal size, right, for gloves of the type depicted 
in Exhibit 54 and Exhibit 55? 
 
A: I can't say that. I can't answer that. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I don't know what the gloves were. 
 
Q: You liked tight-fitting gloves, didn't you? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: But for use in work you did. Right? A: Not necessarily. I liked 
warm gloves. 
 
Q: Warm gloves and gloves that fit snugly. Correct? 
 
A: You want them to fit, yes. 
 
Q: You don't want gloves for purposes of work, when you are 
holding a microphone and so forth, that are loose and you can't get 
sufficient dexterity. Correct? 
 
A: If they're not warm, I don't want to wear them. 
 
Q: But you are not going to wear big, loose gloves that are warm. 
Right? 
 
A: I have, yes. 
 
Q: But you normally didn't. Right? 
 
A: I wore warm gloves. 
 
Q: You wore warm gloves that fit snugly. Right? 
 
A: If they fit, they fit. If they don't fit, they don't fit. I don't know 
what "snugly" means. 
 
Q: Seems like I've heard that before. 
 
MR. BAKER: Then you must have quit. 
 
THE WITNESS: You must have quit, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have a different theory about that it. 
Anyway... 
 
Q: Those gloves that you see in exhibits 54 and 55 fit you. 
Correct? 
 
A: They appear to, yes. 
 
Q: And the glove in Exhibit 56 fit you. Correct? 
 
A: Better, it appears, yes. 
 
Q: What was the size in Exhibit 56? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What's your best estimate? 
 
A: XL, XXL. 
 
Q: "XL" means extra large. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. "XXL" means XXL. 
 
Q: Double extra large. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about the glove sizes in Exhibit 54? 
 
A: Be my same guess. 
 
Q: Extra large or double extra large? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why double extra large? 
 
A: Because some gloves I have to wear double XL. 
 
Q: Which gloves? 
 
A: Golf gloves. 
 
Q: Golf gloves? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Let me show you as the next exhibit in order, 57, a picture of 
some gloves that are currently in the possession of LAPD SID, 
Scientific Investigation Division. Same thing with Exhibit 58. 
Same thing with Exhibit 59. These are all pictures of gloves at 
SID. Same thing with Exhibit 60. Exhibit 61, Exhibit 62, Exhibit 
63 and Exhibit 64. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 57 through 64 were marked for identification 
by the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, I have shown you 
exhibits 57 through 64, which are copies of photographs in the 
possession of LAPD's SID taken from your residence at 
Rockingham. Do you recognize these gloves? 
 
A: From the pictures, yes. 
 
Q: They are gloves that you owned as of June 12, 1994. Correct? 
 
A: Well, I recognize them from seeing them in court. I would not 
have any independent recognition of these gloves if I hadn't seen 
them in court and it was purported that they were mine. 
 
Q: In other words, as of June 12, 1994, you owned these gloves, 
but you didn't have any particular recollection of them. Is that 
right? 
 
A: As of June 12th, I have no recollection of them. They showed 
them to me in court and said they were from my house and--yeah. 
 
Q: Looking at the gloves, you don't have any reason to believe that 
they were not your gloves. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you see that the sizing of these gloves is extra 
large? 
 
A: Yes. MR. BAKER: "The sizing of these gloves," I see on one-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Which one, Mr. Baker? On the back? 
 
MR. BAKER: I see it on 58, but I don't see it on anything else. I 
may have missed it. Okay, I think that shows the same glove, right. 
Yeah, it shows the same glove. at least it would so appear. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Where were these gloves maintained 
at your house on Rockingham? Do you know? 
 
A: No. If I had to guess -- no, you don't want me to guess. 
 
Q: Do you know where you got each of these pairs of gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know how you got them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:: Do you know the manufacturer of them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know when you got them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether you used any of these gloves for work? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know how old each of these pairs of gloves are? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are these all the gloves -- Well, withdrawn. 
 
MR. BAKER: Can we take a short break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Can I correct something on the record also? 
 
MR. BAKER: Sure, go ahead. 
 
THE WITNESS: My son kept ski clothes at my house also, so 
there is a possibility that those which appear to be ski gloves could 
have possibly been a pair of his. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Can you look through the photographs 
and tell me which ones you're referring to, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: The ones that look more like ski gloves. But these (Indicating) 
could be, too. I don't know. All of them. All of them. 
 
Q: I'm embarrassed to say that I don't know what ski gloves look 
like because I'm not a skier, but Mr. Baker is pointing to Exhibit -- 
 
A: I would say all of them. 
 
Q: Mr. Baker pointed to 62 and 65. Now, are you saying, Mr. 
Simpson, all of the gloves are ski gloves? 
 
A: Could be, yes. Yes. 
 
Q: So you are saying none of these gloves was yours? 
 
A: No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that there is a possibility that 
they could be my son's and there's -- obviously they could be mine 
. I don't know. 
 
Q: They could be yours. Right? 
 
A: Very well. Could be. They're in my house. 
 
Q: You don't know for a fact that they're your son's. Right? 
 
A: No. I just want to alert you that there is that possibility, but if 
they are in my closet, they should have been mine. 
 
Q: As Mr. Baker has reminded us, anything is possible. We can 
take a break now. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:55.  
 
(Recess.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 65 through 70 were marked for identification 
by the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately l 1:26. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, off the record I 
premarked exhibits 65 through 70. You have those photographs in 
front of you. They are pictures of what? 
 
A: This looks like what has been described as a watch cap, all blue 
or black, and this appears to be--well, those. I don't know if you 
said both names.  
 
Q: It looks like two different watch caps here? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Exhibits 68, 69 and 70 are a blue watch cap? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And 66-- 
 
A: Blue or black, I guess. I can't tell from these photos. 
 
Q: 65, 66 and 67 appear to be like a black-and-white watch cap? 
 
A: Yeah, or blue and white, one of those. 
 
Q: These, I will represent to you, are pictures taken of watch caps 
at the LAPD's SID facility and apparently taken from your home. 
Do you own these two watch caps? 
 
A: I can't--I don't know. 
 
Q: As of June 12, 1994, did you own the watch caps depicted in 
exhibits 65 through 70? 
 
A: Yeah, I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you own watch caps as of June 12, 1994? 
 
A: We get to that you don't want me to assume thing. We get to 
that. so I don't know. 
 
Q: Well, when you say "assume," do you believe you had hats of 
the sort or caps of the sort depicted in exhibits 65 through 70 as of 
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I would imagine so. 
 
Q: And where would they have been kept at your house at 
Rockingham? 
 
A: In a ski closet. 
 
Q: And where is that ski closet? 
 
A: Outside of my main closet. 
 
Q: Is that where the ski gloves also would have been? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you wear hats or caps such as these depicted in exhibits 
65 through 70 for skiing? 
 
A: When I skied, yes. 
 
Q: As of June of 1994, were you still skiing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did you stop skiing? 
 
A: I would--I'm guessing the late '80s. 
 
Q: What use of watch caps -- of your watch caps did you make 
from the time you stopped skiing through June of 1994? 
 
A: When you say my watch caps, these aren't all my watch caps, I 
don't think.  
 
Q: These are not yours? 
 
A: That's a girl's watch cap there (Indicating). 
 
Q: How can you tell? 
 
A: The color. I believe it's Nicole's. 
 
Q: You recognize it as Nicole's? 
 
A: I know she had one like that, yes. 
 
Q: For the record, you are referring to exhibits 65,66 and 67. And 
with reference to 68, 69 and 70, what use did you make of that 
watch cap from the time you stopped skiing in the late '80s until 
June of 1994? 
 
A: I don't know if this is my watch cap, but I didn't make use of 
any watch cap in that period of time. 
 
Q: The watch caps like the one in Exhibit 69 -- 68 through 70 that 
you did have as of June of ]994, what use were you making? 
 
A: If I had a watch cap at this time, no use. 
 
Q: It was just in your closet or your ski drawer? MR. BAKER: Ski 
closet. BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Ski closet. 
 
A: Yes, with all the other ski clothes that I was making no use of. 
 
Q: But you can't say positively you did not have the ski cap -- the 
watch cap identified in exhibits 68 through 70. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What size hat did you wear in June of 1994? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What size watch cap did you wear? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have a general sense of what size your -- you wore for 
hats or caps in June of 1994? 
 
A: Large. 
 
Q: You have a large head? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have a nickname as a result of having a large head? 
 
A: I had one. 
 
Q: What was it? 
 
A: Headquarters. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Headquarters. 
 
Q: Headquarters. When did you have that nickname? 
 
A: As a kid. 
 
Q: In terms of numbers, like size 10, size 8, size 9, what size hat do 
you wear? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any estimation of that, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell by looking at Exhibit 68 through 70 whether that's 
the size of hat that you wear? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Does size 8-1/2 seem right to you? 
 
A: No, I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Is that a size? That's 8-1/2 inches. Is that how they 
do it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't either. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think so, because it seems too small. 
 
MR. BAKER: It seems too logical. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you own any dark sweat suits as 
of June of 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're positive? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I didn't wear sweat suits. 
 
Q: So you owned none at all? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What do you consider to be a sweat suit? 
 
A: Sweat suit, sweat pants, classic sweat pants, classic sweat shirt. 
 
Q: What clothing did you wear in June of 1994 for exercising? 
 
A: I wore tight--what they call -- they look like bicycle pants. 
 
Q: Spandex? 
 
A: Spandex, yes. Spandex shorts. 
 
Q: What long pants, if any, did you wear for exercising? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: At no time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you wear any exercise clothes on your exercise video that 
you made in May of 1994? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: What did you wear? 
 
A: Whatever they gave me. 
 
Q: What did they give you? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was it long pants or short pants? 
 
A: I believe they were short pants. 
 
Q: Did you wear any long pants? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Whatever they gave you, did you keep? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You gave it back to them? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: To whom did you give it back? 
 
A: Whoever was in charge of wardrobe and stuff there. 
 
Q: As of June of 1994, did you own any athletic wear, dark in 
color, long pants? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by "athletic wear." 
Anything like he said that he used? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Anything you would work out with or 
participate in athletic events or sports, as opposed to slacks you 
would wear to go someplace. 
 
MR. BAKER: Excluding golf clothes, I assume. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think we can exclude golf, because you 
wear kind of normal slacks for golf -- 
 
MR. BAKER: No. It's absolutely obligatory that you wear the 
ugliest pants ever made. He doesn't, but a lot of golfers do. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I just want to make sure we're talking 
about the same thing. Did you understand -- Can you differentiate 
between golf pants and other athletic pants? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, put aside golf pants. Did you own any other dark 
athletic pants? 
 
A: Not that I'm aware of. 
 
Q: No long athletic wear type pants at all? 
 
A: Not that I'm aware. 
 
Q: When you say not that you're aware, you could have owned 
some pants but not be aware of it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how could that have happened? 
 
A: Just like all the ski clothes, I have no idea what's in that ski 
closet, but you guys pulled some caps and some gloves from there. 
I wouldn't have known because I haven't looked in that closet in 
years. 
 
Q: By the way, we didn't pull this. A: Well, whoever did. 
 
Q: This was taken from your home by the LAPD. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: By the way, can we get a stipulation that we can at 
least get his golf clubs back? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I guess we can talk about that. I don't know 
where they are. 
 
MR. BAKER: I do. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: They're in evidence, I think. Right? They're 
not at the LAPD SID. I think they're a trial court exhibit. 
 
MR. BLASIER: I think they are. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Anyway, those are the Callaway golf 
clubs-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- in evidence? 
 
A: I guess so. I'd like to have them, though. 
 
Q: Let me ask you a question about those golf clubs. 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm sorry. 
 
MR. KELLY: Take a couple hours, Bob. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When you last saw those golf clubs is 
when you packed them. Right? 
 
A: What do you mean? The clubs? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That was on the evening of June 12, 1994. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you put the golf clubs in the golf cover bag, that's the last 
time you saw those golf clubs. Right? 
 
A: The clubs, yes. 
 
Q: When that bag--That bag was checked in at the airport to go 
onto the airplane. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you arrived in Chicago, you were picked up by a Hertz 
representative named Merrill. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you knew Merrill from before. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did you know his name was Merrill when I just said it? 
 
A: Because he was in court. 
 
Q: So Merrill picked up your golf clubs and you and the rest of 
your luggage and put it all in his trunk. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what happened to -- He took you right to O'Hare Plaza? 
 
A: If that was the hotel, yes. 
 
Q: And then when you got out,what luggage came out with you? 
 
A: My grip, my Louis Vuitton bag and my suit. 
 
Q: And you left the golf clubs. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And in the golf clubs was that blue-grayish bag that you had 
already consolidated. Right? 
 
A: I assume so, yes 
 
Q: Where did you understand the golf clubs were going? 
 
A: Well, they would have eventually been on my golf cart when 
we started to play golf. 
 
Q: What time was your tee time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Roughly. 
 
A: Noon. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How were you going to find out where to go to play golf? 
 
A: He was going to pick me up and take me. 
 
Q: What time did you set for him to pick you up? 
 
A: 10:30 or 11:00. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: The next morning? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were going to sleep for-- 
 
A: Well, that morning. 
 
Q: The morning of June 13. 
 
A: Yeah. I didn't get there till 6 something, to the hotel-- 
 
Q: 6 something Chicago time. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were going to sleep for a while? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then he was going to pick you up. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were going to leave the rest of your luggage at the hotel 
and come back. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were going to take it all with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then after golf you were going to an event that evening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At the country club where the golf course is? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And then the plan was to, if you didn't find Mike Ditka, to come 
back to L.A. that evening. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, if I didn't get into another golf game, I would come back 
to L.A. that evening. 
 
Q: And you had a reservation. Correct? 
 
A: On the plane, yes. 
 
Q: What time that evening? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't recall. 
 
Q: What instructions did you give Merrill to do with respect to 
your golf clubs? 
 
A: None. 
 
Q: Did you understand that Merrill knew what to do? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you know that? 
 
A: Well, he's gonna pick me up the next day and we're going to the 
golf course. 
 
Q: I see. So you understood that when Merrill picked you up, the 
clubs would still be in his trunk. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Of the same car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you know that would be the same person picking you 
up at the hotel? 
 
A: He told me. 
 
Q: He said, "Mr. Simpson. I'm gonna be the same person picking 
you up?" A: Yes. 
 
Q: If he told you some other person was going to pick you up, 
would you have then taken your clubs with you? 
 
A: More than likely, yes. Unless he was going to the golf course, 
he could have taken them there. 
 
Q: Where did you understand Merrill was headed during the time 
you were sleeping? 
 
A: Home. 
 
Q: Did you call Merrill the next morning to tell them--to tell 
Merrill not to pick you up? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have someone do so for you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Merrill came to pick you up? 
 
A: I believe he was on his way. 
 
Q: On his way when? 
 
A: That morning. 
 
Q: When what? When you left the hotel? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you get any instructions to Merrill that you were leaving 
unexpectedly? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you get those instructions to him? 
 
A: I called him. 
 
Q: Where did you call him from? 
 
A: The hotel. 
 
Q: Before you checked out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And so--Where did you reach Merrill? 
 
A: I believe at his home. 
 
Q: How did you get his phone number? 
 
A: He left it with me. 
 
Q: And why did he do that? 
 
A: Because if something came up, I guess. 
 
Q: Like what? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You told Merrill that if something came up, you would want to 
be able to get in touch with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you got his phone number. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't get his phone number? 
 
A: He gave me his phone number or it was in my travel file, one or 
the other. 
 
Q: Before this occasion had you ever seen Merrill before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you ever had his number before? 
 
A: No.

Q: It wasn't a limousine, in other words, or a stretch or a sedan? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: None of those. Right? 
 
A: None of those. 
 
Q: When you got to Chicago, you went down to pick up your 
luggage. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At O'Hare. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you make any phone calls before you got to the 
luggage place? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Like any phone calls from the phone booth? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went there, did you go to where the luggage comes 
down? 
 
A: Yes.

Q: Except your grip? 
 
A: I think everything went in the back. 
 
Q: You sat in the front seat? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have your cell phone with you? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did you make any phone calls? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there a phone in the car?

Q: When did you receive the phone number? 
 
A: If it wasn't already in my folder, he gave it to me. 
 
Q: How would it already have been in your folder? 
 
A: Cathy's very efficient, and normally all that information is in 
my folder and whatever letters he had previously written to Cathy. 
I think a copy of one of those letters was in the folder, too, my 
travel folder. 
 
Q: Where is that folder? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did the police take it? 
 
A: I don't think so.

did you keep it?

a calendar and whatever correspondence has to do with that event, 
put it in a manila envelope, staple my tickets there so I'll know 
what the heck I'm doing.

to be today. Thank you very much. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I was hoping you could help us out there. 
 
Q: What did you and Merrill talk about on the way to the hotel? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: But you made sure you had his home phone number. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you had it. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Merrill told you he would pick you up the next day around--
later that day, around 10:30 or so. Right?

A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have it? 
 
A: I'm sure it would have been in my folder, yes. 
 
Q: Did you know where Merrill was going to be during the 
intervening four hours?

Q: When he picked you up, did he -- He did not pick you up 
because he-- you called him. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you reached him at his home?

Q: What did you tell him? 
 
A: I told him I needed to get back to the airport and could he come 
get me. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He was on his way. 
 
Q: And how long did it take for him to get there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did he get there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I saw some other Hertz people there when I was in the 
lobby, and they took me to the airport. 
 
Q: Did you make arrangements to tell Merrill or to get word to 
Merrill that you would be gone? As I understand what you're 
saying, you asked Merrill to come get you right away. Correct? 
 
A: Yes.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: So to your knowledge Merrill was going to arrive, and you 
would not be there. Right?

yeah.  
 
Q: But your golf clubs would be with him. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you make arrangements with anybody before you hopped 
in that ride to get your golf clubs back?

A: A Hertz person. 
 
Q: Just happened to see such a person out in the hotel area? 
 
A: They were arriving, I guess some clients with some Hertz 
people.

going there to wait for Merrill?

A: They called for one. There was no cabs there. 
 
Q: Did you go to the front desk to check out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And pay your bill? 
 
A: I don't think I paid the bill, no. 
 
Q: It was paid by Hertz? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So what did you do at the front desk? 
 
A: I asked them, could they call me a cab, and I asked for a 
bandage.

Q: What did you do with the toilet paper? 
 
A: I guess threw it away. 
 
Q: What kind of Band-Aid did the person give you? 
 
A: A Band-Aid. 
 
Q: You put it on right there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Right at the front desk? 
 
A: I don't recall. It was either at the front desk or away, because a 
lot of people were trying to check out. I may have walked over a 
little bit or I may have done it at the front desk. I don't remember. 
 
Q: Where did you throw the toilet paper? 
 
A: I don't know. Not on the ground -- not on the floor, I'm sure. 
Maybe there was a thing for, you know, cigarette smokers. Ashtray 
thing may have been there. 
 
Q: Who did you talk to at the front desk? 
 
A: Whoever was behind the desk. 
 
Q: Do you remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Man or woman? 
 
A: I believe it was a woman. 
 
Q: Caucasian? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did she testify in court? 
 
A: I think she was -- I think she was in town to testify, but I don't 
know if she ever got on the stand. 
 
Q: Did you tell her you were hurry? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Asked her for a cab?

Q: Did you ever get your clubs back? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: Tuesday, I believe.

he came to the airport and got them checked on the flight. 
 
Q: The flight that you were on? 
 
A: I assume so, yes. 
 
Q: What's the basis for what you just said? 
 
A: He told me this the next day. 
 
Q: You talked to Merrill the next day, being Tuesday? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did that come about? 
 
A: I was in my office speaking with someone else, and Cathy had 
called him or he called Cathy -- I don't know which one -- and 
Cathy told me he was on the phone. And I apologized to him for 
how rude I was. I felt I was pretty rude to him when I called him 
that morning. 
 
Q: What did you say to Merrill when you called that morning that 
was rude? 
 
A: I think -- that morning I don't think I was rude at all The next 
day I was rude. That morning I just said, "I need to get out of here, 
and I need to get out of here now," and I think I was very abrupt 
and I was rude. I was -- I was not nice. 
 
Q: You're talking about when you called him from the hotel to 
come get you right away? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you tell him that your wife had been killed?

say anything. 
 
Q: Who told you that?

morning.

you? A Well, I assumed they were. 
 
Q: How? 
 
A: He said he got there before my plane left, and evidently the 
skycap had done it. I don't know. Maybe it came on a later flight. 
I'm not sure.

finished speaking to, for the first time, to Bob Shapiro, and I was in 
the office, and Cathy said he was on the phone. 
 
Q: And do you know why Merrill happened to be on your office 
phone?

actually-- I left no explanation with these people, and maybe she 
was explaining to them and, you know... I don't know.

kids to get here, and we were -- Bob asked if I wanted to go 
straight to his house. I told him "No. Just drive." And-- 
 
Q: Just drive? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Nowhere in particular? 
 
A: Yes. And then we were down Bundy at some area, and I said, "I 
think I have some bags at the airport" or "bag at the airport," and 
we went to the airport. 
 
Q: What bags did you think you had at the airport? 
 
A: Golf clubs. 
 
Q: How did you know it would still be there? 
 
A: I assumed it would be. 
 
Q: How did you know that Cathy Randa hadn't made arrangements 
to get it back? 
 
A: I just assumed it would be there. 
 
Q: Did you call Cathy first and say, "By the way, did you make 
arrangements to pick up my clubs so I don't have to go down there 
and get them?" A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask someone else to get them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where were your children? 
 
A: En route from Lagoon to Bob's house. 
 
Q: Had they already left when you decided to go to the airport? 
 
A: I think they were about to leave. 
 
Q: You called down there? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: From Bob's car phone? 
 
A: Or we called Bob's house and Bob said A.C had just called, one 
or the other. 
 
Q: Your children were with A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who else? 
 
A: I assume the Brown family. 
 
Q: What about Arnelle? 
 
A: I don't think so, but could have been, but I don't think so. 
 
Q: Who took your children to the Brown residence? 
 
A: A.C. 
 
Q: Did he go alone with the children? 
 
A: I was in Chicago, so I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you find out later that he took them down there alone? 
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q: He took them down there the evening of -- I guess it would be 
the wee hours of the morning of the 13th? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know when the children got to the Brown residence? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you know whether anyone besides Cowlings was there 
with your children from Brentwood? In other words, did any of 
your other family members go down to be with the children? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: When you say "down," do you mean down to 
Lagoon? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you talk to Cowlings about 
getting the kids back to you? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: Did you talk to Cowlings about getting the children back to 
you? 
 
A: I must have, yes. 
 
Q: This is now Tuesday morning. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had you seen Al Cowlings yet? MR. BAKER: When you say, 
"This is now Tuesday morning," what are you

what?

A: What about it? 
 
Q: What day is this? 
 
A: Tuesday. 
 
Q: Tuesday, the 14th. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You got back into town on the 13th. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had you seen Cowlings yet? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to him? 
 
A: I feel I must have. 
 
Q: Did you call him from the hotel room? 
 
A: No.

Q: Was he at your house on Monday night? 
 
A: I can't recall. 
 
Q: So Cowlings was going to take the children to Bob's house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they were going to be there in about an hour? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why did you want to just drive around? 
 
A: Because I just--that's what I do. 
 
Q: You drive around a lot? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: No place in particular? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long have you been doing that? 
 
A: My whole adult life. 
 
Q: Where do you like to drive around? 
 
A: It depends. 
 
Q: What are your--what are some of your more favorite places you 
like to go? 
 
A: I don't think there is any favorite place. I just like to get on the 
freeway and move normally or drive around. That's what I've 
always done when I've been troubled. 
 
Q: So when you decided to go to LAX, you didn't know whether 
you were going to find your golf clubs there. Right? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And made no effort to find out. Right? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And when you got to the airport, what did you do? 
 
A: I think we went to where luggage -- lost luggage, and then we 
went-- I believe they said--I don't know. We went to lost luggage, 
and then we went to wherever the luggage was. 
 
Q: Did you park the car? 
 
A: No. Just at the curb. 
 
Q: Did both of you go in? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you make arrangements to not get ticketed? 
 
A: I don't know how you can do that. 
 
Q: So you just left the car there. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: American Airlines? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Baggage pickup. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Went inside and went where? 
 
A: I think to lost and found. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: That I was looking for a bag and I didn't have the ticket. 
 
Q: Who did you talk to? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Man or a woman? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Caucasian? African-American? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: What did that person say? 
 
A: I don't know exactly. Obviously that the bag was -- to go to the 
other end or something. I don't -- I don't remember specifically 
what they said. 
 
Q: Now, did you describe the bag you were looking for? 
 
A: I must have. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: "I'm looking for a golf bag." 
 
Q: So that person sent you someplace else? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: To the other end of the baggage claim. 
 
Q: And what did you do there? 
 
A: Some--I saw the bag, and a guy opened the cage and gave me 
the bag. 
 
Q: You just saw it through the cage? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you prove to him that it was your bag? 
 
A: He didn't ask for any proof. 
 
Q: Did he recognize you? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: What did you say to him? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know who that person is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you identify that person? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Man or woman? 
 
A: I think that was a man. 
 
Q: The bag was in the blue cover bag. Right? 
 
A: I don't know if it was a blue cover bag-- 
 
Q: It was a cover bag. Right? A Yes 
 
Q: What did you do with the bag when you got it? 
 
A: Either Bob carried or I carried it and put it in the trunk of his 
car. 
 
Q: Did you look inside? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you open it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not once? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you open it to see if everything was in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I wasn't -- I'm a trusting person, I guess. 
 
Q: You didn't care to see if--These were your favorite golf clubs. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In fact, you want them back right now, don't you? 
 
A: Yes MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Your lawyers asked for the clubs 
back. 
 
MR. BAKER: I want them back. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: These are your favorite golf clubs. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you didn't look inside? 
 
A: I've never gotten to an airport and looked to see if all my clubs 
were still in the bag ever in my life when I checked the golf clubs -
- golf bag. 
 
Q: Is this the first time in your life you've gone to an airport the 
day after you came into town with your luggage to get your golf 
clubs? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: Is this the first time you made a special trip to the airport to get 
your golf clubs?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did that happen before? 
 
A: Many times before. 
 
Q: Many times when you would come back into town with your 
luggage and your golf clubs not be with you? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you would go back and get them yourself? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Why does that happen so often? 
 
A: Because I play so early In the morning, and most of the times, 
not only in L.A. but even when I've been out of L.A., and I want 
my clubs because I'm gonna play the next morning, and they 
evidently came in on the next flight, and I don't want to wait 
because I want to play first thing the next morning. So I get up 
early or later on that night, would go get them because normally 
when they deliver, it's sometime the next day. 
 
Q: And you don't send a messenger? 
 
A: That has happened before, too, yes. I haven't sent a messenger, 
but they have delivered also. 
 
Q: Or you might have someone go pick them up for you. Right? 
 
A: No, I've never done that. 
 
 Q: Never asked Cathy? A: Never. 
 
Q: Cathy's son works for you, too, doesn't he? 
 
A: Now, yes. 
 
Q: What's his name? 
 
A: Gary. 
 
Q: Gary Randa? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He was a member of your defense team? Worked as an 
investigator or runner? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is he still? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Does he work for you? 
 
A: He has worked for me, yes. 
 
Q: Currently? 
 
A: I don't believe so. I'm not paying him. anyway. Q: So you went 
down and you got the clubs; didn't look inside. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then drove where? . 
 
A: Maybe driven around a little more, but essentially we went to 
his house. 
 
Q: Where did you drive around? A: Between his house and the air- 
port. Q: Did anybody see you, by the way, when you were at 
Bundy? A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you slow down and-- 
 
A: Yes. Q: --take a look? 
 
A: Yes. We were at the corner. We were actually on Dorothy at the 
corner. 
 
Q: Could you tell if anybody was home at Nicole's condo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anybody there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were pictures taken of you there? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen any video or photographs of you there with 
Kardashian? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you got to the airport, got your clubs, got in the car, did 
you-- how long did it take you before you got back to Kardashian's 
house? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you drive around a little more before you came back home 
to Bob's house? 
 
A: We did not rush straight to his house because I don't think we 
got on the freeway, but we went to his house. 
 
Q: He took a route home other than through the freeway? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: He lives in Encino. Right? Or at that time did? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where in Encino? 
 
A: Encino Hills. 
 
Q: Do you know what route he took back? 
 
A: Maybe Sepulveda. I'm not sure . I'm not sure. I was not looking 
at it. 
 
Q: Did you take the freeway down-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:--to the airport? A: No. 
 
Q: Surface streets? 
 
A: Yes. Well, mostly Barrington. 
 
Q: Straight down? 
 
A: Yes. Most of the way, yes. 
 
Q: When you got to Bob Kardashian's house, what happened to 
your golf clubs? 
 
A: I assume they stayed in the golf club at that time. 
 
Q: Did the bag stay in Bob's trunk? 
 
A: At that time, yes. 
 
Q: When did you take them out? 
 
A: He may have taken them out. I did take a club out at one point 
in time. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: Sometime in the next two or three days. 
 
 Q: At Bob's house? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: To just swing? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What club was it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When is the next time you saw your golf bag or your golf clubs 
after you put them in the trunk? 
 
A: In two or three days, sometime in those two or three days at 
Bob's house. 
 
Q: Do you know if Bob took them out and brought them in the 
house? 
 
A: No, because they were in his garage. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because that's where I got the club out of the bag. 
 
Q: So to your knowledge someone took them out of Bob's trunk 
and put them in his garage. Right? 
 
A: Well, his car was in his garage also. 
 
Q: But the bag was out of the trunk, in the garage? 
 
A: Yes, standing in his garage. 
 
Q: You never went to the golf bag to look into it for any reason? 
 
A: To get a club out, yes. 
 
Q: When you went to get the club out, was the cover bag over the 
golf clubs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you had to unzip the cover bag? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you take the whole golf bag out of the cover bag? 
 
A: No. The cover bag just fell. 
 
Q: Just flipped over. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you pulled out your club? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you look around at all for anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you look at that other blue bag that was in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You swung your club in the garage there? 
 
A: No. I just kinda--it was like a security thing that I had with me. 
 
Q: And then did you put it back in the golf bag? 
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q: And how did the--Did you take the golf bag with you when you 
left Kardashian's house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what happened to it after you last saw it in the 
garage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Bob Kardashian or anyone else looked in 
your golf bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or your cover bag. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have them check it for anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if they did? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if there was any blood anywhere on your golf 
bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On your golf clubs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On the cover bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you check? 
 
A: Me? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were there any knives in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know? 
 
A: Because I didn't put any knives in, unless there were a penknife 
for my key chain. 
 
Q: Did you check? 
 
A: I didn't have to check. I know I never put any knives in there 
other than maybe a penknife on my key chain. 
 
Q: Did you ask anyone to check? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you got to LAX on the morning of the 13th, you said Taft 
and Randa picked you up. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What car was used to pick you up? 
 
A: I believe it was Skip's car. 
 
Q: What kind of car is that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When you got to Skip's car, you put the baggage where? 
 
A: I don't know if he put the Louis Vuitton in the trunk or not or in 
the back seat with Cathy. I just don't remember. 
 
 Q: It was just the three of you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And why did they pick you up? 
 
 A: Because--I don't know. Because Skip was my friend and Cathy 
was my friend, and evidently Arnelle was distraught the last time I 
spoke to her, and they were the closest people to me in LA. at that 
time. A.C., from what I understand, was taking my kids to Lagoon. 
 
Q: When they got to the airport and picked you up, did you look in 
your bags at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-- before they went into the trunk? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where did you go from the airport? 
 
A: To Rockingham. 
 
Q: Straight to Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you have conversation in the car about Nicole's death? 
 
A: I'm sure we did. 
 
Q: Did you ask, you know, how it happened? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: What did they say? 
 
A: No one knew. 
 
Q: Did they know anything? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did they tell you anything at all about Nicole's death? 
 
A: I really don't recall. 
 
Q: Did they ask you whether you did it? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: There was no discussion about that? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did Cathy Randa ever ask you that question? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't recall. 
 
A. No. 
 
Q: Did Cathy Randa ever ask you if you were responsible for 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Wouldn't that be something you would recall, Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Can you search your memory and tell 
me if she ever asked you that question? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Is that the best you can do? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss with Cathy whether you were responsible 
for Nicole's death? 
 
A: I'm sure after I was arrested I was telling everybody, "Why are 
they doing this to me," yes. 
 
Q: Before you were arrested? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What about Skip Taft? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, that's 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you ever tell him--Let me ask you 
this: Did he ever ask you if you were responsible for Nicole's 
death? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Not every conversation he has with Skip Taft 
is privileged. 
 
MR. BAKER: You are going to have to prove it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Okay. Let me ask you a question: Did 
you have conversations with Skip Taft as a friend, a loyal friend of 
yours for many, many years, when he picked you up at the airport, 
or were you involved in attorney-client communications on that 
ride home? 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, so sinister, "attorney-client relations on ride 
home." Don't answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have to have a foundation here, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: You are not going to get any answers out of him 
about what he talked to Skip Taft about. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is there something about Skip Taft that he is 
immune from the subject of testimony? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I thought so in the criminal trial because he 
was an attorney, and he has a law-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me lay a little foundation on this. Okay, 
Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: Lay it quickly because I'm getting hungry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: When you got in that car and drove home with Randa and Taft, 
were you involved in attorney-client communications- 
 
MR. BAKER: Well. that calls-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: --with Skip Taft? 
 
MR. BAKER: That calls for a conclusion on the part of this 
witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's the only way I can do it, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: No, I don't think you can do it at all, so- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: How am I supposed to find out if it's 
privileged or if it's not privileged? They could have been talking 
about anything, even golf clubs. 
 
MR. BAKER: You can certainly ask him if he was talking about 
the Super bowl or the NBA finals. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, you know whether or not you were talking with 
Taft about legal matters, about lawyer-client matters, whether you 
were consulting him for advice or not, legal advice. You know. Is 
that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that. I mean, that's--any time he 
talks to Mr. Taft about anything that has any legal Implications, it's 
attorney-client privilege. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He didn't say it had any legal implications. 
These were his trusted friends picking him up in time of great need 
and support. 
 
MR. BAKER: I understand that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Is that right, Mr. Simpson? Can you 
answer that? Is that right? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: So tell us what you discussed. 
 
A: I don't know if we discussed anything. I think what they were 
trying to do is be there to comfort me. 
 
A: And did they ask you if you killed Nicole? 
 
A: I don't think they asked me any questions about killing Nicole, 
no. 
 
Q: Did they question you at all about 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell them one way or the other that you did or didn't? 
 
A: I don't even think that was a subject matter, if I killed anyone at 
that time, so I don't believe that was a subject matter in anybody's 
mind a the time. 
 
Q: So the subject of your responsibility or not for Nicole's death 
never came up with Taft and Randa. Is that right? 
 
A: They were there to comfort me in that ride, yes. That's what 
they were there for. 
 
Q: And you had spoken to them quite a bit before you got in that 
car. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On the plane. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Lots of phone calls. Right? 
 
A: I don't know what a lot of phone calls is-  
 
Q: Numerous. 
 
A:--or how many I got through on. 
 
 Q: Numerous phone calls. Right? 
 
A: I know I tried to get through to them and to people during that 
period of time, yes. 
 
 Q: And also from the hotel. Right? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: And during all those phone calls with Taft and Randa from the 
moment you found out about-- the officers called you and told you 
about Nicole's death, did they ask you whether you had done it? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you tell them? 
 
A: I never thought that that was a subject that anybody would ever 
discuss among us, no. It never entered my mind that--that never 
entered my mind. 
 
Q: That subject ever come up during any of those conversations? 
 
A: At that time, no. 
 
Q: It came up later. Right? 
 
A: Obviously. 
 
Q: With Randa and Taft. Right? 
 
A: After I was arrested, yes. 
 
Q: But not before. 
 
A: I can't recall. 
 
Q: Not once. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: I'm saying I can't recall. 
 
Q: Now, when you got to--Where did you go, right from the airport 
to Rockingham on the 13th? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Make any phone calls? 
 
 MR. BAKER: This is about the fourth time. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am just trying to get back to--Well, I better 
not continue because we are running out of tape and you're getting 
hungry, so we will take our break here. 
 
MR. KELLY: Which is more important? 
 
MR. BAKER: The tape.

marked as Exhibit 71? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You recognize that as the bath room at the O'Hare Plaza where 
you stayed on June 13 when you went there from L A. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, I just want you to tell us where on the vanity of this sink 
the glass was situated when you apparently hit it with the back of 
your hand. 
 
A: You mean the broken glass? 
 
Q: The glass that you said you broke. 
 
A: When it was broken. 
 
Q: No. Before it was broken, where was it situated? 
 
A: Okay. I thought--I didn't know I testified that I hit it with the 
back of my hand before it was broke. 
 
Q: How did you break it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What I am trying to get to is where the glass was right before 
you came into contact with it that caused the glass to break. 
 
A: I don't know. But I can tell you, when it was broken, it was right 
here beneath the towel, right in this area it was broken (Indicating). 
 
Q: Take the reporter's exhibit, Mr.- 
 
MR. BAKER: Here you go. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: No, no. Take this one, Mr. Simpson, 
and why don't you mark where, I guess, the broken glass was. 
 
MR. BAKER: Just a red circle in the area. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, in that red circle was the broken glass? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Can you tell us where the glass was when you came into contact 
and broke it? 
 
A: It must have been in this area because when it broke, this is 
where the glass kinda went (Indicating). 
 
Q: The circled area? 
 
A: Yeah, basically, yeah. 
 
Q: And just a few minutes ago you said you didn't backhand it. 
 
A: I don't know how it broke . I really don't. I have no memory of 
how it broke. I just know I was in a frenzy, and it broke. 
 
Q: You do know that you broke it, though. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you on the phone when you broke it? 
 
A: Somebody may have been holding on the phone. I was going 
back and forth to the phone. It was during a period of time when I 
was trying to get a flight, and in that period of time I was not put 
on hold, but people were looking for flight information and stuff, 
and I was just going back and forth from my-from the phone to 
my--so I don't know when in that whole mix it happened, but it 
happened during that period of time. 
 
Q: Nor do you remember how it happened. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You do know, for example, that you didn't like throw it at the 
mirror. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Or throw it anywhere. 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. BREWER: Mr. Baker, would you just describe for the record 
where Mr. Simpson drew a circle? 
 
MR. BAKER: It looks, Mike, to the right of the sink bowl, and it 
looks to the left of what appears to be kind of a wicker basket 
where there is, I assume, the complimentary toiletries that are 
obligatory now in every hotel. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. Can you give me some copies of it? 
Let's mark this as Exhibit 72. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 72 was marked 
 
 for identification by the reporter and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Can you see without the glasses? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I have marked as Exhibit 72 a copy of a phone bill for the day 
of June 13, 1994 at the O'Hare Plaza--Howard Johnson O'Hare 
Plaza Hotel. That's where you stayed. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By looking at these phone records, can you tell me who you 
called that morning in the hotel room? 
 
A: The first number at the top is Cathy Randa's. 
 
Q: Cathy was the first person you called. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you call Cathy before or after you heard from the officer? 
 
A: After. 
 
Q: The very first phone call that you had that morning was with the 
officer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're sure of that now? 
 
A: Yes. I've always been sure of that. 
 
 Q: Has that ever been questioned before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why are you sure of it? 
 
A: Because that was the call that woke me up. 
 
Q: You were sound asleep? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you set your alarm for? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: Did you have a wake-up call? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: How were you planning to get up after a red-eye for 10 30 golf? 
 
A: I never have any problem waking up. 
 
Q: You don't recall if you set the alarm or anything like that? 
 
A: No. Actually, I was wrong. I did have a call before this call, 
before the police officer. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: The operator at the hotel. 
 
Q: What did she call about? 
 
A: See if my room was all right. 
 
Q: When you first got up there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Before you went to sleep? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you got to the room, you unpacked, you went into bed. 
Did you fall asleep pretty soon? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have any Band-Aid or anything on your finger? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you bleed at all in the bed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Drop any blood droplets on the sheets? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're aware there are blood droplets found on those sheets. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're aware they're in the middle of the sheets on the 
bottom sheet and the top sheet. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're not aware of that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're not aware of the fact that they were found generally in 
the middle where your hand might lie at night? 
 
 A: No. 
 
Q: Where are they? 
 
A: Where are my hands? 
 
Q: No. Where was the blood found on the sheets? 
 
A: I don't know. Someone just said there was some blood in the 
bed. 
 
Q: No one ever told you the location of that blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know how the blood got there? 
 
A: I assume in the morning when I was going back and forth and 
when I sat on the bed, you know. 
 
Q: Do you know for a fact that's how it got there? 
 
A: I would assume so, yes. 
 
 Q: When you say "assume so,'' I don't know how you use the word 
"assume." What I want to know is if you remember actually 
dropping the blood on the sheets in the bed in Chicago. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when you left that hotel that morning, did you know there 
was blood on the sheets in that bed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The first time you learned about that was in the court case? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me about the first call you got from--after you woke 
up. 
 
A: The police called. 
 
Q: The first call that occurred that morning was one that you 
received? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who was it? 
 
A: I guess it was the operator from the hotel or the girl at the desk. 
 
Q: That was right when you got in the room. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But after you went to sleep, you got another call. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who was that? 
 
A: A police officer. 
 
Q: And tell me about their call. 
 
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, "tell me about it"? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Tell me what you can recall from that 
call. 
 
A: They asked who I was. He -- I don't know if he prefaced it. He 
said my kids were all right. 
 
"First let me tell you your kids are all right." And I think he said he 
had bad news for me, or words to that effect, and he said "Your 
wife was murdered" -- may have said "killed" -- "last night" or 
"Your wife was killed." He may not have said "last night." But 
'Your wife was murdered" or "Your wife was killed"- "had been 
killed." 
 
And I got up, sat up, and I tried to make sense of it, and I asked 
him what--you know, essentially what did he mean. I didn't get it. 
It was just hard to digest. 
 
And he started telling me that there was nothing he could tell me. 
"We're trying to find out," and he gave me a whole line of they 
didn't know any thing. "We're trying to find out, OJ." And he kept 
assuring me that my kids were okay, my kids were fine. I believe 
he said they were at the police station. And I might have asked him 
why. 
 
Q: Why they were at the police station? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And what did he say? 
 
A: I don't remember at that--what his answer to that was. 
 
And then he asked me about, could I come back to L.A., I believe, 
and essentially it was that. 
 
Q: What was the name of the person who called you? 
 
A: I don't--in court they said it was Phillips, but at the time I 
wouldn't have known which one it was. 
 
Can you remember anything else said by either you or him in that 
conversation? 
 
A: I don't know if he asked me then or was it the next call, that did 
I-- what time I left LA. maybe or was I coming back or when I was 
coming back. I don't remember then. I was kinda--I was not quite 
with it then. 
 
Q: Can you remember anything else that either you said or he said? 
 
A: Not right now, no. 
 
Q: Do you know of any document or anything else that would 
refresh your recollection about that conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did you leave it with the officer? That you were coming 
back, or what? 
 
A: He said something to me about the press didn't know. I think he 
said --and I think I asked if the Browns knew and he said that they 
hadn't been told, or a conversation sorta like that, but they hadn't 
told anybody yet, and I--you know, he may have given me a phone 
number. I think he gave me a phone number or two. And that's all I 
can recall. 
 
Q: Is that it? 
 
A: Yeah, that's what I can recall right now. 
 
Q: What did you do after that call? 
 
A: I started getting dressed. I may have called Cathy immediately 
to get me a flight out, first flight she can get out of Chicago, and I 
just-- I started getting dressed, and I started calling airlines myself, 
too. 
 
Q: You asked Cathy to find you a flight back? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you tell her what you had just been told? 
 
A: No. Not at that time. I may have told her--the next call, I may 
have told her. 
 
Q: Did she know anything about it when you had called her the 
first time? 
 
A: She didn't know there was a murder, no. I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did she know anything had happened to- 
 
A: I think she thought something had happened. I think-- I don't 
recall, but I'm pretty sure she knew something had happened, but I 
don't recall. 
 
Q: You're saying that when you called Cathy Randa, you didn't tell 
her what the officer had just told you? 
 
A: No, I didn't. He told me not to say anything. He said, "The press 
doesn't know. We haven't told anybody," they hadn't told the 
Browns, and I didn't want to tell her immediately, no. 
 
Q: What did Randa say to you to lead you to believe that she 
knew? 
 
A: She asked what was going on, and I think they had just called 
her, someone had just called her, so she was -- you know, at that 
time of the morning, I guess she was concerned, for me to call her 
that early. 
 
Q: Who had just called her? 
 
 A: I don't know at the time. Now I know it was the police, Arnelle 
and the police. 
 
Q: You know now that the police had gotten in touch with Randa 
before you and Randa spoke. Right? 
 
A: Now I do, yes. 
 
Q: And did the police or Arnelle first get in touch with Randa? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know which one? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But when you spoke to Randa in this first conversation, did she 
acknowledge that she heard about Nicole's death? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did she say to you about what she had earlier heard about 
from the police? 
 
A: Nothing. I was in a rush. I just said, "Get me a number, Cathy. I 
can't talk to you. Get me the first flight out of here," and she was 
trying to ask me what was wrong, what was wrong, and I told her I 
couldn't tell her. I was-- I don't know. I may have been crying. 
 
Q: But she knew what was wrong. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And what -- you got off the phone, and then what did you do? 
 
A: I started trying to get dressed, and I started going back and forth 
to the phone. I started myself trying to see if I can get some 
numbers of airlines, I believe. 
 
Q: And did you? 
 
A: At some point I did, yes. 
 
Q: You had already told Randa to get the first flight out for you. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. I said, "See if you can get a flight out for me right away." 
 
Q: But even though you told her that, you decided to do it 
yourself? 
 
A: Yeah, at the same time. I just wanted to get out of Chicago, and 
I'm glad I did because the flight she eventually got me was a lot-- 
was later than the one I ended up getting myself. 
 
Q: You had the numbers of the airlines? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did you get them? 
 
A: Either from the operator--I'm sure from the operator at the hotel 
or I called Information. 
 
Q: Is that the next call you made? 
 
A: I don't know what these other numbers are. 
 
Q: What airline did you go back on? 
 
A: I think American. 
 
Q: So you called a couple of airlines to get flights out. Right? 
 
A: I talked to a lot of people. It may have been some Hertz people I 
talked to. It may have been some airline people I talked to. I don't 
even know if they were travel agents. I was just on the phone, back 
and forth on the phone to-- I would get one person and say it was 
an emergency, and then they would -- maybe one of the airlines 
checked the other airlines. I don't recall. 
 
 Q: When you made the calls to the airlines, did you succeed in 
getting an early flight? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then did you call Cathy back? 
 
A: I don't think I had got the flight by the time I talked to Cathy 
again. 
 
Q: So you see- 
 
A: But I might have. 
 
Q:--the fourth call on Exhibit 72 is 
 
Q: call back to Randa. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And what did you discuss in that call? 
 
A: Probably the flights. 
 
Q: Did you discuss what had happened in that call? 
 
A: I may have told her then, yes. 
 
Q: And did she ask you any questions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she ask you about your activities the night before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you recall anything else you discussed with Randa in that 
conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then what did you do next? 
 
A: I continued to try to get dressed, and I believe I continued to go 
back and forth to the telephone. 
 
Q: Who else did you call? 
 
A: Just trying to get flights basically, trying to find the Hertz guy 
to come and get me. 
 
Q: And you called him. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that the next number? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't recognize any of the other numbers. 
 
Q: The 708 number? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
 Q: Okay. But you did get in touch with him and told him to come, 
and that's when you said you were rude. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, that-- I think I talked to him more than once, so I knew I 
was rude whenever I spoke to him. 
 
Q: Why did you talk to him two times that morning? 
 
A: Because he wasn't there, and I was trying to get him to get there 
and trying to figure out how far he was away, those kind of things. 
 
Q: The first time you called Merrill of 
 
Here, he was not at his house? 
 
A: No, he was there. 
 
Q: Why did you call Merrill of Hertz again? 
 
A: To find out where he was, was he close. 
 
Q: You mean you called him at his house? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When you called him the second time, did you reach him? 
 
A: I can't recall. I think I may have. 
 
Q: Okay. Who else did you call? 
 
A: I called Nicole's house, I believe. 
 
Q: Which number is that on here? 
 
A: xxx-xxxx. 
 
Q: Who answered? 
 
A: I believe I spoke to a police officer. 
 
Q: Who was that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Tell me what was said in that call. 
 
A: That may have been when they-when I was first asked what 
time I had left the night before and was I coming back to L.A.. 
soon. 
 
Q: What did you tell him in answer to the question? 
 
A: "I'm taking the first flight I can get back" and what time I left 
the night before. 
 
Q: Did they ask you any other questions? 
 
A: Not that I recall right now. 
 
Q: Do you remember the name of the officer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask what had happened to Nicole? 
 
A: Everyone that I spoke to, I asked that, and they all kept saying 
they didn't know, they were investigating, and there was nothing 
they could tell me. 
 
Q: Can you remember anything else about that call? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever write any notes down of any of these calls? 
 
A: I may have wrote the number down, yes. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: Whatever piece of paper I had there in front of me. 
 
Q: The police department number? 
 
A: The number that they had given me. I thought they had given 
me a cell number or something. 
 
Q: The first time you talked? 
 
A: Yeah, I believe he gave me a cell number or something. 
 
Q: Have you ever made any notes or memos of these conversations 
that you had? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you don't know of any such notes or memos. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, did you also call the police department in West L.A.? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: One of these numbers is to the West LA. Police Department. 
 
A: That would have been the number that they 1 had given me. 
 
 Q: What was the purpose of that call? 
 
A: To find out more about what was going on. 
 
Q: And did you find anything out? 
 
A: No, 
 
Q: And, now, there is a third call here to Merrill of Hertz. His 
number, I will represent to you, is 708-xxx-xxxx. You see there are 
three entries? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Three 708 numbers like that? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Why did you call him the third time? 
 
A: To find out where he was. 
 
Q: When you called the second time, was he still at his house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And when you called him the third time was he still at his 
house? 
 
A: I don't know if I got through to him, but I don't recall. 
 
Q: Why were you so anxious to get Merrill of Hertz when you 
could have gotten any ride downstairs? 
 
A: Well, I hadn't been downstairs yet and, as it turned out, there 
was no-- any ride downstairs waiting for me. 
 
Q: When you called the airlines to arrange transportation, did you 
call downstairs to the front desk to arrange a cab? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What's your best recollection, Mr. , Simpson? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you make any other phone calls? 
 
A: Well, here's another one to my home (Indicating). 
 
Q: One to your house? 
 
A: Well, this says here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Which one is that? 
 
A: XXX-XXXX. 
 
Q: And who did you speak to there? 
 
A: I believe a police officer, and I may have spoken to Arnelle at 
that time. 
 
Q: Who was the police officer you spoke to at your Rockingham 
house? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What did he say to you? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And Arnelle? 
 
A: She was just upset basically. I was trying to calm her down at 
that point. 
 
Q: What did Arnelle say. if anything, about what had happened to 
her that evening? 
 
A: I don't think she did. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: I don't believe so. I don't recall. Did she have a boyfriend at that 
time? 
 
A: I don't believe so. She may have, but I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did she ask you if you knew anything about Nicole's death? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you make any calls from your cell phone from the hotel? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any- 
 
A: Maybe. Maybe from the lobby or downstairs while I was 
waiting. 
 
Q: When you went downstairs? 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: Now, you said something before that when you cut your finger 
or hand or whatever on the glass in the bathroom, that you were on 
hold? 
 
MR. BAKER: We are not going back through the cutting thing. 
You spent well over an hour- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not going to ask him about the cuts. I 
just want to ask him if he was on hold. 
 
Q: Were you on hold at that time? 
 
A: At some point in time an operator --it may have happened more 
than once--said, "Well, you got a minute? Let me check through 
it." 
 
And I said, "Sure. I'll be right back to the phone if I'm not here," 
and I was trying to pack and everything, yes. 
 
So when I say, "I was on hold," she was taking some time to do 
whatever she was doing, and I was trying to pack at the same time. 
 
Q: Immediately after you cut your hand, did you tell anyone on the 
phone that you had done so? 
 
A: I don't recall. I may have. 
 
Q: Who did you tell? 
 
A: As I just told you, I don't recall. I may have. 
 
Q: Do you think you may have told an operator- 
 
A: I may have. 
 
a:--that you cut your hand? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Did you tell Cathy Randa? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you tell Arnelle? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, when you got downstairs. you said you made some cell 
phone calls. Is that right? 
 
A: I said I may have, yes. 
 
Q: Did you call Cathy Randa back? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: What did you tell her? 
 
A: I don't recall if I called her or not. 
 
Q: Did you call Louis Brown? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Did you reach him. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You called his home? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And there was no answer? 
 
A: There was an answer. 
 
Q: Who answered? 
 
A: Denise Brown. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She started screaming. 
 
Q: Screaming at you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was she saying? 
 
A: I don't know. She was just yelling. 
 
Q: Was she saying, "You killed her"? 
 
A: I didn't hear that. 
 
Q: Was she saying words to the effect that you were responsible 
for Nicole's death? 
 
A: She might have. 
 
Q: What did you say to her 
 
A: She hung up. 
 
Q: Did you get a chance to say anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, was this phone call to Denise 
 
MR. BAKER: Phone call where Denise was. It wasn't to Denise. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q: Was this phone call to the Brown residence in which Denise 
answered the phone the first time that anyone had intimated to you 
that you were responsible for Nicole's death? 
 
A: Obviously, yes. If that's what she did. I mean, she was just 
screaming, and I just--and then the phone went dead. 
 
Q: Did you call her right back? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who did you call after Denise? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What was the sense of what she was screaming about, Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know. She was just -seemed totally out of it, seemed 
hysterical. 
 
Q: You couldn't tell what she was saying? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you try calling her back? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: I was dealing with my own feelings. 
 
Q: What was your purpose in calling Lewis Brown? 
 
A: To talk to him. 
 
Q: Did you ask--Did you call back to talk to him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Had you spoken to your children by this time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you know where they were? 
 
A: I believe they were -- I'm not sure at what time we're talking of. 
At one point I think I was aware that they were on their way to 
Lagoon. 
 
Q: Here, I'll have to mark this. I think it's already an exhibit, but I 
can't find it right now. Here we go, 613. 
 
From your cell phone you called XXX-XXXX. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Whose number is that? 
 
A: Cathy Randa. 
 
Q: And you called Cathy after Denise. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Tell me what you discussed with Cathy. 
 
A: I think the flight that I was trying to make or the flight that I 
made. 
 
Q: You told her that you had caught your flight. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: "Caught your flight"- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: That you were--you arranged your 
flight. Right? 
 
A: Well, I told her I had arranged it --I'm sure in one of these calls 
I told her I had a flight. I just didn't know | if I would make the 
flight and-, because it was pretty tight. 
 
Q: And do you remember anything else you and she spoke about? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you called the 310-XXX-XXXX. Who is that? 
 
A: Skip Taft. 
 
 You spoke to him? 
 
A: Yes. I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Is that the first time you spoke to Taft that day? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What was that conversation about? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Was that for the purpose of discussing 
legal matters? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Then tell me what you discussed. 
 
A: I told him what happened -what I had known had happened. 
 
Q: And what did you say to Mr. Taft? 
 
A: That Nicole had been killed. 
 
Q: Did he know already? 
 
A: I don't recall. I don't think so. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: And what did he say? 
 
A: I don't know. He was upset. 
 
Q: Did you tell him that you were being blamed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell him that Denise had accused you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No discussion about your involvement? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who did you call next? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: XXX-XXXX. Who is that? 
 
A: Skip's office. So maybe I didn't get him at home. 
 
Q: That's his other number? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then we have XXX-XXXX. That's Taft again. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you have XXX-XXXX, and who is that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, all these cell phone calls are made on the way to the 
airport? 
 
A: Possibly. I don't know. I could have been in front of the hotel 
also. 
 
Q: Waiting for the ride. Right? 
 
A: Waiting for a cab or Merrill. 
 
Q: Now, I will represent to you that XXX-XXXX is the phone 
number of Kato Kaelin. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Why did you call Kato Kaelin? 
 
A: To find out what was going on. 
 
Q: What was going on about what? 
 
A: What was going on about the murder of Nicole. 
 
Q: Why would you call Kato Kaelin about Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Because he was living at my house and there was a lot of police 
at my house, and I was trying to talk to anybody who might know 
anything that was going on. 
 
Q: How did you know there were police at your house? 
 
A: Because I had spoken to the police earlier. 
 
Q: Did they tell you why they were at your house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you question, "What are you doing at my house?" 
 
A: No. I was hoping they were taking care of my family. 
 
Q: Is that what they told you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you spoke to the police in all of the conversations before 
the Kaelin conversation, did you ask them what they were doing at 
your house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they tell you that they were searching for evidence or 
anything like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You thought they were there taking care of your children? 
 
A: I assumed so. 
 
 Q: Is that what you thought? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you called Kato Kaelin to find out if that was true? 
 
A: Just called Kato to find out what was going on. 
 
Q: Now, you believed that there was activity going on at your 
house in which the police were searching for evidence. Right? 
 
A: I didn't know what they were doing. No one said that to me at 
that time. 
 
Q: But you wanted to find out from Kaelin what the police were 
doing at your house. Correct? 
 
A: No. No. No. I just wanted to find 
 
out from Kato or talk to him about what was going on. 
 
Q: What was going on about what? 
 
A: Just everything. 
 
Q: This is a person you barely knew. 
 
A: That's not necessarily true. 
 
Q: Why would you call Kato Kaelin within an hour of finding out 
that your wife has been murdered? 
 
A: Because he was at my home. He had talked about some noises 
the night before. He was at my home. 
 
Q: When he talked about those noises, you were concerned that he 
might know something about the murder? 
 
A: What he might have found. I don't know. 
 
Q: So you made an association between the murder and those--and 
the sounds that Kaelin heard? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Yes. And tell us what assoc---tell us what he said to you about 
that association. 
 
A: Nothing. I never talked to him. I don't think he was there. 
 
Q: Did you ask him, "Kato, those sounds you heard, did you find 
anything?" 
 
MR. BAKER: He wasn't there. He never talked to him. 
 
THE WITNESS: I wasn't there. I never talked to him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You never got a chance to talk to him? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: How did you know he wasn't there? 
 
MR. BAKER: He just said it. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just said it. 
 
MR. BAKER: You've got to listen. David's got it on his screen. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He did say. 
 
Q: Did you talk to him that day? 
 
A: That day. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk to him before you arrived in Los Angeles? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you tried a couple of times. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know if that was the only time I tried or 
not. 
 
Q: You tried at least three or four times to call Kato Kaelin by the 
time you landed in Los Angeles, didn't you? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know if that's true. I might have. 
 
Q: If the phone records indicate it's true, then it's true. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The cell phone records and the Airfone records. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your purpose in calling Kaelin was to find out what he 
knew. Right? 
 
A: No. Just to find out what was going on. 
 
Q: And to talk about your story and his story. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And to talk about what he had seen the night before. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And to talk about what you and he had done the night before. 
Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You deny all those things? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You deny that that was your purpose or intention? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 Q: You had no such thought in mind. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You just wanted to call and see how he was doing. Is that right? 
 
A: Not necessarily. 
 
MR. BAKER: Enough. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: ''Not necessarily" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you want to call him for? 
 
A: As I said, to find out what was going on. 
 
Q: That was the first time you wanted to call him. Why did you 
want to call him two, three, four times? 
 
A: Because I never got him. 
 
Q: But you could ask other people 
 
A: Ask them what? 
 
Q:--what was going on. 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: Why were you so insistent on finding out from Kato Kaelin 
what was going on? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That's argumentative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's not argumentative. 
 
MR. BAKER: Of course, because he was "so insistent"? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's your characterization. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You had a desire to get in touch with 
Kato Kaelin. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you wanted to find out what was going on. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: From Kato Kaelin. Right? 
 
A: From anybody that can tell me. 
 
Q: From Kato Kaelin, too. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who else did you call besides Kato Kaelin? 
 
A: At my home? 
 
MR. BAKER: Other than what he- we've been testifying to for a 
half an hour, 45 minutes? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You called Leroy Taft, Cathy Randa. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they are among your closest friends and advisors. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Kato Kaelin is not. Right? 
 
A: But Kato Kaelin is at my home, and since the police wouldn't 
tell me anything and Arnelle tried to tell me whatever she knew, 
which was nothing, maybe Kato knew something that was going 
on. 
 
Q: Did you try reaching Kaelin at various numbers? 
 
A: That morning, no. I wouldn't know any other number to try. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Taft or Randa about where Kaelin could be 
found? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask Cathy or--Randa, Arnelle or Taft, anyone else. to 
get in touch with Kaelin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or to help you get in touch with Kaelin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or where Kaelin could be found? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or what Kaelin knew? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What made you associate the noises that Kaelin heard with 
Nicole's murder? 
 
A: I didn't really associate anything. I just--when I left my house, 
Kato was concerned about some noises, and the next thing I heard 
about my life in L.A.. is that Nicole was murdered. So the police 
wouldn't tell me anything. Arnelle didn't know anything. Kato was 
at my home. Maybe he knew something. 
 
Q: So you thought the murderer might have gone to your home? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: But that was a possibility? 
 
A: I didn't know. 
 
Q: But that was a thought that entered your mind. 
 
A: Not really, no. 
 
Q: Then what was the--why did you make that association? 
 
A: I didn't really make the association. 
 
MR. BAKER He didn't say- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI Mr. Baker- 
 
MR. BAKER: He said he did not associate those noises. Read it 
back. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI Excuse me, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: I want it read back. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Earlier in the testimony he said he made that 
association, and I am asking him why he did so. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't agree with that. That isn't what he said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you want to now say that you didn't make that association? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't argue with him, because it's on the thing, and 
I wrote it down. He did not associate. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Nicole was killed at Bundy. Right? 
 
A Yes 
 
Q: And the noises were heard at Rockingham. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But because you heard -- because Kaelin told you about noises 
at Rockingham, you wanted to find out from Kaelin what he knew 
about the murder of Nicole at Bundy. Is that right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You deny that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What caused you to even think that there was any connection, 
association or relationship between the thumps you heard at 
Rockingham-Excuse me. Withdrawn. 
 
MR. BAKER: He never heard any thumps. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q: What made you think there was any association, connection or 
relationship between the noises that Kaelin told you he had heard 
at Rockingham with your wife's murder at Bundy? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: You said a few moments ago that you did make such a 
connection in your mind. 
 
A: No, I didn't say that. I said that the last thing that I talked to 
about my home when I left was Kato. He was concerned. And the 
next thing I heard was Nicole was murdered. I had talked to 
Arnelle. She didn't know anything. The police wouldn't tell me 
anything. Kato was there. He was an adult. Arnelle was somewhat 
hysterical. So I just wanted to ask Kato what was going on. 
 
Q: And what was the connection in your mind between what 
concern Kato had expressed to you when you left the property at 
Rockingham and your wife's murder? 
 
A: None. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you read that, page 165, line 13. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me read it on the real-time. Okay? 
 
Question: So you have made an association -- "Question" -- This 
was a few minutes ago, Mr. Simpson. 
 
"Why would you call Kato Kaelin within an hour of finding out 
that your wife has been murdered?" 
 
"Answer Because he was at my home. He had talked about 
something the night before. He was at my home. 
 
"Whether he talked about those noises that you were-- 
 
"Question: Whether he talked about those noises, you were 
concerned that he might"-- I can't read this real-time. It's in 
abbreviations, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: I didn't say a word, sir. Don't look accusatory at me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you read it, Mr. Blasier? 
 
MR. BLASIER: I'm not in real-time. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can we stop for a second? Let's go back to it, 
David. Okay? You can find it for me. 
 
(Record read from Page 1435, Page 9 through Page 1435, Line 20.) 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: We are back on record. 
 
Q: I now had the reporter read to you that you made an association- 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: No. He said he may have. You say he did. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I now have had the reporter read back 
to you your prior testimony where you said that you may have 
made an association between the noises that Kato told you about 
and Nicole 's murder. 
 
Did you hear that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was that association that you may have made? 
 
A: Wasn't an association. It was just --it was noises he had said the 
night before. I knew he vas at the house. Arnelle was upset. The 
police wouldn't tell me anything. That's it. 
 
Q: But you said you may have made such an association. What did 
you mean by that? 
 
A: I meant that that morning-- 
 
MR. BAKER: You've answered that question. Don't answer it 
again 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You wanted to talk to Kaelin to cover 
your tracks. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: You've been thinking about this. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who did you call after Kaelin? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Who is Jonah Wilson? 
 
A: A friend of Arnelle's. 
 
Q: Why did you call him? 
 
A: I believe Arnelle went to his house. 
 
Q: How did you know that? 
 
A: I was told that. 
 
Q: By whom? 
 
A: Arnelle. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: Whenever I talked to her previous to that. 
 
Q: Did you speak to Jonah Wilson that evening? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: On the plane? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you called Jonah Wilson's number, the only person you 
spoke to was Arnelle? 
 
A: I don't know if I spoke to anyone. I just don't recall. 
 
Q: Phone records show 10 minutes' worth of calls to the number of 
Jonah Wilson. 
 
A: What do you mean, "worth of calls "? 
 
Q: Two calls totaling 10 minutes from the Airfone. 
 
A: Well, I must have talked to Arnelle then. 
 
Q: Not Jonah? 
 
A: If Jonah was taking care of her, I may have talked to Jonah a 
little bit, too. 
 
Q: Did Arnelle go with Mr. Cowlings with your children? 
 
A: I don't think so but, as I just told you before, I didn't know. 
 
Q: You think you might have spoken to Mr. Wilson? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Had you met him before? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many occasions? 
 
A: Oh, I've known him since he was a kid. They grew up together. 
 
Q: Is he the son of Carl Wilson? 
 
A: Of the Beach Boys, Brian--one of the Wilson guys, yes. 
 
Q: Yeah. And was he a boyfriend of Arnelle's? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just a friend? 
 
A: Her best friend for 15 years now. Since they were kids. 
 
Q: Did you remember talking to Mr. Jonah Wilson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you make a lot of phone calls from the airplane? 
 
A: I may have tried. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "a lot" is, but- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Like 30? 
 
A: I may have tried. 
 
Q: What was your purpose in making all these phone calls from the 
airplane? 
 
A: Well, my purpose wasn't to make all those calls. It was just 
tough getting through because the plane kept --airplane's phone 
kept cutting out. 
 
Q: The records show numerous calls to Cathy Randa and Leroy 
Taft. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Why were you calling Leroy Taft and Cathy Randa so many 
times? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, show him the phone records and see what "so 
many times" are rather than-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Would you like to see them, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. BAKER: "Lot of calls" and "so many times," that's- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to mark this as the next exhibit in 
order, which is 73. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 73 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You want to take a--you can take a 
moment to look-- 
 
A: You have to show me. I can't read this. 
 
Q: You understand that when you make Airfone calls. they're 
billed to your credit card. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you made all the phone calls on your credit card. Right? 
 
A: I'm sure I did, yes. 
 
Q: And your credit card was [DELETED]. Correct? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: But you don't have any reason to doubt that. do you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, I have here a chart that indicates the order of these phone 
calls. and the first one is to Kato Kaelin on the airplane. The last 
call you had made on your cellular was to Kato Kaelin, and the 
first call on the Airfone was to Kato Kaelin. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: So you were very interested in getting in touch with Mr. Kaelin. 
Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, not really. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Not really? 
 
A: I didn't get through. If you don't get through, you try again. 
 
Q: First call on the airplane to Mr. Kaelin. 
 
MR. BAKER: You can characterize it any way you want. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What was the purpose of the 
numerous calls on here, without having to go through each and 
every one of them, to Randa and Taft? 
 
A: To tell them my flight, but I couldn't get through, so I kept 
trying until I got through. 
 
Q: Once you got through and told them your flight, was there any 
further need to talk to them? 
 
A: I don't know about ''need," but. you know, someone was just 
murdered, as far as I knew, and I was hurting. Maybe they were 
just trying to --I think we might have prayed a little bit. We--I don 
't know. 
 
Q: Who did you pray with? 
 
A: I believe Cathy. I think Skip a little bit. When I said ''pray," we 
got a little religious with one another. Skip's a religious--somewhat 
religious person. But, yes, I think it was just they were trying to do 
what a friend would do in these circumstances. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "somewhat religious"? 
 
A: He goes to church. 
 
Q: Is he a Christian? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're a Christian? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Randa is? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you say you got religious together, what was the 
reason for that? 
 
A: I don't know. Someone was-died in our life. That's what tends to 
happen when that happens. 
 
Q: Was there any praying or religious-- expression of religious 
expression for you? 
 
A: To say strong, yes. I'm sure that was-- I think that's what they 
were trying to do, to soothe me, and in a sense I was trying to 
soothe Cathy, I know that, because she was pretty upset and 
distraught. So we were--we were just trying to, you know, soothe 
each other, I guess, you know. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion in any of these phone calls with 
Randa or Taft about your involvement? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not once? 
 
A: Not once. 
 
Q: Not a single question to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About whether you knew anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About whether you knew who might have killed Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About what your whereabouts were? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Whether you had an alibi? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They didn't ask you any of these things? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never came up once? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion in any of these conversations with 
Taft and Randa about what the cops knew? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What information that they were uncovering? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, after you had called Randa and Taft and Kato Kaelin all 
these times, had you spoken to your children? 
 
MR. BAKER: Let's- 
 
 THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. BAKER:--not put the pejorative "all these times" on it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to go through them all, but 
there's numerous calls to them. 
 
MR. BAKER: The times indicated on Exhibit 73" is fine with me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You had not yet spoken to your children. Correct? 
 
A: I think they were en route to Lagoon at that time. 
 
Q: During the entire time you were on the airplane? 
 
A: I don't know about the entire time, but during the course of that 
time I did speak to one of my daughters: Arnelle. 
 
Q: But not to Justin or Sydney. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Weren't you concerned that your children had just lost their 
mother? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Didn't you want to speak to them above anything else? 
 
A: Once I got myself together, I certainly did, yes. 
 
 Q: Didn't you put their welfare above yours? 
 
A: They were in good hands. A.C is the best. 
 
Q: But he's not their father, is he? 
 
A: No. And I couldn't have them in my arms because I was on an 
airplane, and I did not want to talk to them on a crowded airplane, 
and I wanted to get myself together before I spoke to them, yes. 
 
Q: So you made a choice not to speak to them until you were in 
person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you stick to that choice? 
 
A: I don't know. I may have spoke to them that night once I was at 
my home. 
 
Q: On the telephone? 
 
A: I may have, yes. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: . When did you first speak to Nicole's parents? 
 
A: Sometime that day, maybe even on the airplane. but sometime 
that day. 
 
Q: And did you ever speak to Denise again? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who did you speak to? 
 
A: I believe Judy. 
 
Q: And tell me about your conversation with Judy. 
 
A: It was just a matter of us, you know, trying to, you know, trying 
to comfort one another. 
 
Q: Did Judy ask you any questions about your whereabouts? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was she accusatory at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she ask you if you knew anything about how Nicole had 
died? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or who would kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did you first find out that Nicole had been murdered? 
 
A: The morning of the police call. 
 
 Q: They told you that it was a murder? 
 
A: Yeah. I believe his words were "murdered," but he may have 
said, "Nicole was killed," but I thought he said "murdered." 
 
Q: In thinking back, he may have said, "Nicole was killed." Is that 
what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah. But I'm almost positive he said "murdered," but "killed," 
could have used that word, too. 
 
Q: If he did use that word "killed" rather than "murdered, " why 
did you believe she was murdered? 
 
A: He said "killed" or "murdered," and when I asked him what did 
he mean. his litany was, "We don't know. We're trying to find out." 
 
 I'm sure if it was anything other than "murdered," he would have 
told me. It was a car accident--if it was a car accident. But he was 
very insistent on telling me that they were investigating, they didn't 
know, that they were trying to find out, OJ. 
 
Q: So as far as you know, she could have been run over by a car. 
Right? 
 
A: I didn't feel that, no. 
 
Q: You didn't feel that way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But he didn't tell you how she had been killed. Correct? 
 
A: No. That's correct. 
 
Q: There are several calls to the Simpson Enterprises cellular 
phone. What were those calls for, and to whom were they made? 
 
A: I'm sorry. I don't know what a-what do you mean, "Simpson 
Enterprises cellular phone"? 
 
Q: You made several phone calls from the airplane to a number in 
the name of Simpson Enterprises--to a cell phone in the name of 
Simpson Enterprises. 
 
A: Uh-huh.  
 
Q: That's Cathy's cell phone? 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: And you called a number in the San Fernando Valley, 818-
XXX-XXXX. Whose number is that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Five-minute phone call? I withdraw that. That call was made 
from your cellular phone to a San Fernando phone number, the 
213-XXX-XXXX cellular phone. Would that have been Cathy's 
call? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know whose number that is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell Cathy or Leroy to call anybody for you? 
 
A: No . Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: I told Leroy at one point to call maybe Howard Weitzman. 
 
Q: And why did you ask him to do that? 
 
A: Because a lawyer sitting next to me on the phone suggested that 
I should. 
 
Q: A lawyer sitting next to you on the phone? 
 
A: Yeah, while I was on the phone on the plane. 
 
Q: Oh, while you were on the airplane. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What was that lawyer's name? 
 
A: I don't know. He was in court, though 
 
Q: And how did that lawyer know that you might need a lawyer? 
 
A: He--the plane was sold out. The seats were tight. As I was 
talking on the phone, I guess he got the gist of what was going on, 
and I was crying some, and he was somewhat comforting, and we 
talked a little bit about it, and he made this suggestion to me. 
 
Q: Well, Mr. Simpson, what did you say to him that could have led 
him to suggest to you that you needed a lawyer? 
 
 MR. BAKER: That's calling for speculation on the part of this 
witness. 
 
1 BY MR. PETROCELLI Q: WHAT did you say to him? 
 
MR. BAKER: If he said anything. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: This man said, "You should call a 
lawyer." Right? 
 
A: No . He said, "It may be a good idea if you have a lawyer." 
 
Q: Did you have a lawyer? 
 
A: A criminal lawyer, no. 
 
Q: What discussion that you and this man had led to a suggestion 
about a criminal lawyer? 
 
A: It was just talking. He heard me talking to Skip Taft about what 
was going on and that I--Skip was asking me, I'm sure- 
 
Can I talk about what Skip and I talked about? 
 
 MR. BAKER: If you weren't talking about the legal stuff, you can. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. Just about him picking me up, and he wanted 
to know where I wanted to go, and I said, "I need to go to my 
house because the police said that they'll be there and for me to"--
"they need to talk to me right when I land," and evidently he heard 
it. You'd have to ask the guy at this point. Evidently he heard that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Whose idea was Howard Weitzman? 
 
A: Skip or I. I guess. One of us. 
 
Q: Now, did you and this other man next to you, whose name I 
don't have in mind right now, discuss that you might be a target? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or a suspect? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But yet he recommended that you might need a criminal 
lawyer? 
 
A: He didn't say "criminal lawyer" -- well, he may have. He said, 
"If you're gonna talk to the police. is your lawyer"--I said, "My 
lawyer's a business lawyer." 
 
He said, "You might want to think about having another lawyer 
there," and that's when I called Skip and said what this guy had just 
said to me. 
 
Q: Did you speak to Weitzman from the phone from the airplane? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: When was the first time you made contact with Weitzman? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was it when you were on the ground in Los Angeles? 
 
A: May have been when I was at my house 
 
Q: Can you remember anything else you and this passenger 
discussed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you also have a phone call to Marcus Allen. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you reach him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to his wife? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anybody? 
 
A: I can't recall if someone was staying at his house at that time or 
not. 
 
Q: The phone records show a minute and 20 seconds to that 
number. Does that jog your memory at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What was your purpose in calling Marcus Allen? 
 
A: He was a friend. 
 
Q: One of your closest friends? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you called Tawny Kiuen. Who was she? 
 
A: A friend of Cathy's and a former friend of mine--and a friend of 
mine. 
 
Q: Former girlfriend of yours? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And why did you call Tawny? 
 
A: I was trying to get Cathy and I wasn't getting through, and I 
didn't know if Cathy had headed to her house or -- I think Cathy 
may have -- I'm not sure if Cathy had changed her cell phone or 
may have just changed her cell phone, but if Cathy called her, I 
wanted her to know I was looking for her. 
 
Q: That was the sole purpose of calling Tawny, was to get in touch 
with Cathy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is there anything else you can tell us about all of these phone 
calls to Cathy and Skip other than make arrangements to pick you 
up? 
 
A: The problem was getting through. That was the problem. Most 
of those phone calls didn't get through. 
 
Q: 29 of them got through. 
 
A: I disagree with that. 
 
Q: Maybe I misspoke. Let me look. How many do you think got 
through? 
 
A: I don't know. With Skip, maybe two or three. And maybe with 
Cathy. one or two. 
 
Q: The notations on Exhibit 73 say, "48 call attempts. 27 Billable 
calls(Calls completed). Do you believe you had 27 phone 
conversations? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Much fewer than those? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: One call to Leroy Taft is minutes-plus near the end of your 
flight. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that about the lawyer? 
 
A: I don't know. We may have just been commiserating or -- at that 
time. 
 
Q: What did you mean before when you said you wanted to get 
yourself together? 
 
A: I think I was emotionally somewhat shattered at that time, and I 
wanted to be strong for I my kids. 
 
Q: Is that the only thing you had in mind? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that was the purpose of all these phone calls, was to get 
yourself together? 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know the connection- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That's argumentative, contrary to 
what you've just been doing for two hours, hour and a half. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't exaggerate, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: I apologize. An hour and 24 minutes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you got picked up at the airport, you've already told us 
Randa and Taft were there, and you went off. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you sign any autographs on the airplane? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Coming back to Los Angeles? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: And did you sign any autographs going to -- from the hotel to 
the airport and onto the plane in Chicago? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: AND from the part where you departed the plane and got into 
the car in Los Angeles? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, when you got picked up by Taft and Randa. did you 
discuss the subject of Weitzman or some other criminal lawyer? 
 
A: The subject? 
 
Q: YEAH, whether such a person had been arranged. 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: And were you told that Weitzman had been retained? 
 
A: I believe so. I don't know about retained, but he'll be at my 
house when I got there. 
 
Q: Did you go directly to the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you got to the house, you got out of the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: DID you take your luggage? 
 
A: My grip. 
 
Q: What about the bag in the trunk, the Louis Vuitton with the suit 
bag in it? 
 
A: I assumed that Skip or Cathy would grab it. I later found out 
that Cathy would grab it, and they wouldn't let her on the property. 
 
Q: And what did Cathy do with it? 
 
A: She stood there--You re asking me secondhand knowledge now. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: She stood there, and at some point Bob Kardashian came and 
held it for her and tried to get on the property, and the police 
wouldn't let him. 
 
Q: What did Kardashian do with your suitcase? 
 
A: I gather took it and put it in his car. 
 
Q: And did he take it to his home? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know the sequence of this because he doesn't 
have any firsthand knowledge of this. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You might have heard later on- 
 
MR. BAKER: So what? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:--from Bob, and I would like to know, 
based on any information you have, where that suitcase next went 
when Kardashian took it from Randa and put it in his car. 
 
A: He may have taken it to my office, and he may have taken it 
home. I don't know 
 
Q: When is the next time you saw the suitcase. Louis Vuitton 
suitcase? 
 
A: I don't -- I'm not sure. Maybe later that day or maybe the next 
day. I'm just not sure. 
 
Q: Did you ask anyone, "Hey, where's my suitcase?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Later on that day when you were back at your Rockingham 
home-that evening, I guess. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did ask you for your suitcase? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ask to see it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the police ask for it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know if it was at Kardashian's house or at the--at 
your office. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Or if he brought it back to my house that evening. I just don't 
recall. 
 
Q: Do you remember the next time you saw it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you remember unpacking it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Since that suitcase was taken out of Kardashian's car, that Louis 
Vuitton case, did you ever see it again after that? 
 
A: In court. 
 
Q: That was the next time you saw it? 
 
A: That I'm aware of, yes. 
 
Q: And did you ever find out from any source what happened to 
your suitcase after Kardashian took it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who was Louise Perry? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: That name means nothing to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, there are calls from your Rockingham residence later in 
the evening of the 13th to a number--to the phone number of Ron 
Shipp, (805) XXX-XXXX. Did you make those calls? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Shipp make those calls from your house to his house? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: Your calendar shows a luncheon with Mr. Shipp on the date of 
June 3, 1994. 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: You don't believe it shows such a luncheon? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Exhibit A shows an entry for June 3. "Lunch Ron Shipp." 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Do you see that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: And Exhibit 8-A is both Cathy and- 
 
THE WITNESS: This is Cathy's. This is not 12 mine. The ones she 
gives me don't have all her things on it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Let's look at 8-B, because 8-B is the one he gets. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Wait a second. Before--wait a second. Cathy 
wasn't going to Sydney's dance 17l recital at 5:00 p.m. Correct? 
 
A: No. But on her calendar she puts all of her events on also, as 
you can see. 
 
Q: In any event- 
 
MR. BAKER: Let's see 8-B and let's fund out if we have a 
luncheon with Ron Shipp, if you are going to pursue this line of 
inquiry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I want to ask you a question: Did you 
lunch with Ron Shipp- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --on June 3rd? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Cathy? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you ever find out Cathy did? 
 
A: No. It was about that time that I knew she was supposed to have 
a talk with him about showing up at my house. 
 
Q: So you think that's what that date was for? 
 
A: May have been. I don't know. 
 
Q: Making a note there about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What is your note? 
 
A: My note says--I don't even know what it says. One says, "Who 
is Louise Perry?" The other one says, "God bless America." The 
other one says "Justice for all." One says "Skip Taft." 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer anything about your 
notes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Well, Louise Perry is a name you are 
going to follow up on, Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: You are not entitled to ask him about notes he takes 
during 
 
Q: deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: During testimony? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah. He is entitled to take notes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, yeah, but it might- 
 
MR. BAKER: He's entitled to have some confidentiality during the 
deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It might have some relevance to the 
proceedings. 
 
MR. BAKER: It might. Give me the pen. Don't you give him that 
pen, David. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Now, Mr. Simpson, on the plane ride 
to Chicago, did you make any phone calls? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you sleep? 
 
A: I may have dozed, yes. 
 
Q: That was a red-eye. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it was dark. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were sitting in First Class? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there somebody right next to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And were you on the aisle or near the window?  
 
A: I probably sat in both seats. 
 
Q: Did you -- How long did you sleep? 
 
A: I told you I may have dozed. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Did you read? 
 
A: Some, yes. 
 
Q: How long do you think you dozed? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you sleep on airplanes? 
 
A: Sometimes. 
 
Q: Do you sleep on red-eyes? 
 
A: Sometimes. 
 
Q: Did you sleep more or less the same that you usually sleep on 
this particular flight? 
 
A: No, 
 
Q: You slept less? 
 
A: Normally my red-eyes are to New York. This was a much 
shorter flight. 
 
Q: So you slept less? 
 
A: If I dozed, yes. 
 
Q: You slept less because it was a shorter flight. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were you agitated at all? 
 
A: No . 
 
Q: Upset about anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you Betting up to go to the bathroom? 
 
A: I did, yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: More than one? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you get up to go to the bathroom 
at all? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: More than once? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A: A few times. 
 
Q: Three or four? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Five or six? 
 
A: I doubt that, but possibly. 
 
Q: Possibly l0? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Under 10? 
 
A: Yes, I'm sure under l0. 
 
Q: Somewhere between 5 and 10? 
 
A: No, I'm not saying that. I said may have been three or four. May 
have been five. 
 
Q: How long was the flight? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you drink a lot of water? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: About how many glasses of water? 
 
A: A lot. 
 
Q: Five or six? 
 
A: At least. 
 
Q: Maybe 10? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: You usually drink that much water? 
 
A: I have to, with my medication and on airplanes, yes. 
 
Q: What medication were you taking that night? 
 
A: Well, I was taking a whole lot of Motrin and stuff, and when I 
fly-when I'm on my 1 medication, I take a lot of water. You have 
to. The Sulfasalazine, I don't think I was on it at that time, but 
when I fly and I--and I give this as advice often, you have to drink 
a lot of water if you're gonna fight jet lag, and I knew I--I was still 
fighting jet lag from the previous week, so I was drinking a lot of 
water, yes. 
 
Q: And did you talk to any of the passengers on that flight? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Howard Bingham and briefly to Craig Baumgartner's partner, 
whose name I can't think of right now. 
 
Q: Business partner? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He happened to be on the flight? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were they both in First Class? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They both were in Coach? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where were they? 
 
A: Bingham was in Coach. He was in First Class. 
 
Q: And they both came up to talk to you? 
 
A: Well, he was in First Class, so he didn't l have to come up to 
talk to me, but Bingham did. 
 
Q: What I meant was, was he seated right next to you where he 
could talk without getting out of his seat? 
 
A: It was a small First Class, and we spoke when we first got on 
the plane. 
 
Q: Did you get out of your seat at all to go speak to anybody? 
 
A: Once the plane was in flight? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: What about before it was in flight? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Bingham and this other guy. 
 
Q: And you went to each of their seats? 
 
A: No. I just stood up in the aisle and talked. 
 
Q: Just chitchat? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk to any of the flight attendants? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Do you remember their names? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to the pilot? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: At some point during the flight. 
 
Q: He came back to talk to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you and he talk about? 
 
A: I don't recall. Football maybe. 
 
Q: How long? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you give any autographs on the airplane? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: To whom? 
 
A: To the pilot for sure and maybe to one or two other people. I'm 
not sure. 
 
Q: That came up to you in the cabin? 
 
A: Yes. Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: Were you sweaty? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Have others said you were sweaty? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were you agitated? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where you edgy or jumpy from the medication? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When had you started taking that medication that makes you 
drink a lot of water? 
 
A: Originally? As I told you- 
 
Q: That day. 
 
A: --I don't think I was taking it that day. I think I said that on the 
record here. I don't think I was taking it during that period of time, 
but I've been taking it for two or three years previous to this. 
 
Q: But--So you were drinking a lot of water because you were 
flying. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: And I drink a lot of water anyway, but because I was flying, I 
drink even more. 
 
Q: Is that one of the reasons you went to the bathroom several 
times? 
 
A: I would imagine so. 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not a doctor, but I think that's- 
 
By MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Fair assumption? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: We've been going an hour and a half. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Should we take a break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:41. (Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:20. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 74 was marked for 
identification by the reporter and is attached hereto.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, as you know, I served an 
Amended Notice of Deposition, which I've u1 attached as Exhibit 
74, and no documents--there is--let me see how many there are 
here. Exhibit 74 contains 37 categories of documents, and none has 
been produced thus far. Are you producing anything? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. I think you've gotten our objections. I'm willing 
to sit down with you on Wednesday and go over all of these to 
tighten them up and to produce with you what we have. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And at the resumption of Mr. Simpson's 
deposition, then, they will be made available before then? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah. Whatever documents that you and I agree on. 
If we don't agree, we will go in and get judicial review of it, and 
they will be made before the next depo--they will be made 
available to you before the next depo. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. That's Exhibit 74. 
 
MR. BAKER: And they are really not all documents. I mean, what 
ever they are. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Some of the items are things- 
 
MR. BAKER: Right, and I'm not arguing about that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We are not going to get into that now. 
 
Mr. Simpson. in April you went down to shoot a movie called 
FROGMAN. 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you played a character called Bullfrog. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: A Navy SEAL character. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You received some training to perform your part in that movie. 
Right? 
 
A: Incorrect. 
 
Q: No training at all? 
 
A: None. 
 
Q: Was there a person who worked with you to show you some of 
the moves? 
 
A: I don't know what you mean by "the moves." 
 
Q: Some of the physical actions that you would have to take as the 
character Bullfrog. 
 
A: On the set there was a stunt coordinator, yes. 
 
Q: And that stunt coordinator gave you some training on how to 
perform some of the actions that you had to take in the role as 
Bullfrog. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did that stunt coordinator have to do with you? 
 
A: He would show us, if a punch had to be shown from the camera, 
where to punch so that it would look like a hit in the camera, stuff 
like that. 
 
Q: There were scenes in that movie when you would wield a knife. 
Correct? 
 
A: No. There was one scene. 
 
Q: Where you wielded a serrated dive knife. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did anybody show you in connection with that particular scene 
how to perform the physical actions? 
 
A: How they wanted it to be done, yes. 
 
Q: And who did so? 
 
A: The director. 
 
Q: Did anyone else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you receive any advice or training, whether on the set, off 
the set, from anybody in connection with your movements and 
actions in the role of Bullfrog? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you heard anyone say in court that you did so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to a former military person or current 
military person about some of these actions, knives, knife scenes or 
anything like that, how to hold a knife, wield a knife? 
 
A: No.

A: None. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I would like to mark as the next exhibit in 
order, Exhibit 75, excerpts from the script of FROGMAN. 
 
Q: That was the name of the project? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 75 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: These were obtained again from the 
LAPD SID inspection that we had a while ago. Did the movie ever 
get released, by the way? 
 
A: No, I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Do you know why not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have a working copy of the film? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see the dailies on this? 
 
A: Some days, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever see any rough cut of the movie? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, I would like to refer you to pages 16 and 17, where it 
describes a scene where you enter the interior of a dive shop at 
night. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're Bullfrog. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Near the bottom of the first page it says, "Bullfrog has entered 
the dive shop" --quote, "Without a sound. Bullfrog has entered the 
dive shop." 
 
A: Where? Where is this at? Is it the last page or second to the last 
page. 
 
Q: Second to the last page. "Without a sound, Bullfrog has entered 
the dive show shop. Doesn't turn on the lights. Doesn't have to." 
Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Next line: "Bullfrog comes up with a lethal, serrated dive knife.' 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then, "Bullfrog cases the area. All clear." 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: "Looking toward the back of the shop. Through the maze of 
counters and gear, he sees a shadow." 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: "Bullfrog's SEAL," capital letters S-E-A-L, "career. Bullfrog 
steals past. Silent. bullfrog's made a circle. He's behind the shadow. 
He lunges and, in one swift move, has the intruder on the floor, one 
arm twisted back in a punishing hold." Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That character was a woman that you apprehended. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. That this is talking about, yes. 
 
Q: Correct. In this script?. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the knife that you were holding, was that a real knife? 
 
A: They may have given me a rubber knife when I grabbed her 
 
 Q: But before they may have given you a rubber knife. you had a 
real knife? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In what hand were you holding that knife during the particular 
scene that I described? 
 
A: I believe the left hand. 
 
 Q: Left hand? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Are you positive about that? 
 
A: Yes. I believe. I'm not totally positive, but the camera on this 
side (Indicating)- 
 
Q: Motioning to your left now. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. I believe the camera was on this side, so I think that's 
how we shot it. 
 
Q: And it was dark during this scene. Right? 
 
A: Well, yeah, the camera shot it dark, but you have to light it 
where it's not dark. Otherwise you wouldn't see it. 
 
Q: But it's supposed to depict the nighttime scene. Right? 
 
A: The key word is "supposed to depict." Yes? 
 
Q: It's a night scene. Right? 
 
A: We're indoors, but it's supposed to be a night scene, yes. 
 
Q: What were you wearing, Mr. Simpson, during this scene in 
FROGMAN? 
 
A: Whatever wardrobe they gave me. 
 
Q: What was it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Dark outfit. Right? 
 
A: I'm not sure of that. 
 
Q: Gloves on. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No gloves? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did you have anything on your head? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q: And what kind of dark outfit did you have on? 
 
A: I told you I don't believe that--I don't know if it was a dark 
outfit or not. 
 
Q: Can't remember the color? 
 
A: I thought it was a light-blue sweater, but I could be wrong there, 
but, you know, I was-- this guy just finished eating dinner 
somewhere, so I don't recall it being a dark outfit at all, no. 
 
Q: Who taught you how to hold the knife in the manner that you 
did? 
 
A: I don't know if anybody taught me. I think the director wanted 
me to hold it up. 
 
Q: And who taught you how to make the move by which you 
apprehended the shadowy figure? 
 
A: The director said, "Come up and grab her and pull her this 
way." 
 
Q: And is that what you did? 
 
A: Yes. Not the way it's written here, but that's what I did. 
 
Q: Did you ever see the footage of this scene? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who was the director? 
 
A: This is embarrassing. Michael... You know, I apologize. I can't 
think of his name. 
 
Q: Do you know whether this script was based on generous part on 
a book? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Tom Clancy book? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever read the book WITHOUT REMORSE? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: If--In portraying the character of Bullfrog and in performing 
this particular scene- 
 
A: First, let's clear one thing up: Just 'cause it read this way, it 
doesn't mean this is the way the scene was shot, and it wasn't shot 
the way it reads. 
 
MR. BAKER: He didn't ask you about that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: How was it shot? 
 
A: In pieces. 
 
MR. BAKER: This is OJ. being OJ. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: It was shot in pieces." What does that 
mean? 
 
A: That means it wasn't shot like this. All these arms behind the 
back and that stuff never happened. 
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: I just grabbed her and pulled her out of what they call the 
camera. Grabbed her from behind and pulled her out of the camera 
scene. 
 
Q: What part never happened? 
 
A: All this pulled down on the ground and pulling the hands 
behind the back. 
 
Q: Well, did someone else perform those movements? 
 
A: No. It just wasn't shot that way. The director had took his 
license and shot it his way. 
 
Q: He changed the movements when he decided to shoot the 
scene? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you still came up--You still entered the dive shop at night. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you didn't turn on the lights. Right? 
 
A: k wasn't a dive shop, so there was no lights to turn on. It was- 
 
Q: It was supposed to be a dark scene. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Come on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And you still held a lethal serrated 
dive knife. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. How long was that knife? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: More than 6 inches? 
 
MR. BAKER: You talking about the entire knife or the blade? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The blade. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: About 6 inches? 
 
A: Could have been, but I don't know. 
 
Q: What did you do with that knife? 
 
A: It was theirs. It was the people that, you know, doing the movie. 
 
Q: Did you keep it as a souvenir? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about the clothing? Did you keep any of the clothing as a 
souvenir? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever met a Navy SEAL? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Within a year before June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Say that again. 
 
Q: Within one year before June 12, 1994, did you ever- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --have any contact with a Navy SEAL? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: One guy was a guy who worked on the set, and one guy's wife 
worked at the hotel in Cabo that I was at. 
 
Q: And the guy that worked on the set who was a Navy SEAL, 
what was his job? 
 
A: I guess he was-- I believe he co-wrote the script, and he was 
there as a technical adviser. 
 
Q: And what is the name of that person? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't recall. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: When is the last time you spoke to that Navy SEAL? 
 
A: Sometime I believe during the movie. I don't think I talked to 
him since then. I may have, but I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any discussions with the Navy SEAL about 
the script- 
 
A: I'm sure I did, yes. 
 
Q:--as the movie was being shot? 
 
A: I'm sure I did. 
 
Q: Including the scene we just mentioned? 
 
A: I don't think we ever specifically talked about that scene, no. 
 
Q: But he was there at the time. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that script writer who was a Navy SEAL was there at the 
time you shot the scene that I just described. Right? 
 
A: I believe so . I don't recall, but I believe he was. 
 
Q: Thank you. The purpose of working--Excuse me. 
 
MR. BAKER: Dan, he wants to stop at 4:30, too, John does, and I 
have no objection. 
 
MR. KELLY: I've got to make some decisions here, so if we can 
just go to 4:30, I'd appreciate it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's more than acceptable, Mr. Kelly. 
 
MR. KELLY: What are you being so nice about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's Friday. I'm not going to be in a deposition 
tomorrow. 
 
Q: Was the purpose of having--of working with the Navy SEAL so 
that the actions that you would be performing would look more 
authentic? 
 
A: I don't know. I didn't make that decision. 
 
Q: Is that your understanding? 
 
A: I don't know. You have to ask the people who made the movie. 
 
Q: But you were attempting to portray the scene in an authentic 
manner. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. I don't know what "authentic" is, but in relation to this, I 
was doing what the director told me to do. 
 
Q: Well, an actor is supposed to try to convince the viewers that 
he's doing the real thing. Right? 
 
A: I was doing what the director told me action-wise. 
 
Q: Were you trying to act to the best of your ability? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. It would have been simpler if you just answered. 
 
Okay. Let me depart FROGMAN and 
 
go to another subject, if that's all right with you, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. 8AKER: It is getting slaphappy here. Now you ask my 
permission. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to mark as the next exhibit in 
order Exhibit 76 and Exhibit 77. Exhibit 76 is trial Exhibit 596, 
and Exhibit 77 is Trial Exhibit No. 126. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 76 and 77 were marked for identification by 
the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: While we are waiting for the original 
12 pictures, let me ask you a question about the Chicago hotel. Did 
you take with you any plastic bags or laundry bags 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you use any of them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any of them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any explanation why bags were missing from that 
hotel room? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. You don't have to have 
explanations. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Dry-cleaning bags? Does that make a 
difference? Did you use any dry-cleaning bags? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Exhibit 76 and 77 are pictures. Can you identify what is 
depicted in those photographs? 
 
A: A portion of my bedroom. 
 
Q: And what about the other picture? 
 
A: Some socks on a rug. 
 
Q: Are those your socks? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have socks like that? 
 
A: I have black socks, yes. 
 
Q: That look like those socks? 
 
A: I don't know. I can't really see what these socks look like. 
 
Q: Well, you saw a lot of these socks in court. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you were in court, there was a lot of testimony about 
these socks. Right? 
 
A: Testimony, yes. 
 
Q: And video footage as well. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are those your socks? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: On June 12, 1994 did you have socks like those?  
 
A: I had black socks. but I can't tell how these socks are because 
they're balled up. 
 
Q: What kind of socks? Do you have -- a brand name that you- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you buy your own socks? Did you at the time, June of 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What brand socks did you buy? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you have any particular brands that you bought? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would you be aware of the brand names of the socks that you 
owned in June of 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you leave those socks on the floor when you left the room 
on June 12?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How do you know? 
 
A: Because I never leave my socks on the floor in my bedroom. 
 
Q: Are you neat by habit? 
 
A: By habit, yes. 
 
Q: If you're in a hurry though, you might leave your socks on the 
floor. Right? 
 
A: Not in my bedroom. no 
 
Q: You didn't hang everything thing up in your bathroom. 
 
A: That's a little different. 
 
Q: And the towels. 
 
A: That's a little different 
 
Q: How is that different? 
 
A: It's a bathroom. 
 
Q: You never have left anything on your bedroom floor when you 
left the room? 
 
A: Anything? Anything. 
 
Q: Clothing? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: A belt? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Socks? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never. 
 
A: Never. That I know of. 
 
Q: Did you wear black socks on June 12, 1994. 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Excuse me. You believe so. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You wore them to the recital. Right? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did you wear any other black socks that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: One pair. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do those look like the pair? 
 
A: I can't see what these look like. 
 
Q: Could they be the pair? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I didn't leave black socks here. 
 
Q: Apart from the fact that they're on the floor there, do they 
generally look like the black socks that you wore? 
 
A: I can't tell because I can't see what these look like. 
 
Q: Have you ever found the pair of black socks that you wore on 
June 12? 
 
MR. BAKER: That assumes they're missing. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. Q: Where are the pair of black 
socks that you wore on June 12? 
 
A: I assume in my home. 
 
Q: Have you looked for them?

Q: Do you know if they were the exact pair that you took off that 
evening?

socks that you had taken off the night before? 
 
A: I didn't look for them, no. 
 
Q: When you took the black socks off the night before or the day 
before or whenever you did, where did you put them? 
 
A: Either in my shoes or back in the sock drawer. 
 
Q: In what shoes? 
 
Q: The shoes I was wearing. 
 
Q: Because you might wear the socks again? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you came back to your house on the 13th, did you look in 
those shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were the shoes there? 
 
A: I assume so. 
 
Q: Were the socks in the shoes? 
 
A: If that's where I left them, I would assume so. 
 
Q: But you don't know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You took off your socks when you took off the clothes you 
wore to the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's when you put on the golf clothing. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said you hung up the other clothing, the pants and the 
shirt. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: But you don't have a clear recollection whether you put the 
socks in the hamper or in the shoes. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: He never said the "hamper." 
 
THE WITNESS: The shoes or in my drawer. BY MR. 
PETROCELLI: Q: The drawer. I'm sorry. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why didn't you put them in the hamper? 
 
A: Because I didn't feel they were dirty. 
 
Q: How long had you worn those socks? 
 
A: Whatever time it took me to get to the recital and back. 
 
Q: Do you sweat? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you sweat in your feet? 
 
A: I'm sure sometimes. 
 
Q: You had worn the socks for two to three hours. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were going to wear them again without washing them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who does your laundry? 
 
A: My housekeeper. 
 
Q: Did you have a hamper? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where was it located? 
 
A: My bathroom. 
 
Q: Did you put anything into that hamper on June 12th? 
 
A: I'm sure I did. 
 
Q: You took a shower in the morning, right, when you went to go 
to play golf? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Did you put any of your towels in the hamper that day? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Can you to the best of your memory, Mr. Simpson, describe to 
me the socks that you wore to the recital on June 12? 
 
A: They were black. That's all I can recall. 
 
Q: What kind of material were the socks made of? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were they thick socks or thin socks? Stretch socks? Can you 
describe them? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What kind of shoes -- Black loafers. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What kind of socks do you usually wear with those black 
loafers? 
 
A: Not real thick, but others if they're black, black socks. 
 
Q: Black socks, not thick. Correct? 
 
A: I would imagine not thick not in June. 
 
Q: Sheer? 
 
A: Could be. 
 
Q: How high? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Torn? Were there any tears in the socks, any holes in them? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't think, I can't recall seeing any holes  
 
Q: Now, the socks that were introduced at trial, you were there 
when they were introduced. Right? 
 
A: I don't recall ever seeing them introduced at trial. 
 
Q: The actual socks that were taken by the police, you do not 
remember seeing them in court? 
 
A: I never saw them. 
 
Q: Did you examine them? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: You never said, "Let me see if these are mine"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you examine the gloves to see if they were yours? 
 
A: Yeah, I looked at gloves. 
 
Q: Were they yours? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Not sure? 
 
A: I think they're too small to be mine. 
 
Q: But you're not sure. They could be yours. Correct? 
 
A: I didn't think so. 
 
Q: They could be. Correct? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Are you positive? 
 
A: I'm pretty positive. 
 
Q: Pretty, but not a hundred percent. Correct? 
 
A: I'm pretty positive they weren't mine. 
 
Q: But not a hundred percent. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative in view of the last four 
answers. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, it's not. 
 
Q: Not a hundred percent. Correct? Don't tell him what to say, Mr. 
Leonard. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I'm not telling him what to say. He's answered 
the question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, he hasn't, Mr. Leonard, and you know he 
hasn't. 
 
MR. BAKER: Hundred percent positive. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He can answer that, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't tell my client what he can answer, please. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But it's a clear question. 
 
Q: You are not a hundred percent positive. Correct? 
 
A: After I tried them on, I'm a hundred percent positive they 
weren't mine. 
 
Q: Before you tried them on, you were not a hundred percent 
positive. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And because you say they're too tight, that's what made you 
positive. Is that right? 
 
A: They're too small. period. 
 
Q: They didn't fit at all. Is that right? 
 
A: Not close. 
 
Q: Couldn't even get on your hands. Right? 
 
A: Not close. 
 
Q: Did you try them on without, what do you call them, latex 
gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: It wasn't latex. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What was it, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: I can't tell you, but it's not latex. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why can't you tell me? 
 
MR. BAKER: Because I can't remember. I'd be happy to. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What was it? Do you know what those 
gloves were? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The kind of gloves that you might use to lean things or garden 
with or anything like that? 
 
A: Not me. 
 
Q: You ever wear those kind of gloves before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So your answer is clear, without trying on--without putting on 
latex or rubber gloves or plastic gloves beforehand. did you ever 
try those gloves on that were in court? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there any reason why one of the first things you didn't do 
when you saw those gloves was try them on? 
 
A: I'm sorry- 
 
Q: Why didn't you try the gloves on immediately when you first 
saw them to show everybody that they weren't yours? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean when he was a criminal defendant? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: When he first saw them in the courtroom. 
 
MR. BAKER: Because the guards were around him; he can't get 
up; he can't move? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: DID you ask to try them on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. What about the watch cap or the hat? You remember that 
hat. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: DID you examine that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you try it on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it your hat? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: Are you a hundred percent positive? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And why don't you think it's your hat? 
 
A: Because I saw that they took one from my house, and I don't 
ever recall having more than one. 
 
Q: How do you know they took one from your house? 
 
A: I saw it in the discovery. I think you showed it to me today. 
 
Q: The picture I showed you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you believe that you only owned one watch cap like that. Is 
that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. If I owned one, yes. 
 
Q: But you hadn't used any watch caps in a long time. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you're not a hundred percent sure how many watch caps you 
owned as of June 12. Correct? 
 
A: No, that's wrong. I only recall buying one my whole life. 
 
Q: Are you a hundred percent sure that you had one watch cap like 
the one that was in court in your home on June 12? 
 
A: That was mine, yes. That was in my home. 
 
Q: That was anybody's. 
 
A: That was mine, yes. 
 
Q: You keep saying, "That was mine." Did you have anybody 
else's watch cap in your house? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know what Nicole might have put in my 
house. 
 
Q: Did you wear a watch cap on June 12,1994 at any time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, why didn't you look at the socks? 
 
A: I don't know. I just never saw them in the courtroom. 
 
Q: Did you ask to look at them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, where do you shop for socks? Or where did you? 
 
A: Everywhere. 
 
Q: Can you name some stores where you shopped for socks in June 
of 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Excuse me while I'm looking for something. You knew--Did 
you know the schedule of Nicole's housekeeper? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You knew she didn't work Sunday nights, though. Right? 
 
A: I didn't know if she was coming back Sunday nights or not. 
 
Q: She didn't sleep there Sundays. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What do you mean, you didn't know she was coming back? 
 
A: Most house keepers come back Sunday night. 
 
Q: You're saying you didn't know what her schedule was at all? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Do you know why the ski cap found-- excuse me. Do you know 
why the watch cap found at Bundy had hair matching yours? 
 
MR. BLASIER: I believe that's incorrect. That mischaracterizes- 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I know that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you know why the watch cap had 
Bundy hair consistent with yours7 
 
A: Some hairs consistent with mine. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No, Q: Do you have any explanation for that? 
 
A: Maybe because I'm black. 
 
Q: Is that the only explanation you know of? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Just because you're a black person? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. He doesn't have to have any 
explanation for that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't say he had to. I'm only asking him if 
he has any explanation. 
 
MR. BAKER: His explanation in terms of that evidence will come 
from his attorneys, as you are well aware. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It may not. He may have information that 
completely exonerates him. 
 
Q: Do you know why hair consistent with your hair was found on 
Ron Goldman's shirt? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any explanation for that? 
 
A: I'm no expert on similarities of hairs and shirts. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I'm no expert on similarities of hairs or shirts, so- 
 
Q: So the answer is you don't know why that is. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know why that the glove found at Rockingham had hair 
consistent with Ron Goldman's hair? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the glove at Rockingham had hair consistent 
with Nicole's hair? 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. The glove? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you know why the glove at 
Rockingham had hair consistent with Nicole's hair? 
 
MR. BAKER: I am not sure there is any foundation for that 
question, and so I am going to instruct him not to answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You are saying there was no hair 
matching Nicole's hair found on the Rockingham glove? 
 
A: I'm saying I am not aware that that was so, and if it was so, I 
would have no- 
 
Q: Explanation? 
 
A: I would have no knowledge of- I have no knowledge. I'm no 
expert on hair, but... 
 
Q: Do you know why the glove found at Rockingham had fibers 
matching Ron Goldman's shirt? 
 
A: I have no -- no, I don't have knowledge of any of this that you're 
saying. 
 
Q: Do you know why the glove found at Rockingham had fibers 
matching the carpet in your Bronco? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of any of this. 
 
Q: I have a few more to go through. Do you know why the glove at 
Rockingham had blood consistent with a mixture of yours, Ron 
Goldman's and Nicole's? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of this. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood on the panel of the Bronco 
matched your blood? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you know why the blood on the console of the Bronco 
matched your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood on the panel of the Bronco was 
consistent with a mixture of Ron Goldman's and your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood on the console of the Bronco is 
consistent with a mixture of Ron Goldman's and Nicole's blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood in the Bronco matched Nicole's 
blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood found on the Rockingham 
driveway matched your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
 Q: Do you know why the blood in the foyer in your house 
matched your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood on the socks found in your 
bedroom matched your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you know why the blood on the socks in your bedroom 
matched Nicole's blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the blood at Bundy matched your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why the shoes found at Bundy matched Bruno 
Magli shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have no knowledge about any of these things? 
 
A: Other than what I heard in court, no. 
 
Q: Did you have a rug in your foyer? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: What color was the rug? 
 
A: It's a Persian rug. 
 
Q: Was it located on the foyer at a spot where blood was found? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: It was located away from the blood? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Was the rug there when you came home? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Is the rug missing? 
 
A: No. It's there. 
 
Q: Do you have any explanation for how this evidence got where it 
was found? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. He doesn't have to have an 
explanation. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer that? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You understand that I am not suggesting that 
he has to have one. I am just asking if he has one. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, all I can tell you is --I am obviously not going 
to tell you how to ask questions, but I am not going to let him 
answer that question. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Apart from anything you learned 
from your lawyers, do you have an explanation for how any of this 
evidence got where it was? 
 
MR. BAKER: I think you've gone through it all, and he doesn't 
have any knowledge about that, and we don't-- he will not be in our 
expert designation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Before you ever spoke to a lawyer, 
after you left Los Angeles, did you have any knowledge or 
information as to how any of that evidence was found where it 
was? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: If in fact it was found where they say it was found. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have any facts or information 
to suggest how that evidence got where it was found? 
 
A: Other than what I learned in court? 
 
Q: When you say 'learned in court,' you mean what your lawyers 
argued in court? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Other than what you learned in court. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever found out what those noises were that Kato 
Kaelin heard? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask him? 
 
A: Ask him what. 
 
Q: What the noises were. 
 
A: He didn't know. 
 
Q: When did you ask him? 
 
A: When he was looking. He was saying, "I heard noises,' he 
thought it was an earthquake, and I may have asked him the next 
day when I got home . 
 
Q: When you got home, when did you first see Kaelin? 
 
A: That afternoon. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: At my house. 
 
Q: In the main residence? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did he get there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you invite him in? 
 
A: He came in. 
 
Q: Uninvited? 
 
A: I think everybody was invited that day. 
 
Q: That's when you had your family there and a couple of your 
close friends. Right? 
 
A: People were coming and going. 
 
Q: Lots of people? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: More than 20 or 30? 
 
A: I would imagine so, but I'm not sure. 
 
Q: And what did you talk to Kato about? You said you talked 
about the noises. Tell me about that conversation. 
 
MR. BAKER: He said he may have. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe I asked him what was going on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: No one had told me anything. I knew he had--by this time had 
spent time with the police, and maybe he knew something. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He didn't know anything. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what the police asked him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask him what happened during the evening after you 
left? 
 
A: I asked him, did he find anything. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: I believe he said no. I believe he said he didn't look. 
 
Q: After you left, he told you that-- 
 
A: I believe he said he didn't look. 
 
Q: He did not look. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you and he talk about anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was that the end of your conversation with Kaelin on the 13th? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk about the fact that the two of you were together the 
night before for part of the time? 
 
A: I don't believe so, but we might have. 
 
Q: When you say you "might have," do you have a recollection 
that you discussed having gone to McDonald's together? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You did not discuss that? 
 
A: I don't have a recollection of us discussing that. 
 
Q: Did you say to Kato, "You're my alibi. Right?" 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Was he your alibi? 
 
A: I didn't know I needed an alibi. 
 
Q: Did you say that to him? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you discuss anything concerning your alibi with Kato 
Kaelin? 
 
A: I didn't believe I needed an alibi. 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you say to Kato, "You were with 
me. Right, Kato?" 
 
A: I don't think so. He was obviously with me when we went to get 
a burger, but I don't believe that we discussed that. 
 
Q: Did you say to Kaelin, "You saw me go in the house, didn't you, 
or words to that effect? 
 
A: I don't recall saying that, no. 
 
Q: Did you hear him testify to that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is Kaelin -- was Kaolin's testimony truthful? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI Q: What you heard, and you were in a 
position to gauge, was it true? 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not going to testify in this trial whether he's 
truthful or untruthful. He is going to testify what he observed and 
what he witnessed and what he said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What Kaelin said about you, was that 
the truthful? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. We are not--he is not going to be 
interrogated about what he thinks somebody else said is truthful or 
untruthful. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did Kato say anything about you that 
to your knowledge was false? 
 
MR. BAKER: Again, the same objection-- 
 
MR. BREWER: I'm not asking for his assessment of his 
credibility. I am asking for particular information. 
 
MR. BAKER: Anyway, it seems like exactly the same thing to me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it's a little-it's a different question. 
 
Q: Did Kato Kaelin say anything on the stand, Mr. Simpson, that 
you knew to be false? 
 
MR. BAKER: Now, the -- he testified for days on the stand, and 
that is too broad. You can ask him questions, I suppose, about what 
Mr. Kaelin says, and if he believes it's true or false based upon his 
own empirical knowledge, I'll obviously allow that, but I am not 
going to allow you a broad blanket, anything in however many 
days he was on the stand. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer that 
question? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Q: Do you remember anything that 
Kato Kaelin said that right now stands out in your mind as false? 
 
MR. BAKER: If you have any recollection of what he testified to 
in all those days. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't really have a clear recollection of all the 
things that he testified to and anything really specific, so I can't 
speak on anything just really specific, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: On the day of the 13th when Kaelin is 
at your house, did you and he go off into your kitchen? 
 
A: We may have. 
 
Q: And what did you and he discuss in your kitchen? 
 
A: I don't think we walked into the --if we walked into the kitchen, 
it wasn't to discuss anything specific, I don't think. 
 
Q: But when you did get into the kitchen, what did you and he 
discuss? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You have no recollection? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when Kaelin came into your house, were you glued to the 
TV set? 
 
MR. BAKER: When are we talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the 13th, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what that means. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: In other words, were you watching 
television, three televisions? 
 
A: I was sitting with my mom and a bunch of people. The TVs 
were on. I don't know if I was dozing or watching at that time. 
 
Q: And what you were watching was coverage m about your wife's 
murder. Right? 
 
A: We were trying to find information when we were looking at 
TV, yes. 
 
Q: And at some point you asked Kaelin to go into the kitchen for a 
minute. Right? 
 
A: I don't recall that, no. 
 
Q: But the two of you went into the kitchen area. Correct? 
 
A: We may have. 
 
Q: THE two of you were alone. Correct? 
 
A: I don't recall that, no. 
 
Q: And he hopped up on the sink. Correct? 
 
A: I don't recall that, no. 
 
Q: You leaned against the sink. Right? 
 
A: I don't recall that, no. 
 
Q: And then you said to him, "You saw me go in the house," didn't 
you? 
 
A: I don't recall that. 
 
Q: "We went to McDonald's, and then you saw me go into the 
house." Right? 
 
A: I don't recall that. 
 
Q: Do you deny those conversations? 
 
A: I don't believe I had those conversations. I just don't recall 
having them. 
 
Q: Are you positive that those--that that conversation did not 
occur? 
 
A: I don't recall talking to him in the kitchen about that, no. 
 
Q: But you're not sure. 
 
A: I don't recall doing it, no. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: I'm sure I don't recall doing it. 
 
Q: If Kaelin says it happened, you wouldn't have any reason to 
doubt him. Correct? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I don't recall doing it. 
 
Q: The day-- Withdrawn. On June 11 you spent some time 
watching television with Kato, didn't you? 
 
A: I don't know. He may have came in while I was watching TV. 
 
Q: And you were watching THE WORLD ACCORDING TO 
GARP. Right? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: With Robin Williams. Right? 
 
A: I may have.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, why don't you change it. 
 
MR. KELLY: We will stop at- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 4:30. Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: Why don't we stop it? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Stop what? 
 
MR. BAKER: The depo. 
 
MR. KELLY: The depo for the day. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, I was going to ask a couple more 
questions about GARP. 
 
MR. BAKER: Save GARP. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. KELLY: I've got- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll save GARP. 
 
MR. KELLY: I can't- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to leave you in suspense about the 
GARP questions. Okay? 
 
MR. KELLY: That okay, Dan? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, it's okay with me. Half hour doesn't- 
 
MR. BAKER: Michael. I know you don't agree with- 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes the deposition of 
Orenthal James Simpson, Volume V. The number of videotapes 
used was two. We are going off the record, and the time is 
approximately 4:03. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the stenographic record, I would like to 
say that we are not concluded with Mr. Simpson's deposition, and 
the lawyers are going to try to get together to agree on a date for 
the resumption of the deposition. 
 
MR. BAKER: Agreed. And would you join us here at 4:00 o'clock 
on Wednesday next, the 31st? 
 
MR. BREWER: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: You won't. 
 
MR. BREWER: The deposition is day to day. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, as I suggested to you, and let's keep this on 
the record, Mr. Simpson is not going to be here, I'm not going to be 
here, Mr. Leonard's not going to be here, nor is Mr. Blasier going 
to be here, so you can take whatever solace you want in that. I'm 
willing to work out a new date, and I'm willing to do it on the 31st. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just so the record is clear, I am prepared to 
continue and complete my examination on Monday. Tuesday of 
next week I think I would be finished. If everyone can get their 
schedules together, that's acceptable to me. 
 
MR. BREWER: And I've already indicated to Mr. Baker that I 
anticipate no more than a day of examination on my part, and I can 
't speak for Mr. Kelly. 
 
MR. KELLY: You would be ready to go on the 31st? 
 
MR. BREWER: Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: You are not going to be here Monday and Tuesday. 
Is that what you're saying? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's what I just said, and Mr. Petrocelli already 
agreed that we could put it over and we would sit down and talk 
and do a schedule on the 4th--or the 31st, rather, and that we would 
complete Mr. Simpson's deposition after we had--you had the 
ability to view the videotape and you had the financial documents, 
and so I am trying to be reasonable. Mr. Brewer, you can be 
unreasonable and obviously tell the press anything you like. 
 
MR. BREWER: First of all, we don't need those comments on the 
record, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I wanted to put them on the record. 
 
MR. BREWER: And I would indicate that I've set aside and I 
believe all the other lawyers have set aside the appropriate time 
within which to complete the deposition. It was scheduled to go 
day to day until completed. 
 
You objected to the deposition going beyond five days. It seems to 
me that it's incumbent upon you to go into court to get an order to 
stop the deposition, and you haven't done that. 
 
And the fact is that I have other matters and other cases that I have 
to attend to, and it took us a month to get this deposition 
scheduled, so I'm concerned about those issues. 
 
Now, maybe you have time on your calendar. l personally don't. I 
have other matters I have to attend to, and I was hopeful to get the 
deposition completed by Wednesday of next week at the latest. I 
don't think that's an unreasonable request. 
 
MR. BAKER: As I said from November 15th on, five days, and I 
have commitments, and I've told Mr. Petrocelli I have 
commitments that I have to keep. So I think there's a reasonable 
way to work it out. If you don't want to attempt to do that, that's 
fine. I mean, we'll go into court and we'll do whatever is necessary, 
and we will go from there and-- 
 
MR. BREWER: We have stated our positions. 
 
MR. BAKER: You have indeed.  
 
MR. KELLY: My position is, I'm out here. I'm ready to continue 
Monday morning with the deposition. It's my understanding that 
this court order was day to day also. I'm not going to waste my 
client's money, my weekend, everything else, staying here if it's 
obviously not going to go Monday. I'm putting my objection on the 
record. What I do want to make clear. and I discussed this with you 
before, Mr. Baker, is that all the depositions that have been noticed 
for the Browns and Lou Brown and the like will be put off beyond 
any completion of this deposition if we are going to work in the 
spirit of cooperation, because I want to get this done first before we 
move on to that matter. 
 
Do you have any problem with that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I have tried to cooperate with everybody 
relative to their documents and relative to everything else. 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Now, if it's a one-way street, the answer is clearly 
no. If you guys want to go into court and fight it out, all the 
deposition notices that I have out will stay as the date they are, and 
we will then go and we will fight for every depo and every hour 
and every minute, and that's the way we'll do it. 
 
MR. KELLY: Right. I think I said just the opposite. If you indicate 
to me that you will give me your earlier indicated level of 
cooperation on my interrogatories and rescheduling the Brown 
depositions. I will work with you on completing this deposition 
also. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't have a problem. I think we ought to 
cooperate and save our clients money. That's what I think we ought 
to do, but--because cooperation saves clients an awful lot of money 
rather than running into court. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's not something we've ever done. 
 
MR. BAKER: But I think after a week we might have a way to do 
it through the duration of this case. So if we do, fine. If we don't, 
we both know how to do it the hard way. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Good afternoon. 
 
Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Good afternoon. Have a nice weekend. 
 
(ENDING TIME 4:04 P.M.) I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF 
PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT 
SUBSCRIBED AT CALIFORNIA, THIS ____DAY OF ___,

Q:  Were you there alone?

A:   No.

Q:  Who were you with?

A:  Joe Stellini.

Q:  Just the two of you?

A:   Well, we went in just the two of us, Yes.

Q:  And did you start up a relationship with Nicole at that time?

A:   A few days later.

Q:  You called her?

A:   No.

Q:   How did you get in touch with her?

A:   I was having lunch at The Daisy and she came in.

Q:   Now, Nicole was how old at the time?

A:   18.

Q:   And you were how old?

A:   I believe 28, 29 maybe.

Q:   29?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   Were you married?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Were you separated?

A:   We had just finished a separation, so we were trying to see if we would
get back together.

Q:   You and Marquerite?

A:   Yes.

Q:   That's your first wife?

A:   Yes.

Q:   When did you marry Marquerite?

A:   1967.

Q:   And when did you end your marriage with her?

A:   Officially? It was probably 19-- I  don't know. Late '70s.

Q:   After you met Nicole?

A:   Uh-huh. Yes.

Q:   During the time--Strike that. When you met up with Nicole in the summer
of 1977 after the first couple times seeing her, did you begin dating her?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   In other words, did you start a romantic relationship with her?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   And at that time you were married to Marquerite. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And living with Marquerite. Right?

A:   When I was in L.A., yeah.

Q:   You were a professional football player at the time--

A:   Yes.

Q:  --and you were traveling?

A:   Well, I lived in New York, and she didn't move to New York with me. I
lived in Buffalo during the season.

Q:    During the football season. Right?

A:   And Marquerite didn't move to New York with me.

Q:   And during the off-season you came back to the home of Marquerite and
you in Los Angeles?

A:   At the end of that year for a while, yes.

Q:    End of 77?

A:   Yes, for a while.

Q:    At what point did you permanently move out of your home with
Marquerite?

A:   Sometime after I got back from football in '78.

Q:  --'8?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So where did you move--where did you live in Los Angeles when you
came back after the 1978 football season?

A:   After I left, I can't recall if we were on Mulholland Drive or where at that
time. I lived for a while in the Westwood Marquis.

Q:  Alone there?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And then you moved where?

A:   I lived between there and an apartment on Wilshire Boulevard, and then I
went back to Buffalo -- oh, I went to San Francisco, and...

Q:   Where does Mulholland fit in here? Is that the home with Marquerite?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Now, during this first couple of years that you knew Nicole, let's
say up to your divorce from Marquerite, what you said was late '70s, did you
live with Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:  When did you first live with Nicole?

A:   I think when I came back from probably right at '80. Right at '80, after
the '79 season.

Q:   So January of '80?

A:   I would say, yeah.

Q:   And--

A:   That's an estimate.

Q:   Where did you and Nicole move to?

A:   I think I rented a place at the -- well, I rented a place on--at the end of
Stone Canyon. At the end of Stone Canyon.

Q:  And that was the first home of Nicole and you?

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:   You have to answer audibly.

A:   Yes.

Q:   Before you moved into Stone Canyon for the first three years that you
and Nicole knew each other, how regularly did you see one another?

A:   Quite regular.

Q:   Did you -- was she your principal mate, so to speak?

A:   After the first year, yes. After we had known each other a year, I would
say yes.

Q:  Okay. And where did Nicole live during those three years from '77 to
January of '80?

A:   She had a place in Westwood right off of Wilshire and Veteran. And then
she had a place on Bedford.

Q:  Did you furnish those places for her?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Both of them?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. And was she working?

A:   Sometimes.

Q:  When you were playing football did she travel with you?

A:   No.

Q:  So she was at home in Los Angeles?

A:   She visited me in Buffalo and then spent a lot of time in San Francisco
with me.

Q:  When was the first season you were in San Francisco?

A:   '78.

Q:  Okay. So starting September of '78. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And how many seasons were you in San Francisco?

A:   Two.

Q:  '78 to '79; '79 to '80. Right?

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  You had an apartment in San Francisco during those two years?

A:   A condominim, yes.

Q:   That you purchased?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And Nicole lived there with you?

A:   When she was in San Francisco, yes.

Q:   So during the years '78-79, '79-80, Nicole was shuttling between the
places you provided for her in Los Angeles and the condo in San Francisco.
Is that right?

A:   The place that I helped her with in Los Angeles and the place in San
Francisco, yes.

Q:   You say "helped her." You mean she --

A:   I gave her money when she couldn't pay  the rent, and sometimes she
could pay the rent.

Q:   What was she doing for a living?

A:   She was working at The Daisy.

Q:   For a couple of years?

A:   A year.

Q:   And then after that what?

A:   She decorated. She started decorating for me. She decorated my place,
and then just decorated.

Q:   She earned income from decorating?

A:   From decorating, and she -- I went to Vegas a few times and made a lot
of money, and she made a lot of money also.

Q:   You mean gambling?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Excuse me. When is the last time that she worked for a living?

A:   I would say late '80s.

Q:   And did she work from the '70s through the late '80s?

A:   Depending if she had a decorating job.

Q:   So whenever she worked, it was in the decorating business?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And she would do interior decorating of homes?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. What's the home that you purchased that she decorated it that you
just mentioned a few moments ago? Stone Canyon?

A:   No. Brentwood.

Q:   Oh, Rockingham.

A:   Rockingham.

Q:  Did you move from Stone Canyon to Rockingham?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. How many years did you live in Stone Canyon?

A:   I think just one off-season or one spring.

Q:   That was a rental, you said.

A:   Yes.

Q:   And when did you move into Rockingham?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  When did you purchase it?

A:   I purchased it in '77, but it had to go through a lot of renovations and
changes before we moved into it.

Q:  Was it vacant for two or three years?

A:   Maybe a year.

Q:   Did someone live in it before you?

A:   Yes.

Q:   You rented it out?

A:   No

Q:   Who lived there?

A:   A family called the Eastons.

Q:   Why were they living there?

A:   Because they owned it.

Q:   You said you purchased it in '77.

A:   From the Eastons.

Q:   And they continued to live there?

A:   No.

Q:   No. After -- They moved out when you  purchased it in '77. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you didn't move in until sometime in 1980--or '81, actually?

A:   Yes.

Q:  So for those four years who was living at Rockingham?

A:   I don't think it was four years, because I didn't purchase it until late '77.
Then I did a major renovation, which took the better part of a year, and then
Marquerite and Jason and Arnelle moved in.

Q:   I see.

A:   And then our divorce was final, and I moved back in.

Q:   Well, was Rockingham a home that you purchased when you were still
married to and living with Marquerite?

A:   Before I met Nicole, yes.

Q:   I see. So when you met Nicole, you and Marquerite and children were
living at Rockingham?

A:   No.

Q:   But moved into Rockingham while you met Nicole--while you were
dating Nicole. Right?

A:   Yes, when I was seeing Nicole, yes.

Q:   Okay. And when did Marquerite move out of Rockingham?

A:   Whenever our divorce was final, and I don't recall when that was.

Q:   And then after she moved out, you moved in with Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And generally speaking, what was the time frame of that?

A:   '80.

Q:  Sometime after January '80?

A:   Yeah, I guess, yes. Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, from January '80 until when did Nicole live with you at
Rockingham?

A:   Her primary residence was that until we divorced -- I mean until we
separated.

Q:  Okay. And you -- Nicole filed for divorce in January of 1992. Correct?

A:   January or February. Late January or early February.

Q:   Okay. And when did she move out?

A:   Late January.

Q:   When she filed?

A:   Well, we were separating, and I told her  that if she didn't file, I would.
So after three weeks of just being separated she found a place, and around
that same time she filed.

Q:   During the time period when Nicole first moved in with you at
Rockingham until she moved out in January-February of 1992, were you ever
separated for marital reasons?

A:   I'm sorry. Say that again.

Q:   Were the two of you ever separated during that time frame because of
marital problems?

A:   Between what.

Q:   When the first time she moved in Rockingham in January of '80 and
when she left in early 1992?

A:   Separated.

Q:   Yeah.

A:   You got to be more definitive, because I can't help you.

Q:   In other words, did you move out or did she move out for any period of
time because of difficulties in your marriage?

A:   Move out? We weren't married for the first four or five years we were at
Rockingham so it wouldn't have been a marital thing. For a day or a week,
yes, she moved out from time to time, a day or a week maybe.

Q:  What's the longest she moved out?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:  What's the longest you moved out?

A:   I never moved out.

Q:  When did you get married?

A:   '85.

Q:  On what day?

A:   February 2nd.

Q:   February 2, 1985?

A:   Yes, I believe so.

Q:   And when was Sydney born?

A:   In '85.

Q:   What's her birthday?

A:   October 17th.

Q:   And Justin?

A:   I believe it was '7---I mean '87.

Q:   1987?

A:   Yes. I'm trying to think if it was '88. Maybe in '88.

Q:   '88?

A:   Well, I'm just trying to think. He's two  years younger, but it's August
6th.

Q:  '88?

A:   I believe it's '88, yes.

Q:   Did Nicole move out--you said she moved out from time to time. Did she
do so between the time she first moved in in early 1980 and the date of your
marriage in February of '85?

A:   Yes.

Q:   About how many times?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   Can you estimate for us?

A:   No, I can't.

Q:   Why did she move out from time to time?

A:   We had disagreements.

Q:   About what?

A:   Various things. I don't know. At one point I didn't want to get married.

Q:   From the time that you got married in February of 1985 until January-
February of 1992, did Nicole move out from time to time?

A:   Give me that again.

Q:   From the time that you and Nicole got married in February of 1985 until
the time that she moved out permanently when she filed for divorce, during
that interval of time, seven years approximately, did she move out of
Rockingham from time to time?

A:   Move out

Q:   Yeah, like for a week or --

A:   Well, not move out, no. We had another place, so if we were not getting
along, she sometimes would go to our other place.

Q:  What is that other place?

A:   It was in Laguna.

Q:  When was Laguna purchased?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:   Roughly.

A:   Mid--early, mid '80s. I believe before I was married.

Q:   Before your marriage to Nicole?

A:   I believe so, yes. I'm not a hundred percent sure of that, but I believe
before I was married.

Q:   And when did you purchase the place in New York?

A:   '8 -- well,'90. I believe it was '90.

Q:   Did Nicole ever move into the New York place?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did she ever move in there because of a break in your relationship?

A:   No.

Q:   Just to join you while you were in New York?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did Nicole ever move into the Laguna place because of a break in your
relationship?

A:   No.

Q:   You said she went down there to stay from time to time when--

A:   Yeah.

Q:  --you had problems.

A:   Well, when we had problems and quite often when we didn't have
problems. We lived in Laguna during the summers most times.

Q:  Okay. During your relationship with Nicole from, let's say, January '80
to 1992, did you have any other residences besides New York, Laguna and
Rockingham?

A:   She did. I mean she owned property, but  no.

Q:  Where did she own?

A:   San Francisco.

Q:   Is that something you had purchased when  you were living in San
Francisco?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And as part of the prenuptial agreement, you gave her that property?

A:   Essentially. yes.

Q:   Is something incorrect about what I said?

A:   No. I say essentially that's what it was, yes.

Q:   What do you mean by "essentially"?

A:   I just wanted her to have some income, and I gave her that so that she
could have some income to--

Q:   You owned it in your name --

A:   Yeah.

Q:  --and you transferred it to her?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did she assume the mortgage?

A:   There was no mortgage for her.

Q:   Was it paid off already?

A:   Essentially, yes.

Q:   You took care of it?

A:   No. I--part of it was in my trust at the time. I guess there was a loan on it
in my trust, and most of it was paid off, but to her it was free and clear.

Q:  So you transferred that property to her roughly 1985?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And from that point on did she rent that property out?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And did she ever use it as a residence?

A:   No.

Q:   And did you?

A:   No.

Q:   Now, did Nicole own any other property besides San Francisco?

A:   I believe So. I believe she--well, I knew she had something in Laguna,
but I--you know, Nicole's business was her business.

Q:  The place in Laguna, is that something you bought for her?

A:   No.

Q:   She bought it on her own?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And did she buy it during your marriage?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Is that a place where you and she ever stayed?

A:   No.

Q:   She rented that out?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. So she had two rental units, right, Laguna and San Francisco,
during a good part of  your marriage?

A:   Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't even look like Ed.

MR. PETROCELLI: Got a little more hair.

MR. KELLY: It would take me a long time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Now, did you--you and Nicole, you said, had a number of disagreements
and she would move out from time to time or go stay in Laguna. Did -- And
you said one of the causes of these disagreements was your desire not to get
married.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he didn't talk about a "number of
disagreements."

THE WITNESS: I don't think I said she moved out either. I don't think I said
she moved out. She went --moved out is taking all your clothes and
everything. I don't recall her doing that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, did she ever move out in that sense during the entire time that you
were --

A:   I don't recall that.

Q:  -- living at Rockingham together?

A:   I don't recall that ever happening.

Q:  Where she took all her belongings and said, "Look, I'm gone. I'm moved
out." Except for the the last time, of course.

A:   Maybe once.

Q:  When was that?

A:   The day before we got engaged.

Q:  Is that because you wouldn't get engaged?

A:   Partially, yes.

Q:   And you solved that problem by --

A:   Getting--

Q:  --agreeing to marry her?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Did she physically move out?

A:   She just took some things.

Q:   And how long was she gone?

A:   That night.

Q:   One night?

A:   Yes.

Q:  What other reasons did you have conflicts and disagreements with her
such that she would go stay someplace else for a while?

A:   One time she found some phone numbers of girls, and other than that I
can't specifically tell you.

Q:   You can only remember one occasion where she went to stay someplace
else because she was upset that you were seeing other women?

A:   No, that's not what I said.

Q:   You said she saw phone numbers of girls. I take it that means that she
thought you were cheating on her?

A:   I don't know about what she thought, but there were phone numbers, and
she moved. Not moved. Left for a day or two or few days.

Q:  You and she had an argument about this?

A:   I'm sure we had, yes.

Q:   And what year was that?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   Mid '80s?

A:   In the '80s, yes.

Q:   After marriage?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   During one of her pregnancies?

A:   She never moved out when she was pregnant, no.

Q:   Who were the girls whose phone numbers--

A:   I have no idea.

Q:--caused this disagreement?

A:   I have absolutely no idea.

Q:  Can you recall anything about your disagreement with her on this subject?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you argue frequently about infidelity on your part?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever argue about that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  On how many occasions?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  More than a dozen?

A:   No.

Q:  More than five?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Was it the most constant -- was it the most frequent topic of conflict
between the two of you during your 12-year relationship at Rockingham?

A:   I'd say no.

Q:  What was?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Did you have any topic of--common topic of conflict or disagreement
between the two of you?

A:   My traveling.

Q:  How many times did you fight over your seeing other women or her
thinking you were seeing other women?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, when you say, "fight," have verbal
disagreements? Is that what you mean by a fight?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q:  Well, you already said you never physically hit her. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said he physically had an encounter with her on
January 1st, 1989. You've gone into that in great detail.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q:  Well, you never hit her. Right?

A:   No, I never punched her or anything like that, no.

Q:   By the way, you never kicked her either. Is that right?

A:   That's correct.

Q:   My question was: How many times did you fight over your seeing other
women or her thinking you    were seeing other women? I'm not limiting it to
--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And again, that's verbal disagreements

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: I couldn't say.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  There was the one occasion in 1989 having to do with Katherine. Correct?

A:   No. that's absolutely wrong.

Q:   Why is that wrong?

A:   Katherine was Marcus' girl. We didn't fight over that.

Q:   But you and she were that evening--the fight that evening began a
discussion about Katherine, did it not?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean--are you talking January 1st, 1989 again?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

THE WITNESS: What do you mean? You have to be a little more clear.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Let me ask you this, yes:  In  January of  '89 when you had the incident
with her, did that have  anything to do with her belief that you were being
unfaithful?

A:   I don't know what her belief was. She had a conversation with Katherine
Allen. You should call Katherine Allen. She was wrong. She ended up
talking to Katherine Allen and realizing she was wrong. So you would have
to talk to Katherine Allen about that.

Q:   We will, and Marcus Allen as well, once we can get them served. They
apparently don't want to be served.

A:   I don't blame them.

Q:   Anyway, what was Nicole's concern expressed to you about Katherine
and/or Marcus Allen?

A:   She had a conversation with Katherine. She misinterpreted something that
Katherine told her.

Q:   What did Katherine tell her?

A:   Something about earrings.

Q:   What about earrings?

A:   Katherine was talking about the earrings Marcus had bought her, and
while Nicole was, from what I gather, you know, gushing over how nice
those earrings were that Katherine was--Marcus had bought Katherine,
Katherine said something, "Well, look at you. Look what you got," and
Nicole misinterpreted that as that--I don't know. You have to ask--you know,
Nicole never was clear about it to me, so you'd have to talk to--Nicole ended
up talking to Katherine Allen, and they got it straightened out.

Q:   Well, what I don't understand about that is: What caused Nicole to get
upset with you about Katherine's comment to her, 'Look what you got?'

A:   I'm assuming that Nicole felt that what Katherine was saying that I
bought some earrings, but what Katherine was referring to was I guess
Nicole wasn't aware that she was dripping in diamond earrings that night, and
that's what Katherine was referring to.

Q:   That you had bought earrings for whom?

A:   I don't know. You have to talk to Katherine about that. I never got that
clear from Nicole.

Q:   Did Nicole accuse you of buying earrings for another woman?

A:   She said something about, "What about the earrings that Katherine was
talking about?" And from that point it turned into an argument.

Q:  Did you know what she was talking about, by the way?

A:   Not at all. As a matter of fact, I tried to get Katherine on the phone for
Nicole to clear it up, to find out what was going on, but Nicole wouldn't talk
to Katherine, and I guess the next day they did.

Q:  Where did Katherine live? In Los Angeles?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So you were going to call her at, what  --

A:   Marcus' house, yes.

Q:  2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning?

A:   Yes.

Q:   What time was it?

A:   Whatever. 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the  morning.

Q:   To straighten this out?

A:   No. For Nicole to--Hey, you know, Nicole couldn't tell me what she was
talking about. so--and she had mentioned Katherine's name, so I said, 'Hey,
well, get Katherine on the phone and let's straighten it out. "But typically she
didn't want to straighten it out. She wanted to argue.

Q:   During the course of your relationship with Nicole, would you say you
argued quite a bit?

A:   No.

Q:   Frequently?

A:   No.

Q:   On a regular basis?

A:   No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It was scheduled at 10:00 o'clock every Monday.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Once a month?

A:   We probably had--Well, when you said  "argument"

Q:   Yeah.

A:   --I don't know what "argument"--

Q:   Would you fight and argue a lot?

A:   No.

Q:   Would you say that your relationship was a stormy one?

A:   No.

Q:   Would you say that it was a healthy relationship?

A:   I thought we had a great relationship.

Q:   For the entire time that the two of you were together?

A:   I thought until '92 when we started to split, we had our ups and downs
like every relationship, but I think--we had a tremendous relationship, a
relationship that everybody seemed to want to share with us because they
were always around.

Q:  How do you know they wanted to share that?

A:   Because they were always around. That's what I interpreted that to mean.

Q:  But you were a celebrity. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  So that's why they were around. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well. don't answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  But did they tell you. "O.J. and Nicole, we really envy your relationship.
We"--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer this.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is that what people told you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: I've heard that before.

MR. PETROCELLI: He is making a statement. I am entitled to examine him
about it, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You are not entitled to ask speculative questions and
ask a witness to speculate as to what people --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Don't speculate. I agree with your lawyer on that. We don't want any
speculation. We just want your  recollection of what things--what were said.

A:   Okay.

Q:   Your perception, based on what people said and how they behaved, is
that they wanted to be around Nicole and you because you two had a great
relationship. Is that right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you said you had your "ups and downs.' What were the downs?

A:   My scheduling. I traveled quite a bit, Nicole and I were both bullheaded
and quite often didn't agree on the same things. I'm the type of guy that when
I get into something, I get a little manic about it, golf being one. Golf became
an issue with the two of us.

Q:   When?

A:   Probably the late '80s into the '90s.

Q:   What else became an issue between the two of you besides golf and your
traveling?

A:   As I stated before, finding phone numbers.

Q:   You said that happened on one occasion.

A:   One occasion I recall.

Q:   No other occasions?

A:   There--

Q:   Right.

A:   There were occasions she saw phone  numbers. I get--people give me
numbers all the time, so--I get cards and numbers from everybody. So it's on
an occasion that I recall specifically that happening, but--yeah.

Q:  Where did she find these phone numbers?

A:   Whenever I get home, I empty my pockets--off a road trip or something,
I would empty my pockets on my vanity, and at one point I guess she went
through my drawer and found the phone number found phone numbers.

Q:  And how many times during the entire time you lived with her at
Rockingham were you unfaithful?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that. Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   How many extramarital relationships did you have?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that either.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he said they had a great relationship. I am entitled
to examine him about--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't agree with you, and  he is not going to
answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You don't want to answer that question?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question either.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you unfaithful?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Now, isn't it true that you were having sexual relations in the same house
that you were living with Nicole at the time that she was in that home?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Isn't that true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  During one of her pregnancies?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, I am entitled to probe his entire history of his
relationship with Nicole.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I disagree with you, and he is not going to answer
it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Didn't you and she have a confrontation over your having sex with
another woman in the guesthouse at Rockingham?

A:   Never.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--Go ahead. You've answered it.

THE WITNESS: Never.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  That event never occurred?

A:   Never. Never, ever.

Q:  Had you ever heard that report--event reported in the news or the media?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's irrelevant, what you've
heard. I've heard everything reported in the news media.

MR. PETROCELLI: You didn't think it was irrelevant, what Mr. Kaelin
heard in the media.

Q:  In any event--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Make your speeches outside in front of the
microphones.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're saving them for you, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you are going to save them a long time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did you ever have a relationship with another woman in the same at your
Rockingham residence while Nicole was there?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did you ever fight with Nicole over such an incident?

A:   Never.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--Go ahead. You've answered it.

THE WITNESS: Never.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Never?

A:   Never.

Q:   Did you have a difficult time with Nicole's pregnancies?

A:   No.

Q:   Did you become abusive towards her during her pregnancies?

A:   No.

Q:   How many times was she pregnant?

A:   By me.

Q:   [Nods head.]

A:   That I know of, four.

Q:   And two of them were aborted?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Before your marriage?

A:   No. One before; one after.

Q:   When was the first one?

A:   Early on in our relationship. I don't know.

Q:   You were still--married to Marquerite?

A:   I may have been at that time separated from Marquerite.

Q:   When was the second one?

A:   I believe '89 or '90.

Q:   Did you know she had that abortion?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did you agree with it?

A:   No. We had an argument about it.

Q:   Tell me about that argument.

A:   I didn't want her to have an abortion. She had said that after Sydney and
Justin, that she would never have an abortion again, yet she wanted an
abortion.

Q:  Why?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   What did she tell you?

A:   She just didn't want to go through being pregnant. She didn't want to
have any more kids. At that time she didn't.

Q:   Did she--did you say the abortion was in 1989 or 1990?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Which year?

A:   One of the two, I don't recall exactly.

Q:   Mr. Simpson, was this abortion after or before the January 1, 1989
incident?

A:   After.

Q:   Okay. Do you know how long after that incident she got pregnant?

A:   No.

Q:   By the way, was she pregnant at any other time by someone else other
than you? You said --

A:   That I know of

Q:   Yeah, that you know of?

A:   Once.

Q:   When was that?

A:   I think in '9--'92.

Q:   How did you find that out?

A:   She told me.

Q:   Is it during the time that the two of you were separated?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And she was living at Gretna Green?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Excuse me. Did she tell you about it beforehand?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: 'Beforehand," what's that mean

MR. PETROCELLI: Before the abortion.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did she seek your advice on what to do?

A:   No.

Q:   She just told you what she was going to do?

A:   She was emotional, and she just needed someone to talk to.

Q:   And you talked to her about it?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And did she tell you who the father was?

A:   I didn't ask.

Q:   Do you know?

A:   No.

Q:   Do you have any information as to who the father is?

A:   I can guess, but it would be a guess.

Q:   Why would it be a guess?

MR. ROBER BAKER:  He doesn't want you to guess.

THE WITNESS: Well. Why, because she was seeing evidently different
people so --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Who was she seeing at that time?

A:   At the time she talked to me, I assumed  she was seeing a guy named
Joseph.

Q:   Joseph Perulli?

A:   I don't know his last name.

Q:   This is the same Joseph who was at the Jenners' Christmas party in
December of 1993?

A:   Correct. But then she told me a month later that she hadn't been seeing
this guy, she hadn't been seeing Joseph since like June--

Q:  Of '92?

A:   Yeah. So, you know, I never asked her who the guy was. I assume it
was this Brett guy, but you don't want me to assume.

Q:   Brett Shaves?

A:   Yes.

Q:   He worked for her divorce lawyers. Right?

A:   I've been told that, yes.

Q:   Getting back to this previous abortion in 19 -- after the 1989 incident, did
you and she argue--Well, withdrawn. Did she express to you her desire to
have an abortion because of physical abuse by her --

A:   No.

Q:  --by you against her?

A:   No.

Q:  Or because she did not want to suffer any mistreatment during pregnancy?

A:   No.

Q:  None of that was expressed to you?

A:   None of it, no.

Q:  Did she say anything to you along the lines that you had given her a hard
time during the previous pregnancies, and she didn't want to live through that
again?

A:   No.

Q:  What was the reason she gave you.?

A:   We were moving--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Asked and answered. Don't answer it. You've
already told him.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You were moving where? Please complete your answer.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't. I told him not to answer the question. You've
asked and answered it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, you cut him off in the middle of a question.
Besides--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. I cut him off in the middle of an answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Middle of an answer. Excuse me. Besides, I don't think
it's appropriate to instruct on asked and answered when following up on this
area.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You're right.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  How many conversations did you have about her getting this abortion
before she had it done?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  More than one?

A:   She was very emotional about it, so I think when we talked about it the
first time, I avoided the conversation, and then she went and had it done.

Q:  When she went and had it done, did you know that she was doing so?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. So she cleared it with you first?

A:   Right

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know what--Don't answer that. I don't know
what that means.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did the two of you reach a mutual decision that she would have it done?

A:   No.

Q:   So she had it done against your wishes?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did she seek any counseling at that time to your knowledge?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   Did you and she seek any counseling with respect to this decision?

A:   No. Not that I know of. Not that I recall.

Q:   Did she have any medical treatment for injuries during that pregnancy that
resulted in the abortion?

A:   No. Not that I know of, no.

Q:   Did she have any medical treatment for injuries during her pregnancy with
Justin?

A:   No.

Q:   And did she have any medical treatment for injuries during her pregnancy
with Sydney?

A:   No.

Q:   Do you know if she ever had any medical treatment for injuries during
your relationship with her?

A:   No.

Q:   Do you know if she received any medical treatment as a result of her
injuries from the 1989 incident, New Year's Eve?

A:   I know she didn't. I wanted her to go, and she did, and there was nothing
for him to do.

Q:   She did seek medical treatment?

A:   No. I asked A.C. to take her to--she had a headache or something, and I--
we didn't know if it was from a hangover or from our tussle, so I asked A.C.
to take her to have her checked, but ---she went down; there was nothing to
do.

Q:   Where did they go?

A:   I think St. John's.

Q:   Emergency room?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And that was on New Year's Day?

A:   That was after the whole police thing.

Q:   Later on in the morning, you mean?

A:   Well, the police didn't see fit to take her to anyplace, so I thought just in
case, she should.

Q:   When you say the 'Police didn't see fit,' what do you mean by that?

A:   They obviously--they didn't take her anyplace for any medical treatment,
so, you know, I thought she should go to someplace for them to take a look.

Q:   Are you saying that they should have taken her?

A:   I don't know. I don't know if they should have or shouldn't have. They
obviously didn't see fit to, and they didn't, and when I asked her, she said
they didn't. And I said, "Well, you should go," and she didn't want to go,
and told A.C. to take her.

Q:   When you had this conversation that she should go, was this in person?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Is this after the police left?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So when you left the residence while the police were there, where did you
go?

A:   I went to a friend's house.

Q:   Whose house?

A:   Alan Schwartz.

Q:   And how long did you stay there?

A:   40 minutes maybe, the first time.

Q:   Then where did you go?

A:   Back to my house.

Q:   Were the police gone?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And was Nicole there?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Had she gone to the police station?

A:   I didn't know at that time.

Q:   Do you know whether she went at all that day to the police station?

A:   Now I do, but at the time I didn't.

Q:   Okay. And when you got back, was it just you and she there alone?

A:   And A.C.

Q:   And how did A.C get there?

A:   I don't know. I think Arnelle called him.

Q:   How did Arnelle know about this?

A:   Well, she was the one that told -- her and Michelle were the people that
told me to leave because they thought I was gonna get into a -- like we were in
an argument with this Detective Edwards, I believe it was.

Q:   Arnelle was living there at the time?

A:   She was home at the time, yes.

Q:   And Michelle was the housekeeper. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And she was living there, too. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did either Arnelle or Miche1le witness any of the physical confrontation
that you and Nicole had that evening?

A:   Between Nicole and I?

Q:   Yeah.

A:   No.

Q:   When the police were on the scene, Arnelle and Michelle told you to
leave?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And the reason that they told you was to avoid a confrontation with the
police?

A:   With Detective Edwards.

Q:   And was there some reason why they feared that you might have a
confrontation with Detective Edwards?

A:   Because he was an asshole.

Q:   And describe how he behaved.

A:   He was saying things to me like---I don't know--"You two should be
apart. She should leave you." and I said something to him, "I thought you
were supposed to be diffusing this situation here," and he made another
comment, and I said, "Well, who are you to be saying this to me " And at that
point they were telling me, "O.J.," you know, "Dad, you should"--"Dad,
don't do this," because we were standing out, and Nicole was trying to get
out of the car, and Nicole said something about the babies. And I said,
"There's two women in here to take care of the babies," and he said that to
them and--I don't know. He and I had some words, and then Arnelle and
Michelle was saying, "Dad, O.J., just go."

Q:   What were these words that you and Edwards had?

A:   I don't know. He was saying things to me that I thought a police officer--
I thought his job at that particular time was to diffuse the situation, and he was
doing just the opposite of that.

Q:   What was he doing?

A:   I don't know. He seemed to be trying to bait me.

Q:   Bait you into doing what?

A:   I don't know.

Q:   Bait you into getting upset, you mean?

A:   Well, he was succeeding into that, yes.

Q:   Did he use profanity towards you?

A:   I think at one point, yes

Q:   Did you towards him?

A:   I don't recall. I may have, but I really don't recall. I don' t recall doing
that no.

Q:   You heard him testify at the criminal trial?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did he describe the incident accurately to the best of your recollection?

A:   Oh, no. He lied on numerous things.

Q:   He did?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Tell me.

A:   Well, he said that Nicole told him, and I don't believe Nicole would have
lied to him, that the reason for the fight was that I had some of my house help
in bed.

Q:   That you were sleeping with your house help?

A:   Yeah, Michelle or Ruth. I mean, I think the Browns are still pretty close
to Ruth --

Q:   Who is Ruth?

A:   -- and if they thought that, they certainly wouldn't be still close to her.
Michelle--when you see Michelle. I don't think you would buy that either.
And I know Nicole didn't say that to him, and I know that Nicole has never
said that to anybody, and since there was a female officer there also --

Q:  What was her name?

A:   I have no idea. And somehow they've hid her effectively.

Q:   Hid her?

A:   Yes.

Q:   She didn't testify?

A:   Yeah, of course not. And now I understand why this guy was on the
Christopher Commission at that time.

Q:   Who?

A:   Detective Edwards.

Q:   What does that have to do with anything?

A:   It has to do with the way he obviously was treating me. He must have
been reported for that with other people, because he wouldn't have been on a
list that in my mind singled out 40 officers out of 7--  or 8,000 officers as
officers who have had problems.

Q:   Is that the first time that you had  experienced a problem with an LAPD?

A:   Yes. Or any officer, for that matter.

Q:   Any officer.

A:   Yeah.

Q:   Would that be true through June 12, 1994?

A:   That's correct.

Q:    So through June 12, 1994, the only time you had a problem with any
law enforcement person was Detective Edwards?

A:   Yes.

Q:   On the one occasion on January 1 '89. Right?

A:   That's what I believe, yes.

Q:   Did you file a report against Mr. Edwards?

A:   No.

Q:   Detective Edwards. Excuse me.

A:   Detective Ferrill spoke to me about it  the next day. I told him that--you
know, he seemed  to be as interested in Detective Ferrill--I mean  Detective
Edwards as me. And I just said, "Hey, this  guy wasn't a good guy but I
didn't want to get into  it because I just wanted this thing to go away

Q:   So, Detective Ferrill, based on your  conversation with him, appeared to
agree with you,  that Edwards--

A:   No. He seemed to be interested in asking me questions about how
Detective Edwards--you know, what happened with him and I said, "Well.
we had some words." And he said, "What." And I said, "You know, I really
don't want to get into that, you know. I just want to deal with whatever I got
to do to make this thing go away."

Q:   Did you not pursue it any further other than talk to Detective Ferrill, that
is, pursue your complaint against Detective Edwards?

A:   Correct.

Q:   Now, who is Ruth?

A:   Ruth was a nanny.

Q:  What's Ruth's last name?

A:   I don't know. Lou Brown could tell you that.

Q:  Does she still work for the Brown family?

A:   No. No. She--no she certainly  doesn't work for them. She came out to
help out and  from what I'm told, didn't get paid anything. So she's  not
working for them.

Q:  Now, did you and Nicole have any  disagreement that evening over your
sleeping with  house help?

A:   No. And never have we.

Q:  Never?

A:   Ever.

Q:  Do you know--do you have any knowledge or information as to what the
basis of that comment by Edwards was?

A:   He's the only guy I've ever heard say anything remotely like that, so you
would have to ask--you know, I have my opinions, but, you know--

Q:   What's your opinion?

A:   I believe he's a racist, is what I believe he is, and a liar.

Q:  You mean racist against African Americans?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did you believe that at the time?

A:   I believe something was wrong with him at  the time. I didn't know he
would sit on the stand and  say that Nicole told him I was trying to make--was
having sex with my house help.

Q:   Is that the first time you had heard that?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Is on the witness stand?

A:   Yes.

Q:   You didn't hear it at the time?

A:   I never heard it any time in my life until he said it just blurted it out on the
stand. It was amazing.

Q:   You had no contact with Detective Edwards between January 1, '89--
well, actually, you never talked to him or saw him after January 1 '89. Is that
right?

A:   As far as I know, no. I wouldn't recognize him, anyway.

Q:   You haven't filed--Well, withdrawn. When you left Alan Schwartz's
house and you came back to Rockingham, you said Cowlings was there--

A:   Yes.

Q:  And then you asked Cowlings to take  Nicole to St John's Hospital?

A:   Yeah. Nicole said--I said, "You know,  you better"--you know, she said
her--she was  looking for some aspirin or something, and I said. "Do  your
head bother you."  And she says, "Yeah, I'm just getting a  headache," and
she didn't want to talk. And I said, "Well, you should have that  checked."
And A.C. was there, and Nicole didn't want to talk to me, so I got some
clothes and left.

Q:  Where did you go?

A:   Back to Alan Schwartz's.

Q:   How long did you stay with Mr. Schwartz?

A:   A day.

Q:   And you came back to Rockingham then?

A:   Yes. But I was upset also. I was pretty upset about the whole thing--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you if you were upset. He asked you
when you came back.

THE WITNESS: Yes. Well, I came back to get some clothes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Well, you came back that day to get clothes and went back to Schwartz's
and stayed there one night. Right?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   Then you came back to Rockingham, and did  you go someplace else?

A:   Yeah. I stayed a few nights at a friend of mine's house named Mike
Ornstein.

Q:  So the first night was at Schwartz's  house--

A:   Yeah.

Q:  --and then Ornstein for two nights?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   And then back at Rockingham?

A:    I was at Rockingham most of the time during that period of time, but I
just felt I needed some distance.

Q:   Why were you upset?

A:   Because I thought it was a--I thought it was a--I thought we had had a
great night; we had had, what I felt, a great--a great period of time together,
and to me it was--for the argument to start the way it did was wrong, and I
wasn't happy with that.

Q:  You blamed Nicole for that, the way the argument started?

A:   For the way it started, yes. Not for my  actions, but the way it started.
My actions, I was totally responsible for.

Q:   When you--During the three days that  you were staying out at your
friends' homes, did you  talk to Nicole?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   You resolved this pretty quickly?

A:   Yeah. But, you know, how do you  resolve--when a relationship got
physical like that,  it's hard to--I mean, it bothered us both.

Q:   The first time, in your words, the relationship got physical?

A:   Like that, yes, first time it ever got physical.

Q:   Only time?

A:   Yes.

Q:   You--

A:   I mean, when I said only time, I mean it's the only time that we were
physically confronting one another. Nicole's hit me at times.

Q:   She has?

A:   But that was nothing. Yeah, I don't consider that no big deal.

Q:  Why not?

A:   Because it was--I didn't call the police.

Q:  And calling the police is a big deal?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Let me make sure I understand something. You described at length in
your prior testimony that  the physical confrontation was "rassling." That was
your word. Right?

A:   I was physically trying to remove her from the bedroom, yes.

Q:   Now, is that the only time that you and she had ever rassled in that way?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. And you had never had an occasion other than that incident to have
a physical confrontation with her where you were trying to restrain her or
remove her?

A:   At one point she was at a door, and this is something that Denise spoke
about, and she started knocking my pictures and things down, and I grabbed
her by her arm and put her out the front door.

Q:   Where was that, Mr. Simpson?

A:   Rockingham.

Q:   Denise witnessed that?

A:   She witnessed that, yes.

Q:   You, Denise and Nicole. Anyone else present?

A:   And Ed McCabe.

Q:   Who is he? Denise's friend?

A:   He was a friend of Denise's and mine.

Q:   Are you still friends with him?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Have you seen him since you've been out of jail?

A:   Yes.

Q:   On how many occasions?

A:   Twice.

Q:   When was the last time?

A:   Can I ask a question?

Q:   Sure.

THE WITNESS: When did you come into town?

MR. LEONARD: Sunday.

THE WITNESS: Sunday morning.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you and  Mr. McCabe talk about this incident?

A:   This week  No.

Q:   And the prior time that you met him?

A:   Pardon me

Q:   And the prior time that you were with him--

A:   No.

Q:  --since you got out of jail?

A:   No.

MR. LEONARD: No, wait a minute. Monday. Let  me correct myself.
Monday.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not under oath. Don't  worry about it, Mr.
Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: No, but since he's--

MR. PETROCELLI: But if you want to be, we can  take care of that.

MR. KELLY: Put you on the list.

MR. PETROCELLI: I know Mr. Baker likes putting lawyers under oath.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Anyway, what day was this?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What day was what?

MR. PETROCELLI:  Knocking pictures down in front of Denise and Ed
McCabe.

THE WITNESS: It was in the early '80s.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What pictures was she knocking down?

A:   Whatever pictures that were around.

Q:    On the stairway?

A:   Stairway--I had a table in my entry, armoire, that had a lot of pictures on
them and she  just swiped them all off.

Q:  Did they get damaged?

A:   I don't know. Maybe the frames, maybe  the glass.

Q:  And how far was she from the front door?

A:   Couple of feet.

Q:  Couple feet?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  And was the door open or closed?

A:   Open.

Q:   And you just picked her up-

A:   I didn't pick her up. I just took her by her arms and just moved her out
the front door.

Q:   While you and she were yelling at one another?

A:   I wasn't yelling. She may have been saying something, but I don't recall.

Q:   What was the disagreement about?

A:   I don't--I really don't know.

Q:   Don't have any recollection why Nicole was upset?

A:   No.

Q:   Why she was knocking the pictures down?

A:   No.

Q:   Is this the only incident that you can  recall when you--when Nicole was
throwing pictures  down or knocking them down or tossing them or
damaging  pictures and photos?

A:   I--you know, I can't--I know that  I've seen pictures broken, but I can't
recall seeing  her break them. But, you know, I was in one room; she  was in
another room. The only other occasion is I was  walking on down the street
one day, and she drove up  and started throwing pictures at me.

Q:   You were driving down the street--

A:   I was walking down the street.

Q:   Walking--

A:   Yeah.

Q:  What street?

A:   Little Santa Monica.

Q:   Walking to or from your car?

A:   From a restaurant.

Q:  To your car?

A:   Actually, I think I was walking to another store.

Q:   And were you and Nicole having a meal at this restaurant together?

A:   No. No.

Q:   What was the time frame?

A:   Oh, I don't know. Oh, maybe '84.

Q:   And Nicole came driving by--

A:   Yeah.

Q:  --And started throwing pictures?

A:   Like Frisbee-throwing these pictures.

Q:   What kind of pictures?

A:   Pictures that she had had framed of us and stuff.

Q:   Do you know what the cause of this  conflict was?

A:   I was walking out of a restaurant with a guy named Randy England,
who--I can't recall, but I think at the time was one of Denise's boyfriends;
and as we were walking out of the restaurant, I can't think of her name, but
Elaine Young's daughter was  walking down, and we were talking as we
walked out, and Nicole showed up--I mean drove by and just started
throwing pictures. Elaine Young's the lady who sold me my house, and --

Q:  Rockingham?

A:   Rockingham. And we weren't with these people. We were walking to
another store, and I don't know what Nicole thought, but she Frisbee'd those
pictures at us, and she said something very unpleasant to the girl.

Q:  What did she say?

A:   You'd have to ask the girl that. I  think--

Q:  Do you remember?

A:   I don't remember. I read it somewhere  since--when I was in jail I read it,
because I had  forgotten the incident, and I read it when I was in--

Q:   What was it that you read?

A:   I don't know. It was just something that  I read when I was--

Q:  You don't recall. Is that right?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. Did you talk to Nicole after this incident to find out what it was all
about?

A:   I tried to.

Q:  What did she say?

A:   She didn't. That was the incident-- that was the time she moved out and
went to my friends, and I proposed to her the next day.

Q:  Did Nicole--

A:   I remember that portion of it.

Q:  Do you know how it was Nicole had framed pictures in her car?

A:   Yeah. She had--she was having pictures framed and I guess she was
picking them up from the framer.

Q:  Was she moving out? Is that why she had  pictures--

A:   No.

Q:  --in the car?

A:   No. She was just framing pictures of  ours. In our home is--our home
was like a photo album. Nicole's big on pictures and frames, and every  wall
in our house had pictures and frames, and we were constantly traveling and
doing things, and she was constantly taking pictures and constantly framing
pictures.

Q:   Were there any other incidents involving her throwing pictures?

A:   Not that I recall. She knocked a picture over once. She knocked a couple
pictures over once in '93, but she didn't break them or anything.

Q:   This is at Gretna Green?

A:   No. This is at my home in Rockingham.

Q:   What was the date of this incident, Mr. Simpson?

A:    I would say April of '90. April.

Q:   And what was the cause of this problem?

A:   It was she wanted us to get back together. I was reluctant. I had taken a
trip with  her to--so we could get away, at my mother's advice,  to find out
why she wanted to get back together. I  spent a few days with her. I came
back, and she--my  kids were at my house swimming, and she came by and
wanted to know why Paula's pictures were still there,  and I said "Because
Paula's my girlfriend."  And she said, well, that wasn't gonna  work, and she
slapped the picture and left. But she  called and apologized the next day.

Q:   Was this before you and she had made the agreement under certain
ground rules to reconcile?

A:   Before I laid the ground rules and agreed to try it for a year. This is about
a month, I would say, before then.

Q:   You say you laid them down.

A:   Yes.

Q:   Isn't it true that you wanted to get back with her?

A:   No.

Q:   As much as she with you?

A:   No.

Q:   She was insistent?

A:   Very insistent.

Q:   And you relented?

A:   No. By--by May I knew I loved her. I didn't know if I was in love with
her. I knew I loved  the time that we spent with our kids. And when they
followed us down to Cabo, that trip, the group of  people I was staying with
left, and Nicole and the  kids asked me could I stay, and I stayed a few extra
days, and I truly enjoyed the time that I spent. Nicole and I were very loving
in that time, and it was  during that time that I--and it was right around
Mother's Day that I told her that I would try it.

Q:  So your view of this reconciliation is that you took her back, not that she
took you back. Is that right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know that anybody took anybody back.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't think it's a view either. I don't think anybody
argues or anybody would argue that Nicole was very insistent and--to get
back together. And I told her no the first two or three times, but she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Now, you said you loved her, but you didn't know if you were in love
with her?

A:   Yes.

Q:   During that following year or the year that ensued, did you ever come to
the realization that you were in love with her?

A:   Once I came to--it was almost a year. It was either the end of March or
the first day or so  of April. I was surprised that I was at that point  finally
amenable to them moving back in, and it was  the first time that I honestly felt
that--in my  heart, anyway, that maybe this would work, and--  well, and I
called Lou Brown and Judy Brown and told  them.

Q:  The first time since your divorce that you felt that way?

A:   No. The first three months of--Oh, my divorce, yes. First time since my
divorce for sure, yes.

Q:  And first time since Nicole starting -- started to pursue you to reconcile
that you felt that way. Right?

A:   Well, she pursued me for two and a half months before I relented. I said
two and a half months, and I shouldn't explain this, but when I say "two and
a half months," previous to that she had been sending me tapes and cupcakes
and stuff. But from the day she showed up at my house with letters and tapes
and talking to me about getting back together, from that  day to the time that I
said okay was about two and a  half months.

Q:   And how long was she sending messages  through the children and
cupcakes and things like that  before she showed up with the letters and the
tapes?

A:   It started in late February.

Q:   Of 1993?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So you had only been officially divorced  five or six months. Right?

A:   Officially divorced, yes, but we had gone on with our lives a lot earlier
than that.

Q:   Okay. So from February '93 till about late March, early April--

A:   Yes.

Q:   I may have misspoke. When did she show  up at your house with the
letters and the tapes?

A:   In mid--mid March.

Q:   Mid March?

A:   Mid to late--you know, it was the latter part of March. I know that.

Q:  There was a letter she wrote you, a long letter--

A:   Yes.

Q:   And she gave you some videotapes. Right?

A:   Well, they were our tapes, and it was--  yeah, and she wanted me to look
at them.

Q:   One was a wedding tape?

A:   Yes.

Q  And the other one was of the children?

A:   Yeah, a wedding tape that's never been  sold, and a tape of our children.

Q:  What do you mean, "never been sold?"

A:   I never sold it, even though some people  wanted to buy it, but they
evidently got somebody else to okay them to sell them some tapes.

Q:  Your wedding tapes have been sold?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Do you know who sold them?

A:   Well, I know who gave the okay.

Q:  Who?

A:   The Browns.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let's take a break.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record. and the time is
approximately 10:55.

[Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 11:16.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Was there a particular event that sticks out in your mind when Nicole
showed up at your house with the letters and the tapes?

A:   Yes.

Q:   What was that?

A:   The fact that she showed up. I hadn't seen her in few months.

Q:   Between February of '93 when she started  to send the cupcakes and
messages through the kids and  this time she showed up, you were not in
contact  with her?

A:   Not at all.

Q:  Not at all?

A:   Not at all.

Q:  Did not call her?

A:   Not at all.

Q:  Did not return messages back to her?

A:   I personally didn't, no.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Assuming that there were messages from her.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You said I think the last session of your deposition or one of them that she
used to communicate messages through the kids.

A:   Yes, or through Cathy Randa.

Q:   Cathy. That's right. By the time she showed up at your house  on this
occasion in March of '93, had you already met Paula?

A:   Paula was my girlfriend.

Q:  Paula was your girlfriend. That's right. You met her in May of '92.
Correct?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. In fact you know the day, don't you?

A:   Roughly, yes.

Q:   What is it?

A:   22nd of May. Well, I met her before the 22nd. I actually met her like on
the 12th or 13th. 22nd of May is when we dated, roughly.

Q:   And you bought her the bracelet as a two-year anniversary, two years
later. Right?

A:    Well, for an anniversary date. We hadn't been together for two years,
but...

Q:   Two-year anniversary date.

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Now, when she showed up at your doorstep in March of '93, that
was uninvited, I take it. Right

A:   Yes.

Q:   And this is first time you had seen her in a while?

A:    Seen her, yes.

Q:   You had spoken on the phone--

A:   Yes.

Q:   --About getting back together

A:   No.

Q:  Just about the kids?

A:   No. She had called me right before this.

Q:   Oh, to--

A:   To ask that she needed to talk me.

Q:   And you said yes?

A:   No.

Q:  What did you say?

A:    I said I didn't--if it wasn't about the kids, I didn't want to talk.

Q:   Why were you so adamant about this?

A:   Because every time I talked to her in the--well, I was just adamant. I
didn't want to deal with her problems because generally when I talked to her,
it was about her problems, and I didn't want to be involved in her problems.

Q:   What were her problems at that time?

A:   We go back to her being pregnant; went back to her having a problem
with some boyfriend; we went back to Thanksgiving she was having a hassle
with a boyfriend, and, consequently, didn't bring my kids  to New York after
we had agreed on it. Consequently,  I had to get lawyers involved to get my
kids for  Christmas. Consequently, at the last minute she  wanted to come to
New York. It was just--I just made a decision at  one point that if we were
going to communicate, it  should have been about the kids, and outside of the
kids I didn't want any--to deal with her.

Q:  When did you make that decision? In other words, what was sort of the
last straw where you didn't want to communicate with her anymore except
about the kids after Christmas of '93?

A:   It wasn't the last straw. It was just after Christmas, after we had a great
time together Christmas and she called me--yeah, after Christmas. After
Christmas. It was no specific incident. It was all of those incidences, and I
just made up my mind after she left New York that I would only communicate
with her when it came to the kids.

Q:   And that basically held true all of January '93, February '93 and part of
March of '93?

A:   Correct

Q:   Did--Let me backup for a second now. During the time before she
showed up at your doorstep in mid March of '93, had she ever--and after
your--  the two of you split up, did she ever come talk to you  about problems
with other men?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Lean on your shoulder, so to speak, ask  for advice, those kind of things?

A:   Advice, yes.

Q:  And about what men did she come talk to you?

A:   Twice about Joseph, and the pregnancy.

Q:  What were the two times about Joseph? Tell me about those incidents.

A:   The first I think she was informing me that she had met a guy that I--
quote, she was crazy about. Evidently she had just spent time in Mexico with
him and--but she didn't know. She didn't know if he had really split up with
his girlfriend, and so she was--you know, it was--you know, it was her first
time, I guess, and her--since '77 that she was getting into a real relationship
with a person other than me, and she just--I don't think she totally believed
that he had split up with his girlfriend or something, and she just was talking
to me about it.

Q:  What was the other occasion?

A:   I gather at some point in time someone  had told her that I was
somewhere with--that I was  somewhere and Joseph was with another girl
and that I was at this place, and she came over to talk to me  about that. Well,
she didn't come over. We actually  went to dinner, I think, and talked about
that. It was in the summer or early June, mid June maybe. Mid  June.

Q:   We're into 1992 now. Right?

A:   Yeah. We're in the summer of '92, during the summer.

Q:   So during this time period you and she were split up, not together as a
couple, but had a healthy relationship?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   Okay. And that lasted until things deteriorated in November of '92 over
this Thanksgiving  incident?

A:   Yes. Yes. It was very good right up until when she didn't bring the kids
back for Thanksgiving and gave me no reason why.

Q:   Did you ever talk to her about that?

A:   I asked her why.

Q:  And what did she say?

A:   She said she just didn't feel like it.

Q:   Did she tell you why?

A:   No. She told me why eventually, once we were back together a year or so
later, but--

Q:   What did she say then?

A:   She was having beefs with her--I guess  her boyfriend, and whenever she
talked to me I was  short, and she just said she just didn't feel like  flying to
New York and--she just didn't feel like flying to New York. That was it.

Q:  Who was her boyfriend then?

A:   I believe it was Brett.

Q:   Brett.

A:   Yeah.

Q:   Did you have a healthy relationship with her from the moment the two of
you decided to split up in early 1992 until this point in Thanksgiving time?

A:   Healthy, I would say--I went through a tough time. I didn't want to split
up. So for me it wasn't healthy for me.

Q:   But initially you didn't want to split up, but then eventually you reckoned
with it. Right?

A:   When she told me that she was crazy about another guy, there was no
reason for me to try to stay in it.

Q:   Now, when was that, that conversation?

A:   That was the night I believe--we keep getting the Mother's Day--but it
was roughly  Mother's Day or the day after--I believe it was the day after
Mother's Day in '92. I was at the Browns'  house, and Nicole showed up real
late from Mexico.

Q:  Who did she say she was crazy about?

A:   Joseph.

Q:   Joseph. So you said on your video that  you and Nicole had lunch on
January 6, 1992, where  Nicole told you that she wanted to split up?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. And from that point on until this conversation on Mother's Day of
1992 you were of the frame of mind of wanting to put the relationship back
together. Right?

A:   Well, you know, I mean I--yes, I was thrown off--basically, yes. It was
one incident that may have changed.

Q:  What was that incident?

A:   The Keith Zlomsowitzh.

Q:   That was before Mother's Day '92?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And was that shortly before--

A:   A few weeks, I would say.

Q:   After the Keith Zlomsowitzh incident, did you still want to put the
relationship back on track?

A:   It's hard to say. I just know when she told me she met this guy she was
crazy about, but she  didn't know that--it was that day in my mind I moved
on.

Q:   Emotionally. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And as of Mother's Day of '92, you had  not yet met Paula. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:   The Zlomsowitzh incident, was that the first major setback in your plans
to try to win her over again?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he didn't say he had plans to win her over. He
just said--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Or your desire to reconcile with her? Was the Zlomsowitzh incident like
the first major setback for you?

A:   No. When she moved out was a major setback for me.

Q:   Well, I understand, but you were trying to pursue her and get the
relationship back on track?

A:    I don't know. It's hard to say. I just know that I accepted it was over
when she came and spoke to me about Keith. I -- at that point in time I
emotionally left and --

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Keith or Brett

MR. PETROCELLI: Not Brett.

THE WITNESS: Joseph

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We're all--

THE WITNESS: At that point I moved on. I had  started --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay.

A:   I was ready to find somebody.

Q:  The two of you have cordial and positive relations between January 6,
1992 and the Mother's Day of '92 incident?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And continued again through the rest of that year?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Then Thanksgiving things went downhill?

A:   Well, I can't say it went downhill, no. I just say at that point of
Thanksgiving, lawyers got involved for me to get the kids for Christmas, and
we actually had a very, very good three or four time-- days at Christmas, a
real good time.

Q:  Did you communicate with her between Thanksgiving and Christmas
1992?

A:   Very little, almost--if it--if I  communicated with her, it had to do with
arranging for  the kids with-- you know, after the lawyers had got  involved,
which day the kids would come back, who  would bring them back, because
she wasn't coming back.

Q:   Were you romantically involved with Nicole at all during the year 1992?

A:   We had one night--we had a couple of  nights. One night she came to my
house, and then one  night after we had gone to Mezzaluna--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The answer to that is yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes. I'm sorry. Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  How many?

A:   I'm not sure of this, but -- I mean kissing and stuff, I would say twice.

Q:   Were any of them after the Mother's Day of '92?

A:   No. No.

Q:   Both before?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Were they both before the Zlomsowitzh incident?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   So between January and the Zlomsowitzh  incident of '92--

A:   Yes.

Q:  --is when you had relations with Nicole  in '92?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And thereafter for the remainder of that year did not. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:   And when for the first time did you have relations with her in 1993?

A:   I would say beginning of April she showed up at my house one night.

Q:   Okay, I'll get back to that. In April of 1993. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Now, she spent some time with you in Christmas, and it went
well, you said. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That's Christmas of '92. That's in New York?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And you were with Paula then. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Was Paula with you and Nicole at the same time?

A:   No. No.

Q:   Was Paula part of the four days that you  spent with Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:   Okay. Was there any friction between Paula and you over that?

A:   A little bit.

Q:   Now, had you made any plans to marry Paula?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever propose to her?

A:   No.

Q:  You and she ever discuss marriage?

A:   Marriage, no.

Q:   Getting engaged?

A:   No.

Q:   Having a family, living together?

A:   Kids, yes.

Q:   And you discussed this in the year 1992 and up through some point in
'93, I take it?

A:   I don't know if it ever came up in '92 or '93. I just--I'm sorry. Ask the
question again.

Q:   When did it come up?

A:   It didn't--it was never a plan. You know, Paula is a--as she stated,
Paula's always  wanted a family. She wanted the white picket fence.

Q:  She wanted to get married to you and have  a family. Right?

A:   She never told me she wanted to get  married to me.

Q:  Well. she wanted a family with you. Right?

A:   She never told me that, ever. She always  just said that her dream was
always this house with the white picket fence and kids.

Q:   But you understood that she would have liked to have that with you.
Right?

A:   Well, the longer we were together, I would have assumed that eventually
I was--yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Are you saying the two of you never talked about that?

A:   Never talked about that no.

Q:   Never once talked about having kids together?

A:   Yes, we talked about having kids and filling houses up with kids, yes.

Q:  Did you--

A:   But it was--

Q:   Go ahead.

A:   It was at an affair that we talked about that.

Q:   It was at an affair?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Was that the evening of June 11?

A:   Yes.

Q:   1994. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Before that evening had you ever spoken to Paula about that?

A:   Us having kids

Q:   Yeah.

A:   I don't really think so. Paula just  wants to have kids. She wants to have
a simple life and kids and house and family.

Q:  When Nicole showed up on your doorstep in March of 1993 what was the
state of your relationship with Paula?

A:   Great.

Q:  You had a monogamous relationship with her?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And were the two of you living together at anytime?

A:   No.

Q:  Did she stay with you often?

A:   If she visited me in New York for a few  days--she has a very active
career, so she was traveling as much as I was.

Q:   Well, from mid-March of--well, when  Nicole came to see you in March
of '93, what was the  reason she told you she wanted to get back together?

A:   I'm sorry

Q:  When Nicole came to see you in mid-March of '93.--

A:   After she saw me--

Q:   When she came to see you to talk to you--

A:   Okay.

Q:  --what was the reason that she said that she wanted to get back together?

A:   She told me, you know, "I love you. I never said I didn't love you. I
needed to do the things that I did this year." She didn't like her life. She
didn't like the people she was hanging around with. She--quote, "All the guys
are just trying to get in your pants. All the girls I run around with, they're just
looking for somebody with money to marry. Everybody's doing drugs, and I
said  to myself, I had a good life, I had a good family, and  I want to come
home."  She went on to discuss that evidently she  had been going to some
therapy, and they had taught  her something, and she asked me if I had read a
letter  that the kids had gave me, which I hadn't, and we  were--it was
curious, too, because she says in the letter she wishes we were taking a walk,
and I was taking a walk with her at the time.

Q:    Why hadn't you read that letter the kids gave you?

A:    Because they just walked in with it and handed it to me, and then I went
looking for where they went, and then I noticed Nicole was parked across my
driveway, and I--

Q:   Did she tell you that she regretted the decision to split up with you?

A:   No, she said she didn't regret that. She needed the time that she had.

Q:   Did she talk to you at all about abuse by you?

A:   No.

Q:   Did that come up at all in this conversation?

A:   I don't recall that coming up at all.

Q:  What about infidelity?

A:   In this conversation her sole purpose was to get back with me.

Q:  What did--By the way, what people did she say she did not like?

A:   She didn't say. She said a--I didn't  know who her friends were. You
know, I knew Cora, but  all these other people who we see now, I didn't
know who these people were.--

Q:   Who do you mean by "these other people," Mr. Simpson?

A:   The Keiths, the Cicis, these people--I don't know these people.

Q:   Cici was not someone who was in your and Nicole's life before you split
up?

A:   No.

Q:  Was Cora?

A:   Cora, yes.

Q:  She was. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  But not Cici. Right?

A:   Not Cici.

Q:  And not Faye Resnick?

A:   Oh, no, not Faye Resnick.

Q:  What about Chris Kardashian and Chris Jenner?

A:   We knew Chris Kardashian--I know  Chris--they were friends because of
Bob and I were  friends. They never did anything outside of Bob and  I.
Nicole wasn't a big fan of all the fingernails and hair and clothes thing, and
that--Chris was--that was Chris' thing.

Q:  What about the Schulmans? Were they part  of your circle of friends
before you and Nicole split up?

A:   At one point. Then Nicole had a falling-out with the Schulmans, and I
believe by the time we split up Nicole hadn't spoken a word to Linda in a few
years, even though I would see them from time to time.

Q:   And what about the LeBarons?

A:   You know, I don't--we saw them maybe once a year.

Q:   Okay. When you and Nicole split up in '92, who was in your circle of
friends, your closest friends?

A:   I would say for Nicole it was Cora. I don't think she saw much of Suzie
Kehoe, who has been her closest friend most of the years we were together
up to that time, The Schwartzes--

Q:  Alan Schwartz?

A:   Yeah. And Pam Schwartz. And then Nicole's life was more geared
around the kids, you know.

Q:  Those are the main people, though?

A:   Yes, I would say for the main people

Q:  When you took vacations, you took  vacations with these people?

A:   We had in the past, but--yeah, we had  in the past.

Q:   Okay. What did you tell Nicole--

A:   Not Cora. We hadn't taken vacations with Cora, no.

Q:   Not Cora. Now, what did you tell Nicole in March of  '93 when she said
she wanted to go back?

A:   I told her I was in a relationship and-- but essentially I felt that I had loved
her and I always would love her, but I was in a relationship, and that I had
suggested--I was big on us doing something together as a family once a
week, and we had--since I had been back we hadn't done that, and I said,
"But I do believe we should at least once a week do something together with
the kids."

Q:  And did she accept that?

A:   She had no choice.

Q:  And did you carry out on that plan?

A:   Well, what happened--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's a yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes. Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  What happened?

A:   What do you mean?

Q:  You said, "Well, what happened"

A:   Well, yes, we did carry out on that plan, but Nicole didn't accept that
plan, and Nicole just started showing up everywhere.

Q:   Against your wishes, you mean?

A:   Well, when you say "against [my] wishes,"  I mean--

Q:   Was it bothering you?

A:   To an extent, yes, but not--I mean, it wasn't unpleasant, but it got
complicated.

Q:   How?

A:   Because I'd be places and be meeting Paula places, or Paula would come
to a golf course and was gonna meet me for drinks or something, and Nicole
would show up before Paula showed up.

Q:  Uninvited?

A:   Well, she was going to the driving range.

Q:   It was your sense that she was going there because you were there?

A:   She told me that. She said if we got  back together--and I'm crazy about
golf--she  wanted to learn how to play golf, so she started  taking golf
lessons.

Q:   But are you saying it was a coincidence that she showed up at these
places when you were  there, or she was trying to meet up with you there?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That calls for speculation.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What was your understanding of what was happening?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: How can he have an understanding unless she told
him.

MR. PETROCELLI: Because he can observe human nature.

THE WITNESS: Well, she knew what time I played golf, and when I was
coming off--coincidentally, when I was coming off the 18th green, Marshal
would say, "Your wife." I said, "My wife,  I don't have a wife. "Your ex-
wife is on the driving range," and I'd go down.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did she show up at any other places where  you were besides the golf
course?

A:   My house.

Q:  Again, uninvited?

A:   Yes. But that was nothing because-- well. I can't say that was nothing.
Quite often it was either the kids were at my house or she was coming  by to
drop something off for the kids or she was  dropping the kids off, an then it
got to be a little  more than that.

Q:  When did that happen?

A:   After we went to Cabo.

Q:  How did it get to be a little more than that?

A:   Well, she started coming late night.

Q:  Without your asking her to?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And while you had Paula there with you--

A:   No. Paula--well, a few times. I just assume that when she didn't see
Paula's car, she would ring the bell, but if she saw Paula's car, she--I mean,
you know, it depends if she knew I was home or what.

Q:  Did she have a key?

A:   At that time, no.

Q:  Is this the Ashford bell?

A:   Yes.

Q:   You went to Cabo with her in April of '93?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And the two of you went as a couple?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Who did you go with?

A:   Just her and I.

Q:  And you were romantically involved during that trip?

A:   In that trip, yes.

Q:  Yeah. And did your plans for the future change during that trip?

A:   I hadn't made up my mind one way or the other.

Q:  You were still kind of on this once-a-week family event?

A:   Well, yeah, that was still what I wanted it to be, but at this time that
wasn't what was happening.

Q:   Okay. And after Cabo did Nicole start showing up more and more often--

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. And did she at some point show up in Mexico?

A:   Yes.

Q:  When was that? After the Cabo trip?

A:   Yes. That was in May.

Q:  And who did you go with to Cabo --to  Mexico with?

A:   Allen and Gail Austin, Craig and Melissa  Baumgarten, I believe Hos--
Bob Hoskins went with  us, and Cory Wolman.

Q:  Where did she stay?

A:   At a friend's house.

Q:  In Cabo?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And Nicole showed up at this house?

A:   Well, she called. When I called to leave a number where I would be, she
said, "We're coming." I said, "What do you mean 'we're coming."

Q:   Who's "we"

A:   And she said her and her friend and the kids--And I said, "Well, where
you staying." She said a friend's ex husband had a co-op, which I've read
now is a villa, but that's where they were staying.

Q:   This friend was Faye Resnick?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So she showed up with Faye Resnick?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And Justin and Sydney?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And Faye's child?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   What's her name?

A:   I can't recall her name right now.

Q:  Francesca?

A:   Francesca.

Q:  And did you and Nicole see each other during this trip?

A:   Yes. I would--after I would after golf I'd drive into town and yes. The
answer's yes.

Q:  When she said she wanted to come down, did you resist that at all?

A:   She didn't say she wanted to come down. They said they were going
down. They were going to stay.

Q:   Did you try to talk her out of it?

A:   No.

Q:   Okay. And after Cabo you came back, and she started showing up a lot at
your house. Any other places, too?

A:   No. After Cabo I came back and--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Is this his Cabo of May or Cabo of April? Is this the
second Cabo trip

MR. PETROCELLI: Good question, Mr. Baker. I  think this is after the--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm so overwhelmed

MR. KELLY: There's a first for everything,  Bob.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm so overwhelmed, I can't --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  This is the first Cabo trip, in April of '93.

A:   Okay, the first Cabo trip.

Q:  You said that from that point on she started coming over unannounced to
your house quite a bit

A:   Yeah, more regularly.

Q:  More regularly.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  And did she show up at any other places during that time period other than
the golf course?

A:   Show up.

Q:  Yeah.

A:   She came to my office a few times.

Q:  Were you telling her not to do these things?

A:   No.

Q:  In other words, you never said, "Look,  Nicole, you're coming around
too often. Please don't do this"

A:   No. No.

Q:   So it was not bothering you at all. Right?

A:   It was uncomfortable, but, no, I like my kids, and I have always liked
Nicole.

Q:   So even though it was uncomfortable, you didn't tell her you were
uncomfortable about it?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay.

A:   No.

Q:  And at some point you then decided to have this reconciliation with her.
Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And that occurred after the second Cabo trip, in May of '93?

A:   Actually during that second Cabo trip. Actually it was during the Cabo
trip that I made up my mind that I would give it a shot.

Q:   Was there anything in particular that caused you to make that decision?

A:   I really--After my friends left, Nicole  and the kids--Justin kept saying--
Sydney and  Justin, "Come on, stay, dad, stay," and I stayed and I just really
enjoyed myself with my family.

Q:   Was Faye still there?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   So during that trip you and she made the agreement that you've
previously testified about. Right?

A:   Yeah. I think--I came to the conclusion then--I don't know if I worded it
to her then. I may have right after I came back, but it was at that point in my
mind that I said I was gonna give this a shot.

Q:   And your relationship with Paula was good at that time?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Not on the way down?

A:   I think in the previous month, because Paula came by and I know Nicole
was there--that's when she met Nicole. And I didn't even know Nicole was
there. I was upstairs--and then I would say, "Oh, Paula, I was having dinner
with Nicole and the  kids," and it became some friction, but the  relationship
was still good, but it was friction. It was some friction.

Q:  Over Nicole?

A:   Yeah, I think over--I can't recall. It  just seemed that sometimes there was
a couple of  conflicts time-wise, where Paula wanted to do  something but I
had told the kids I'd do something,  and then Nicole would end up with me
and the kids  doing something.

Q:   It's fair to say that the conflicts that you had with Paula during this time
period stemmed from her fear that you might get back together with Nicole?

A:   Well, you'd have to ask her that, but I think--

Q:  You and she discussed that. Right?

A:   I think it had to do with--I didn't -- I don't think I ever discussed with her
about getting back with Nicole until after I made up my mind, and then I
discussed it with her. Then I yeah, we talked about it.

Q:  Before that time, though, you and Paula had discussions where she was
unhappy about Nicole being in your life. Is that a fair statement?

A:   I can't--I don't recall specifically  having a conversation about Nicole
being in my life. I do know that it was uncomfortable, and Paula wasn't
happy when Nicole was coming around a lot.

Q:  Okay. How did Paula take it when you told her?

A:   You know, she--you know, Paula's got a lot of pride. I'm sure she was
hurt. She didn't show  that hurt at that time. She was very supportive of me
at--verbally about getting my family back together. I think she was very
skeptical that it would work, but she was--it was--you know, it was painful to
do it but I think she was supportive but hurt, and so was I.

Q:  And where was this when you told her?

A:   I believe we were at her house, and I think we went to Le Dome for
lunch, and it was right at that--right around then.

Q:   May '93?

A:   May '93, I believe it was, yes.

Q:  Now, from that point on you saw her only one time?

A:   I think I saw her twice.

Q:  Twice?

A:   Yeah. I think I ran into her one other  time, yeah.

Q:   Until you got back together with her in --

A:   Yeah. Yeah.

Q:   --May of '94. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So you only saw her twice in that ensuing  year. Correct?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And not romantically involved with her at all?

A:   No.

Q:   Okay. And didn't speak to her on the phone?

A:   I may have spoke to her a few times on the phone, because I know a few
times I would call Cathy and Paula would be on the phone. I know a few
times I would run into someone who lived in Panama City, and I'd call her
mother, and I believe on one of of those occasions she was there or was
coming the next day, and I called the next day to talk to her, but if it was three
or four times in that year, it would have been the most. Paula called, I know,
the day Marcus was getting married. You know--

Q:   She write to you?

A:   No.

Q:   And you to her?

A:   No.

Q:  When you were in New York during the August football season, 1993,
did you see Paula?

A:   No.

Q:   Why did--Did Paula tell you why she was  skeptical that your
reconciliation would work?

A:   I don't know. I don't think she explained it. I think it was more of an
attitude than she said it, but I was skeptical, so it was--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you if you were skeptical.

THE WITNESS: Okay. No, she didn't --I can't recall any specific thing. I
think it was just more an attitude.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Did you decide to get back together with Nicole essentially for the kids?

A:   I mean that would be the easy thing, but don't think so. I think--I didn't
know how I felt about Nicole. I truly didn't know how I felt about Nicole. I
knew that when we split, I was in love with her, and I knew I would have
never left her at that point in our relationship, and I was--you know, I  had to
try to understand how I felt, and the kids  obviously was in the mix, but I
think it was about  myself first.

Q:  Now, over the next year you saw Nicole on a monogamous basis. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And then split up with her the day after  Mother's Day of 1994. Is that
right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've been through all of this ad nauseum.

THE WITNESS: No, let me see. I got to back up here a little bit. For the next
year I saw Nicole. We didn't date other people. I never asked her what she
did. She never asked me what I did.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay.

A:   It was--we were going. We were working on getting our relationship
back together.

Q:   What I want to know is: During that next year from May of '93 to May of
'94, how many times did you break apart, split up, call it off and then get
back together again?

A:   There were two occasions that I was dead set on ending it, but it never
had happened.

Q:  And those two were when?

A:   The argument that's now the infamous 911 call.

Q:  October 25, '93?

A:   Yeah. And there was one other occasion. I believe there was one other
occasion.

Q:   When was that?

A:   It was early on. It was early on. It was in '93.

Q:   Early in the reconciliation period. Right?

A:   Well, relatively early. It was in '93. I know that.

Q:  What happened?

A:   I--something was in the National Enquirer, and then I was out with
Nicole and I believe Faye and Christian, and it was all in the same kind of
period of time. They were comparing notes about maybe Joseph or some
thing, and I just--I was, you know, I was kind of missing Paula, and I just
didn't feel--I wasn't--I didn't feel I was in love with Nicole, and I just didn't
like what was going on.

Q:   Was this at the California Sushi?

A:   That was the dinner that they were discussing this guy Joseph. I believe it
was Joseph. I may be wrong. I guess whatever the guy they were
discussing, they both had had this guy, and I didn't  know what she was
accustomed to hanging around, but I  was in shock that in front of me they
would be having  this conversation.

Q:  Did you start arguing with her at the table?

A:   No. I said I left. I left. I didn't  argue at the table at all.

Q:  Was it a table?

A:   I believe we left the sushi bar and went to a table. yes.

Q:  And no argument with her? You got up and left.

A:   I got up and said, "I can't believe" I--I don't know who the hell you think
I am." I either asked Chris to pay the bill or gave him some money, and I
walked out.

Q:  That's all that happened, from your account of that. Is that right?

A:   Inside. They came out and was trying to talk me into, you know, coming
back in and stuff, but I was leaving.

Q:   Did you have any argument with her outside?

A:   About coming back in, and I said I wasn't  coming. I said, "I can't
believe"--"Who the hell do  you think I am." You know, "You guys going to
be talking about this. I don't know what your other  boyfriends did, but, you
know, you got me confused with somebody."

Q:   Were you saying that in a loud, angry  voice outside?

A:   I don't know I'm loud all the time,  man, so when you tell me "a loud,
angry voice," I  think it's the way I talk normally.

Q:  Did you observe whether other people were hearing what you were
saying?

A:   I don't believe so. No. There was no crowd around. It was just the four
of us. I think a police car drove by at one point.

Q:  Were you drinking that evening?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Were you drunk?

A:   No.

Q:  Now, what upset you at the table--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Other than what he just told you about.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, you said something they were talking about Joseph --

A:   I think it was Joseph .

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We just went through all this.

THE WITNESS: Some guy they both had screwed.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:   Why would her talking about Joseph upset you?

A:   Well, I think if your wife and a girlfriend was talking about some guy that
both of  them screwed, you'd get up and leave. If you don't--

Q:  Well, were they talking about having sex with Joseph?

A:   Whatever the guy was. I believe it was Joseph. They both had screwed
this guy, and they were talking about sex with this guy.

Q:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Did they just mention the name Joseph,
or were they talking about sex with Joseph--

A:   They were talking about sex with a guy. I'm assuming it was Joseph. I
don't have any clear recollection it was Joseph, but it was a guy that they both
had had, and when they were kind of comparing notes about it--

Q : --In your presence?

A:   --I was in shock.

Q:   When Nicole and Faye were doing this. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Or were they doing it just talking to one another, not to you and
Christian?

A:   The four of us were sitting at a table,  the four of us, and this was a
conversation that was  going on, and I looked at Christian and he kind of did
something and--

Q:  Did you use profanity at Nicole in the restaurant before you got up?

A:   No. No. I don't think I said any thing except--well, I may have said, you
know, "I don't know who in the hell you think I am, to have this
conversation in front of me. I'm outta here."

Q:  Did you hear Faye Resnick's account of this incident in her book?

A:   I may have. I did read her book.

Q:  Yeah, I know you did. She said that you were screaming and yelling and
using profanity at the table. Is that true?

A:   I don't believe so, no.

Q:   And she said you followed her down to the ladies' room.

A:   No, that's wrong.

Q:  She said you barged into the ladies' room, kicking the door open, going
inside.

A:   That's wrong.

Q:   Said you made a big scene in front of the  patrons and the restaurant
manager.

A:   That's--she said that, yes.

Q:   Yeah. Is that true?

A:   No.

Q:  You drove home separately from Nicole that evening?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And did Nicole get driven to Rocking-- or Nicole was at Gretna Green
then. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you went back to Rockingham?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Now, after that incident did you and Nicole not see each other for a
while?

A:   No. We saw each other almost immediately.

Q:   Okay. In both those incidents--

A:   Both those incidents--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Be 10-25.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  10-25 and this California Sushi bar  incident. Was it Nicole who, when
those incidents  occurred, came to you and sort of apologized and  wanted to
put things back together again?

A:   Most certainly at the sushi bar. I think  it was a joint thing at the other
one. I think I--I  think we both apologized to each other at the second  one,
and I was--I may have apologized for being  loud, but certainly not
apologized for the content.

Q:  Loud at what incident?

A:   '93.

Q:  The sushi bar incident--

A:   No, no. The 911 incident.

Q:  You apologized for being loud?

A:   Yeah. You know, it was an argument. It was--but I don't apologize for
why I was arguing,  you know.

Q:   Okay. Did you also have an incident involving Nicole at the Harley
Davidson Cafe opening: in October of  '93 in New York City?

A:   No.

Q:  You attended that with Christian Reichardt and Faye Resnick?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And shortly before that event an article appeared in the National Enquirer
about you and Nicole?

A:   I don't believe so.

Q:  Any tabloid article come out around that  period of time that upset you at
all?

A:   Not that I'm aware of, no.

Q:  And did you have any disagreement with  Nicole either that evening or the
next evening at your  place in New York?

A:   I think the next evening Nicole was upset that a friend of mine and Faye
were on the phone late that night and--

Q:  Was that Mark Packer?

A:   Mark Packer, yes.

Q:   Who was on the phone with Mark? You--

A:   Faye.

Q:   She was upset with you?

A:   Yes, that's--yes. And I kept saying, "She's your friend. Why are you
pissed at me."
"Because he's your friend." "So what does that got to do with us."

Q:  So did the two of you have a loud argument that evening?

A:   It wasn't loud, because she went to bed immediately. She said
something. I said, "Why are  you pissed at me about this. That's your friend
you  brought back here. I didn't bring her back here. She  talks to who she
wants to talk to."

Q:  Was that the extent of the evening?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Of the incident, I mean.

A:   Yeah. We were home, and she had just  made--warmed up some pasta for
me and then--

Q:  Now, you did attend the opening of the  Harley-Davidson--

A:   Yes.

Q:  --Cafe. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And you were at a table with Resnick, Christian and Nicole?

A:   I don't know if we ever got a table, but we may have at one point sat
down. The place was like sardines, it was so packed.

Q:  And did you consume cocaine that evening?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you take cocaine in front of Nicole, Faye--

A:   No.

Q:  --or Christian?

A:   Absolutely not.

Q:  Did any of them take cocaine?

A:   I didn't observe anybody taking cocaine.

Q:  Okay. And what about at your apartment  that evening or the next
evening? Did you--

A:   Absolutely not.

Q:  --take cocaine there?

A:   Absolutely not.

Q:  Okay. Was there an incident in which you  had a disagreement or a fight
with Nicole at a restaurant  called Toscana's?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you recall that incident as described in Faye Resnick's book?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Were you present there?

A:   Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Present there when?

THE WITNESS: The incident --

MR. PETROCELLI: At the incident.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The incident that she described?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q:   What's your recollection of the incident?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he doesn't--

THE WITNESS: I don't think there was an  incident. I saw her book. I was
surprised at it. But you read the stuff. You see what everybody else  there
said. Jeez.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  So what she said about that is false?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Miss Resnick also wrote in her book and  testified under oath that you
called her on May 2 or  May 3 of 1994 from Puerto Rico or from -- No.
Withdrawn. Miss Resnick testified under oath that you called her on May 2
or May 3, had a telephone call with her. Do you recall that?

A:   No. Not particularly, no.

Q:   She said that in this call you were ranting and raving about Nicole having
made a decision to leave you while you were in Puerto Rico. Do you recall
discussing that with Faye Resnick?

A:   No.

Q:   And in this conversation you told Faye that you would kill Nicole. Do
you recall saying that?

A:   Absolutely not.

Q:  Do you recall having any conversation with Faye Resnick about killing
Nicole, even if you didn't mean it seriously?

A:   None. Absolutely none, ever.

Q:  Did you ever discuss that with Christian Reichardt?

A:   Never.

Q:  Did you ever discuss Faye's account of that with Christian  Reichardt?

A:   Account of what?

Q:   Account of that conversation that I just described to you.

A:   What conversation? There was never a conversation. So there was never
a conversation. I don't -- I don't--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You have answered the question.

THE WITNESS: No. I don't know. I don't know--I've talked about a few
things with Christian, but I don't recall that being any point thing.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you and Faye have a conversation on the telephone around May 2 or
May 3 when you were very angry about Nicole and told so to Faye?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: This is '94

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. Did I say '93

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You didn't say any year.

MR. PETROCELLI: '94.

THE WITNESS: I don't know about angry. I was  concerned about what the
heck was going on with  Nicole, which I know I had expressed to Faye, and I
expressed to the Browns.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Are you saying you think you had a  telephone conversation with Faye
Resnick on this time that you expressed that to her as well?

A:   I'm pretty sure, if I spoke to Faye during this period of time, I would
have expressed that, yes.

Q:   Now, this is before you made the decision to leave Nicole for the last
time. Right?

A:   Well, when I came back from Puerto Rico, I had made that decision, but
Nicole and I had a conversation, and it went for another week.

Q:  Okay. Before you--Well, why did it go another week, by the way?

A:   Because there was a suggestion to date or, you know, take Wednesdays
and Saturdays and see how that worked, and so--and I was--that's why,
basically. And Nicole was considering going to therapy but by the end of the
week she just--it  just didn'twork.

Q:   Oh, she was considering it?

A:   Yeah, I told her that I thought she  should try back to whoever she was
going to before she  came to ask me to come back in the relationship  because
I thought she was as healthy as I had seen her  during that period of time, and
I didn't feel that she  was too healthy at this time.

Q:   The conversation that you just described where you asked her to go to
therapy was the conversation on Mother's Day, 1994. Right?

A:   That conversation was an extension to when I first got back from Cabo.
That conversation, it wasn't a suggestion. It was an either/or.

Q:  And the Mother's Day conversation.

A:   Yeah.

Q:   And as of the end of Mother's Day, the decision was she wasn't going to
therapy, and that was the end of the relationship?

A:   Yeah, I think it was either Mother's Day or, once again, the day after
Mother's Day. I don't recall which night it was.

Q:   Now, the prior conversation with Nicole the week before was where?

A:   At her house.

Q:  Okay. What was the day of that conversation?

A:   Whatever--the day after I got back from  Cabo.

Q:  From Puerto Rico?

A:   I mean from Puerto Rico, yes.

Q:  You got back for Christian Reichardt's party. Right?

A:   I got back because we had to shoot in L.A.

Q:  But you went to the party, in other words?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That party was on April 30, I believe.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Okay. And had you had the conversation with Nicole that you just
mentioned before that party?

A:   No. I think it was the next day.

Q:   Okay. And relate that conversation to me.

A:   Nicole had some concern about why I wasn't loving, and my words to
her was, "I couldn't"--I didn't think I could do this. I didn't,  know--when I
was in Puerto Rico. Nicole was like  having a nervous breakdown. and I had
no--I couldn't  understand why. I didn't understand what it was  about, and I
was explaining to her that, you know,  "All of this all calling me, saying
you're sorry. I went through weeks talking to you; I didn't know who  was
talking to from day to day, and I can't do this."

Q:  When Nicole said--she was questioning  you why--

A:   Why I wasn't loving her.

Q:  You mean at the party?

A:   You know, loving. I've always been a very affectionate person--it was
almost a culmination of some of the whole year. It was just that I just never
fell back in love with her. Even though I felt I was in love with her a couple
of  times, I never really fell back in love with her, and I thought it would--as I
told you before, I thought before I went to Puerto Rico was the first time that
I thought it would work, and while I was in Puerto Rico, I mean, Nicole--her
words were was she was having a nervous breakdown.

Q:   Did Nicole describe to you when you came back to Los Angeles what her
problems were while you were in Puerto Rico?

A:   No. No. Whatever--evidently there  was--something was going on.

Q:  Did she tell you that whatever it was,  she was over it?

A:   Basically. She laid some of it off on Cora and some of it off on Faye.

Q:  What did she lay off on Cora?

A:   That Cora was--something was going on  with Cora and Ron Fishman;
Ron had moved out, and Faye  was messing with drugs.

Q:  So her preoccupation with their problems was causing her a lot of stress in
her life?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Is that what she was telling you?

A:   That's what she told me, yes.

Q:  And did you find that a reasonable explanation --

A:   No.

Q:  -- for her behavior?

A:   No.

Q:  Why not?

A:   Why. Why should whatever was happening to these women affect the
way her and I was with each other.

Q:   And you told her that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Now, during that week when you got back  and went to Reichardt's party
and the Mother's Day  decision not to see her anymore, okay, you had
conversations with Faye Resnick on the phone. Right?

A:   Earlier in--maybe, you know. I don't  totally recall, but I knew I had
spoken to Faye a few  times because Faye--yeah, I had spoke to Faye a few
times, yes.

Q:  Apart from expressing to Faye your concerns over Nicole, did you ever
express or vent any anger about Nicole?

A:   No, not any anger, not to the degree that you mentioned earlier, no.

Q:  Are you aware that Christian Reichardt told the LAPD or the District
Attorney's Office, whoever interviewed him, that Faye told him you told Faye
you were going to kill Nicole?

A:   I think I read that somewhere.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It doesn't matter.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You read that someplace?

A:   I'm sure I did.

Q:  Did you ever talk to Christian Reichardt  about his conversation with Faye
Resnick to that effect?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you know that he went on national television and said the same thing?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, do you know that he did so? Because my next question is going to
be: Did you talk  about it?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You just asked him if he talked about it, and it's
irrelevant and--

MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to jog his recollection.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's irrelevant, what he saw on television.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, but it might refresh his recollection as to whether he
talked with Reichardt about it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Did you talk to Reichardt? You can answer that.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  No?

A:   No.

Q:  No. We have to do a tape change right here.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Why don't we do a lunch change

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape  No. 1 of Volume VI. The

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Over the lunch break I refreshed my  memory a bit on this Toscana
incident, Mr. Simpson. Do you know a man named Alessandro?

A:   I met him, yes.

Q:  And did you see him at Toscana's the  evening you were there with
Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:  He walked into the restaurant and you spoke to him that evening?

A:   No.

Q:  Did he walk up to the table?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you have any words with him at all?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you threaten him?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you talk about him?

A:   Nicole did.

Q:  What did she say to you about him?

A:   I think they were talking about the whole table. Her and one of the other
girls was talking about something he had done at one of her parties.

Q:  That's the best you can recall?

A:   Yeah. They were unhappy with him. He  had done something at some
affair Nicole had at her house, and Nicole was very unhappy with it.

Q:  And you had no conflict with him that evening?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. Now, at the first or second  session of this deposition you
mentioned an incident  involving Nicole in January of 1994.

A:   Yes.

Q:  What was that incident?

A:   Nicole--they were leaving a bar, and I gather--I'm only saying what
Nicole told me--at some point Faye was serving or something, and when
Nicole was leaning over to ingest it, she ran into the car in front of her.

Q:  Oh, in the car Nicole was driving?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And Nicole leaned over to ingest some alcohol?

A:   No.

Q:  Was it drugs?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Cocaine?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And she smashed into the car?

A:   In front of her, yes.

Q:  And what car was Nicole driving?

A:   Her Ferrari.

Q:  And was the car damaged?

A:   Very bad.

Q:  How did you find out about this?

A:   Nicole called me.

Q:  That evening?

A:   I believe it was the next day. Within 24 hours we talked. I asked her how
she was doing, and she started crying. She thought she was gonna get in
trouble.

Q:  What happened to the car in front that it hit?

A:   I don't know. I don't know.

Q:  Did you take care of this situation for her?

A:   No. Her concern was they lied to the police, and she thought she'd get
caught.

Q:   Oh, she switched seats with Faye?

A:   No. When they got out and the police came, Nicole thought her license
was suspended, and she said she had been drinking, and Faye said she could
handle it and Faye claimed she was driving, and  Nicole thought that one of
the people when they left  would--I guess the police was talking to other
people when they drove off, when they left with the  tow truck, and Nicole
thought one of these people  would say that she was driving.

Q:  Did that ever happen?

A:   I don't think so. Faye had some lawyer  who evidently helped them out in
these type of things,  and Faye got this lawyer involved.

Q:  Did you have to pay for anything?

A:   No.

Q:  Who paid for the repair of the--

A:   I don't know--

Q:  --car?

A:   --Nicole's business. Probably her insurance.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. You got to wait until he finishes the question.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you ever aware of any tires on Nicole's cars being slashed or cut?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever hear about that?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know how much it cost on this  property damage to the other car?

A:   The other car, no. I know Nicole told me hers was--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you anything  about Nicole's car.

THE WITNESS: Okay. I don't know. I didn't  get involved. Other than
saying I would have dinner  with the lawyer, I didn't get involved.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And what about Nicole's car. How much was that?

A:   I believe she told me in the neighborhood of  $20,000.

Q:  And the insurance company paid for it?

A:   I believe so. yes.

Q:   And the drugs were never disclosed to the police to your knowledge?

A:   To my knowledge. no.

Q:  Faye said she had been drinking?

A:   I don't know what she said, but Nicole talked constantly about how Faye
was able to go through all the tests, and she said, "I could have never done
that."

Q:  Now. did you have any concern about this incident after it was related to
you?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And what was that?

A:   I was real upset with Nicole. She didn't  want anybody to know, and I--I
was very upset with  her.

Q:  What were you upset about? That she had  taken cocaine?

A:   Just the whole thing. It just seemed as if things were happening that
should not have been happening, and I was taking to her quite extensively
during this period of time about drinking.

Q:  Did she in your estimation cut down on the drinking thereafter?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean --

MR. PETROCELLI: After this incident.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. I know after, but for the whole period of time
until the murder

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, until her murder.

THE WITNESS: I don't think so, because I know it was a constant concern
that I mentioned to the Browns, Lou and Judy, from time to time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Even during your marriage, you mean?

A:   No. no. This is--all of this is after,  you know, after we had split.

Q:  And when--when you got back together  in, let's say, May of '93,
Mother's Day of '93,  thereabouts, did you start noticing this excessive
drinking?

A:   Almost immediately.

Q:  Also drug use, too?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever see Nicole during that period of time, May of '93 till You
broke up in the following year, use cocaine?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you know whether she was doing so other than this one incident in
January of '94?

A:   Other than what she told me.

Q:  And what was she telling you in this regard?

A:   Well, the '93 October 911 call, that's essentially one of the major things
that I was--I had found out that things were going on, and that was essentially
what I was yelling about.

Q:  But that wasn't about drug use by Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:  In what sense?

A:   In the sense that I was told that day  about them all doing drugs at a place
called the  Monkey Bar.

Q:   Other than that October 25, '93 incident  and the January car crash
incident, did Nicole relate to you any other incidents of drug use by her?

A:   No.

Q:  And you witnessed firsthand excessive drinking by her?

A:   What I thought was, yes.

Q:  And you talked to her about it?

A:   Well, you know, I didn't--I may have mentioned it to her--I did mention
it to her a few times, but I didn't want to be getting on her, so I talked to other
people in hopes they would talk to her.

Q:  And the other people were Judy and Lou Brown?

A:   And Faye Resnick, for that matter.

Q:  When did you talk to the Browns about this?

A:   I mentioned it numerous times: "Watch how much she's drinking. Watch
out the drinks that she takes."

Q:  And you mentioned it to them more than one occasion?

A:   Yes.

Q:  From May of '93 to May of '94?

A:   I can't say exactly May '93 to May of  '94--

Q:  Well, that's the period of your  reconciliation.

A:   Yeah. Within that time period. I don't  know when it started or when it
ended. I do know that  in my last few conversations with Judy, it was the--
my major focus on that and who she was running around with.

Q:  Okay. Let me ask you--well, first of all, what was their reaction to the
expressions of  your concern about Nicole's excessive drinking?

A:   Well, it was hard to have a reaction because--you'd have to ask them
what their reaction was.

Q:   In other words, did they agree with you? Did they say, "You're right,
O.J., but I can't do anything about it," or did they disagree with you. What
did they say?

A:   Well, because I kept saying, "Watch her when we go out." I mean, I
remember at Lou's--gave a party for Lou one night at a restaurant and I was
saying, "Watch how much she drinks."

Q:  Okay. Now, you talked about some of the  last conversations that you had
with Judy. When did those occur?

A:   The last?

Q :  Yeah.

A:   Basically with the concern was when I was  in Puerto Rico.

Q:  And again, the concern was you didn't know why Nicole was acting
strangely. Right?

A:   Nicole said she felt she was having a nervous breakdown, and she told
me that, and then Judy and I had conversations, and Judy had concerns also
when I was speaking to Judy.

Q:  Did you consider coming back from Puerto Rico--

A:   No.

Q:  --to address the problem?

A:   No.

Q:  Why not?

A:   Because I was working, and I was under a contract, and Nicole's an
adult.

Q:  Did you see if she could get some medical help?

A:   I asked her to. I kept telling her I  wanted her to go to therapy, and I
mentioned about her  drinking.

Q:  Did she say that one of the things that was stressing her out was you?

A:   At that time, no.

Q:  Her relationship with you?

A:   At that time, no.

Q:  Later on she tell you that?

A:   No.

Q:  You said "At that time." That suggests to me that some other time she told
you?

A:   Yes. When we split originally.

Q:  No, I am now talking about April '94 when you were in Puerto Rico and
she is telling you she's having a nervous breakdown.

A:   Yeah, she was just--I was just--from day to day she was--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is no question. He is just telling you where
his--directing your attention to.

MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And my question to you is whether in any of the conversations then or
thereafter about her  problem, this nervous breakdown problem, that there
was any concern expressed by her that you were the cause of this?

A:   No.

Q:  That it had something to do with you?

A:   No. She couldn't pinpoint what it was,  she said.

Q:  You mentioned Cora, and you mentioned  Faye and her concern with their
problems. Does anything else come to mind?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: "Anything else come to mind." Could you being
more expansive

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he understands what I mean.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I--No, don't answer that. That question is
very overbroad.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What I am trying to get you to tell me as expansively as possible is what
she told you was the cause, other than her concern over Cora and Faye,
which you yourself indicated shouldn't have led to this kind of problem

A:   The problem was she couldn't say. She didn't know. And when I would
say, "What's wrong," she couldn't say. "I don't know," is what she'd say.

Q:  Did you say, "Is it me?"

A:   Numerous times. I was the easiest  problem she had, because if she
didn't want to be with  me, I didn't want to be with her, you know, so I
wasn't a major problem for her.

Q:  But she said it was not you?

A:   She didn't say that. She said, "It's  just everything." She didn't know.
And that's when I  constantly tried to get her to go to therapy again.

Q:  She didn't know. So as far as you know, then, it might have concerned
you, but she didn't know. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  In other words, she didn't rule out the possibility that it concerned you. Is
that right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's--

THE WITNESS: She didn't know, so I don't know what she ruled in or out.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. She didn't know. Did you suggest any modification in your
relationship with her in order to alleviate the problem? This is in Puerto Rico.

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. Now going back to Judy, you last  spoke to Judy when?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Not at the recital. Beforehand?

A:   I don't know. Beginning of May, I would  say.

Q:  And you said the major focus was on  Nicole's problems?

A:   Yeah. Nicole and that we were going our separate ways and Nicole.
What--I thought she needed to get back to therapy and stop drinking and stop
running around with who she was running around with.

Q:  And what did Judy say to you?

A:   Judy didn't like who she was running around with either.

Q:  You mean girlfriends?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Faye Resnick?

A:   Ask Judy.

Q:  Who did you mean?

A:   I just meant everything. I didn't know who she was running around with.
I didn't know really who she was running around with, so I didn't know. I
just knew the whole scene wasn't a positive scene, and  from what I can
gather, it was the same scene that she  was in when she came back to me and
told me she hated  what was going on in her life. So from what I was--
gathered. she was going to the same places and hanging  around the same
people.

Q:  Now, did Judy Brown tell you that she  agreed or disagreed with what
you were saying?

A:   She agreed something was wrong because  she had some--some--she
couldn't get anything out of Nicole. I guess--yeah, Judy was concerned. You
got to ask Judy. Judy was concerned.

Q:  Did Judy tell you that she also was trying to find out from Nicole what the
problem was?

A:   She said she wouldn't talk. I think Nicole hung up on her at one time,
and Judy at one point while I was in Puerto Rico, the last week I was in
Puerto Rico, made a comment to the effect that she had spoken to Nicole one
day, and the next day Nicole was attributing things to Judy that Judy hadn't
said the day before. Something in that vein.

Q:  Did there come a time when you perceived that Nicole stopped acting in
this sort of irrational way you're describing?

A:   You have to ask that again. I don't  quite understand it.

Q:  From the time that you first started  experiencing these problems with her
behavior while I  you were in Puerto Rico--

A:   Yeah.

Q:  --beginning with that time, did there  come a time when you saw that there
had been  improvement and that she had stopped exhibiting these  problems?

A:   From the time I got home, everything seemed--even before I came home,
she called. I mean, we talked and she apologized for the way she was acting.
She picked me up at the airport. She seemed totally normal. The following
Sunday, which was the night before Mother's Day, she in front of me almost
had a nervous breakdown. I mean, she was, "Look at me,' she was saying,
and that was when I basically said, "This is not gonna work."

Q:  And from that point on did you observe that her behavior, whether it was-
-

A:   I didn't see--

Q:  --whether it was problematic--

A:   I saw her that week at dinner once or twice. I talked to her, because now
we weren't  together, so I could talk to her more fully about it,  and I talked to
her a lot about it the following week  when she called me when she had
double pneumonia, and  I used that as a,  "See See, I told you so. Whatever
you're doing, you got to stop doing."

Q:  And from that point on she seemed okay to  you?

A:   I didn't hardly--I didn't see her much  from that point on. Until she called
me in--later  in the month yelling at me, she seemed like Nicole, the times that
I saw her.

Q:  Seemed like she--in other words, she was okay?

A:   Yeah. We--we--yeah, she was okay, yeah.

Q:  Now, tell me about this incident and you mentioned it on your videotape,
when Nicole called you and was very upset with you because Faye Resnick
was going to an affair. What was the affair?

A:   It was going to be the Cedars Child-- you know, it was a big affair that
they have at Cedars Hospital, raise money for the birth defects. I was one of
the, you know, founders of it, and I was the guy who was in charge of
getting all athletes at its inception, and we may have been going into the
eighth,  ninth, tenth year, and so that was the affair.

Q:  And describe the argument you had with Nicole.

A:   It wasn't really an argument. She called  me and just started yelling at me.

Q:   For no reason?

A:   I felt for no reason.

Q:  What did she say?

A:   To stay away from her f---ing friends. And  I said, "What are you talking
about." And she said, "You invited Faye and Christian to this thing, and I
don't want you"--"I don't want you hanging around my friends." And I said,
"I didn't invite Faye anywhere. Faye invited herself." And she says, "But I
don't want you  hanging around my friends." And I think I said to her, "What
are you talking about. I never told you who to hang around with. You"--and I
may have made--I don't know what I said. But in any event, she hung up,
and then I called Christian and Faye.

Q:  Did you go to the event?

A:   I was in jail.

Q:   Oh, this was an event scheduled for later  in June?

A:   Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Had you made plans with Christian and  Faye?

A:   I had invited--See, the previous  year--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Go ahead. You know.

THE WITNESS: I had made plans with Christian,  and Faye wanted to know
why she wasn't invited and  gave a good reason why she wanted to go, and I
said, "Well, sure, I don't have a problem with it."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  What was the reason?

A:   That she--"We don't take sides. We love you. We love Nicole. I want to
get to know Paula. I want to get to know whoever Nicole goes out  with.
When our friends split up, we don't take sides, which has always been my
attitude." That is what she said to me.

Q:  And you had no problem with that. Right?

A:   No. I mean, I didn't invite her or Cora because I was going to be with
Paula.

Q:  So the way you left it then--

A:   Was fine.

Q:  --is fine. You were going to go with Paula,  Christian and Faye, and was
Cora going with Ron  Fishman?

A:   No. Ron and his son was going, and I had  to fill up my table. It was a
table of 12.

Q:  But Nicole wasn't included. Right?

A:   Nicole and I wasn't dating. No, I was dating Paula.

Q:  What is the date of this conversation with Nicole?

A:   I don't know. It was after the 22nd but I believe before the end of the
month. So it's sometime--sometime in the latter part of May.

Q:  Is this the last argument you had with her?

A:   I believe it was, yeah. Yeah, it was the last--other than tickets and stuff, it
was the last, yeah.

Q:  Did you call her back?

A:   I don't think it was--I tried to call her back, but she had her phone off the
hook, and I left a message for her.

Q:  Where?

A:   The next day.

Q:   Oh, on her machine?

A:   Yes.

Q:  What was your message?

A:   Told her I thought she was totally out of  line. I told her that we had--I
said, "We split up. We went our separate ways. I was there for you when
you were sick. I thought everything was going good. You are totally out of
line, what you did. You need  to talk to your friend Faye." And I said, "You
need  to look at your own actions when you and I were split  before. You
went a little further than just invited my friends out," and that was it.

Q:  You mean she had romantic relations with your friends.?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did she ever respond to that message, Mr. Simpson?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. Now, you testified earlier on in the deposition that you had a dinner
with her and Sydney and Justin at Bundy around the 24th of May.

A:   Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Do you recall that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Was this argument with Nicole before or after that dinner?

A:   After.

Q:   It was after?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, after you took care of Nicole  when she had was it double
pneumonia?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Was there some still hope in your mind  that maybe things would work
out?

A:   No.

Q:  You were just doing it to get her better. Right?

A:   We--yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Weren't you delivering roses to the house?

A:   On her birthday I might have, but I don't think so. I think I brought her a
cake and a cigarette lighter.

Q:  Did you have any flowers sent to the house?

A:   I did on the--I may have on the 27th, so it would have been a little after
the--I may have--oh, no. I may have on the 24th or the 27th. I may have.

Q:  For what purpose?

A:   That was what I and her always--No, I  didn't. I didn't. That would have
been the next  month I was gonna do that, so I don't think I did.

Q:  What was the purpose that you--

A:   Unless Sydney was graduating or something, yeah.

Q:  What was the purpose for which you would exchange flowers that time of
year?

A:   That's when we first met, and it would  have been June 27. I brought
flowers to her when she had a pneumonia. I know that.

Q:  Once?

A:   I believe so, but . . . You know.

Q:  Was there any expression by you to her that you wanted to get back
together?

A:   No. The minute I started dating Paula, that was that.

Q:  When you saw her at the airport that night.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Did you give Nicole any gifts during the month of May other than the
cigarette lighter and the bracelet?

A:   No.

Q:  You brought her no gifts?

A:   No.

Q:  When Nicole returned the bracelet, she also returned some earrings.

A:   No. I asked for the earrings.

Q:  Why did you ask for them back?

A:   Because she kept the check.

Q:  What check?

A:   The insurance check.

Q:  Why was there an insurance check?

A:   Because she somehow lost these earrings  that I had made for her before,
and when the insurance check came, I signed it, and we sent it to her, and I--
we were replacing the earrings, and evidently when the guy delivered the
earrings to her, she never gave him the money; and for some reason my
office, when the guy billed my office, they sent a check, so she couldn't keep
the earrings and the check.

Q:  How much was the check?

A:   I think the check was a little less than what the earrings cost, so the check
may have been $7,500, $8,000.

Q:  How did you get the earrings back?

A:   I asked for them.

Q:  And did you pick them up in person?

A:   We were discussing some things at her house, and it was when she
brought up the fact that  she didn't think I bought these--this bracelet for  her
and--

Q:  How did she figure that out?

A:   Because it didn't go with anything I've  ever bought her, and it was kind
of out of the blue. And during that conversation she mentioned how she's
gotten used to the TV in the bedroom; she wasn't a big  person on that, and
wanted to know could she keep the  TV I had bought for me in the bedroom
that had the  earphones on it, because I watch TV throughout the night, and a
few other items, and I said, "Since we're making up, you owe me X amount
of dollars." And she didn't have it and she gave me the earrings. She said,
"Well, you have to take the earrings because I don't have the money."

Q:  Do you know why she didn't have the money?

A:   I don't know. I know she was having some--at that particular time she
had loaned some family--from what she said, she had loaned some family
members some money, and--I don't know. Outside of that, I don't know.

Q:  How much had she loaned?

A:   I don't know. I thought she said 10,000 or something to--

Q:  To whom?

A:   I believe she said Lou.

Q:  So, she said she was short on money?

A:   She didn't say that. She was just --I  know money was a--came up in the
conversation  because she didn't have the money to pay me, to give  me the
money back for the check.

Q:  Okay. Now, did she give you the earrings  back the same time she gave
you the bracelet back?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And was that on this 24th when you were over there for dinner?

A:   Yeah. I believe it may have been earlier than that. It may have been the 2--
it may have been on the 22nd. I believe it was like on-- whenever I got--I
think it was--I'm not a hundred percent sure of this, but I think it was like on
the 22nd. I think it was the night of the picnic at my house. But it could have
been a day after or something, because I don't believe--

Q:  Was she upset with you when she returned the bracelet and the earrings?

A:   No. She was--she--It had bothered her because she really, really loved
the earrings, so that bothered her, but I was gonna give them back to  her
anyway, so...

Q:   You were planning to give them back?

A:   Yes.

Q:  At what point?

A:   The next month when our anniversary had  come.

Q:  Why didn't you let her keep them at the time?

A:   Well, because then I wouldn't have to buy  her anything at our
anniversary.

Q:  Did you buy her a present for your anniversary in 1992 when you were
split up in June and you had already met Paula?

A:   I think I gave her--I sent her flowers for sure, and I think what--I'm sure
I sent her something. Not what--something, maybe a Swiss Army watch or
something. I'm not a--but I know I sent her something. I know that
specifically.

Q:  Were you embarrassed or shamed at all about the breakup of your
relationship again?

A:   Shamed and embarrassed?

Q:  Yeah.

A:   No. No. You know what it was, it was a relief, because I felt I was
working too hard.

Q:  At the relationship?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:  So you felt no sense of public embarrassments?

A:   Not at all.

Q:  Humiliation?

A:   No.

Q:  Shame?

A:   No. That's why I think I was happy --I  was happy to move on.

Q:  And were you--

A:   And I was proud of the fact that we seemed to be getting along despite it.
You know, anyone who saw us together knows next two, three-- two weeks
at least, almost three weeks, saw two people who really got along, and even
though they had split, really got along.

Q:  Did you tell any of your close friends that you were going to break up
with Nicole at or around the time that you did?

A:   No, but all of my close friends knew I had.

Q:  They did?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  After the fact, you mean?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  You mean you told them that you had broken up with Nicole?

A:   I told them it was--yeah, because they saw Paula.

Q:  Did you tell them that you had left her or she had left you?

A:   That we split up, you know.

Q:  Did you tell them the circumstances?

A:   It was none of their business.

Q:  Did you tell them the reasons?

A:   I think some of my close friends knew already because I just--

Q:  Who would they be?

A:   Allen Austin would have known because I'm sure I talked about it with
Allen Austin.

Q:  Anyone else?

A:   I don't know. It's not something--you know, my close friends are--it's
not something you talk about. You play golf, but on a golf course, you know,
everybody talks about whatever they talk about.

Q:   Did you tell Cowlings this, too?

A:    You know, you got to understand, I didn't see a lot of A.C. but
possibly. Cathy Randa, for sure. Arnelle for sure, but it was somewhat
abrupt.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: OJ., you don't owe him an  explanation.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Just answer his questions.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  The breakup was abrupt. That's what  you're saying. Right?

A:   Somewhat. Somewhat, yeah.

Q:  By the time of Nicole's death, did all of  your close friends and family
know that you had split  up with her?

A:   Yes.

Q:  You had already told your mother and your sisters?

A:   I don't know if I specifically called  them to say it. I don't know if I ever
thought of that, but anybody around me, yes.

Q:  Did you know whether Nicole ever did see a therapist?

A:   Don't believe so.

Q:  She told you she wouldn't. Right?

A:   She didn't want to. She thought it was a waste of time.

Q:  Okay. Do you know if she saw a therapist named Jennifer Ameli?

A:   No.

Q:  Ameli?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever hear of her? A-m-e-l-i

A:   Last night.

Q:  How did you hear about her last night?

A:   I think GERALDO. Somebody told me some girl was on GERALDO
saying something.

Q:  Was that the first time you've heard that  name?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  You ever go to Jennifer Ameli's office on any occasion?

A:   Not to see Jennifer Ameli, no. I wouldn't know where her office is.

Q:  Did you ever confront Nicole in late May or early June before her death in
front of her therapist's office?

A:   I didn't know she had a therapist.

Q:  In front of an office building?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever confront her and another gentleman with her in her Ferrari in
late May, early June?

A:   I never saw her with another gentleman in her Ferrari then.

Q:  Or any other vehicle?

A:   No, never.

Q:  Did you ever stop to talk to Nicole in  late May, early June before her
death while she was in  her car?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever call her over while she was in her car?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever confront her in a parking lot anywhere?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you think this Jennifer Ameli's a fraud?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you have any knowledge of that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: I don't know

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. Was Nicole afraid of you?

A:   I don't believe so, no.

Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that she was afraid of you?

A:   No.

Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that she had fear of you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What's the difference? Don't answer that. You
answered the  question already.

MR. PETROCELLI: You know, it's not appropriate  to instruct him just
because I asked him a second  question that may be similar or the same as the
first  question.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You know, I've never read "Petrocelli On Evidence"
or "Deposition Objections."

MR. PETROCELLI: Probably never will either, Mr. Baker.

MR. BREWER: Good book.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'll bet it's the shortest book I could ever read, too.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's only shorter than yours.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You sound like Marcia Clark.

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, I'm not going to say anything about that. I don't
want my comments to be misconstrued either way.

Q:  Anyway, she ever tell you that she was afraid of you?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever discuss that subject with her?

A:   No.

Q:  Did she--did you ever sense that she  was afraid of you?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever sense that she felt terror  as a result of--

A:   No.

Q:  --your conduct?

A:   No.

Q:  Not even in the 911 call on October 25 when you heard her voice?

A:   I didn't hear her voice. I didn't know she was on the phone with the
police.

Q:  You heard it in court, though. Right?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  And did you sense terror in her voice?

A:   If I was on the other end of that line, it would have sounded that way to
me, yes.

Q:  Did that surprise you when you heard that?

A:   In light of the fact that she left the room and came down with me--to be in
the room with me, yes, because I knew she wasn't afraid.

Q:  Why do you suppose she expressed terror  in her voice if she wasn't
afraid?

A:   You want me to speculate?

Q:  I want you to tell me what you think,  Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think his state of mind is  irrelevant relative to that
issue.


MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think so. Let the  trial judge decide.

Q:  You may answer.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He will when you make the motion. Don't answer
it.

MR. PETROCELLI: What was my question
Q:  I would like to know if you have any  understanding as to why she
expressed terror in that phone call--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  --if you believe she didn't have any?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: His opinions and asking him to speculate.

MR. PETROCELLI: He may have a current understanding that's not based on
speculation. It's based on some information.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, he is not going to  answer that question. You
are not going to argue the  case through your argumentative questions.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you think that she was trying to trick  the person that she called?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know if Nicole kept any diary in  May or June of '94?

A:   Not that I know of.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let the record reflect that for the about the fourth
time, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Petrocelli are whispering to each other.

MR. KELLY: I think it's the first time,

MR. ROBERT BAKER: First time after lunch, I would agree with that.

MR. PETROCELLI: In the words of Phil Baker, you don't have to give him
an explanation.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Mr. Kelly, you've never provided us with those
documents, have you, and I believe those were the subject of special
interrogatories, were they not

MR. KELLY: I don't think so, but I will check.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You never provided us with anything. No
responses.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nor have you.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I've provided you with a lot  of objections, the same
as you've provided me with.

MR. PETROCELLI: With only objections.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's all you've ever  provided me with. But a lot
of them; I admit that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Did you want to say  something to me John

MR. KELLY: I dare not, especially in the mike here, or Mr. Baker will be all
over me.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Not at all.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are these her supposed letters or her supposed diary

MR. PETROCELLI: We will find out what they are.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Well, if we are being denied access to these diaries
because of failure to respond to discovery, I don't think it's proper.

MR. PETROCELLI: These are documents that you have. You got them from
the same place I have them. Okay

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Where is that?

MR. PETROCELLI: The murder book.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: And what are they?

MR. PETROCELLI: They are documents in the  murder book. That's all.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You won't describe them,  but you are telling me
that I have them.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not going to debate this  now. I am going to try and
ask some questions. You still haven't responded to my  numerous requests to
have Mr. Simpson produce  documents here.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I haven't gotten responses from your side either,
Mr. Petrocelli.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Mr. Simpson, did you speak to Nicole on June 3, 1994? Do you recall?

A:   I don't recall.

Q: Do you recall coming to pick up the kids at Bundy around 8:30 in the
evening?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And the children wanted to stay with Nicole because she had let them
organize sleepovers at the last minute.?

A:   I don't know what the children wanted. Nicole just told me that she had
just organized something for the kids.

Q:  Did she tell you that she would drop them  off first thing in the morning

A:   She might have.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you don't recall, tell him you don't recall.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall. I don't recall.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, you went there to pick up the  kids. Did you leave with the kids?

A:   No.

Q:  And then you went home. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you get the kids the next day?

A:   At some point, yes.

Q:  Okay. How did you get them?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:  Now, the evening before had you had an argument with Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:  Is that the night that she called you about going out with her friends June
2?

A:   What do you mean, "going out with her friends'

Q:  Remember before you told me about a conversation where she was upset
with you--

A:   No, no. This was--

Q:  --because you were going out with Faye  Resnick and Christian
Reichardt?

A:   No. This is before then.

Q:  Excuse me?

A:   This is before then.

Q:  The Christian Reichardt-Faye Resnick  situation occurred later. Is that
what you're saying?

A:   Before. Before this.

Q:  Before June 3?

A:   I believe so, yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, did you hang up did she hang up on you on the evening of
June 2?

A:   I don't recall talking to her on June 2.

Q:  Anywhere near June 2 she hang up on you?

A:   I don't believe I had talked to her. I don't--I think I had cut off
communications before then.

Q:  Did you say to her when you came to see her on June 3 at 8:30 p.m. to
pick up the kids, "You hung up on me last night." Did you say that to her?

A:   No.

Q:  "You're gonna pay for this, bitch."

A:   No.

Q:  "You're holding money from the IRS."

A:   No.

Q:  "You're going to jail, you f-----g c--t."

A:   No.

Q:  "You think you can do any freaking  thing," or something like that, "You
want.

A:   No.

Q:  "You've got it coming."

A:   No.

Q:  "I've already talked to my lawyers about  this, bitch." Did you say any of
those things to her?

A:   No.

Q:  "They'll get you for tax evasion, bitch. I'll see to it."

A:   No.

Q:  "You're not going to have a f-----g dime left, bitch."

A:   No.

Q:  You said none of those things?

A:   None of those things.

Q:  Do you know whether Sydney had a girlfriend with her at the house when
you went over to pick up the children?

A:   I believe a family had just arrived.

Q:  Okay. And do you remember the name--of  Sydney's friend?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know the names of any of her  friends around this time?

A:   Yeah. The normal friends, yeah.

Q:  What about Allegra? Does that ring a  bell

A:   No. But I do know for the period of time  I was there, they were all just
outside walking in.

Q:  When you were leaving

A:   Yeah, when I drove up and when I left.

Q:  They were outside the whole time?

A:   Yeah. They were walking in, and she said, "A friend's here."

Q:  Did you meet the friend's parents?

A:   No.

Q:The next day do you know whether Nicole came over to return the children
to you, but you were not home? Did you learn about that?

A:   I don't know.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: -- "Return the children to [him]?" I don'tt know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Bring the children to you?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Do you recall whether on the weekend  before June 3 around May 28,
1994, you told Nicole  that you could not take the kids that weekend?

A:   I--possibly. I don't know.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you don't recall--

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you tell Nicole that even though you  were in town over the weekend
--

A:   I don't think I was in town that weekend.

Q:  On May 22 did Nicole tell you that she was officially splitting up with
you?

A:   No. We had already split up.

Q:  Did she tell you on May 22, which is a Sunday, that you and she were
going back to every other weekend?

A:  No, I don't recall that at all.

Q:  Okay. Did she say that she needed rest and that you were gone too much?

A:   On 22? No. I think she was more into me, but I was not amenable.

Q:  Were you gone the last four weekends prior to May 22; out of town, that
is?


A:   I don't--I may have been. But I hosted--no. I may--I'm not --

MR. PETROCELLI: Is that a calendar, Mr. Baker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, it's a calendar.You  can check it out if you
want.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would like to.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: See, it says "May 1994." You can put up any date
you want on them.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's pretty good.

THE WITNESS: Does it say that?

MR. PETROCELLI: My respect for you is growing  by the minute. I'm
impressed.

MR. KELLY: There are no answers on that, are there?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm typing them in.

MR. LEONARD: The question is--

MR. PETROCELLI: It says, "Don't answer that."

THE WITNESS: It would be difficult because two of those four weekends--

MR. KELLY: "I don't remember."

THE WITNESS: It would be difficult to be away those previous four
weekends because two of those four weekends I spent with Nicole and the
kids. One of those four weekends, the weekend--two weekends before that I
spent with Lou Brown, Nicole and the kids, and the weekend before that was
the weekend I returned from Puerto Rico and I spent with Nicole and  the
kids. So it couldn't have been. That's  impossible.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, let me hand you out a document and  ask you if you know anything
about it.

A:   What am I supposed to--

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me mark this as Exhibit  86.

THE WITNESS: Okay. So the answer is no.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is no --

THE WITNESS: --no, I wasn't out of town the four previous weekends,
unless you count being in Laguna with Nicole and the kids out of town one of
those weekends.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Can you mark that as the next exhibit in order.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 86 was marked for identification by the reporter and
attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Mr. Simpson, do you recognize this handwriting on Exhibit 86?

A:   Not really, but--not really.

Q:  Does it appear to be Nicole's handwriting?

A:   I don't really recognize it to be, but it  could be.

Q:  Could you turn the pages?

A:   Uh-huh. To what page?

Q:  Just flip the pages and see if you  believe this is in Nicole's handwriting.

A:   It looks a lot like her handwriting, yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, do you know whether she was  keeping notes of events in
her life--

A:   No.

Q:  --during this period of time?

A:   No.

Q:  May of '94?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know why she would write down the things that I just read you
on a piece of paper?

A:  Inaccurately. No.

Q:  Yeah. Why she would write them down if they were false?

A:   Well, they're obviously--when you mentioned those four weekends out
of town, that's false, so I have no idea.

Q:  But all the other things that I read to you were false also. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  All of the vile things that she  attributed to you?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And do you have any--any understanding  as to why Nicole Brown in or
about June 3 of 1994  would be writing down such things about you that
were  untrue?

A:   I have no idea.

Q:  Did you ever know her to do something  like that in the past?

A:   I knew she would say things, because as I mentioned, Judy and I had that
conversation before I left Puerto Rico, that were not true. I wasn't aware of
any of her writings at that time.

Q:  What do you mean, "Judy and I had that conversation before I left Puerto
Rico, that were not true?" I didn't follow our last answer.

A:   As I said to you earlier, Judy made a comment in one week when I was in
Puerto Rico that she had spoke to Nicole one day and, O.J.--the next day she
spoke to her, Nicole attributed things to Judy that Judy had not said in the
previous conversation the day before.

Q:  I see. Did you know Nicole to have a very vivid imagination?

A:   She was great with the kids, so, yeah,  she was good. She was good at
making up games and,  you know, writing stories with the kids. So, yes, she
was pretty good at that.

Q:  And had she ever to your knowledge made  up things about you in the
past?

A:   Yes.

Q:  You mentioned earlier in your deposition  that she did so in connection
with the divorce  proceeding to get you to tear up the prenuptial. Right?

A:   That's correct.

Q:  And though you also said you didn't see anything that she wrote--

A:   No.

Q:  --she just told you that they had told her to say things. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Other than that incident, did you know her to make up things about you
that were not true?

A:   In what context? I don't--

Q:  In any context.

A:   We--in any context.

Q:  Yeah.

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:  When?

A:   Often when you have an argument and the  next time you talk, she'd say,
"You said this."  And I said, "That's not what I said."  "You said this."  I
mean, you know, like most  relationships, I would imagine.

Q:  But you would do the same thing. Right?

A:  She would say the same thing to me that I  would say to her.

Q:  All right. So in other words, you didn't view that as unusual or abnormal,
did you?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. But in terms of what I just showed you, you would view that as
highly unusual. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you don't have to -- characterize it any way
you want.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you think that--is this ordinary behavior for Nicole, as you know her
for 17 years, to write things like this about you of this nature that are
completely false?

A:   Her--all her actions were unusual and un--and not like the Nicole I knew
in the last few years of her life. Many of them were, and that's why  I had a
concern,and I expressed those concerns to  both Judy Brown and Lou
Brown.

Q:  Well, the only thing you've said so far that you expressed to Judy and
Lou Brown were drinking.

A:   Yes.

Q:  What--did you express anything else to  them about her highly unusual
behavior over the last  couple of years of her life?

A:   Yes. The choice of people that she ran around with. Some of the things
that transpired during that period of time, yes, I expressed my concerns about
those things.

(Fredric Goldman enters the deposition.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you think Nicole was mentally ill in May of 1994?

A:   No. I'll use her words: She seemed to be lost.

Q:  Okay. But at no time did you attempt to get the children taken away from
her. Right?

A:   No. She's a great mother. Great mother at all times.

Q:   And you thought at all times that she was emotionally and mentally fit to
care for the children. Right?

A:   Very much so.

Q:  Up to the last day of her life. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  It is true you were having a dispute with  her about the IRS at this time?

A:   No.

Q:  That's not true either?

A:   No. I just wanted her to change addresses.

Q:  Have you ever seen this document before?

A:   I believe I may have.

Q:  When?

A:   When I was in jail.

Q:  How did you first come across it?

A:   I don't know. I think they just brought all kinda discovery in, and I don't
recall specifically seeing this, but it doesn't seem unusual to me to see this at
this point.

Q:  And when you--after you saw it, did you talk to anybody other than
lawyers about it?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why not? I asked him other than lawyers.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh, I apologize.

MR. KELLY: We ask the tough questions when  you're talking to Mr.
Leonard..

THE WITNESS: Yeah. I don't--I know I didn't  talk to anybody. If I talked
to my lawyers about  these things specifically, they'd have been the only
people I talked to about it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  For example, Cora Fishman, have you ever  spoken to her about why
Nicole was writing stuff like this --

A:   No.

Q:  --the last month of her life?

A:   No.

Q:   Or Christian?

A:   No.

Q:  Are you curious to know?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   On the weekend of May 28th--you can look at Mr. Baker's electronic
calendar--Nicole writes in here that you said you couldn't take the kids that
weekend, but they did spend the night Friday and Monday with you. Is that
true?

A:   No. Another inaccuracy in these  letters. Another non-truth. I should say,
in these  letters.

Q:  Okay. It is not true that the kids spent  the night Friday and then again
Monday on Memorial  Day?

A:   That's correct.

Q:  And you were in Palm Springs?

A:   That's correct.

Q:  Were the children with you?

A:   No.

Q:  Not at all on that trip?

A:   No.

Q:  On Saturday and Sunday Nicole says that they were--the children were
with her. Was that true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, it says in the document, Exhibit 86--

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, that's what I mean, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is that true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can't get your foundation from your own
questions, Mr. Petrocelli.

THE WITNESS: Pardon me

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I--

MR. PETROCELLI: I can try.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I've been overruled. You  can.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were the children with Nicole on Saturday and Sunday?

A:   I was out of town. I have no idea where they were.

Q:  Do you know from when you saw them again that they saw THE
FLINTSTONES and went to play miniature golf?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know whether you had the children the weekend before Memorial
Day weekend?

A:   Certainly--certainly for Sunday, I certainly had them. Wait. Let me--yeah,
certainly Sunday. I don't recall if--certainly Sunday, I know. I don't think I
was in town Friday or Saturday.

Q:  Okay. Can you turn the page?

A:   Which page?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I assume we are going to the--

THE WITNESS: Which page?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --to June 4th

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

Q:  The last page, Mr. Simpson, June 4th. This is Exhibit 86. Did the
children get to your house around  1:00 p.m. on June 4? What is that, Mr.
Baker, Saturday?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It is.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Saturday.

A:   That--they could have, yes.

Q:  Did they spend the evening with you on June 4?

A:   They could have. I'm not sure.

Q:  Why are you not sure?

A:   Because I'm not sure. I knew they were with me on Sunday the 5th, and
some parts of me feel that Nicole brought them over Sunday, the 5th. Matter
of fact, I'm almost a hundred percent sure she did because Justin had dirtied
up his clothes, and Paula took him to Rudnick's or someplace to get him new
clothes to go to an affair with us.

Q:  When did you go to that affair?

A:   That Sunday, the 5th.

Q:  That was the Pediatric AIDS event?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And then you and the kids and Kato and his daughter went out to dinner at
Sizzler?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Is that Sunday evening?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Could you turn back now to two pages earlier? Do you see the
entry where it says  "Friday, April 30?" Mr. Baker, is that--April 30, 1994, is
that a Friday?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Saturday, according to this.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know if you had the weekends--do you know whether you picked
up the kids for the weekend from school the last weekend in April?

A:   I don't think so. I think Nicole and I -- Nicole and I were -- I think --
April what. Show me. Is this April

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, that's April of '94. The 30th is a Saturday,
not a Friday.

MR. PETROCELLI: She might be referring to '93 here.

Q:  Does that ring a bell

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Very good.

THE WITNESS: What, '93

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Yeah. I'm trying to--

A:   I don't know. '93, I don't know what I was doing in April of '93.

Q:  Well, did you take the kids to Vegas on a  trip in 1993?

A:   Yes. Yes. But I think that wasn't April  30th.

Q:  April 2?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That was 1993. Correct?

A:   That was 1993.

Q:  And was Paula on that trip with you?

A:   Paula met us there.

Q:   Okay. And you went with the two kids, and Paula met you there. Right?

A:   Two kids and Arnelle, and Paula met us there.

Q:  Okay. Can you turn to Page 1879, which is two pages before? Okay. In
the first part of this document there is an entry about you picked up the kids
for Justin's "1st Wednesday visitation." Do you know what that refers to?

A:   At the top of the thing?

Q:  Yeah.

A:   I think once I got back from--Yes, I do  know what that refers to.

Q:  What does that refer to?

A:   I think once I got back from Buffalo--I  mean from New York that year--

Q:  What year?

A:   This would have been '93.

Q:  Okay.

A:   --I--we made out in arrangement that every other weekend I would get the
kids, and I had the option on Wednesdays to take them from 4:00 o'clock to
8:00 o'clock or something like that.

Q:  And again, this is before you attempted your reconciliation. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And it says below the first entry, "He will take the kids Friday noon to
P.S." What does that mean? Do you know?

A:   I'm sure it's Palm Springs.

Q:  Did you used to have Cathy Randa pick up the kids?

A:   I think she may have once or twice.

Q:  Okay. Did that bother Nicole?


A:   I don't know. She never said anything to  me.

Q:   And A.C., did he used to pick up the  children, too?

A:   Not from school. Not normally from  school.

Q:  From Nicole's house?

A:   During this period of time I was avoiding  Nicole. I don't think so. I
think--I know he  brought them to Palm Springs, as this said, for me, because
I was already there, but other than that I don't really recall A.C. picking--not
for me, anyway, Picking the kids up from school. I'm sure he did for her
once or twice.

Q:  Do you recall cancelling the pick-up of the children on March 10
mentioned in the last entry here?

A:   I don't recall, but if I was out of town, I would have had to cancel, yes.
This March 10, what day is this?

Q:   1993.

A:   Yeah, if I wasn't in town, I probably did.

Q:   Now go back down to the bottom of the next page, 1880.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  The entry at the end says, "The rest of  1993 were spent either with me or
as family weekends,  hours or days. O.J. and I got back together starting
April 12, 1993."  Was that correct, that you got back  together?

A:   No. That's what she wanted but, as I  told you, that's when she had a
little problem that I  wouldn't commit.

Q:  Was--did you go to Cabo in April of '93?

A:   We had got back from Cabo, and she assumed that that got us back
together, and I told her it didn't.

Q:   Okay. Earlier today I was asking you about injuries that Nicole sustained
and for which she received medical treatment, and you told me about
Cowlings taking her to St. John's on April 1,1989.

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  Do you know of any other instances when Nicole --

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Did he say April 1?

MR. PETROCELLI: January 1--excuse me-- 1989.

Q:  Do you know of any other instances when  Nicole was treated for
injuries?

A:   Well, one other incident that, once  again, I insisted she go in case there
was an injury,  but there wasn't. So there was nothing to treat.

Q:  Was that when she fell off a bicycle?

A:   That's what she told me, yes.

Q:  Okay. And those are the only two times  that you know of when Nicole
was treated for injuries?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. Do you know whether she ever suffered any injuries while she was
pregnant?

A:   No, I don't know of any injuries she ever suffered while she was
pregnant.

Q:  Did you have an argument with her about her first pregnancy, with
Sydney, as to whether or not she should have the baby?

A:   No. I only got married to have kids.

Q:   And you had no such argument with respect to her second pregnancy,
with Justin?

A:   None at all.

Q:   When she was pregnant with Sydney, was she supposed to have twins?

A:    I think she told me that she lost one of the--that she could have had
twins, but one of the  sacs didn't go, something, early on.

Q:  Early on in the pregnancy?

A:   Yes.

Q:  To your knowledge the fetus had not grown  full term?

A:   I think from the time she officially knew  she was pregnant that had
already happened, from what  she says.

Q:  What had already happened?

A:   That it could have been, but one of them didn't hold or something.

Q:  Was a second twin born stillborn? Do you know?

A:   No. I'm saying even before she knew officially she was pregnant
whatever happened had happened--

Q:  Already.

A:   Yeah.

Q:   So she only carried one fetus?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   Were you in the delivery room with her for Sydney?

A:   I believe so, yes.

Q:   And for Justin?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you have an argument with Nicole about whether you should be in the
delivery room for  Justin?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Relate that.

A:   She said I made her too nervous when she  was in the delivery room with
Sydney, that I was too  nervous or something, and--but I still did it. My first
wife told me the same thing.

Q:  When she was--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you what your first wife told you.
Jesus. Right here, look at the color, O.J. It's because of you.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   When she was pregnant with Sydney, did you tell her that you believed
she had gained too much weight?

A:   No.

Q:  And you never berated her physical appearance?

A:   No.

Q:  Same with Justin?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Have you ever heard that Nicole complained about you calling her fat
during her  pregnancies?

A:   After all of this had happened I heard  it. Yes

Q:  How did you hear that?

A:   I think I read it somewhere.

Q:   In her own handwritings?

A:   No. It may have been in a magazine or a  news--some of the coverage of
the trial.

Q:  But it wasn't true. Right?

A:   That's correct.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Damn, I heard on the news that both of these guys
are going to examine today, so you've got to hurry up.

MR. PETROCELLI: You did?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah.

MR. BREWER: That's a bombshell.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's a bombshell.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You have the best lines of these.

MR. PETROCELLI: He saves them. but they're good.

Q:  How many times did Nicole hit you in your relationship?

A:   I'd be guessing.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He doesn't want you to  guess.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   So give me your best estimate.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you have a best estimate.

THE WITNESS: Five or six.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Was one of these the '89 incident?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. You've already talked about that. What were the other incidents?

A:   I--two or three of them were after '89. I believe I documented those. And
I think at some point early in our relationship. When I say "early," before we
got married.

Q:  What do you mean, you "documented those?"

A:   I would call Cathy whenever something happened and tell her to write it
down and put it in a file, because that was recommended to me by some
police officer.

Q:  When--Who was the police officer?

A:   I don't recall, but it was around-- somehow around the '89 thing.

Q:  Where are those documents?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Have you ever seen them?

A:   I haven't seen them--I hadn't seen them  since all this happened, but I'm
pretty sure they were  around in discovery or something.

Q:   You saw them during the criminal trial?

A:   I'm not a hundred percent sure I did, but  I'm pretty sure that they were
found around that time--

Q:  You haven't seen them recently?

A:   No.

Q:  And can you describe the incidents that  you wrote down?

A:   One time she just started hitting and kicking me, and I went into Justin's
room. Why--I don't recall what the conversation was at this time, but I know
she did until she got tired, because I just covered my groin and covered my--
turned my back to her. And then another time she came in, I was just laying
on the bed, and she took a stack of books and just slammed them down on
me. And the other time may not have been physical. The other time may have
been more verbal.

Q:   Where was the other time?

A:    I don't know, but it should be written in that thing. I don't recall right
now.

Q:   And why did she slam the books down on  you?

A:   It was--it was--I don't recall what  it was. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what
it was.

Q:  Was she upset at you?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  About what?

A:   I'm not sure.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's a great question. No, she always threw
books at him.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know. It wouldn't surprise me, based on what
I'm hearing.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall what it was about.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You have no recollection at all?

A:   None.

Q:  Did it hurt?

A:   Not really.

Q:  Okay. You didn't call the police or anything. Right?

A:   No.

Q:  You made no report other than to Randa. Right?

A:   That's right.

Q:  Did you tell Nicole you were keeping track of this, by the way?

A:   No.

Q:  Was that in the year 1989?

A:   I don't know. It may have been.

Q:  And what about the other incident where she hit you and kicked you?

A:   What about it?

Q:  When did that occur?

A:   After '89. After the '8--- New Year's  Day '89 incident.

Q:   In the year 1989?

A:   I don't know. I don't recall.

Q:  What was the cause of that problem?

A:   I have no idea.

Q:  You just don't remember?

A:   I just don't remember.

Q:  At the time do you remember having an argument with her?

A:   Yeah, at the time I remember my purpose was to document it, and I did.

Q:  Well, she didn't just come up in the clear blue and start hitting and kicking
you. Right? There was an argument you were having that escalated--

A:   We said something--she said something, I said something, and she
started (Indicating), and I  just turned and walked into Justin's room and she
followed me.

Q:  And this was the first time there had been any physical confrontation after
the January  incident in 1989?

A:   I believe so, yes.

Q:  By this time you had signed that document  that says if you were to inflict
injury on her physically, then she could tear up the prenup?

A:   Exactly.

Q:  Is that one of the reasons you restrained yourself?

A:   Well, I believe that was one of the reasons she was hitting me.

Q:   Oh, to bait you into hitting her?

A:   Well, I don't know what she was doing.

Q:  Is that what you think?

A:   I don't know what she was doing, but she knew that I would not do
anything, so she--

Q:  Why did she know that?

A:   Because I sent the letter, because I had signed the letter.

Q:  And is that also the reason why you didn't hit her when she slapped ---
slammed the books down?

A:   I wouldn't hit her under any  circumstances before this if she slammed the
books  down on me.

Q:  Is that why you restrained yourself from  removing her from the room?

A:   She--when she did it--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Is that the only reason that you restrained yourself
from taking her out of the  room--

THE WITNESS: No. No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --the piece of paper that you signed?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is it a reason

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. That isn't what you asked him.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's my next question.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Was it a reason?

A:   Why?

Q:  Were you--was it a reason?

A:   As I told you, I wouldn't have hit her before. I wouldn't have hit her
before this.

Q:  What I am trying to find out is whether  after you signed this agreement
with her, you were  deterred by that agreement from hitting her?

A:   I wouldn't have done it anyway.

Q:  Okay. Now, you said she verbally abused  You--

A:   Yeah..

Q:  How did she do that?

A:   I don't know. I'd have to took at the  thing. That's the reason I wrote
them down, to remind  me, and I don't recall right now.

Q:  Is that the only occasion on which she verbally abused you?

A:   Well it's--I don't know. Verbal abuse had a totally different--I mean, I
don't know what verbal abuse is at this point. It's a little different to me than
it was back then.

Q:  It's a little different to you?

A:   Now.

Q:  Now?

A:   Than it was to me back then.

Q:  In what sense?

A:   In--I hear people talk to each other-- virtually every friend I know I've
heard them get into arguments and say things. I've heard Judy say things to
Lou that today I would, from what I understand, is  now verbal abuse, but at
the time I didn't think it  was at all. I thought it was just people talking.

Q:  Did you ever hit your first wife Marquerite?

A:   Never.

Q:  Did you consider yourself a batterer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you consider Nicole a battered spouse?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: What are the basis?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No sound bites is the basis.

MR. PETROCELLI: This isn't about sound bites, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes, it is.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not fair.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am not going to let him answer it, so you can do
anything you want.

MR. PETROCELLI: What I'm--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am not going to let him answer it. You can make
any speeches or whatever you want.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not trying to make speeches. I am trying to explain
to you that his history of abuse, his relationship with Nicole, is  highly
relevant to the issues in this case, and it's  on that basis that I am trying to
explore.

Q:  You wrote the word 'battered,' or you  said you were a battered spouse in
the so-called  suicide note. Right?

A:   I said sometimes I felt like a battered  spouse, yes.

Q:  Well, what did it feel like when you felt that way?

A:   I felt that when you--for instance, when she was hitting me, that I had
nothing to do. I didn't feel that, in my conscience, that I could call the police,
so I felt helpless.

Q:  Why couldn't you call the police?

A:   Because I just wouldn't do that.

Q:  Just your choice. Right?

A:   My choice. I don't think it was a police matter.

Q:  Okay. And do you believe that Nicole was a battered spouse?

A:   From what I know of it, I would say in '89, that day, yes.

Q:  Is that the only day that you believe that she was a battered spouse in the
course of your  entire relationship with her?

A:   In my understanding of it today, I would  say we were both verbally at
times abusive of one another, but if that's the case, I--in my opinion  most of
the people I know are verbal abusers.

Q:  At the time, before your current--your  current understanding is gained
after her murder. Is  that right?

A:   No.

Q:  Well, at the time that you were married to her before your divorce in 1992,
did you think that she was a battered spouse--

A:   No.

Q:  --in the course of her relationship?

A:   No.

Q:  But you thought you were a battered spouse?

A:   At that time, no.

Q:  At the time that you were married to her before your divorce in 1992, did
you think she was a battered spouse?

A:   I thought on New Year's that that was-- I understood from what I read
and saw about battery at the time that that certainly was an abusive incident.
Before then I would have said no.

Q:  When you said you were a battered spouse, what incidents did you have
in mind: The slapping and  the hitting and the verbal abuse?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He has already answered  that, number one, and he
didn't say he was. He said he felt like it.

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the difference?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, the difference may be  a legal conclusion that
you're getting to that I'm not  going to let him answer, and he is not going to
answer that either. You've asked and answered that about four times now.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Have you ever been diagnosed by anyone as a batterer?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know whether Nicole was ever diagnosed as a battered spouse?

A:   No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know who--what you're talking about,
"diagnosed as a"--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You were never diagnosed as a battered spouse. Right?

A:   No.

Q:  Did Lenore Walker examine you?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did she conclude you were a battered spouse?

A:   I don't know if that was her purpose. I  don't know what her conclusions
were, to be honest  with you.

Q:  Did she ever tell you that?

A:   What?

Q:  That you were a batterer?

A:   I don't--you know, I would have to really--

Q:   Excuse me. I misspoke. My question to you is: Did Lenore Walker ever
tell you that she was a batterer--that you were a batterer?

THE WITNESS: I don't--this is my doctor. Can I talk about this?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to. It's okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: She was a designated expert at trial.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: But she didn't testify, as I recall.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think that makes a difference.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, then you're going to  have to test it in court
because I'm not going to let  him answer it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know who Lenore Walker is?

A:   Yes.

Q:  You ever meet with her?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Was there anyone else present?

A:   At times, yes.

Q:  Who?

A:   This other doctor. I can't think of her name.

Q:  How many times did you meet with Lenore Walker?

A:   I don't recall. I was in jail, so whenever she came.

Q:   More than twice?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Are you aware that she has said on national television that you've admitted
to conduct that is battery?

A:   No.

Q:  Are you aware that she has called you a batterer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You would disagree with that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What tests did she administer to you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. Those  are all protected by the
physician-patient privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: These were disclosed reports, including the MMPI. You
want to take a little break here?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure. Why not.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Mr. Leonard whispering in your ear.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He is my co-counsel.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:37.

[Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 3:06.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  We were talking about Dr. Lenore Walker before the break.

A:   Yes.

Q:  How many times did you meet with her?


A:   I don't know.

Q:  Number of times, though?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Now, did you tell Dr. Lenore Walker that you had beat your wife?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You know, you don't have to answer that. I think
that's protected by the  physician-patient privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you tell Dr. Lenore Walker about acts of spousal abuse?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Same objection. Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer any of the
conversations with Dr. Walker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: On the ground of this privilege?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes.

Q:   What was your purpose in meeting with Dr. Walker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If he had a purpose.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Yeah, if you had one.

A:   I personally didn't have a purpose.

Q:  And more than a dozen meetings, would you  say?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  And was this other doctor present at all of them?

A:   No.

Q:  Was there anyone else present besides  either Dr. Walker and this other
person?

A:   No.

Q:  Was she also a doctor?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And how do you know that?

A:   Because I believe when they introduced themselves, it was doctor and
doctor.

Q:  What was the subject matter of your conversations with them?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that either because that's
subject to the physician-patient privilege. Don't answer it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you take an MMPI test?

A:   I don't know what that is.

Q:  A test, a psychological test, where you answered a lot of questions,
multiple choice, 4-, 500.

A:   I don't know if that's what it was, but I  took a lot of tests.

Q:  Written tests?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  Who were present when you took those  tests?

A:   They were, either one or the other or  both.

Q:  Okay. Were you told the results of those tests?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know why you were taking those tests?

A:   It had something to do with the case.

Q:  Do you know what it had to do with the case?

A:   No.

Q:  Dr. Walker ever tell you that you were a batterer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am not going to ask any more questions about
that, Mr. Baker. Okay? We will--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We will argue about that at  a subsequent time.

MR. PETROCELLI: We will resolve that at  another time.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Fair enough.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  While you were married to Nicole, did you  have a relationship with a
woman named Tawny Kitaen?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That was in the late '80s. Is that right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. And did that relationship end before the New Year's Eve incident?

A:   Years before, yes.

Q:  And did it ever resume again?

A:   No.

Q:  Why did you call her from the airplane coming back from Chicago on
June 13?

A:   If I did, I was looking for Cathy.

Q:  And what does Cathy have to do with Tawny Kitaen?

A:   They're best friends. They were at the time best friends.

Q:  Do they live near each other?

A:   Cathy lived in the Valley, and Tawny  lived at the time on this side of the
hill.

Q:  Okay. Now, was that the only reason you  remember calling Tawny from
the plane?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. You said that from what you know now you would consider
yourself to be a battered spouse, but what you knew at the time, you did not
so regard yourself as a battered spouse. Is that right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That isn't what he said.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, you wrote down as of June 17, 1994, that you were a battered
spouse. Correct?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said he felt like he had--

THE WITNESS: Sometimes I felt.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, you said you felt like you were a battered spouse as of June 17th.
Right?

A:   Sometimes I felt like a battered spouse.

Q:  When was the first time that you came to a realization that you felt like a
battered spouse?

A:   When Nicole was hitting me that time at home. I don't know if that's the
first--if that was the first incident in that group of incidences, but I felt
helpless.

Q:  And when she threw the books on you, did  you feel like a battered
spouse then?

A:   I felt helpless, yes.

Q:  Do you think Nicole felt helpless as a  result of your incident with her?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It calls for pure speculation, and
his  state of mind relative to her state of mind is  irrelevant, and I am going to
instruct him not to answer the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you-- Well, this is a discovery deposition, but in any event, I'll ask
another question. Did you observe her being helpless?

A:   When?

Q: When you were struggling with her, 'rassling" with her, as you put it,
January 1, 1989?

A:   Well, she was rassling, back, so she wasn't helpless.

Q:   She was not helpless in the sense you felt--
A:   She was struggling back. In cases I wasn't struggling back. In her case
she was.

Q:   Has Nicole ever verbally abused you in  public?

A:   Yes. I mean, at the time I didn't think  it was abuse, but yes.

Q:   In your video, Mr. Simpson, in response to that searing examination by
Ross Becker, you  said--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: At least he could complete his in a day.

MR. BREWER: 90 minutes.

MR. PETROCELLI: 90 minutes, Mr. Baker.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: 92.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  --you said in response to a question about whether you were a battered
husband: "That is a problem that when I am free to speak and I go--and I plan
to speak to women's groups, I think that is an issue. That is an issue that, you
know, battery is just not a one-way street. I think it is more an attitude than
anything, just because it doesn't hurt when someone hits you, someone slaps
you or someone in front of people is verbally abusive to you,  to me all that
constitutes  battery."

A:   From what I understand it to be now, yes.

Q:  And, now, did you have that understanding  during your relationship with
Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:  All of this understanding was obtained after she died?

A:   No. After '89. And a little after she  died. A little in talking to Lenore.

Q:  Did you become aware of battery as a social problem after this incident in
January of 1989?

A:   I don't understand that question.

Q:  Well, did you become aware of it more than you had been in the past?
Did you learn about it? Did you read about it? Did you go to sessions?

A:   Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Which one do you want him to answer?

MR. PETROCELLI: All of those.
Q:   Did you do all those things?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer the question It's compound. You can
break it down.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you read books on spousal abuse or  battery after the '89 incident?

A:   I believe so, yes.

Q:   And you attended therapy sessions?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And you spoke to professionals about it?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. And from that point on, do you think you had a good
understanding of what battery was?

A:   To an extent, yes.

Q:  And from that point on, did you ever batter Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:  Did Nicole ever slap you in front of people?

A:   Yes.

Q:  When did she do that?

A:   Once in the late 70s, early '80s, and then once in a club.

Q:  The first time who was present?

A:   I really didn't know the people. It was at a party.

Q:  She slapped you in front of strangers?

A:   Yes. Basically. yes.

Q:  What did do you?

A:   I left.

Q:  Left her there?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Where was this place?

A:   I don't know if it was called Bumble's or Pips at the time.

Q:  Pips?

A:   Pips or Bumble's.

Q:  Was it a restaurant?

A:   No. It was a restaurant/club.

Q:  Can you name anybody who was present that witnessed the slapping?

A:   At this point in time, no.

Q:  Any of your friends there

A: They may have been, but I just don't recall.

Q:   Who might have been there?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: This calls for pure speculation.

THE WITNESS: I mean, it would--I really don't know who might have been
there. Billy Kehoe, Suzie Kehoe --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. Anybody else come to mind?

A:   No.

Q:  And the second occasion when Nicole slapped you in public?

A:   It was in Laguna.

Q:  And who was present?

A:   At the incident most of her sisters for  sure, and I don't know who else.

Q:  Was this in a restaurant?
A:   No. It, was--it may have been a  restaurant. May have been at a Mexican-
-I can't  think of the name. Las Brisas or something.

Q:  Any friends there?

A:   You know, there were a lot of people there, and I just can't recall. This
was 12, 15 years ago.

Q:  Why did she slap you?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Did you have a fight with her?

A:   Maybe an argument. Maybe some words.

Q:  And she slapped you earlier because you had an--in the club because of an
argument also?

A:   I don't know if it was an argument. I may have been flirting with some
body. Okay. Did you hit her back on either of those occasions?

A:   No. I left on both of those occasions.

Q:  Did you make up with her soon thereafter?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you ever tell Nicole that she was a batterer?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you know whether Nicole ever sought  treatment as a batterer?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever discuss that she should seek such treatment?

A:   I don't think either one of us ever did.

Q:  Now, Nicole didn't press charges against you. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:  The '89 incident. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:  And she didn't go to the press either. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:  And she did that because of your desire that she not disclose this to the
press. Right?

A:   I think part of it, yes.

Q:  And she let it die out. Right?

A:   Well, she called the police, so--yeah, I guess it--I guess we went on with
our lives.

Q:  Did Michelle let you into her bedroom, that night with a key?

A:   No.

Q:  Did Michelle let Nicole into your room?

A:   No.

Q:  Was Michelle involved at all?

A:   Yes.

Q:  In what way?

A:   She was there.

Q:  Did she see you two fighting?

A:   She heard us arguing. She didn't see us fighting, no.

Q:  Did she come upstairs--

A:   No.

Q:  --to see you at all?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. And Cowlings wasn't there during the fight either, was he?

A:   No.

Q:   As of Nicole's death, did you have a contract with NBC as a
sportscaster?

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  You have to answer yes.

A:   Yes.

Q:  When was that due to expire?

A:   I think I just had signed an extension  for another three or four years.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are you going to be asking  about his financial
affairs, Dan?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. not right now.

Q:  And were you under contract with anybody  else as of June 12, 1994?

A:   Hertz, for sure.

Q:  Was that a long-term, contract?

A:   I think it was maybe two, three more years left on that.

Q:  Did you have any other employment at that time?

A:   Other than my just normal stuff, you know, I was--you know, I'll do a
movie here or there. I can't think of anything real specific, no.

Q:  So the only two contracts you had were NBC and Hertz?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  Okay. Were you under contract to act in any movies to be produced?

A:   At the time of her death?

Q:  Yes.

A:   No.

Q:  And were any deals in development or anything like that?

A:   Well, I had done something that was up  for consideration for a TV series
called FROGMAN.

Q:  You had done the pilot for FROGMAN. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:    And had no contract outside of the pilot?

A:    Well, if it went to a series, I believe  there was--I believe there was an
arrangement in place.

Q:   Okay. And did you have any agreements with any other motion picture
producers?

A:   No.

Q:   Okay. Both NBC and Hertz contracts have been cancelled?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Now, did you--were you under contract to NBC and Hertz as of June ---
excuse me--in January of '89?

A:   No.

Q:  Which one?

A:   What do you mean?

Q:  Either of them?

A:   I was under contract to Hertz.

Q:  But not NBC?

A:   Not NBC.

Q:  Were you with another broadcasting  company?

A:   No.

Q:  When did you begin working for NBC?

A:   1989.

Q:  What year--I mean what month in '89?

A:   The fall.

Q:  Okay. And what was the last contract you had before that for a
broadcasting company?

A:   I believe I--I don't know what year, but sometime in the late '80s I did
something for-- it could have been ESPN.

Q:  Were you ever employed by ABC?

A:   Yes.

Q:  When was that?

A:   In the mid and early '80s.

Q:  And when did that end?

A:   And then in the early '70s.

Q:  When did it end in the '80s?

A:   I believe it was '86 maybe.

Q:  So between 1986 and the fall of '89 you didn't have a regular
broadcasting job. Is that right?

A:   I did something with ESPN, I believe. I  did one season, I believe, with
ESPN where I did five  or six games.

Q:  Of college football?

A:   No. Pro games.

Q:  For one season, you said. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  So that was the only broadcasting work in  between the ABC and NBC
jobs?

A:   Correct.

Q:  And your contract in the fall of 1989 with NBC, how long was that for?

A:   I'm sorry. Say that again.

Q:  Your contract with NBC that you entered  into in the fall of '89, how long
was that contract for?

A:   Somewhere between three and five years, I believe.

Q:  Okay. Was it renewed?

A:   Yes.

Q:  How many times?

A:   I believe in '94 it was being renewed for the third time.

Q:  For the third time?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  Were there any morals clauses in the NBC  contract?

A:   You know, I never read the contract.

Q:  Or in the Hertz contract?

A:   I never read the contract. but I believe  that's--there's something pretty
standard in most of  those contracts.

Q:  About their ability to terminate in the  event of conduct that they find
objectionable?

A:   I believe so.

Q:   Were you under--were you endorsing any other products or services in
January of 1989 besides Hertz?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. Let me go back to Exhibit 86 for a minute. I forgot to ask you about
the first page, Mr. Simpson. Why don't you take a look at that. I am going to
ask you just to go over the first page with me.

A:   Okay.

Q:   It is true, referring to the first entry there, that you had not called Nicole
between Christmas and January 16, 1993. Is that right?

A:   Say that again now.

Q:  Referring to the first entry at the top  of Page 86, is it true that between
December 25, 1992  and January 16, 1993 you had not called Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you have a recollection.

THE WITNESS: Well, called Nicole or called my  kids

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Called Nicole.

A:   No, I didn't call Nicole.

Q:  Did you tell Nicole that you were coming back to Los Angeles during the
week of or following January 16, 1993?

A:   I don't believe so, no.

Q:  Did you come back that week?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Now, on Monday, January 18, 1993, were you in Los Angeles?

A:   I could have been.

Q:  Do you recall picking up Justin at Gretna Green and Sydney from Rachel
Berman's and taking them to breakfast?

A:   I don't recall it. I don't recall it, no, but I could have.

Q:  Okay. And Monday, February 1, 1993, do you recall picking up Justin
from Oliver's party?

A:   I do--I don't know where I picked him  up from but I do recall February
1st clearly,  vividly, as a matter of  fact.

Q:  Why is that?

A:   Because it was the first time I had  spoken or saw Nicole since
Christmas.

Q:  Okay. Do you know--Dita is who? Judy?

A:   Judy, yes.

Q:  Did Judy come to see you and the kids on that day?

A:   When I drove up to get the kids' clothes, Dita was standing outside with
Nicole, of their house, and that's when I saw Nicole.

Q:   Okay. Did you pick up Sydney from school that day?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  And did you take kids to karate?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. And did you watch karate?

A:   I believe so. I don't know if I did or didn't. I'm not sure.

Q:  Did you go to Toscana's with Nicole, Judy and the kids or did you go
home after karate?

A:   I didn't do anything with Nicole. I saw  Nicole for three or four minutes,
and that was the  only time I saw Nicole.

Q:  Then you went home?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you have a confrontation with Nicole  about the February 2, 1992
vacation plans?

A:   "Confrontation," I don't know if it's the  right word, but--

Q:  Argument?

A:   I don't think that was the right word either. Nicole was mistaken on--
Nicole hadn't paid any heed to a letter that she received.

Q:  From whom?

A:   From my office, stating that I would not be in town the remainder of that
week. So I wanted to spend time with my kids for the 1st, 2nd and I believe
the 3rd, because I was leaving town on the 3rd.

Q:  And she didn't pay any attention to that. Is that what you said?

A:   She wanted me to keep the kids all week because I had been--this was the
first time I was back in L.A., and she made some comment about she was
going to Europe that week.

Q:  Did you call to leave a message that you were going to stay in Florida?

A:   No.

Q:   See, I am referring to the last entry on here.

A:   Where is this at?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's right down here  [Indicating]. It's very poor on
that copy.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   "O.J. called once to leave a message"  something "stay in Florida." I can't
read it all.

A:   It could be, because I was in Florida I would say a lot during that time. I
was thinking to move to Florida.

Q:  During the week of February 13 and 19, did Nicole take the kids to Aspen
to go skiing?

A:   I'm sorry.

Q:  During the week--I am referring now to the second page, Mr. Simpson,
the only entry on there.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  During the week of February 13 to 19, did Nicole take the kids to Aspen
to go skiing?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  Okay. Thank you. Let me show you--You recalled Nicole going with
Sydney to see Disney On Ice in January 1988?

A:   No.

Q:   Do you recall you being invited and not wanting to go?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall Nicole taking Sydney  to go to Disney On Ice at some
other occasion?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever go to see Disney On Ice?

A:   I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. Well, let me show you this letter dated it appears to be January
1988. Can't read the day. Mark this as the next exhibit.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 87 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Have you ever seen this document before?

A:   I might have.

Q:  When did you first see it?

A:   I believe when I was in jail. Has this been changed, this date

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I can't read the date.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you recall an incident when you came  back from going out with A.C.
Cowlings and you were  drunk in or around January of 1988 and had a
confrontation with Nicole?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you recall calling her a fat pig?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you recall whether Nicole was two months' pregnant in 1988?

A:   She probably would have been.

Q:  She was two months' pregnant with Justin, who was born in August of
1988. Correct?

A:   She probably would have been, yes.

Q:   Okay. Down here in the middle it says, "He never let up. You're a fat pig
. . . You're disgusting. You're a slob... I want you out of my f---ing house."
Did you say those things to Nicole?

A:   Never.

Q:   "Then I took Sydney to bed, tried to, anyway! And he proceeded to cut
me down with A.C. in the entry downstairs." Do you recall that?

A:   No.

Q:   "I tried to tape the conversation but the recorder  didn't work. He was
saying all  those things again, so that I could  hear every word as he was
telling  A.C.--My wife's a fat ass--a liar... I stopped f---ing other  girls, and
now I jack off . . . The fat  ass . . ."  Did you say those things?

A:   Never.

Q:  Do you recall locking her out of her room?

A:   No.

Q:  You lived in Rockingham then. Right?

A:   In '88

Q:  Yeah.

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you tell her to get out of your f---ing house?

A:   No.

Q:  You see all these things written down here?

A:   You want me to read it all

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Next page.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, look at the second page,  Mr. Simpson. I am at the first complete
paragraph. It says that you said you want her "to have an  abortion with the
baby." Did you say that?

A:   I would have never said that, ever.

Q:   She said she packed a few things together. Do you remember her doing
that?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you tell her that, "Let me tell you  how serious I am . . . I have a gun
in my hand right now-- Get the f--k out of here."

A:   No.

Q:  Did you have cats at that time as pets?

A:   We used to have cats. I don't know if we still had them at this time.

Q:  Okay. Nicole writes:  "I got real scared and grabbed Sydney and the cats
and a bag for her and a bottle--and a pair of sweats from the laundry room for
me and get the hell"--"got the heck out of the house." Do you see that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, see, it says--it's your foundation that it's
Nicole's writing.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, do you recognize this writing as  Nicole's?

A:   I can't tell with this, but it could be  Nicole's, yes.

Q:  Do you know why Nicole would write such  things if they were not true?

A:   Maybe she was feeling that way.

Q:  That she would just invent this whole thing?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you don't know, just tell him you don't know.

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, was there some incident that you believe she might have been
referring to here?

A:   No.

Q:   Does this resemble anything that happened that you can recall?

A:   Nothing I ever recall. No.

Q:  Is it possible that it happened but you don't recall?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  It never happened

A:  Never happened.

Q:  You're a hundred percent sure?

A:   I never said these things to Nicole, ever.

Q:  Does it--When you saw this for the  time, were you shocked that such
things were written  down by Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's irrelevant whether he was
shocked or not shocked.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer it, I told you.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you do anything about it?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Do anything--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  To investigate why she did this.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: While he was in jail?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that either.

MR. PETROCELLI: He had a lot of lawyers, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Thank you very much for your gratuitous remark.

MR. PETROCELLI: And a lot of investigators.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you ever find out the circumstances  behind Nicole's writing of these-
-of this letter?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he can tell me if he  knows.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He could tell you a lot of things he knows if I
allowed him.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's not privileged.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's not privileged

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's not attorney work product and it's not protected-
-

MR. PETROCELLI: He might have learned it from Al Cowlings.
Q:  Putting your lawyers aside, do you have any information about the
circumstances of Exhibit 87?

A:   No.

Q:  Now, you don't believe Exhibit 87 was made up by Nicole in connection
with getting out of  the prenup, do you?

A:   Personally

Q:  Yes.

A:   Yes.

Q:  And what makes you say that?

A:   I don't know. She--when she talked to  me about some of the things that
they had her doing, one of the things, that she had to write letters, and  this
looks like a letter with--some of the other  stuff I saw didn't took like letters.

Q:  Well, when I asked you about this before, you never told me that she said
that they had her-- they asked her to write letters.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer his argumentative question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Is that something that you just thought of now?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question. It's argumentative, and
it's your saying what he testified to earlier.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Are you now saying that Nicole told you the lawyers had her write letters?

A:   She said to me they had her write a bunch  of stuff, you know, when she
was filling out various  things, writing up these, her words, "letters." She
didn't say anything other than notes, other than  letters. I assumed they were
all letters, but they  weren't when I saw them in jail.

Q:  What were the other ones that were not  letters?

A:   This whole list that--when she says,  "These are the things I remember,"
and she wrote all of these things that you guys start saying was a diary.

Q:  Okay. Now, this document, did somebody tell you that this is what
Nicole's lawyers had her write up, Exhibit 86--excuse me--Exhibit 87?

A:   No. But I just saw it with--in the packet that I got of all of those
allegations, this was a part of it, so I assume this was all a part of it.

Q:  When you were given that packet, were you told this is a packet of
materials that Nicole made up?

A:   No. I was given a lot of discovery one day, and I sat in my cell and read
it.

Q:  And you saw a bunch of documents which appeared to be allegations by
Nicole against you. Right?

A:   Well, this was all in one packet.

Q:  And it was those documents that you  thought at that time were the
documents that she made up. Right?

A:  Well, I knew they were the documents she  made up because they said
they were hers, and I knew  it was made-up stuff.

Q:  And how did you know they were hers?

A:   Because it was purported to be hers. It was--

Q:  Who purported it to be hers?

A:   Whoever delivered it to me, and whatever it was, it was purported to be
her things with her lawyers, and --

Q:  Who told you it was her lawyers?

A:  --I can't recall if they were signed by her or not, but the handwriting was
much like this handwriting, and it was purported that these were allegations
that she was making to her lawyers.

Q:  Do you know where these documents came from when they were given to
you?

A:   Discovery.

Q:  Discovery from whom?

A:   From the prosecution.

Q:  Now, where did the prosecutors get it?

A:   I have no idea.

Q:  Did you ever ask?

A:   No.

Q:  In other words, you think they were found  in Nicole's home or personal
possessions or lawyer's  office?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's irrelevant, where he  thinks they were found. He
has told you he doesn't  know. Don't answer that.

Q:  Let me show you--let me show you the next exhibit in order, which will
be--what are we?

THE REPORTER: 88.

MR. PETROCELLI: 88. Here you go, David.

(Plaintiffs'Exhibit 88 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Have you ever seen Exhibit 88 before?

A:   I just saw it, yes.

Q:  Just a minute or two ago you were referring to a document where various
incidents were listed. Is this the one you had in mind?

A:   Yes.

Q:  I believe I've already asked you about  each of these claims of abuse, and
you have said none  of them occurred. Is that right?

A:   Correct.

Q:  Who is Bruce?

A:   I believe her divorce lawyer.

Q:  Nicole--do you recognize the note to  Bruce to be in Nicole's handwriting?

A:   It could be. I don't--I can't say that  I totally right now recognize Nicole's
handwriting, but I'm assuming it is.

Q:  Do you have any reason to believe this note is not in her handwriting?

A:   Not really, no.

Q:  Now, she writes here in the middle, "There were plenty of small times
where he'd just push me or grab me hard enough to bruise my arms, but they
happened so often that I can't remember specifics." Is that true that that
occurred?

A:   No.

Q:  And did you ever push her or grab her hard enough to bruise her arms?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. Go to the second page where it talks about Pips on Rodeo.

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  Is that the place where she where Nicole slapped you?

A:   No. This is a place that was still on Robertson.

Q:  When did you get a wine closet put into your Rockingham residence?

A:   19--I mean what's there now I got in  1990 maybe, '89 or '90.

Q:  And before then did you have a little area where you would store wine?

A:   Yes.

Q:  What did you call that?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  A wine closet?

A:   It could be called that, but I never called it a wine closet.

Q:  And how long was that closet there?

A:   Since I had Rockingham.

Q:  You don't recall any incident where you put Nicole in that closet, do you?

A:   Never.

Q:  Could you go to the page entitled "Vacations' in here?

A:   What page is that?

Q:   I think it's the next to last page.

A:   Okay.

Q:  The first one says "Italy," and then it  has next to that, "Venice, Rome,
Florence, England,  Germany." Do you see that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you go on a vacation like that with  Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:  For her 21st birthday?

A:   I don't know if it was for her birthday. I doubt it was for her birthday
because we were there for Octoberfest. The earlier part of Octoberfest, so it
was late September, so --

Q:  What year?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Early on in your relationship?

A:   Relatively, in terms of 17 years, yes, but it couldn't have been her
birthday because it was Octoberfest.

Q:   The next line says "Aspen," can't read the next word.

A:   "Many times."

Q:  "Many times."

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Is that true, that you and she went there many times?

A:   Yes.

Q:   It says "1986--Vail . . .(many times)."

A:   Yes.

Q:  Is that true also?

A:   Yes.

Q:  "1988--Hawaii (many times)." Is that  true?

A:   Yes.

Q:  "Cabo San Lucas." Is that true?

A:   Yes.

Q:  1988 was Hawaii and Cabo. In 1989 it says "Acapulco twice [sic],
birthday." Is that true? Did you go there then?

A:   In 1989

Q:  Yeah.

A:   --I don't think we went twice, but I went there for her--took her there for
her birthday, yes.

Q:  Did you go to Puerto Vallarta?

A:   No.

Q:  Las Hadas?

A:   Las Hadas we went to on our honeymoon. Puerto Vallarta--

Q:  Honeymoon in 1985?

A:   I don't think--You're telling me to read what she says here.

Q:  Is that where you went?

A:   Yes, that's one of the places we went  to. I don't ever recall going to
Puerto Vallarta with Nicole, but I might have. We might have.

Q:   Just so I'm clear, your honeymoon was in Las Hadas in 1985?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Okay. Did you attend a wedding for Michael Millitello at the Ritz Carlton
with Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That's on the last page.

A:   Yes.

Q:   But there was no incident of abuse there?

A:    None at all.

Q:  Who are Eric and Val Von Watts?

A:   Our neighbors--was our neighbors.

Q:  Now, there it says that you and they listened to music on Wilshire. What's
this Wilshire place? Do you know anything about that?

A:   No. It just seemed to me that we once  went to hear a band of some friend
of Watts once on  Wilshire. It's--you know, it's a while ago, so--  but it just
seemed to me that we may have.

Q:  Did you ever take Nicole to a hospital on  Wilshire Boulevard?

A:   No. Is there a hospital on Wilshire


Q:   I don't know. Is there?

A:   Yeah, there is.

Q:  Where?

A:   My two kids were born, early kids were born at Good Samaritan Hospital
in downtown L.A.

Q:  Wilshire?

A:   Yes. Yes/

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah, it goes all the way through. Yeah, it goes all
the way through.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Let me show you another document, Mr. Simpson. Mark this as Exhibit
89.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 89 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You ever see this document before?

A:   No, I don't recall.

Q:  Did you see it in jail?

A:   I might have.

Q:  Does this document appear to you to be in  Nicole's handwriting?

A:   Yeah, it looks like the same handwriting  as this other.

Q:  What did Nicole call you?

A:   O.J.

Q:   This is a letter addressed to you, and it says in part here: "I'd like you to
keep this letter if we split so that you'll always know why we split. I'd also
like you to keep it if we stay together as a reminder." Okay

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  Did you ever get this letter from her?

A:   No.

Q:  Could you tell by that statement when this was written?

A:   No.

Q:   After the June--excuse me. After the January 1989 incident, was there a
time when you and she were contemplating splitting?

A:   No.

Q:  You never even discussed it?

A:   Till she told me she wanted to split, it  never came up.

Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that she saw  your marriage as a huge mistake?

A:   No.

Q:  Prior to your marriage but while you were  living with her, were you
frequently seeing other women?

A:   No.

Q:  Was that a subject of contention between Nicole and you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've gone into that. Don't answer that. You've
gone into that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  This letter indicates that it was, and I am perhaps hoping this might jog
your recollection. Does it?

A:   I don't know. I haven't read the letter, but, I mean, obviously when there
were phone numbers, she would make comments.

Q:  Just about phone numbers?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  She says she "took the blame many times  for your cheating." Do you
know what that refers to?

A:   No.

Q:  She writes in the second paragraph, "I  remember a long time ago a
girlfriend of yours wrote  you a letter. She had" -- "she said, well, you aren't
married yet, so let's get together."  Do you know who--Did you ever receive
such a letter?

A:   I didn't, but she did.

Q:  Nicole did?

A:   Yes.

Q:  From whom?

A:   I don't know. I was at USC, and some girl put a letter on my windshield
wiper, and evidently I never noticed it driving home, and Nicole took it off
the windshield wiper.

Q:  And she talked to you about it?

A:   Yes.

Q:  What did it say?

A:   I don't recall. I never saw the letter. She never gave me the letter.

Q:  Something about your getting together with her?

A:   Could have been.

Q:   Okay. The third page of this letter, I  am not going to read it; it's too long
and there is a  lot of profanity in here, but generally the third  page, the third
paragraph, talks about your giving her  bad treatment, looks of disgust
because she was heavy  from her pregnancy with Sydney. That's not true?

A:   No.

Q:  Did you ever complain to Nicole, let's say before 1990, that her living
habits bothered you; she was sloppy and messy?

A:   Living habits

Q:  Yeah, that she'd leave things around, she was not neat, leave her shoes on
the floor, things like that.

A:   I think it was sort of a running thing with us, yes.

Q:  And you were more neat and orderly?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Now, the next page of this, it says "2764" at the top, it says: "There was
also that time before Justin and after Sydney I felt good about how I got back
into  shape. You beat the holy hell, out  of me and we lied at the X-ray lab
and said I fell off a bike. Remember!??" Now, do you see that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Do you recall such an incident?

A:   No.

Q:  You never beat--

A:   It never happened.

Q:  It never happened?

A:   Never happened.

Q:  Now, in the next paragraph Nicole writes about the televised Clipper game
and going to Stellini's before the game and your 40th birthday party and the
week leading up to it." Do you recall those events?

A:   I don't recall--I recall my 40th birthday party, but the events around it, I
don't remember. We always went to Stellini's, so...

Q:   Was there some episode or incident at a televised Clipper game that comes
to mind?

A:    No.

Q:  And the top of the next page says, "Since Justin's birth is the . . . New
Year's Eve beat up."  You deny beating her up. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is a word after --

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is a word after--

MR. PETROCELLI: Where, Mr. Baker?

THE WITNESS: What are you talking about?

MR. PETROCELLI: 2763.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: "The mad New Year's Eve" Oh, is that what it is,
"the mad New Year's Eve"

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, you're right.

Q:   "And since Justin's birthday is the mad New Year's Eve beat up." Do
you see that?

A:   I see it. yes.

Q:  But that didn't occur. Right?

A:   We had a fight on New Year's, as I told you.

Q:   But you didn't beat her up?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay.

A:   But the bruises and stuff she received, I feel totally responsible for.

Q:   On the next to last page, Nicole writes: "I called the cops to save my life
whether you believe it or  not. But I didn't pursue anything  after that--I didn't
prosecute, I  didn't call the press and didn't  make a big charade out of it. I
waited for it to die down, and asked for it to."  Is that true?

A:   What portion of it?

Q:  The whole thing/

A:   Well, it couldn't be true because we had stopped fighting. She called the
cops after the fight was over, so I don't--I don't--that can't be true. The rest
of it --

Q:   The part about she called the cops to save her life. That's what you're
saying. Right?

A:   That's what I'm saying, yes.

Q:  The rest of that's true, though. Right?

A:   What is the rest of it? I don't . . .

Q:  The next sentence: "I didn't pursue anything after that --I didn't prosecute,
I didn't call the press and didn't make a big charade out of it--I waited for it to
die down and asked for it to."

A:   Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Tape change, is that what you said? Go ahead.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is end of tape  No. 2 of Volume VI. The time
is approximately 3:50  and we are off the record.

[Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The  time is approximately
4:08. This is the beginning of  tape No. 3 of Volume VI.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   After Nicole and you were married and had children, did she go out less
frequently?

A:   Yes, we went out less frequently.

Q:  Did you and she used to argue over her backing out of functions at the last
minute?

A:   Yes.

Q:   So look at the last page of this, the paragraph in the middle. It says: "I
agree that we married"-- "that after we married things changed--we couldn't
have house fulls of people like I used to have over and barbecue for, because
I had other responsibilities. I  didn't want to go to a lot of  events and I'd back
down at the  last minute on functions and trips  I admit. I'm sorry."  Is it true
that those things occurred?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. Let me mark the next three  exhibits, 90, 91 and 92. These are the
three letters  from you, Mr. Simpson. I think you've seen these in  court
already. First one is a two page document. Mark that as Exhibit 90; second
one is three pages, and that will be 91; and the third one is a seven-page
document. That will be 92.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibits 90, 91 and 92 were marked for identification by the
reporter and are attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You've seen these three exhibits before, 90, 91 and 92?

A:   No. Can I read them?

Q:   Oh, sure. What I want you to do is put them in proper chronological
order for me.

[Witness reviews documents.]

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Off the record real quick.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record. [Discussion held off
the record.]

MR. PETROCELLI: Back on the record.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And you wrote all three of these>

A:   Yes.

Q:  They are all in your own handwriting?

A:   Yes.

Q:  When did you write these? Start with--

A:   I really can't say. It seems as if this one with the 92 would have been the
first one, it just seems.

Q:  Okay.

A:   And it seems that 90 would have been the last one, but it was all in--one
of them I wrote while we were--actually while we were having dinner. I don't
know which one, though.

Q:  At Rockingham?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Do you know the dates of these, when you wrote these letters?

A:   I would say they were all written within the month, yeah, all pretty much
written within the two weeks to--you know, within that first month.

Q:  January 1989?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you give all three of these to Nicole?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Exhibit 90 is written on Cartier  stationery. Do you see that?

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  Do you know where you got that from?

A:   No.

Q:  Were you in New York during this time?

A:   No.

Q:  You didn't have a football job in January of 1989. Is that right?

A:   No.

Q:  Why didn't ABC renew your contract? Do you know?

A:   You mean back in '86?

Q:  Yeah.

A:   I don't know. They were going with a whole new look on Monday night
football, other than Gifford.

Q:  Were you having a drinking problem in December 1988, January 1989?

A:   No.

Q:  In one of these letters, I believe it's  Exhibit 92, it says that you agreed to
go to  Alcoholics Anonymous.

A:   Yes.

Q:  Why?

A:   Because we had been drinking, and then I  got physical, and I didn't
think that was an excuse  for that. I didn't want to use alcohol or whatever,
the way I reacted, as an excuse.

Q:   So you didn't have any drinking problem, but you went to AA anyway?

A:   No. Nicole told me, "Well, you don't have to go to AA. You're not a
drunk," and I didn't.

Q:   Were you drunk that night?

A:   Well, I think we both were drinking, so  we had drank pretty good that
night.

Q:  Were you drunk?

A. I was able to drive home, but I think we had drank pretty good that night
yes.

Q:  Were you legally drunk?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Did you take a blood alcohol test?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Had you taken one, would you have passed or failed?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's a great question, though.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him  answer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. I think it calls for  pure speculation.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   In all three of these letters, basically  you're expressing regret for the
incident?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And again you seem to have some very strong words of regret here about
your conduct being unacceptable and so forth.

A:   The way I reacted, I thought I reacted unlike I had ever reacted before.

Q:  But all you did was restrain her and try to get her out of the room. Right?

A:   I physically removed her from a room and I had never really done that
before.

Q:  In Exhibit 91 you talk about a conversation with the detective.

A:   Yes.

Q:  Is that Edwards?

A:   No.

Q:  Who is that?

A:   Ferrill.

Q:  You also say you're not trying to buy her out, buy Nicole out, in Exhibit
91. What did you mean  by that?

A:   I think it was during that period of time  that I had discussed with her or I
had sent her or  discussed with her this letter about the prenuptial agreement.

Q:  Whose idea was that?

A:   Mine.

Q:  Okay. Did Nicole respond to these letters?

A:   She wrote me two letters, I believe.

Q:  Do you have them?

A:   No.

Q:  Have you seen them since you went to jail?

A:   No.

Q:  What did her letters say, if you can remember?

A:   How she was disappointed in how the night went and how she had been
trying so hard, and she apologized also, and tone-wise almost what I wrote to
her.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. The next document I am  going to mark is 93. It's
an agreement.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've got to get better  copies.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 93 was marked  for identification by the reporter  and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is this the agreement that you offered Nicole?

A:   I believe so.

Q:  Whose handwriting is this agreement?

A:   I don't know. Looks like it may be Skip Taft.

Q:  You authorized Taft to write this on your behalf?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Let me--Whose--Was it your idea or Taft's idea, by the way?

A:   Mine.

Q:  And did you discuss it with Nicole before you offered it to her?

A:   I think so.

Q:  And what did she say?

A:   I didn't think it mattered to her one way or the other, but this letter was
more for me than it  was for her.

Q:  Okay. And do you know when she signed this document?

A:   A lot later.

Q:  Do you know why?

A:   I have no idea.

MR. PETROCELLI: I will mark as the next  exhibit a better copy of this
document, 94, plus an  attachment.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 94 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Take a look at Exhibit 94, Mr. Simpson, and the second page is a letter
from Nicole to Skip, who I take to be Skip Taft, stating:  "It has taken me
until now to sign this agreement. Until recently, I didn't even think we'd
reconcile. Things look good--in fact--better than they've looked in the long
time. Please send a copy to Bruce Clemens and to me. Thanks, Nicole."  And
the last page is an August 8, 1989  letter from Taft to Clemens transmitting
Nicole's signed document. Do you see that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, between January of '89 and  August of 1989 when Nicole
signed the document, were  you separated from her?

A:   No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Except for the times that  we've already discussed,
the three days--

MR. PETROCELLI: Three-day period.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Right.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you having difficulties working  through the incident that occurred
on New Year's Eve?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think we've gone through this in some detail.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What I am focusing on here obviously is the statement by Nicole that she
didn't think "we'd ever reconcile," and she underlines the word "Never," and
I am wondering whether it causes you now to remember--

A:   What?

Q:  --anything more than what you've already  told me about this incident.

A:   No. We never separated. We lived  together--, we took trips together that
spring.

Q:  But as far as you were concerned, the  incident was behind you within a
couple of days after  it occurred. Right?

A:   As far as I was concerned, the incident  was--would never be behind us,
but we went on with  our lives a couple of days after. I mean, we ended up
back together and we took some trips together, and we continued on with our
lives. But I was going to therapy, and we were going to therapy together, so
the incident was still very much alive in our consciousness.

Q:  Did you ever talk to Nicole about why she hadn't signed the agreement?

A:   No.

Q:  Why it was taking her time to sign it?

A:   No. It was up to her.

Q:  Okay. And did you and she ever have discussions about her personal
safety?

A:   No.

Q:  And your assuring her personal safety?

A:   Other than this

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean assuring her  personal safety vis-a-vis
O.J.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  That came up with Dr. Kittay, did it not?

A:   You'd have to ask Dr. Kittay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Next is Exhibit 95. Exhibit  95 is the nolo contendere
plea to the misdemeanor of  spousal abuse plus some related documents.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 95 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Even though Nicole didn't press charges, the prosecutors brought a
complaint against you. Is that right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you pled nolo contendere to the charge of spousal abuse. Correct?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you received what as a penalty?

A:   Basically community service time.

Q:  How many hours?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Did you perform them?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And you also went to see Burton Kittay?

A:   That's correct.

Q:  Okay. And Nicole came with you?

A:   Maybe once or twice she was a part of it, but yes. Not always.

Q:  Now, in Mr. Kittay's letter here, which  is a part of this attachment, is a
letter to Howard  Weitzman dated April 3, 1989. Weitzman was your lawyer
in connection with this spousal abuse proceeding. Right? Is that right?

A:   Pardon me/

Q:  Weitzman was your lawyer?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Kittay writes that you have expressed statements to him assuring the
safety of Nicole.

A:   Pardon me

Q:  Do you see that on the second page there?

A:   Second page of --

Q:   Kittay's letter.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Burton Kittay's letter.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And then on the next page. Mr. Simpson,  in number 6 and 7 at the
bottom, you see you have  promised your wife's safety. Do you see that?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Now, did you and Nicole have discussions  about this--

A:   No.

Q:  --about her safety?

A:   No.

Q:  It was never an issue?

A:   No. That's what this letter [Indicating] was about.

Q:  Excuse me?

A:   That's what this letter [Indicating] was about.

Q:  You're referring to the agreement?

A:   Yes.

Q:   What do you mean by that?

A:   That's what the letter was about.

Q:   How does -- The letter provides a financial disincentive to you to hit her
in the future. Is that right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And that's how you assured her safety. Right?

A:   Well, that's--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Now, you mean--

THE WITNESS: What I gave to her.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --in connection with this  going to therapy and the
other things that he's  testified to

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you tell Dr. Kittay anything  different than what you've testified to in
this deposition about what happened that evening?

THE WITNESS: I don't know if I can talk about what Dr. Kittay and I talked
about.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. You don't have to. You don't have to discuss
anything that Dr. Kittay and you  talked about other than what's set forth in
the letter.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it pretty much covers everything, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't agree with you. He doesn't describe the
incident at all, unless I missed it, Mr. Petrocelli.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it's all about the incident, though.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He doesn't describe the  incident, and he doesn't
have to--your question went to that incident.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q:  I want to know what exactly you told the  doctor about what happened that
night.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And I instruct him not to  answer that question based
upon the psychotherapist  patient privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Dr. Kittay writes that you intend to remain in therapy for an extended
period of time. Did you?

A:   Yes.

Q:  How long were you in therapy all told?

A:   I don't think I ever stopped. I just would call him from time to time as I--
pertaining to when I felt that I needed another perspective, as I stated in the
video.

Q:  How many times did you consult him with respect to spousal abuse
issues?

A:   I think once we--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can tell the number of times.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: I think once we went beyond--  once it was beyond the
court, whatever the court thing  was, I continued to see him, and at that point
it  wasn't about spousal abuse. It was just from time to  time when I needed
another perspective on whatever was  happening.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. Do you know how many sessions you  had pursuant to the court's
order?

A:   No.

Q:  Okay. I would like to show you this other document here called
"Antenuptial Agreement."

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 96 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  This is the prenuptial agreement or the antenuptial agreement that you and
Nicole entered into prior to marriage?

A:   I believe so.

Q:   Okay. And is this the antenuptial agreement that Nicole was trying to
invalidate by inventing claims of spousal abuse?

A:   I believe so.

Q:   Okay. Do you have any basis of-- Withdrawn. Do you know how she
was going to attempt  to invalidate this agreement by inventing claims of
abuse?

A:   It had something to do with this letter  and retroactively--I don't know. It
was an aborted  attempt that never really got much breath.

Q:  But the letter that you gave her said  that if you ever hit her after the date of
that  letter --

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  --then the prenuptial agreement would be torn up. Right?

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:  And the prenuptial agreement was Exhibit 96. Correct?

A:   Correct.

Q:  So all she had to do was invent one episode after the date of the February
1989 agreement. Correct?

A:   Well, she would have to prove it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you're asking him to--

THE WITNESS: She would have to prove it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  She would have had to prove it. Exactly.

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Do you know why she made up a number of  incidents that are dated long
before--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  --February of 1989?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've been through this, and  it calls for
speculation, and don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you have an understanding as to why pre-February 1989 incidents
were invented--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--you are not going to--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  --in the course of these divorce proceedings?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You are not going to answer that. You've gone
through that, and you are asking him to speculate, and--

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not asking--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --his opinion is irrelevant to any--

MR. PETROCELLI: But what if somebody told him?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well. You want more hearsay? You didn t get
enough from Faye Resnick's  depo?

MR. PETROCELLI: Faye has a lot of direct  admissions from Mr. Simpson.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We'll see.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. The next document is  Exhibit 97.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 97 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Have you ever seen this document before?

A:   I don't recall.

Q:  Do you know what it is?

A:   No.

Q:   Do you know whether Nicole was keeping a diary at any time during
your marriage?

A:   I don't believe so.

Q:   Is this one of the documents you saw in jail?

A:   Now that I see these dreams, I'm pretty sure I did.

Q:   Excuse me.

A:   Now that I see this little thing with dreams here, I think--I think I did.

Q:  And that would have been the first time you saw this?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Go to the third page of this. It's--  the fourth page actually. On the side it
says  "3139."

A:   What does it say?

Q:  "3139." Right over here (Indicating).

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've got it right here [Indicating].

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q:   On the left side there, Mr. Simpson, it says, middle of the page,
"Saturday was worse. O.J. picked us up in Cabo. Sunday was a blowup."
Underneath that, "Painful, painful week." Do you see that?

A:   "Saturday was worse. O.J. picked us up"-- I

Q:   "In Cabo."

A:   I don't know what this would be referring to.

Q:  You have no recollection of that event?

A:   What do you mean by picking them up in  Cabo? Is this when they came
down, when Nicole  followed us down to Cabo?

Q:  I don't know when this is. That's why I'm asking you.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, don't speculate, O.J.

THE WITNESS: That's the only time.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: O.J., just don't speculate.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What's the only time?

A:   Pardon me The only time I recall them arriving at Cabo that I wasn't there
may have been that time.

Q:   April '93 when she came with Faye and the children?

A:   She did come to Cabo once in--she did one year in '94, I believe, come to
Cabo later than I did, but I don't know. I can't read this, so I can't--if I could
read it all, I probably could help you.

Q:  Did Nicole used to talk to her--talk to you about her dreams?

A:   I think, she read something, and they told them to write down her
dreams, I believe.

Q:   Do you know when that was?

A:   In my mind that was the therapy she went  to that when she came out of--
I'm speculating. I'm  sorry. I'm speculating.

Q:   What time frame are you referring to?

A:   Before we got back together is what I'm  speculating to, but I--

Q:   The therapy that she was in--

A:   Yeah. It seems like the guy told her to  write her dreams down or
something or she read it  somewhere. I just kind of recall that going on.

Q:   Go to the last page of this--or next to last page. It says on the left side, "I
believe however, that O.J. needs to learn"--

A:   Next to the last page?

Q:   Yeah.

A:   Where?

Q:   Right over here (Indicating).

A:   All right.

Q:   It says, "I believe however, that O.J. needs to learn how to take space
also. He is still very possessive, obsessive and controlling." Do you agree
that you were possessive in your relationship with Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And you're inserting that that means that he was
possessive, obsessive with  her. Right. That's the tone of your question--

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --the import of your  question

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I don't think that  says that at all.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you--

A:   I don't believe so, not the first two, no.

Q:  Were you obsessive with Nicole?

A:   I don't believe so at all.

Q:  Controlling?

A:   I think I'm a controlling person, period.

Q:   And you were controlling with Nicole, too. Right?

A:   I think in my life, in my space, I like my space the way I like my space.

Q:   My question was whether you were also controlling with Nicole.

A:   No.

Q:  What were you--Well, you're controlling generally but not with Nicole. Is
that what you're saying?

A:   Yeah, I think in general that I like my  space. I like things the way I like
things, and  people who come into my life tend to conform to the  way I do
things.

Q:   Did Nicole conform?

A:   Yes. Not the last year we were together,  but certainly before, she did,
yes.

Q:   By last year "[you] were together," what  do you mean?

A:   The last year we're together I wouldn't let her move in, so consequently
she had her space to do whatever she wanted to do.

Q:   1993 to '94?

A:   Yes. Yes.

Q:   Okay. And you were not obsessive towards her. Is that right?

A:   No. Well, I may have been obsessive in that I bought her too many
things, but outside of that--I would be the same way with any girl in my life.

Q:   Okay. Mother's Day of 1994.

A:   Uh-huh.

Q:   Did you go down to see Nicole without being invited?

A:   No.

Q:   You went to Sean's communion on that Saturday?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And then Mother's Day was the next day?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And did Nicole ask you to come down and join the family?

A:   Yes. We had a date--we had a Saturday  night date.

Q:  Now, that Saturday Nicole--apparently you got there really early in the
morning Saturday morning--

A:   Yes.

Q:  --after that incident on the freeway. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Now, on that Saturday you and Nicole were arguing at her mother's
house. Right?

A:   No.

Q:  Nicole left to go home while you were out getting your car washed. Is that
right?

A:   No. Nicole went to my place to sleep while I went and bought Mother's
Day gifts for Judy, Denise, Dominique and Nicole.

Q:  And when you got back to the Brown  residence, Nicole wasn't there.
Right?

A:   She was at my place sleeping.

Q:  And the kids were with the Browns. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And then you went over to--you went  over to the condo with Nicole.
Right?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   She was there sleeping. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you wanted to go out that evening. Right?

A:   No. I kinda went back and forth. I took a nap, and then I woke her up at
8:00 o'clock to go to dinner.

Q:   Now, she said she didn't want to go out. Right?

A:   No. She got dressed and she got to the door, and then she freaked out.

Q:  Okay. Didn't you get on the bed while she was lying on it and straddle
her?

A:   No.

Q:   And sort of force her--

A:   Definitely not.

Q:   Shoulders down, against--pinned her  against the bed?

A:   Definitely not.

Q:  Did you have an argument with her on the bed while you were upset
because she didn't want to go out?

A:   No. She--we got to the door, the car  was warming up, and she freaked
out and said, "Look at  me. I'm having a breakdown. I can't do this."  And I
said, "What's the matter with you?"  And we talked, and she calmed down,
and we went to her mother's house to drop off the night stuff for the kids.
Then we went to the restaurant and had dinner.

Q:  And there was absolutely no incident where you had mounted her or
straddled her on the bed?

A:   None.

Q:  When you awakened her to go out, was she amenable to going out with
you?

A:   Yeah. She got up, took a shower and got dressed.

Q:  So everything was all right until you started to leave, and then all of a
sudden she--

A:   And all of a sudden she just freaked. She was shaking. I mean, I could
visibly see that something was wrong.

Q:   And you had no idea why that was  happening?

A:   Well, it was why I was slowly pulling  away, because that's the way that
she sounded when I  was in--from time to time when I was in Puerto Rico.

Q:  Now, the next day you went to the Browns'  for Mother's Day. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Were relations between Nicole and you  good that day?

A:   Yeah, things were--it was--that's the strange thing about it: Things were
great that day.

Q:  There was no tension?

A:   None. We were laughing. There was some book that Judy had bought for
Nicole, and we were all reading it saying, "This is you, Nicole. This is you
Nicole," and it was really a fun day.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Just answer his questions, O.J.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  As of May 8, 1994, which is this Mother's Day, did Nicole have a will?

A:   Yes.

Q:   When had she made that will?

A:   Just about every time we took a trip, she  wrote out what she had, what
she was doing and who she  was leaving things with. That started very early
in  our relationship, once she started obtaining things,  and I think Lou was
trying to get her to sign, because  I remember seeing something--Lou was
talking to her  that day even about some--because she bought the  house, and
Nicole had been putting something off and  putting it off, and Lou was trying
to get her to fill  out something for a will, and to my knowledge Nicole never
did. But I'm told that there's a signed will somewhere, but I'm also told that--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Never mind. Never mind.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  But you're also told what--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: You cut him off in the middle of a sentence.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I sure did cut him off in the middle of it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why. He was answering the question.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He was not. He was going well beyond the
question.

MR. KELLY: I thought he answered the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   "But I'm also told" what? What are you  told about this will?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Now he is responding to a  question, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. He is not going to  answer that question. We
are not going to get into  that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Get into what

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We are not going to get into--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What is it about this will that you know that you were going to tell me a
minute ago?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question. The will is irrelevant to
any issue in this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: Not if Nicole was making out a will because she feared
for her life.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you can put whatever spin you want on it, but
I'm not going to let him answer that. It's irrelevant.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   How many times did Nicole make out a will to your knowledge?

A:   I know to my knowledge on numerous  occasions when we took trips,
she would write stuff  down; I know to my knowledge once the kids were
born,  she wrote down a broad thing about who gets what, and  I know to my
knowledge Lou Brown had some papers that he wanted her to sign then.

Q:  How many wills do you know that she wrote out?

A:   You call them wills. They were like who would get whatever. If the plane
crashed or if something happened to us, who would get what. Her thing was
totally separate than mine.

Q:  She would write it out in her own handwriting?

A:   I believe so, yes.

Q:   And she would do this every time she took a trip?

A:   No. I think she would--it was like-- I remember at one time I asked her
had she upgraded her will at some point, because she--Nicole had at one point
attained a decent wealth, close to a million-dollar wealth, and I was asking her
at one point had she upgraded her will, and I believe when we were splitting
up, she did again.

Q:   Do you know why Nicole took out Arnelle and Jason in her will on May
8, 1994?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, there is no foundation for that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:   Do you know anything about that?

A:   I never knew that they were in her will.

Q:   So you don't know why they were taken out?

A:   I never knew that they were ever in any will of--I don't know why they
would be in any will of Nicole's, and I was not aware that they were ever in
any will of Nicole's.

Q:   Did she talk to you about making a will out on that day?

A:   No. Well--no. No. I just recall her dad was saying and she--we were
talking, and her dad was saying something, and I felt he wanted her to come
and look at some papers, and Nicole just didn't want to do it.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is a convenient time. We will break until 9:30.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Why don't we start at 10:00 because--I can get here
at 9:30.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's fine.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes the deposition of Orenthal James

EXAMINATION

background. You grew up where?

A:  1967.

at them.

as a youth?

A:  13, 14, 15.

Q:  Couple of years?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Were you put into some institution or reform school at all?

A:  No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You know, this is so remote  and I've been,
I think, more than lenient, but I am not going to let you ask him any
more questions about when he was 13, 14, 15 years old.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, that was my last question.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Good. Good. We're on the same
wavelength.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're on the same wavelength on that one.
Q:  When you--you went to USC for two years. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And graduated in 1969?

A:  I didn't graduate.

player?

Q:  And between 1969 and 1979 did you have any other employment
besides playing professional football?

NAKED GUN trilogy, COCAINE AND BLUE EYES, GOLDIE
AND THE BOXER, and there's others that I just can't recall.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  COCAINE AND BLUE EYES is one movie?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And what's the last one you mentioned?

Q:  Yeah.

Q:  Are there any others where you used a knife?

A:  In FROGMAN.

Q:  That's the only one?

A:  That I know of, yes.

Q:  How many TV pilots other than FROGMAN have you filmed?

A:  I think COCAINE AND BLUE EYES was a pilot, I believe.

Q:  Did you film a pilot called 1ST AND 10?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you work on that project?

A:  What do you mean?

A pilot project of 1ST AND 10?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have anything to do with a property called 1ST AND 10?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What?

A:  I acted in a series called 1ST AND 10.

Q:  It was a sitcom?

A:  Not really, no.

Q:  How long was it on the air?

A:  The years that I was on, I think we were on three or four years.
I'm not sure.

Q:  You had a recurring role?

A:  Yes

Q:  What years were those?

A:  In the 80s.

Q:  Okay. Do you know someone named Eddie Reynoso?

A:  No. I may have, but I don't know.

Q:  Now, the movies that you've acted in, that started sometime
when?

A:  I don't understand the question.

Q:  When did you begin to appear in motion pictures or television
films?

A:  1969.

Q:  And that continued all the way until what point in time?

A:  1993.

Q:  What was the last--The last project you filmed was FROGMAN?

A:  '94. Yeah, '94 it would have been FROGMAN.

Q:  FROGMAN?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And before FROGMAN, one of THE NAKED GUNs?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, when did you first go to work for a television
broadcasting company?

A:  It was '69 or '70.

Q:  What was the company?

A:  ABC.

Q:  And what was your job?

A:  I was a commentator, color commentator.

Q:  During the off-season?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. For football games. Right?

A:  Not so much football. It's probably more track. I mean, I did Irish
hurling, Irish football,
you know, whatever.

Q:  And how long did you work for ABC, that first stint?

A:  I don't know. You know, I'm sure we can give you my--Cathy
Randa would send people my -- what do you call that?

Q:  Resume?

A:  Resume.

Q:  Okay, I would like to have it.

A:  Yeah, because I don't know all this stuff.

Q:  Let me just follow up generally. You don't remember when you
stopped working for ABC the
first stint?

A:  Not really, no.

Q:  Okay. And what was your next broadcasting job?

A:  I signed with NBC in the late 70s, but it wasn't really for sports,
even though I would have done the Olympics if they weren't aborted
in Moscow, and I may have done a Rose Bowl or so for them. I was
more producing film, producing TV shows for them.

Q:  Which shows did you produce?

A:  GOLDIE AND THE BOXER, GOLDIE AND THE BOXER GO
TO HOLLYWOOD. COCAINE AND BLUE EYES, DETOUR TO
TERROR.

Q:  Are these films that you also would appear in?

A:  Yes. HIGH FIVE was one I didn't --I produced and didn't
appear in. It was a pilot.

Q:  Have you directed any film?

A:  No.

Q:  After the NBC production job, what was your next television job?

A:  I believe Monday night football.

Q:  What years were those?

A:  It was in the 80s.

Q:  In the '80s?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. That was with ABC. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then after that what came next?

A:  NBC.

Q:  When was that?

A:  I believe it started in '89.

Q:  And that was still going on as of the time of Nicole's death?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. Have you had any professional acting training?

A:  No.

Q:  Ever taken an acting course?

A:  No.

Q:  You ever take any courses or take any training in connection with
your work as a spokesperson, an actor or commentator?

A:  Voice lessons.

Q:  You mean diction?

A:  Yes. My voice diction.

Q:  How long did you do that?

A:  On and off for a few years.

Q:  Who did you study with?

A:  Arthur Josephs, and I can't think of the other guy's name. I see he
still uses me in his advertisement, but I can't think of his name.

Q:  Who taught you how to act?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There's a lot of people who say no one.
Sorry, O.J.

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

MR. PETROCELLI: You said it, not me.

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  In the course of--In other words, when you did your film role,
you didn't have any training before that; you just showed up and they
told you what to do, and you did it?

A:  No. They--I read the script, and I acted like I thought the person
acted. Most of my acting roles are not too far from me, you know, so
pretty much played myself personality-wise.

Q:  And worked with the directors of those various films?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And other actors on them?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, are there any other companies that you've endorsed
products for besides Chevrolet, Hertz and RCA?

A:  I'm sure there are.

MR. KELLY: I think it was RC Cola.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, RC Cola. You're right.

Q:  Any others come to mind?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have contracts with these companies I just mentioned?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And did you have contracts for these other companies for sort of
long-term sponsorship or endorsement work?

A:  I don't know if it was long-term but those are the ones I recall that
had any kind of  length of time.

Q:  As of the time Nicole died, which endorsement contracts were still
in effect?

A:  Hertz.

Q:  Was that the only one?

A:  Basically, yes. I don't recall. There  may be something that I'm
not thinking about right now, but that's basically it.

Q:  Was there any economic fallout as a result of the 1989 incident?
A:  No.

Q:  Did any of the companies threaten to cancel contracts?

A:  No.

Q:  Did they discuss that with you?
A:  No. No. No.

Q:  Was there any suggestion by them that there might be a problem
with one of your contracts

A:  No.

Q:  --during that period of time?

A:  No.

Q:  And did the subject come up at all in your dealings with these
companies in the year 1989?

A:  I probably discussed it with the chairman of Hertz.

Q:  And what did you tell him?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Was he concerned about your public image?

A:  I don't know. He talked to Nicole, because we went on a vacation
with them later that month, so--

Q:  Month of January?

A:  Yeah, at the end of January we went on vacation with him.

Q:  What's his name?

A:  Frank Olson.

Q:  Excuse me? Frank Olson?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. We are having trouble hearing you this morning, and I'm
very close to you. Was there any economic fallout as a result of your
divorce proceedings in 1992?

A:  No.

Q:  Was there any discussion with any of your employers or
companies for whom you were endorsing products, about your
divorce?

A:  I probably alerted them that I was getting a divorce, yes.

Q:  Did you discuss with Nicole that if she testifies in the divorce case,
it might hurt you economically?

A:  No.

Q:  The subject never came up?

A:  No.

Q:  And did she bring that up with you.?

A:  No. I wanted her to testify.

Q:  Why did you want her to testify?

A:  Because I wanted the truth to come out.

Q:  About what?

A:  Whatever they were alleging.

Q:  Isn't it the case that when she was about to testify, you took her
into the hallway and insisted that she not?

A:  No. The day she was supposed to testify, she didn't show up. She
was in contempt of court; didn't show up.

Q:  And is it your testimony that you had no conversation with her at
all or through your lawyers with her to not testify?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. He is not going to answer
about what his lawyers did.

MR. PETROCELLI: What his lawyers said to Nicole or her lawyers.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He not going to answer--if it went from him
to the lawyers, he is not going to answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want that one.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. You want just if you know what your
lawyers said to Nicole or her lawyers relative to her testifying, you
can answer.

THE WITNESS: I don't think we ever said anything to her about
testifying. I know I didn't. I told her, you know, "You can't not
testify," when she didn't show up. "You have to show up."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You said I think yesterday and also in your video that if Nicole did
not file for divorce, you would have.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Why is that?

A:  Because I didn't want to go a long period of time, and I was
paying would have to pay temporary alimony. I didn't want to go a
year and then decide we wanted to divorce and then go another year
trying to get the divorce. So I just said--I figured it would take a year
almost, I was told it would take a year almost to get a divorce as it
were, and I figured in that length of time, if we didn't want a divorce,
we wouldn't; and if we did, at least it's over.

Q:  Well, if Nicole had indicated she did not want a divorce in
January-February, are you saying you were going to file anyway?

A:  I gave her an ultimatum: Either she files or I was going to file.

Q:  So you made up your mind you were going to get divorced one
way or the other?

A:  Well, not get divorced. File and get the process going.

Q:  And then see if it works out during the process?

A:  Yeah. Yeah. During the process if we didn't, we didn't.

Q:  Nicole was having an affair with someone at around this time,
wasn't she?

A:  I found out, yes, that she was, yes.

Q:  You were trying to find out before the actual separation. Isn't that
true?

A:  What do you mean, "separation"?

Q:  When you and Nicole separated when she left Rockingham?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Before she left Rockingham you were trying to find out from her
friends if she was having an affair. Right?

A:  I asked her.

Q:  And you asked her friends, too. Right?

A:  No. I asked her.

Q:  You asked Cora Fishman.

A:  I asked Cora Fishman much later.

Q:  You did not ask Cora Fishman before Nicole moved out of
Rockingham whether Nicole was having an affair with anyone?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. And the only person you asked was Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And she told you what?

A:  At that time she told me no.

Q:  And you later found out that was untrue. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  You found out she was having an affair with Alessandro. Right?

A:  That's what she told me, yes.

Q:  And when did you first find out?

A:  When she was trying to get back with me.

Q:  In 1993. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you didn't know before then. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  You were--before Nicole moved out of Rockingham you were
upset that this fellow Alessandro was coming over to the house and
eating your expensive caviar and drinking your champagne. Isn't that
right?

A:  No, that's incorrect.

Q:  Didn't you say that to Cora Fishman?

A:  After--this was a year later I said that to Cora Fishman. After I
found out that they had an affair. I was a  little put out that he was at
my house on Christmas having champagne and caviar with me and
they had been having an affair.

Q:  This is a conversation you had with Cora in 1993?

A:  Yes, after I found out that there was an affair. Up to then I didn't
know that there was an affair.

Q:  Okay. So Nicole's infidelity had nothing to do with your splitting
up with her. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Now, what are you talking about?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  In other words, when you and Nicole split up, you had no state of
mind that she was having an affair with anyone. Is that right?

A:  In 19--

Q:  '92 .

A:  In '92 she instigated that. I didn't instigate that.

Q:  Yeah, I know. But when she instigated it, you didn't have any
knowledge or information that she was having an. affair then or ever.
Is that right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. Now, after the 1989 incident you and Nicole had several
arguments about your infidelity. Is that right?

A:  After?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  After January 1, 1989--

A:  No.

Q:  --you and Nicole have a single argument or discussion about your
being unfaithful?

A:  I don't know what she may have talked to the psychologist about
but we didn't discuss it after that, no.

Q:  --After the  '89 incident until the time that she moved out. there
was no conversation between the two of you about your seeing other
women or being unfaithful. Is that right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. Were you faithful during that period of time?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you seeing any other women during that time from January
'89 to the time that you and Nicole split up in early '92?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that either.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You said on your video that Nicole knew how to push your
buttons. What did you mean by that?

A:  Well, I think people who have been together a long time, they
know each other pretty well, you know, push buttons. I don't know.
She knows that I don't like leaving clothes around, and if she's upset,
she leaves her clothes around. You know, just little things. It was
nothing really particularly, but I think people know--I would imagine
your wife knows how to get on your nerves, and you probably know
how to get on her nerves.

Q:  How did Nicole get on your nerves besides not being neat and
orderly?

A:  I don't know. Nicole was not a communicator at times. Sometimes
she'd vent but not discuss, I think probably more than anything
bothered me.

Q:  That personality trait?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Anything else?

A:  Nothing I can think of right now. I'm sure--

Q:  And how did you press her buttons?

A:  She hated the fact that I'm a leaver. You know, I will take off at
times, and that would bother her, if she was venting at me and I
would just take off. I think more than anything in the years we were
together, that's the thing that she expressed to me that irritated her the
most.

Q:  Did she ever express to you that you were too controlling for her?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that you were too possessive of her?

A:  What do you mean 'for her'? She just thought I was a controlling a
person.

Q:  Controlling--She told you that. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And did she tell you you were obsessive towards her?

A:  No.

Q:  Or possessive?

A:  No.

Q:  When Nicole got mad at you would she scream at you?

A:  At times, yes.

Q:  Was it a frequent occurrences?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Would she insult you?

A:  I mean, in the years that I've known her, I believe she has, yes.

Q:  And would she use profanity towards you?

A:  At times.

Q:  Now, when she did that, did you feel like hitting her?

A:  No. I'd leave.

Q:  Okay. Did you scream back at her?

A:  At times.

Q:  And use profanity?

A:  At times.

Q:  Did you break things?

A:  No. See, that's something that I don't  do.

Q:  You never threw anything on the floor or smashed photographs or
broke things. Is that right?

A:  No. No.

Q:  How many times in your relationship with Nicole when you were
having an argument with her did
you find yourself out of control?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If ever.

THE WITNESS: To me, when I think of  '89 when I was trying to
get her out of the room that's   something that I wouldn't have
normally done. So in a sense I felt that I was not in control the way I
would  have liked to have been.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And what about any other incidents?

A:  No.

Q:  What about 1993? Were you out of control then?

A:  No.

Q Okay. And how many times in your relationship with Nicole did
you observe in your view that she was out of control?

A:  I can't answer that.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Are you talking just about arguments, not
about when she was having her  nervous--

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, arguments.

Q:  Arguments with you.

A:  I couldn't--I couldn't--I'm sure there were times that I thought,
you know, she needed to slow down or at least to stop and sit and
think about what she was saying, but I can't specifically name them.

Q:  Because they're too numerous?

A:  No. I just can't specifically--you know, it's just spread out over a
lot of years.

Q:  But you told me that in your case there was only one time.

A:  Uh-huh

Q:  Now I am asking about Nicole. Are you saying that it was more
than once?

A:  Well, when you say "she was out of  control"

Q:  Yeah.

A:  --I mean, my interpretation of that may be different than anyone
else. I would leave whenever I thought it was mindless, so in a sense
to me the situation was out of control and I'd leave.

Q:  How many times did that occur?

A:  I can't--I have absolutely no idea.

Q:  More than a dozen?

A:  Probably over the years, yes.

Q:  More than a hundred?

A:  No, certainly not, no.

Q:  Somewhere between twelve and a hundred.?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Can you make it any closer than that?

A:  No.

Q:  Other than Alessandro, are you aware of any extramarital affairs
that Nicole had?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that. It's been
asked and answered, and I think --

MR. PETROCELLI: You are instructing him not to answer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Since we know Mr. Fuhrman has the right
of privacy,  I think Mr. Simpson has as well.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Was sex an important part of your relationship with Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you enjoyed having sex with her?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you ever have violent or rough sex with her?

A:  No.

Q:  Did Nicole ever complain to you about your need for excessive
attention or admiration?

A:  No.

Q:  That subject ever come up?

A:  No.

Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that you were a manipulator?

A:  Say it to me?

Q:  Yes.

A:  No.

Q:  Did she say you were the king of manipulation?

A:  No.

A:  Okay. She said it to others, I take it, about you?

A:  I heard Kato say that in a deposition.

Q:  Is that the first time you ever heard that?

A:  I may have read it in a deposition of Kato's before, too.

Q:  Have you always been close to your mother?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that the closest relationship with a woman that you've ever had
in your life?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I don't know what you mean by
"close." I mean. If you're talking just on an
emotional basis

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --ask the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  That's what I mean.

A:  You know, I can't answer that. I had a different type of emotional
relationship with Nicole and Marquerite that was as intense and
satisfying as I've had with anyone. A mother is a whole different
thing.

Q:  You said in the video that your mother is your most favorite
person in the world. Is that right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And was that true throughout your life?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did your mom raise you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was your father present in the home?

A:  Not in the home, no.

Q:  During your entire childhood?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that. This is way
too remote.

MR. PETROCELLI: You've instructed him?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me mark this and make it a little easier. This
is a transcript of the 911 call. 98.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 98  was marked for identification by the reporter
and is attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Can you turn to Page 5, line 15, where Nicole says, "Then he
came and he practically knocked my upstairs door down." Is that true?

A:  No.

Q:  You didn't knock the upstairs door down?

A:  No.

Q:  Or did you bang on it really hard?

A:  I knocked on the door. I think that's on the tape, isn't it? This is a
transcript of the tape?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: This is the other one.

THE WITNESS: Pardon me?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: This is the other one.

THE WITNESS: You hear the whole thing on the tape.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  I want--I am asking you what's true and what's false that Nicole
said.

A:  You listen to the tape, and you'll hear that that's false. I knock on
the door and asked, "Why is the door locked?"  And she's talking to
the police officer on the tape that I heard saying, "He wants to know
why
the door's locked, and then he went back downstairs."

Q:  Did you pound on that door?

A:  I knocked on the door.

Q:  Knocked or pound?

A:  I would say knocked.

Q:   Okay. Did you knock real hard?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Yes or no?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. Did she try to get you out of the bedroom because the kids
were sleeping in there?

A:  I never went in the bedroom. The door was locked.

Q:  Okay. Did she try to get you to go downstairs because the kids
were sleeping upstairs?

A:  I would say no.

Q:  Okay. Now, Nicole says on line 20 that  you "wanted somebody's
phone number," and she gave you a phone book.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What phone number did you want?

A:  I wanted phone numbers of this girl that Nicole--of a girl named
Alex and of Keith Zlomsowitzh.

Q:  And why did you want their numbers?

A:  Because I wanted to know what was going on with these people
around my kids.

Q:  You were going to call them up?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you get the phone numbers?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Did you have an argument with Nicole that day about her
having a former boyfriend's number on her speed dial?

A:  No.

Q:  Joseph Perulli in particular?

A:  No.

Q:  That never came up?

A:  No.

Q:  On any other day did that come up?

A:  No.

Q:  On Page 9, Line 10, Mr. Simpson, it says, "I had to read this
bullshit all week in the National Enquirer."

A:  Yeah.

Q:  That statement is attributed to you. You said that. Right?

A:  I may have.

Q:  And what was the Enquirer article about?

A:  I think--I believe the situation they were talking about this whole
this whole--because I didn't--I was in--I don't know what it's about.
but it wasn't about that week. It was about you. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And something in that article upset you.?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And what was it?

A:  It was just something some of her friends were saying about her--
First of all, I didn't want to be in the article, but it wasn't this week.
This was something that had happened previous to this.

Q:  Well, okay. Answer this question first, and then I will get back to
the timing issue: What was it in the article about you that upset you?

A:  It was just this implication that Nicole--O.J. was begging Nicole to
get back together and Nicole didn't want to, and her friends were
saying O.J. wanted her to move back in the house but Nicole didn't
want to, and it was just so the opposite of that, so--it was just so 180
degrees opposite of that, that that bothered me.

Q:  To whom were those comments attributed in the Enquirer?

A:  I don't know, but I'm sure it was one of her friends. To a friend
of Nicole's, is who it was attributed to.

Q:  And had that article come out in the week before this October 25
incident?

A:  No.

Q:  When had it come out?

A:  I think earlier, maybe August.

Q:  Why were you reading about it all week?

A:  Well, I don't think that's correct, the way this is. I think we were
venting about a lot of  things, you know. This argument started about
one thing and, like most arguments, you go into tons of  things in the
midst of an argument so...

Q:  Okay. In Page 3 Nicole states at line 15 that you were going--that,
quote, "He's going"-- excuse me. "He's f...king going nuts." Is that a
fair description of your behavior?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  In your mind, were you going nuts?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. How many arguments had you had with Nicole in the
course of your entire relationship with her when you were screaming
and yelling as loud as you were on October 25, 1993?

A:  That may have been the best one.

Q:  So in your entire relationship you don't think it ever happened?

A:  No, not like this, no.

Q:  Okay. I am reading from a brief your lawyers filed in the criminal
case. It's with regard to this incident. It says you kicked in a French
door to gain entry. Is that true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. You asked him that 15
times. He is not going to answer it again.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you kick in a door to gain entry?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer it. Don't answer the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  What I want to understand, Mr. Simpson, is whether you had
permission to get into that house from Nicole or whether you broke in
without her permission.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We are not going to get back into that.
You've been there and done that.

MR. PETROCELLI: You don't have to make speeches. Just instruct
him, and we will move on.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I didn't think that was a speech.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't take it personally, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand that. I'm not trying to have you
take it personally, Mr. Petrocelli.

MR. PETROCELLI: I know, but, you know, you make a lot of
comments about things that I do that are not true, and I don't feel the
need to respond, and so maybe it would be better if you didn't make
them.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: What comments are those, Dan?

MR. PETROCELLI: See the above.

Q:  At any time from 19---January 1992 until the end of Nicole's
life,did you ever say to Nicole that you have no reason to live now?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever say that to anyone?

A:  No.

Q:  Were you ever so despondent about your relationship--

A:  Oh, I--No, no. I didn't.

Q:  Up to the time Nicole died.

A:  No. No.

Q:  Were you ever so despondent about your relationship with Nicole
that you told someone that you didn't want to live or didn't have any
reason to live?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you at any time ever say to Nicole-- Withdrawn. During the
last six months of Nicole's life, did you at any time say to her words
to the effect, "I don't know what I'm going to do if I see you with
another man"?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever say that to her?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever say that to Judy Brown?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever say at any time during the last six months of Nicole's
life: "If I ever see you with another man, I'll kill you"?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever say that at all?

A:  No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You're up, candy man.

MR. PETROCELLI: No. not quite.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You want to take a break to call Steve?

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

Let me mark as the next exhibit in order, 99, this letter.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 99 was marked for identification by the reporter
and is attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Take a look at Exhibit 99. Do you recognize this document, Mr.
Simpson?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is this in Nicole's handwriting?

A:  Yes.

Q:  This is a letter to you. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And is this the letter that she sent to you or gave to you in mid
March of 1993?

A:  Yes.

Q:  When she delivered the tapes of the wedding and your child's
birth?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What did you do with the original of this letter?

A:  I don't know. It's somewhere in discovery or with someone, I
guess.

Q:  Did you respond in writing to this letter?

A:  No.

MR. PETROCELLI: I need to find something. Take a short break.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and the
time is approximately 11:33.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the
time is approximately 11:40.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Getting back to your background for a minute, what promotional
or other videos did you make in the year 1994?

A:  The Playboy video, a Playboy by-- basically what it was supposed
to be was a traveling man's, the lazy man's workout.

Q:  That's the Playboy video?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Is that where you're shown exercising?

A:  Yes. Stretching basically, yes.

Q:  Did you keep the clothing that you wore in that video?

A:  No, unless it was mine.

Q:  Was it?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  And what about this Juice Plus, what was that about?

A:  It was a concentrated--it's where that they flash-dry juice. I
couldn't drink juice because of my arthritis, but juicing is very good
for you. My arthritis--acidity in orange juice and stuff is stuff that
irritated my arthritis, and this is a way that they could flash-dry it so
you can get all the nutrients and things that you would get in normal
juice. It was really the juice itself, it truly was oranges and, you
know, carrots and everything, and it condensed into a powder and it
condensed into a pill so you can--it was equivalent--if you take this,
it's equivalent to drinking fresh juice because it was truly fresh juice.

Q:  You were paid by a company to promote this product?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And how long were you--What is the name of the company?

A:  Juice Plus was the product. The company is National Safety
Association, I think, something. I can't--

Q:  What did you do for them? Went around making speeches?

A:  Yes, I made a few speeches for them, yes.

Q:  How long before Nicole's death were you involved with Juice
Plus?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  More than a year?

A:  I don't think so.

Q:  Did you make any videos for them?

A:  I didn't really--I don't believe so. I think they may have video'd
me speaking at various events. I don't recall doing a video for them.

Q:  And when was the last--

A:  I may have done a video. I don't recall.

Q:  When was the last event you spoke at for Juice Plus?

A:  I believe in Dallas.

Q:  And when was that?

A:  I don't know. I don't recall.

Q:  In 1994?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Is that the one you saw in court?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Okay. How long have you had arthritis?

A:  I became aware of it--I've had it a while, but it got intolerable
probably around '90, I mean when I felt like I was being crippled by
it.

Q:  In 1990?

A:  Around '90 or so.

Q:  Who treated it?

A:  I first went to Frank Jobe, and it was Frank Jobe. who was
possibly the top orthopedic person, who felt it was arthritis more than
what he could do, and he sent me to Bertram Maltz.

Q:  In the early '90s?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And was Dr. Maltz treating your arthritis up until the time of
Nicole's death?

A:  Yes, basically. yes.

Q:  And what treatment did he prescribe for you?

A:  The main thing he did is he started me on a medication calls
Azulfidine, and I also went to a   nutritionist who treated it a little
differently, about me changing my diet. So I changed my diet and
things got better.

Q:  And when did things get better?

A:  I mean at times. You know, right now things are better, but I do
have relapses, you know. But the pain portion of it, things sometimes
get better. The stiffness and everything is still there, but the pain got
better. I mean, the pain was almost intolerable at one point.

Q:  In 1994 before you went into jail, was the pain ever intolerable?

A:  Maybe once or twice, but not for any length of time.

Q:  And did your arthritis flare up at all in June of 1994?

A:  Possibly, yes.

Q:  When?

A:  I couldn't say explicitly.

Q:  And did you have a--was it in an acute phase on June 11 or June
12?

A:  Acute, I can't do anything. When it's acute, I need help to go to
the restroom so I would say no.

Q:  Was it acute at any time in 1994?

A:  To that degree, not that I recall.

Q:  Okay. And what was the state of your arthritis condition on June
11 and June 12?

A:  I had traveled. When I travel--I play a lot of golf always, but when
I travel and play golf, it's--bothers me more. So, I would say more
than--My feet were bothering me then more than almost anything, but
it was--and I had some swelling.

Q:  Swelling of where?

A:  My joints a little bit and my fingers, and my knees always a little
bit.

Q:  You had swelling in your joints on June 11 and June 12?

A:  A little bit, yes.

Q:  Did you seek any special treatment on those days?

A:  I may have taken--some days I don't take Motrin, and I probably
took Motrin those days.

Q:  Do you remember doing so?

A:  I'm sure I did.

Q:  Were you inhibited in your ability to do any activities on June 11
and June 12th because of arthritis?

A:  You mean was I inhibited in doing or inhibited that I couldn't do?

Q:  That you couldn't do.

A:  I couldn't really shuffle cards. I could deal them, but I had trouble
shuffling them. But that happens to me quite often.

Q:  You played cards both Saturday and Sunday?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  June 11 and June 12?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Did you shuffle when it was your turn?

A:  I don't think I shuffled Sunday. Saturday, I don't recall.

Q:  Did you deal the cards?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And you played golf Saturday, Sunday and were planning
to play on Monday, and Tuesday perhaps. Right?

A:  I try to play every day.

Q:  So the arthritis doesn't prevent you from playing golf. Right?

A:  Just handicaps my game.

Q:  Okay. Was your arthritis bothering your golf game on the 11th and
the 12th?

A:  It always bothers my golf game. If I didn't have--

Q:  More than usual, I mean.

A:  I don't know. I think the traveling and all, I was probably a little
stiffer, but I travel so much that that's not unusual, so--so, I mean, I
play with the handicap.

Q:  Did you do anything for the swelling in your joints other than take
some Motrin, perhaps?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know if Motrin is for swelling.

THE WITNESS: It's not.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's for pain.

MR. PETROCELLI: For pain. Well, let me rephrase the question
then.

Q:  Did you--other than taking some Motrin, did you do anything at all
for your arthritis on June 11 and June 12?

A:  You know, everything--I mean, I don't know how to answer the
question because virtually everything I do, before I go play golf,
stretching; sometimes I wear sleeves on my knees. I've had various--
various analgesics, and I do this all the time. So virtually everything I
do is for my arthritis. Otherwise I'd get up, do a stretch and go play
golf. One of the reasons I get up so early is, because of my arthritis, it
takes me a longer time than most people to stretch to, you know, be
able to function.

Q:  Did you wear sleeves on your knees on June 12?

A:  I may have on my left knee. Not on the 11th, I'm sure, but
probably on the 12th.

Q:  Did you take any medications besides the ones you described? One
was Motrin, and the other one was this other drug you mentioned.

A:  I don't think I was taking the Azulfidine during this period of time.

Q:  So you weren't taking any prescribed drugs at all for arthritis on
June 11 and June 12. Is that right?

A:  I don't think so, yeah.

Q:  And you don't--You may have taken some Motrin.

A:  I'm sure I took Motrin.

Q:  Okay. And did you receive any particular medical treatment for
your arthritis on those two days?

A:  Other than the Motrin, no.

Q:  Is Dr. Maltz the only doctor who treated you for arthritis in the
'90s?

A:  Other than the nutritionist.

Q:  What's the nutritionist's name?

A:  Oh, jeez. Well, I'm embarrassed. She has a line of vitamins out.
Maybe ---I can't think of her name. I can get it for you easily.

Q:  Okay. Is there a name for the arthritis that you have?

A:  From what they told me, I have--well whatever is normal arthritis
that I think many athletes might sustain, and then there's rheumatoid,
and I was showing signs of rheumatoid arthritis.

Q:  When did you start showing signs of rheumatoid arthritis?

A:  You'd have to ask them. I just went by  what Dr. Jobe and what
Dr. Bertram Maltz told me.

Q:  Okay. Did you tell Nicole in May or June of 1994--Withdrawn.
Did you have a conversation with Nicole in May or June of 1994
when she said in words or in substance to you, "How dare you buy
my friends. How come you're buying my friends?"

A:  In substance--when she called me and yelled at me, in substance
that's what she was saying.

Q:  Did she also say to you, "You took my friends away. You took
my family"?

A:  No.

Q:  She never said anything like that to you--

A:  No.

Q:  --in those same conversations?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. And what did you understand her to mean when she was
talking about your buying her friends?

A:  I'd say in substance--I don't think she used that word, but in
substance she was saying something about "Leave my friends alone"
and stuff, and I didn't know.

Q:  Had you just entered into any financial deals with any of her
friends?

A:  I don't understand the question.

Q:  Had you made any business dealings with any of her friends in the
three months before she died?

A:  Well, Christian I consider my friend also, and Christian performed
a service for me and he was paid for that service.

Q:  When did you make this deal with Christian?

A:  I can't say that we made a deal. He and I three or four months
previous to this started working on this possible--a possible project,
yeah. I would say we started about three, four months before June.

Q:  Was that the Playboy video?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Yes?

A:  Yes.

Q:  So Christian was involved in that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And he got paid?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Who paid him.?

A:  I did.

Q:  How much did you pay him?

A:  $5,000, which was just sort of a-- $5,000.

Q:  When did you pay him the $5,000?

A:  Probably in May.

Q:  In--

A:  After I did the video.

Q:  --1994?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was that the first business dealing you had with Christian
Reichardt?

A:  You know, it depends how you look at it. He did a lot of--I went
to his office often, so, you know, if that's business, that was
business.

Q:  Was that the first time you paid him any money?

A:  I just can't recall if we paid him for helping--he--I don't know if I
paid him or if he did it as a friend for some--you know, some
chiropractic work that he did for me.

Q:  Was that the first time you recall paying him any money.?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did Nicole say to you in May or June of 1994, "If you
really want this marriage to work out, you're gonna have to go to
therapy to control your anger"?

A:  No.

Q:  Anything like that?

A:  No.

Q:  Did she ask you to go see a therapist in May or June of 1994?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you see a therapist in May or June of 1994?

A:  Yes.

Q:  This is after you and she split up on Mother's Day. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You saw Burt Kittay?

A:  I talked to Burt.

Q:  Is that the therapist you're talking about?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  You talked to him on the phone?

A:  Yes.

Q:  How many times?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  This is between Mother's Day and Nicole's death.

A:  I don't know.

Q:  More than once?

A:  I don't think so, but possibly.

Q:  Were these professional consultations or just friendly
conversations?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, when you say you talked to a
therapist--

MR. PETROCELLI: They could be talking to play golf.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. If there is anything about
psychotherapy, that's what he wants to know.

THE WITNESS: Possibly.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You're not--Excuse me. You're not sure?

A:  Any conversation I may have had with him would have been in
connection with Paula, so possibly.

Q:  Not in connection with Nicole?

A:  Not in connection with Nicole.

Q:  Did he charge you.?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Okay. How long were the conversations?

A:  I don't know. I know I joined him and Cathy at lunch once, and
other than that, as I said, I don't have no real memory of flat-out
talking to him about--for service.

Q:  Where was the lunch?

A:  At a place called--I believe it's called the Marquis West.

Q:  Where is that?

A:  Right out here, over here somewhere next to his office.

Q:  Where is his office?

A:  Was on Santa Monica Boulevard.

Q:  And tell us about that conversation.

A:  I don't think I want to tell you about if  it was professional
conversations that he and I had.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If Cathy was there, it's waived.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, well, I don't recall exactly what--Cathy was
there, and we were talking about the food, you know, and I may have
asked his opinion about Paula, how to make things easier with--you
know, for Paula, what I should look for, because I knew I had hurt
her before.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  It's your testimony that the--you did not discuss at all Nicole in
that conversation?

A:  I believe not. I may have mentioned that, you know, Nicole and I
was through, but any conversation I had with him wasn't really
concerning Nicole.

Q:  And when you were talking about Paula--

A:  I may have. Now, I'm not sure if I did at all, but I'm almost
positive I would have brought Paula up if Burt was there.

Q:  Can you tell me anything else that was said in that conversation?

A:  No.

Q:  How long was it?

A:  I don't know. I came; they were having lunch. and I left and they
were still having lunch.

Q:  Is that the only time you specifically remember talking to Burt
Kittay during this time frame of  May and June of 1994?

A:  Yes. I may have talked to him on the phone once coming from
Palm Springs.

Q:  Weekend of Memorial Day?

A:  Yes.

Q:  By the way, during that weekend did you have the children on
Thursday and Monday.?

A:  Of what weekend?

Q:  Memorial Day weekend '94.

A:  Maybe Monday but not Thursday. I didn't have them Monday. I
think Sydney came by Monday. But Thursday, no.

Q:  And Friday.?

A:  No.

Q:  But maybe Monday?

A:  Maybe Monday.

Q:  Who set up this meeting with Burt Kittay?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Which meeting you talking about?

MR. PETROCELLI: The lunch meeting.

THE WITNESS: I don't think it was set up. I think I went to the
office, and Cathy said she was going to lunch with Burt, if I wanted
to join them and I said if I had time I would, and I think I did spin by.
They were already having lunch. I picked off their plates and left.--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Earlier you said that this was a conversation about professional
consultation. You didn't want to describe it to me. What did you
mean, "professional consultation"?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said it may have been.

THE WITNESS: It may have been. I'm not sure if I brought up
Paula. I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Paula, and I may have
asked for advice from him about that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What advice?

A:  I'm sorry. What?

Q:  What advice did you ask him?

A:  About how to make it easier for Paula and what I should look for,
because in getting back with Paula, I had hurt her before and, you
know. I guess it was a trust issue.

Q:  When you and Paula got back together during this time frame, did
you and she have any discussions about Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:  Did she say to you in words or in substance, "I'm concerned about
resuming my relationship with you because I don't want to get hurt
again if you leave me for Nicole again"?

A:  No.

Q:  That never came up?

A:  Never.

Q:  When you picked her up at the airport or met her at the airport--I
guess you said you surprised her--did--you and she had a
conversation about getting back together?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We are not going back through this. I
instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you and she have a conversation about getting back together
and the impact on her of your breakup with Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's asked and answered. I am not going to
allow him to go back through that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Tell me everything that you and Paula discussed concerning Nicole
during the months of May and June.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Same. I'm not going to allow him to do that.
Not only that, it's overbroad.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is it your testimony that at no time before Nicole's death in the
month of May and June you and Paula discussed Nicole? Is that your
testimony?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's been asked and answered also. Don't
answer that either.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  When did you and Paula get back together?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We have been all through that. Don't answer
that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Did you and she become monogamous in May or June of 1994?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's been asked and
answered, and it invades his right of privacy.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Did Paula ever ask you if you killed Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Asked and answered. Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  When Paula visited you during the week of  June 13, did she ever
discuss with you your involvement in Nicole's death?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. That's been asked and
answered as well.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't agree with any of these, by the way--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand.

MR. PETROCELLI: --but we will take care of it later on.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Did Paula come to visit you in prison?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Asked and answered. Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think--any of these  have been asked and
answered.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he talked about it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think so, Mr. Baker, but--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If I'm wrong, we will check it at the--we
will run it through the computer at the lunch break.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Did you have any visits with Paula in the jail cell?

A:  Pardon me? Say that again.

Q:  Did she visit you in your jail cell?

A:  No.

Q:  Never?

A:  Never.

Q:  Well, when you were in jail, did she come to visit you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Where?

A:  Attorney room.

Q:  Okay. Well, that's--you understood that's what I meant, didn't
you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. You said "jail cell."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Well, you understand what I mean.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: I want to make sure I'm not-- he is not
withholding important information on some hypertechnical
interpretation of my questions.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You want to just answer the questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am sure he wouldn't want to mislead anyone.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't get snotty.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you know, I think that's an inappropriate
response, but we will go back.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Tough. I don't really care what you think.

MR. PETROCELLI: I know you don't, and I'm not trying to please
you, Mr. Baker. I am trying to do my job.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: The question was "jail cell."

MR. PETROCELLI: One Baker is enough. Okay? I don't need two.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Your point is well-taken on that.

MR. BREWER: It's 12:00. Do you want to just--

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me just wrap this up here on this point.

Q:  She visited you in the attorney room. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  A number of occasions. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you had many, many telephone conversations. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And if any of those conversations in the jail--in the attorney room
or on the telephone, did she ask you if you killed Nicole?

A:  I don't ever recall her asking me that.

Q:  Did you tell her?

A:  I'm sure I did.

Q:  What did you tell her?

A:  I'm sure I did. I don't remember any specific conversations, but I
think anybody who heard me speak during that time once I was
arrested, I've said many, many times, "Why are they doing this to
me? I didn't do this," and basically that was my attitude.

Q:  Did Paula ask you where you were on the evening of June 12 at
any time?

A:  Not that I recall.

Q:  Did you ever ask Paula if she listened to the messages you left her
on June 12?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever tell her to erase those messages?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever tell her if she could make copies of them or to
retrieve them?

A:  No.

Q:  Did she ever discuss with you those messages?

A:  No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. I'm prepared to keep going, but did you
want to break for lunch now, Mr. Baker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think it was candy man that was kind of
interested in groceries. No, it was Michael.

MR. BREWER: It wasn't me. You were getting into colloquy, so I
thought it would be a good time to break.

MR. PETROCELLI: Is the lunch here?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, we will stop now, and start up
again in an hour and finish up.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the
time is approximately 12:04. At the hour of 12:04 p.m., a luncheon
recess was taken, the deposition to resume at 1:04 p.m.

At the hour of 1:15 p.m., the deposition of ORENTHAL JAMES
SIMPSON was resumed at the same place, the same persons being
present.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the
time is approximately 1:15.

EXAMINATION  Resumed

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Prior to Nicole's death, did you used to keep your gates open?

A:  Years ago, before we got dogs.

Q:  When did you stop keeping your gates open?

A:  Probably mid '80s.

Q:  And when you got dogs, then you closed them up all the time?

A:  Well, in the beginning we didn't, but I would say probably closer
to the late  80s, SPCA--we started getting a lot of complaints, and into
the '90s a lot of complaints from the SPCA, so we had to start closing
up.

Q:  The Rockingham gate can open and close manually, can it not?

A:  Yes.

Q:  In fact, it was demonstrated on the video that you put out that it
opened and closed manually. Right?

A:  I don't think so.

Q:  When you walked down the Rockingham driveway, you opened
up the gate?

A:  Yeah, I did open it up manually. We weren't making that as any
demonstration, yes.

Q:  Yeah. How do you make the gate work manually as opposed to
automatically?

A:  You have to disengage a lever on the machine box.

Q:  Can you do anything at the location of  the gate itself to take it off
of--

A:  Well, the machine box is over in the bushes that connects--the arm
that connects to the gate to pull it open or not. At the end of the box is
a--you can--there's a lever you can disengage, and then it's fully
manual.

Q:  If you're standing outside your property, can you disengage the--

A:  No.

Q:  --automatic feature of the gate and cause it to open and close
manually?

A:  No.

Q:  It's impossible?

A:  Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Be a great security system, wouldn't it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Not unless you're the only one who knew about
it.

Q:  The--Do you ever keep that gate on manual when you leave the
property?

A:  It's not been my habit to, no.

Q:  Have you ever done that?

A:  I might have in my life, yes, but I don't recall when, other than
when we shot the video.

Q:  Was the gate used to your knowledge in a manual mode on June
12?

A:  I don't believe so. no.

Q:  Are you sure about that?

A:  I'm pretty sure about that, yes.

Q:  You recall all of your trips out the Rockingham gate and in the
Rockingham gate, and do you think any of them occurred when the
gate was on manual mode?

A:  No.

Q:  If you were outside your property and you  wanted to get inside
and you didn't have a key, how would you do that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Are you talking about outside the physical
walls of his property?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. I didn't know if you were talking
about outside the house, because a key doesn't open the gates, is
why.

MR. PETROCELLI: A key opens the Rockingham gate, doesn't it?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you've got a clicker.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE WITNESS: A key opens the Rockingham gate.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh,the Rockingham. I'm sorry. You're
right, the Rockingham.

THE WITNESS: So--

MR. PETROCELLI: He'll say you're right, but he won't say I'm
right.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You're right,

Mr. PETROCELLI. I apologize.

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record. Okay.

Q:  What's the answer, Mr. Simpson?

A:  I don't know if that's ever happened to me. It has happened to me,
but Justin was with us. So outside of that, it's just never happened to
me.

Q:  What has never happened to you?

A:  That I was outside the gate and nobody was inside to let me in and
I didn't have a key or a control.

Q:  Well, when you had Justin, how did you get him to open it up for
you?

A:  Justin can--actually, there was two bars that he can actually walk
through on the gate, and then he'd go and push the gate opener.

Q:  And I take it you can't fit through those bars. Right?

A:  No. No. No.

Q:  Have you ever jumped any of your fences?

A:  Since I've owned the house?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Which ones?

A:  Down where the tree grows through the wall.

Q:  Which wall?

A:  The Ashford wall.

Q:  And near the Ashford gate?

A:  Well, I can't say it's near it. In terms of the wall, it's about
halfway down my property.

Q:  Here is Exhibit 85. Where have you jumped the fence on your
property?

A:  Right about here [indicating].

Q:  Okay. You are pointing to the tree on the east side--northeast side
where the word "Lawn" appears. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And would you just climb over that fence?

A:  Well. there's a tree that grows through it, so you can kind of step
on the branch--maybe a little taller now than when I did it but you
would have to step on the branch and then just go over the wall.

Q:  Then you're in the backyard?

A:  Yes.

Q:  When was the last time you did that?

A:  I don't know. '80s.

Q:  And have you ever gone over any of these other perimeter walls to
your property?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. And would you have been able to do so in June of 1994?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Speculation. Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  How would one have jumped the walls? Where can you climb the
walls on your property?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Other than where he just told you?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Yes, other than the one area in the northeast quadrant of your
property that you just identified.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And when you say you can climb these
walls, you mean him physically can climb any of the walls?

MR. PETROCELLI: A person. A person.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Bruce Jenner maybe?

MR. PETROCELLI: Bob Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: None. None without a crane.

MR. KELLY: Pure speculation.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Again, Mr. Simpson.

A:  I don't know. I think a motivated person  probably could climb the
walls.

Q:  You could climb the fence--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Your process server did it.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, he didn't.

Q:  You could climb the fence at Rockingham. There are some trees
around here [indicating] near the north of the Rockingham gate.
Right?

A:  I never have, and I never have seen anyone do it.

Q:  Is it possible to do?

A:  I would think anything's possible, yes.

Q:  Now, you can get on the Salingers' property, which is on the
south side, by simply walking from the sidewalk right up to the
property. Correct?

A:  Yeah, down their driveway to their house, yes.

Q:  And then you can walk up to the south side of your property on
the Salingers' side of the fence. Right?

A:  I suppose you could.

Q:  And you can walk all the way down that property until you come
to the area opposite, oh, Kato Kaelin's room. Right?

A:  I really don't know.

Q:  Why not?

A:  Because I don't know.

Q:  There is a carport back there, isn't there?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you can climb on that carport and jump that fence, can't you?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Do you think that's impossible to do?

A:  I think it would be very difficult.

Q:  Why? What would be the obstructions that you would encounter?

A:  Thick foliage. I haven't really looked at the carport, but I would
imagine it would be pretty tough to just climb on top of a carport. I
don't know if they have any lattice work that would help you climb up
there or not. And it would seem to me, and  I'm just flat-out guessing,
that if you got as high as a roof, those--the Eugenia bushes get thicker
as they go up. I would imagine it would be dangerous coming through
there.

Q:  The--your property--the level of your property is higher than the
level of the Salingers'. Right?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Where on his property,

MR. PETROCELLI: South side there.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are you talking about his roof or the--

MR. PETROCELLI: No. The ground level.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The ground level?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: I would--I believe so. I'm not a hundred percent
sure of that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  By how many feet? Do you know?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  About three feet?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  So you know of no way along the south side of your property that
you could, if you didn't have a key, get from the Salingers onto your
property. Is that right?

A:  Unless you're climbing something. I don't know of a way to do it,
no.

Q:  Is there an easy place to climb over on the south perimeter?

A:  I don't know. I've never really--

Q:  Across the south perimeter of your property?

A:  I've never really paid attention to it. Other than back here
[Indicating] where that so-called glove was found, I don't--I've never
paid attention to it.

Q:  Well, since this whole situation occurred, have you investigated
whether or not the fence could be climbed in that area opposite
Kaelin's room?

A:  I looked at the fence and thought it would be difficult to climb that
fence without sustaining some type of injury. I mean, it would be--
you'd have to be really motivated to do it.

Q:  What kind of injury might you sustain?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Speculation.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You mean from the sharp edges on the top of the fence?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Going now to the east--southeast corner of your property,
is there a way to access the property from that corner or, for that
matter, from the east side of the property?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  There is a neighbor whose property is directly east of yours?

A:  A couple of neighbors.

Q:  Yeah. Is that vacant land there? Do you know?

A:  No. Well, on one--now the--yeah. One of them is vacant, yes.

Q:  Was it vacant in June of '94?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  What separates your property from the neighbor directly to the
east?

A:  Which one?

Q:  Right here in the corner [Indicating], southeast corner.

A:  I would imagine a fence and some pretty thick foliage.

Q:  And how high is that fence?

A:  I've never looked at it.

Q:  Is the fence that extends down the south side of your property
between your house and the Salinger property the same height all the
way down to the corner?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  And is there a fence that extends northerly from the southeast
quadrant?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Same height as the south fence?

A:  I never looked at it. I don't know.

Q:  Okay. So do you know whether one could climb that fence if they
were so motivated?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  The only time you're aware of anyone accessing your property
without a key is when Justin did so with you?

A:  No. I know that various friends would climb the wall here
[Indicating].

MR. PETROCELLI: One second. [Telephone interruption.]

Discussion held off the record.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. Where on your property do you know your friends have
jumped the wall or the fence to get on your property?

A:  Right about the area that I spoke of  [Indicating].

Q:  Just in that northeast corner where the big tree is?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  That's the only place you're aware of?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Have you given anybody instructions at any time that if they need
to get on your property without a key, that's the way to get on?

A:  I may have implied that, yes.

Q:  To whom?

A:  Years ago this guy Schulman used to have a basketball game, and
they played at my house on weekends, friends of his, and not bother
us in the house. If we were home or not, they would jump the wall
there.

Q:  That's John Schulman?

A:  Ricky Schulman.

Q:  Rick Schulman. Is that Linda's husband?

A:  Yes.

Q:  The--In your video you make a point of showing that if someone
wanted to get inside the house from that pathway behind Kaelin's
room, they could enter one of two doors: One into the laundry room
and the other one into the garage. Do you recall that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you also point out that the garage door opens outward, so
even if it were jammed up, you could still open the door.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you recall that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you know what was in that garage where the door is on June
12, 1994?

A:  I think a--I didn't know at the time.I saw a picture in jail, and it
appeared to be a--kind of a chest.

Q:  A chest of drawers?

A:  No. I think it was an Oriental chest of some sort and with some
things on it.

Q:  Blocking the door?

A:  Yeah, blocking access to walk--if you were trying to go that way,
you would have had to climb the chest; then open the door. If you
wanted to go from inside to outside. that's what it appeared.

Q:  What if you wanted to go from outside to inside? You would open
the door and then you would--

A:  Climb the chest.

Q:  Then you would be confronted with the chest?

A:  I would think so.

Q:  And how high is that chest?

A:  If I recall, probably this table [Indicating].

Q:  Conference room table, about--

A:  Yeah, maybe a little taller than this.

Q:  --three feet, four feet. Is that about right?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay. Was anything on that chest to your knowledge?

A:  I don't know. You know, I saw a picture, so I would have to see
the picture to refresh myself. So other than that, I don't know.

Q:  Do you know whether there was anything in front of that chest
such that if you moved the chest out of the way, you know, you
would be confronted with some other obstacle?

A:  It would be pretty tough because I know my car is in there, so
there must have been some-- had to be some room. I'm just guessing
now, so you'd have to show me a picture. Otherwise I'm flat-out
guessing.

Q:  I take it that was not a door that you used to enter into or leave
from at or around June of 1994. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And when was the last time you recall using that door for access?

A:  The garage door?

Q:  Yeah. The one going out to the south side.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: When you say "for access," do you mean to
access to the house or to the garage?

MR. PETROCELLI: To the house--to the garage.

THE WITNESS: As of when?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  When is the last time you remember using the door?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Before June--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  June 12, 1994.

A:  Before June 12.

Q:  Yeah.

A:  I don't know. I don't have a memory of it.

Q:  Okay.

A:  I've used it, I know, but I just don't have a memory of when.

Q:  It had been a while since you used it it prior to June 12. Right?

A:  I would think so, but I'm not sure.

Q:  Was that door on the Westec alarm, that outside garage door?

A:  I doubt it.

Q:  And there is no keypad there, is there?

A:  No.

Q:   Is there a keypad on the door that goes into the residence from the
garage?

A:  Yes.

Q:  On the outside of the door in the garage?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And the laundry room door, is that a door that you were--you or
others using your house used regularly in June 1994?

A:  I don't know about regularly, but it was a door that was used.

Q:  Do you know whether there was anything obstructing that door
from being used in June of 1994, June 12th to be specific?

A:  Normally you could--you could as if-- if I was--the other day I
went out that door, and there's always a little--when you go to the
various rooms and you take dirty laundry and you put it on it and you
end up dropping that right there, so you have to kick it out of the side.

Q:  You have to kick what out of the side?

A:  This little laundry, you know--

Q:  A basket?

A:  Yeah, a basket.

Q:  A plastic basket?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  So that would be the only thing that you believe would have been
blocking that door, is a laundry basket?

A:  Sometimes you'll have an empty Sparkletts bottle or something
there, but they're never any problem to move aside.

Q:  Does that door open inward or outward?

A:  I believe inward.

Q:  And is that door on the Westec or was that door on the Westec
alarm in June of '94?

A:  I would think so.

Q:  Is there a keypad on the outside of that door?

A:  No.

Q:  Or on the inside?

A:  Near the inside but not at the inside.

Q:  Okay. When was the last time what was the last time prior to going
to jail on June 17 that you were in the area of the air conditioner on
that pathway behind Kaelin's room?

A:  On the 13th.

Q:  What were you there for on the 13th?

A:  There was talk about something was outside of Kato's room, and
and I don't know. I think possibly that ski mask or--I don't know.
Something was found, and we walked out there to see what was out
there.

Q:  This was in the evening?

A:  Yes.

Q:  This is after the police had left and you had come back from your
office and you were at Rockingham. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And it was dark out by then. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  Still light out?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What time was it?

A:  I don't know. 5:30, 6:00 o'clock maybe.

Q:  And who did you go back there with?

A:  I don't remember. I think Kardashian may have been with me, and
there was somebody else with us, too, but I can't--I can't recall. I
know there was two or three of us that walked back there.

Q:  Now, what was your purpose in going back there?

A:  I don't know. Curiosity.

Q:  No other purpose?

A:  No other purpose I can think of.

Q:  And what did you determine, if anything, when you went back
there?

A:  Nothing.

Q:  How did you get back there?

A:  Walked out of the washroom door.

Q:  That laundry room?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And were you able to walk past ---did you walk past the air
conditioner?

A:  I didn't, no.

Q:  Are you able to?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Physically?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You can squeeze by it?

A:  Oh, yeah.

Q:  Okay. Between the air conditioner and the fence there is enough
clearance for you to get by it?

A:  No. You kind of duck under it.

Q:  Duck under it?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Before June 13 when was the last time you were back in that area?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  When is the last time you know for sure you were back there?

A:  I--for sure I don't know. I know I'd had to go back there a few
times to do things like light the water--I mean light the heater.

Q:  Where is the water--the water heater?

A:  I guess--no. Just the heater. The house heater goes out sometimes,
and I had to go back there a few times for that and --

Q:  Where is that heater?

A:  Right outside that door before you get down the walkway.

Q:  West of it?

A:  West of where the air conditioner is; east of the laundry room
door.

Q:  On this map here, this sketch, Exhibit 85, you have "Kaelin's
Room," right, and you have "Office." That's the office that adjoins
Kaelin's room. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then where is the laundry room?

A:  Here. The laundry room would be here [Indicating].

Q:  Okay. Just immediately east of the  garage. Right?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And where is the heater?

A:  Heater is here [Indicating].

Q:  Okay. So right about here [Indicating]. I will put an H there.

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay. And when was the last time that you went to the heater
before June 12 ,'94?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  So you have no recollection in 1994 of ever having been in that
south pathway. Is that right?

A:  That's not correct. I know at some point in time I was back there
for not only the heater, but also for the lighting. Sometimes I have
power outages, and you have to go hit the whatever you call, switch,
but I don't recall.

Q:  Where is the switch?

A:  Right here [Indicating].

Q:  Right next to the heater?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay.

A:  No. No. Right here [Indicating]. Across from here.

Q:  Right here  [Indicating]?

A:  No.

Q:  Why don't you put it.

[Witness complies.]

Q:  You put an X there. Okay?

A:  Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: I will make this another exhibit.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Fine.

MR. PETROCELLI: H for heater. X . . .

Q:  Now, do you have any other purpose in 1994 for going back in
that south pathway?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. And are you telling us that you know for sure you went
back there in 1994 before June 13?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you did so in order to turn fix the lights or fix the heater?

A:  Yes. It's a regular occurrence at my house.

Q:  What is?

A:  Either the heater doesn't come on or one of the switches go off. So
portions of my house, the light doesn't work. It's something that, you
know-- and since I've been out of jail, I've done on numerous
occasions.

Q:  Now, when you did that in 1994, did you--how did you get to that
location?

A:  I'd go out the washroom door.

Q:  And then you would head west. Right?

A:  No. East.

Q:  East. Excuse me. And when was the last time before June 13,
1994 that you had gone down as far as Kaelin's room?

A:  I have no idea.

Q:  When was the last time in any year that you've been down there?

A:  I don't know. I don't have a recollection. I've done it, obviously,
on occasions, but I don't have any recollection at this point.

Q:  Why do you say you have "done it obviously, on occasions"?

A:  Well, because it's my property. I built that. My cable wires run
back there. We play a game with my kids that you can go anywhere
on the property and hide, and, you know, some times you look back
there if they're back there, those kinda things.

Q:  Do you recall you being back there in 1994?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. In 1993?

A:  I'm sure I did, but I don't recall when and what.

Q:  And it was playing hide-and-seek with your kids?

A:  Possibly. Possibly.

Q:  Did you have any other reason for going as far as Kaelin's room?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Why.?

A:  The fire department each year gives you a thing about your
property, so you have to go and look and see what they tell you you
got to move.

Q:  And what did they tell you?

A:  Oh, from time to time you have wood. I think it was too much
wood back there at one time. At one point it was the leaves had to be
cut back.

Q:  Where would the wood be that had to be moved?

A:  I believe it was all the way back here [Indicating].

Q:  To the corner. Right.?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  And when is the last time you recall going back there before June
13?

A:  I don't have a real memory of any specific time going back there. I
just know I've been back there on numerous occasions.

Q:  If you had to go back there to get wood in that southeast corner,
would you access that location from the other side of the property;
from your backyard, that is?

A:  No.

Q:  You could. Right?

A:  I would imagine so, yes.

Q:  So right now, though, you don't have any specific recollection of
going as far as back as Kaelin's room in 1993. Is that right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay.

A:  1994, you said.

Q:  And 1993.

A:  I know I did. I just don't know specifically when and, you know,
what.

Q:  What's the lighting back there? What was it in June of '94?

A:  Whatever God gave it.

Q:  There is no artificial lighting. Right?

A:  None.

Q:  So it's completely dark at night down there. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And that's what it was like in June of '94. Right?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Does the neighbor have sprinklers that wet the south pathway?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  You know, get it wet when they go on?

A:  I don't know.

MR. PETROCELLI: I will make a copy of this and mark that as
Exhibit 100, I guess.

[Plaintiffs' Exhibit 100 was marked for identification by the reporter
and is attached hereto.]

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know whether the garage door was kept locked in June of
1994?

A:  Which door?

Q:  The one that leads from the garage to the south pathway.

A:  I don't have any specific thought of that, no, one way or the other.

Q:  Okay. And what about that laundry room door, was it kept locked?

A:  Kept locked.

Q:  And you had a master key. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Which would have worked on the laundry room door. Right?
A:  Yes.

Q:  And the garage?
A:  I believe so, yes. It wasn't our the garage door was normally not
kept locked. But...

Q:  Not kept locked?

A:  Normally not. I don't know if it was that period of time or not.

Q:  Did you the last three years before June of 1994 ever call someone
to fix the heater?

A:  I'm sure I did.

Q:  Who did you call? Do you know?

A:  I don't handle that. Michelle you'd have to ask Michelle about
those things.

Q:  And who handled the cable?

A:  Whoever does cable in the area.

Q:  Have you carried wood back to that corner of the house, the
southeast corner?

A:  No.

Q:  How did the wood get there?

A:  I think they cut down a tree.

Q:  In that area?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Now, do you ever go there and get wood for your fireplace?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know--Excuse me. In June of 1994 did you know any of
Nicole's neighbors at Bundy?

A:  No. No.

Q:  Do you know any of their names?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever speak to any of them?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Which ones?

A:  The person who shared the building that she was in, and I had an
occasion to briefly talk to the person who lives just north of her. You
know, they have a common--well, just--I don't know if they're
condos or what, but the one just north of her.

Q:  Those are the only two neighbors you recall talking to?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And did you talk to them a number of occasions or just once?

A:  The neighbor that shared the building with her--

Q:  Yeah.

A:  --I talked to from time to time because our kids would play when
he had his daughter, I believe. The neighbor to the north, only--
Nicole's in an argument with him and I kinda got into it a little bit, but
that was the only time--

Q:  That was about dogs?

A:  Dogs and leaves and dog doo.

Q:  When was that argument?

A:  In late May.

Q:  '94?

A:  Yes. Mid to late May.

Q:  Is that when you went over with your-- with Jason in the car--I am
sorry--Justin?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Was that another occasion?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was that at night?

A:  I was coming over for--I don't know. I don't know. It was in the
afternoon. I do know that. I--it was light, and it was afternoon.

Q:  Did there come a time after you split up with Nicole in May where
you told her, as you had in previous years of your relationship, "I
don't want to communicate with you except if it relates to the kids"?

A:  I don't think I ever--after she. yelled at me, I think I told my
office, and I think through the office she got the word. I know she
called me after that, and I didn't return her call.  So I don't think I
technically ever said to her, "I don't want to communicate with you
other than through the kids." I think I just started doing it.

Q:  Did you ask someone to convey that message for you, such as
Cathy.?

A:  I don't think so. I don't think so.

Q:  And you believe she got that message because why? She was--

A:  Because I wouldn't talk to her, wouldn't receive her calls, and she
started getting letters from my office.

Q:  And she started getting calls--

A:  Or she got a letter from my office.

Q:  One letter. Right?

A:  Yeah. And she called--she called me a couple of times about the
tickets, and I didn't communicate with her. I had Cathy communicate
with her.

Q:  Did Nicole ask Cathy why you were not communicating with her?

A:  I don't know what Nicole asked her.

Q:  Do you know whether Cathy told Nicole that she didn't--you did
not want to communicate with her?

A:  No, I don't know that.

Q:  Okay. And you--your recollection is that you never said that to
her. Right?

A:  I just stopped. Yeah, my recollection is I never told her that.

Q:  Okay. And what is the date that you  began--what is the date that
you stopped communicating with her except for the kids?

A:  I think whatever day she called and yelled at me, it was basically
the next day I called and kinda left a message for her, and I might
have-- I could be wrong. I might have said, "Don't call me" in that
message, but I think I made it clear to her I didn't want any other
communications with her or her communicating with my home or
people in my home. And "communication" is not the right word. Of
hassling people in my home would have been a better word.

Q:  And you never talked with Nicole again about your call to her or
your message to her. Right?

A:  No. Even though we talked again. but I didn't talk to her again
about that, no.

Q:  Okay. You heard at Kaelin's deposition, which you attended,
some discussion of a dispute between Michelle and Nicole. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Can you tell me what know about that dispute?

A:  What? I mean, she had an ongoing dispute with--

Q:  Is it true that Michelle quit on account of Nicole?

A:  I don't know if that's--

Q:  Is it true--

A:  --correct.

Q:  --that Nicole hit Michelle?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. Tell me about that incident.

A:  The kids were at my house swimming with some--with another
kid or some other kids, and Nicole came over, and I was sitting in the
backyard reading, and she came and sat next to me and she says, "I
really can't be around here if Michelle's around here.'' I said, "Why;
She's just cleaning up."  She says, "Well, you know how she just
gets on my nerves." So I went into the kitchen and told Michelle, you
know, Michelle, take the rest of the day off," which I've done on
previous occasions. And Michelle said, "Okay, I just have to make
your bed and finish the kitchen." I said, "Well. just do that and take
the rest of the day off." And I came out and I told Nicole, "She's just
gonna finish the kitchen and make the bed, and she's gonna take the
rest of the day off." And the kids were trying to get me to turn the
jacuzzi on, the heater on, so right at that area I went to the heater for
about a minute or two. and when I walked out, Nicole was walking
out of the house shaking, saying, "She drives me crazy. I hit her."
And I said, "What do you mean, you hit her? " She said, "OJ., I
know it's wrong. but I just can't take that woman, and I hit her." So I
walked into the house, and Michelle was coming out of her bathroom,
and her face was-- was beginning to show that she had been hit and
was red, and she was crying and she was trying to call 911, but she
was dialing 199, and then when she saw me she stopped and started
venting at me, "Look what she did to my face." So I walked out and
said to Nicole "What"--she was getting the kids out of the pool at that
point. "I mean, how"--"I mean, you can't hit people." And she said,
"I know. I know. I just can't that take that woman." And Nicole, as I
went through the house, she went around the house, she put the kids
in the car, and Michelle was crying, talking to me, and I just went to
my office.

Q:  What day was that?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  What month was it?

A:  March.

Q:  1994?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did Michelle continue to work for you, or did she quit after that?

A:  I wouldn't let her stop. Nicole wanted me to fire her and I
wouldn't and I told her that and--Nicole that, "This girl works for me
and she's gonna work for me," and she knew in June that if we got
back together she'd move, "but at this point she's gonna work for me
until she finds another job. If it takes six months, she's gonna work
for me for six months. If it takes a week, it'll be a week, but she's
gonna stay here until she finds another job." Michelle felt that it would
be best for her to move on if--because she knew I wanted the people
around and they were coming around, and she didn't want to be in the
way of that, and she--I think the guy that she had worked for previous
to me had coincidentally then called. He was going through a divorce
and wanted her to come back to work for him, so she found a job.
And then she kinda hung around for three weeks to try to train Gigi
once they found Gigi, to try to work with Gigi on how to run the
house, and then she went to her new job.

Q:  Did she leave your employ before you went to Cabo?

A:  I believe so. No, no. Before I went to--before I went to Cabo,
possibly. Possibly. Before I went--I'm not a hundred percent sure.

Q:  How long had she been with you?

A:  On and off, 10, 12 years.

Q:  And she and Nicole had battled before?

A:  Not like this, no. They had had disagreements before, but they
always stayed friendly whenever Nicole--like when we split and
Michelle was waiting--working for me, I guess Nicole called her on
numerous occasions to come over to help her and to baby-sit for her.

Q:  Did you ask Michelle to go get Nicole out of the police car in that
1989 incident?

A:  I don't think I asked her. I think she just did it on her own.

Q:  You did not ask her?

A:  I don't believe so, no.

Q:  Why did she do that? Do you know?

A:  I don't know. Nicole appeared to want to get out of the car, and
Michelle was there saying, "Come back in the house," or whatever,
and the police were keeping her from getting out of the car--or this
policewoman was keeping her from getting out of the car.

Q:  You said in your video that you had some financial disagreements
with Nicole in 1992 in connection with your divorce. What were they?

A:  She was convinced that she would not have enough money to live
the way she wanted to live.

Q:  How much did she get a month?

A:  Nothing.

Q:  No spousal support?

A:  None.

Q:   Just the 10,000 child support?

A:  Well, we had a buyout. We bought out for a lump of money.

Q:  How much did you give her?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  What's the ballpark?

A:  I don't know. You'd have to look at - I'm sure you've got all the
financial stuff.

Q:  The only--Was it cash you gave her or real estate or both?

A:  Well, the real estate I had previously given her--

Q:  The San Francisco place?

A:  San Francisco. So it was cash. She expressed to me that she
needed to buy a certain house, so we made the deal for her to have the
house. Cash between the two properties.

Q:  You mean with the cash and with the sale of the San Francisco
property, she could buy another place?

A:  Yeah. She had a choice of buying a place up to whatever worth. I
don't know.

Q:  Now, you were ordered to pay $10,000 a month--

A:  Yes.

Q:  --child support?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you continued to pay that throughout your--throughout
Nicole's life?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And after she died did you continue to pay that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that. It's irrelevant
to any issue in this case, and don't answer it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think it's irrelevant but I'm not going to
persuade you.

MR. KELLY: You guys want a ruling?

MR. PETROCELLI: We will call the judge in Idaho.

MR. BREWER: Could be Baker's first press conference.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. You said that you did not regard Nicole's activities when
she was following you in golf courses, to Mexico and to the house as
stalking. You said that on your video.

A:  Yes.

Q:  What do you regard as stalking?

A:  I really don't know what stalking is. I've never experienced it, and
I--as I pointed out. the--I didn't think that's--from what I gather,
stalking to me is a very negative thing, and I thought  Nicole was just
trying to get back with a guy that she was in love with and I didn't feel
that she infringed upon my space during that period of time.

Q:  You think stalking involves infringing on your space?

A:  Yes. I think when someone makes you very uncomfortable,
coming around, follow you and it makes the person being followed
very uncomfortable, you know, that has to be an element in stalking.

Q:  In May and June of 1994 were you following Nicole anyplace?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you spend a whole day following Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:  Anybody who would say that would be lying. Is that right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Do you recall driving by a restaurant on a Tuesday in early June
and seeing Nicole and Judy having a meal in a restaurant?

A:  No.

Q:  And slowing down and stopping and looking through the glass at
them?

A:  No.

Q:  That never happened?

A:  Never happened.

Q:  Did you ever tell anybody that you molded Nicole?

A:  I can't remember specifically.

Q:  Does that sound like something that you might have said?

A:  Nicole and I talked quite a bit, and we're friends, about, you
know, women and men adjusting to another person, so, I mean, it's--
I don't recall specifically saying that, no.

Q:  Did you ever tell anybody that you molded Nicole in the sense that
you took her as a young woman of 17 years old and turned her into
the adult woman that she became?

A:  No. no, I don't--I wouldn't say that's correct. I think in some
areas I had some influence on Nicole, yes.

Q:  On what areas?

A:  Dress... You know. I don't know.

Q:  Besides dress, anything else?

A:  I don't know. Just in general I think Nicole and I was a good
match for one another, and we probably picked up a lot of things from
one another. I thought--communication. I didn't--I never thought
Nicole was a good communicator, and I think she picked up some of
her--I don't think she ever became a good communicator either, but
she certainly got better.

Q:  Were you a father figure to her?

A:  I hope not.

Q:  Did she ever say that to you?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever tell anybody in words or substance that you molded
Nicole?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  That's not something that you would say. Is that right?

A:  I recall Nicole--I recall at dinners with people, everybody's talking
about--Nicole used to always give me credit for, you know, from
becoming a beach girl or whatever--

Q:  What was the "whatever"?

A:  Whatever she was, you know, and those are conversations that we
went out to dinner with couples, people talk about, I guess.

Q:  So she would give you the credit. You wouldn't take the credit. Is
that what you're saying?

A:  I would like to think that I had something to do--like she had
something to do with who and what I am, I had something to do with
who and what she is in areas.

Q:  What did Nicole credit you with doing for her?

A:  A lot of things. I think--

Q:  Besides dress?

A:  --changing her from a beach girl to  whatever she was, where she
felt relatively comfortable in any environment.

Q:  How did you change her?

A:  Exposed her to those things.

Q:  To different things?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was it at your suggestion that Nicole had breast implants?

A:  No.

Q:  And breast surgery?

A:  Never been a breast man.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you ever use the expression "titty fairy"?

A:  All the times. Still do.

Q:  And what do you mean by that expression?

A:  Girls who got tits, I said "What, did the titty fairy visit?"

Q:  Now, did you ever say that the titty fairy visited Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:  To whom did you say that?

A:  Nicole and I was at dinner--to whatever the conversation was. You
know, these girls are very, very open about their breast jobs. In a
restaurant, when Chris Kardashian had hers, her and Nicole and all
the girls went in the bathroom to look at her breasts, and that's what
started Nicole thinking about having a breast job. So there--it's--in
West LA. it's a--you know, it was, "Hey, look at my breast job."
"Who did this?" "Look at my breast job." "Who did yours?" It's kind
of a--and I think all of her friends had breast jobs.

Q:  When did Nicole have hers?

A:  Late  '80s, maybe it was early '90s. I'm not really sure.

Q:  It was not your suggestion?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you give your approval?

A:  I told her, "Just don't make them too big."

Q:  When you were in Puerto Rico, did you call Cora Fishman about
Nicole's behavior?

A:  I called--I believe I tried to call Cora to find out what was going--if
there was something the matter or what was going on, but she seemed
to be having--I don't know if I ever talked to Cora, because they were
having problems, and then Nicole told--you know what? I don't think
I called Cora Fishman. I think I called Ron Fishman. I don't think I
ever got to talk to Cora Fishman during this period of time.

Q:  Did you tell Cora around this period of time: "What's going on
here? I left Nicole in April. In Cabo we were like lovers. We were
planning to be together. She was going to move in. You know, we
had the best sex, you know. She was gonna go follow me in Florida,
and then she was gonna go to Florida because there was a wedding
there. She was going  to go to Florida and she was gonna go to Puerto
Rico with me and all of a sudden, what happened? What happened?"

A:  All of that, I don't think so, but in substance those are--were my
attitudes during the time I was in Puerto Rico. I don't recall having
this conversation with Cora. I do know that Cora and Faye said to me
about Nicole told them what a great couple of weeks we had and how
much she was looking forward to meeting me in Florida, but
something--
something--something was going on.

Q:  You had made plans to meet in Florida?

A:  She was flying to meet me in Florida for a friend's wedding.

Q:  Were you going to go off on a yacht trip, too?

A:  No, because I was still working on the movie.

Q:  Okay. And did you--Was she going to move in?

A:  I was--it was--as I told you, I was--for the first time when I left to
go to Puerto Rico was the first time I thought possibly this
relationship could work.

Q:  Had you discussed it with her, moving in?

A:  The whole year she was constantly trying to move in, and I was
constantly saying, "Wait till June."

Q:  What I mean to say is: Had you and she discussed that now she
would in fact move in when you got back from Puerto Rico?

A:  Only thing we discussed is that I--I don't know. I don't think so. I
just know when she got rid of Michelle, that was one of her purposes,
to get rid of Michelle so that she could move back in, and I know that
made me stronger to wait till June. But this last weekend before we
went to Puerto Rico was the first time that I really felt that maybe they
would move back in, I could let them move back in or, you know, say
okay.

Q:  What did you mean when you said, "that made me stronger to wait
till June"?

A:  Because when she hit Michelle. I was--I  just, you know, didn't
feel that I wanted this. You know, as I said, I wasn't sure that this
was gonna work, and I wasn't sure that this is what I wanted--

Q:  Wasn't Michelle--

A:  --back in my life.

Q:  I'm sorry. Wasn't Michelle gone by--

A:  Yeah, three weeks later.

Q:  So--

A:  When she hit Michelle, I was dead against her moving back--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No question pending.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  But after Michelle moved out you had no further reservation at that
point. Is that right?

A:  No. The weekend she came back from Cabo to spend a weekend
with me in LA. It was a great weekend. On the way to the airport I
called Lou and Judy Brown and said, "You know, you guys, maybe I
was wrong," because I had mentioned to them before that I didn't
think this was gonna work. Maybe I was wrong. So it was the first
time in my mind that I felt that possibly it would work out.

Q:  And this is when you came back from where?

A:  She came back from Cabo. I was on my way to Puerto Rico.

Q:  Oh, on your way to Puerto Rico.

A:  Yes. I was actually in the limo, driving in the limo to get on the
plane to go to Puerto Rico.

Q:  Okay. Now, as of that point in time had you and Nicole agreed on
a date when she would move back in?

A:  Not specifically. I told her we'd give it a year, and after a year, if it
was working, they could move back in.

Q:  No. I mean at this point in time when you're feeling like the
relationship is going to work--you're in the limo; you call the Browns;
you tell them, "I think this could work"--as of that point in time and
before the problems began with Nicole again, did you and she fix a
date for her to move back in?

A:  We never fixed a date. It was--as I told you, it was--I said we'd
give it a year. At one point right before she hit Michelle she wanted--
she had--no question pending. I'm sorry.

Q:  Well, you were in the middle of an answer and you haven't
answered the question yet.

A:  No, no date. No specific date.

Q:  Had you discussed a time frame for her moving back in?

A:  Yes.

Q:  When was she going to move back in?

A:  A year from the previous Mother's Day. I would give it a year,
and then I would--we'd decide if that was--

Q:  I'm confused. I'm confused. When you said you "would give it a
year," that was the previous Mother's Day--

A:  Yes.

Q:  --in May of '93. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And now we are one year later.

A:  Not quite. We hadn't gotten to Mother's Day yet.

Q:  Yes, but you're thinking it's now going to work out. Right?

A:  I'm thinking that--for the first time I'm thinking there's a chance
that this might work and  maybe I was wrong.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That was the end of March, early April of
'94.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, I know.

Q:  But did you think there was some reason why you couldn't let her
move in 11 months later or 10 months later?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What was that?

A:  Because I wasn't ready.

Q:  Okay. So you and she never fixed a date then. Right?

A:  I think I answered that question.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Around four times.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And you and she--Did you discuss with her around this time frame
that she would move in in June or late May of '94?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. So you had no discussions about when she would move in,
in April of '94. Right?

A:  During April of '94 we had no discussions about her moving in.

Q:  Okay. And none in May of '94. Right?

A:  In May, certainly not.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Yeah. I mean, when you say "moving in," there was subjects
about it in May. You know, she said, "Well, you never wanted me to
move in," you know, that type of stuff.

Q:  No. I mean plans to move in.

A:  Yeah, okay. No.

Q:  Okay.

MR. KELLY: Excuse me. Could we take a five-minute break now?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. I of Volume VII.
The time is approximately  2:05, and we are off the record.

[Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is
approximately 2:2 7. This is the beginning of tape No. 2  of Volume
VII.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  At no time in 1994 did Nicole ever come to you to discuss or
confide about relationships with other men. Is that right?

A:  No.

Q:  True?

A:  That's true, yes.

Q:  On your video you have some discussion about whether or not
Nicole purchased--ever purchased gloves for you. Did she ever
purchase gloves for you?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Are you sure about that?

A:  I'm pretty sure about that.

Q:  Now, did she purchase gloves for someone else?

A:  You know, it's hard for me to--I can't answer that. I think one
person said she did, but she bought for so many people, I can't tell
you what she bought for them. But I know she had a budget, and one
person came forward and said that she did.

Q:  Who was that?

A:  Trying to think of his name. He sent them to the prosecution, I
believe. Tom McCullum.

Q:  And who is he?

A:  He was a friend of ours.

Q:  And he says Nicole bought him gloves?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Were those Aris Light gloves?

A:  I don't think so.

Q:  Do you know whether Nicole ever purchased Aris Light gloves?

A:  No.

Q:  You don't know that she didn't. You don't know either way.
Right?

A:  Yeah, you're right.

Q:  Did you ever give away Aris Light gloves?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Did you ever wear Aris Light gloves?

A:  I really don't know. I could have.

Q:  Do you ever remember owning a pair?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember wearing a pair?

A:  No.

Q:  But you could have. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you give away any gloves one month before June 12, 1994,
within that period of time?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  What about in the year 1994?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Did you give any gloves away then?

A:  I don't know. I don't remember what was in my New York to get
rid of.

Q:  When was the last time you gave away clothes before Nicole's
death?

A:  January of '94.

Q:  And these were clothes from the New York place?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And who did you give them to?

A:  Some to a guy named Fuhrman, believe it or not, and then other
guys in the building. You know, you put them in big bags and you
take them downstairs, and, you know, I don't know if they go to
Goodwill or the doorman go through them or what.

Q:  What was Fuhrman's first name?

A:  I only knew him as Fuhrman.

Q:  You are not saying you gave away a pair of Aris Light gloves to
Mr. Fuhrman, are you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. That's a great question,
though.

MR. KELLY: That's one of the most remarkable--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That is remarkable.

MR. KELLY: --things of all time.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That was a great question.

MR. PETROCELLI: I couldn't resist.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I understand.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Who is Mr. Fuhrman?

A:  He's a doorman or--I'm sorry--concierge.

Q:  At where?

A:  At my apartment in New York.

Q:  And what's his first name?

A:  I told you I don't know.

Q:  He still there now?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Do you know whether you gave Mr. Fuhrman any gloves?

A:  I don't know specifically what. I just know I put good things in a
bag. Sometimes he'd come up and take some real good stuff. And
then there would be a bunch of bags. Some of them get thrown away.
Some of them they go through, you know. I left it up to him.

Q:  Where would you leave the bags?

A:  They come up to my apartment. Somebody would come up to my
apartment and take them down.

Q:  You would call them up?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And say, "Here, you can"--

A:  "I got a bunch of junk up here, you guys,  if you come and get it,"
and they come and just grab the bags and...

Q:  So you didn't parse out specific items--

A:  No.

Q:  --to people. Right?

A:  No. I just basically took out things that I liked, and then
everything else went.

Q:  Do you recall ever giving away specifically a pair of gloves?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Do you do this every January?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you give gloves--excuse me. Do you give clothes away at any
other time of the year?

A:  Normally in the summer. Some times as early as the spring, but
normally in the summer when I'm preparing to head back East.

Q:  And you give clothes away at Rockingham?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And who do you give them to?

A:  Michelle handles that. You know, so much of it goes to my family
up to San Francisco; gets boxed, or if they're down, they'll drive it
up; and some friends, and Goodwill.

Q:  How do you replace these clothes you give away?

A:  With money at stores.

Q:  You go and buy them yourself?

A:  Most, yeah.

Q:  You told the viewers in your video that the prosecution tried to
intimidate various witnesses and get them to change their testimony.
Who are these witnesses?

A:  I don't know to change their testimony, but I felt to skew their
testimony from what I got from them. A couple for sure would have
been Cora Fishman. Christian Reichardt.

Q:  And how do you know that?

A:  From what they told me.

Q:  What did they tell you?

A:  Cora said every time she would answer their questions, they
would tell her, "You're not"--"How could you say that? You're not"--
"I thought you were Nicole's friend," you know, words like that,
which didn't sound like they were after the truth to me.

Q:  And what about Christian?

A:  Well, Christian told me he literally almost got into a fight with
Darden and, you know, they had to turn off the thing, and they got
into an argument because he was--you know, Darden didn't  seem to
like what Christian was saying.

Q:  About what?

A:  I don't know. Whatever the interview was about.

Q:  Anyone else tell you that they had been--Well, withdrawn. Did
Fishman and Reichardt tell you they were intimidated?

A:  I don't know if those were words they used.

Q:  That was your word, "intimidate"?

A:  I thought the attempt was to intimidate, Yes.

Q:  Okay. And any other witnesses tell you that the prosecutors tried
to skew or alter their testimony?

A:  Tell me, no, but I just saw conflicting--and I can't name any
specifics, but conflicting police reports from when we interviewed
people, what those people said.

Q:  And from that you drew the conclusion that they were skewered?

A:  Yes.

Q:  But no one ever told you. Right?

A:  Well, that's my word, "skewed," Yes.

Q:  No one ever told you that. Right? Those witnesses didn't tell you
that did they?

A:  No. I thought the--no.

Q:  Okay. Now, you also said in your video that the District Attorney
went to a number of your former girlfriends and even offered
$200,000 for information. Who did they offer that money to?

A:  I believe it was--they were talking about media and stuff, and
maybe it got misconstrued that it was the D.A. that offered the money.
The media had offered the money to virtually every--I   mean, to
people like Tawny. I think there was a girl named--I can't think of her
name, who left a message with Cathy that they were--they had--they
had been offering her money. Marquerite. Various people were
trying to offer them money to tell their story about O.J., but it seemed
they all wanted negative stories.

Q:  You're telling me that the media or the tabloid media was offering
this money. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Not the District Attorney. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  You said on the video that regarding the blood at Rockingham and
the Bronco, you were not sure that it was yours, you didn't think it
was yours, words to that effect.

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Was the blood found in the Bronco and at Rockingham your
blood?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Do you think it was your blood?

A:  Personally, no, but...

Q:  You don't recall depositing blood at the various blood spots where
blood was found at Rockingham. Is that right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And you don't recall ever depositing blood in the Bronco where
the blood was found?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And if that blood were to be your blood, you have no idea how it
got there. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  So just so I'm clear on this, you don't recall any earlier occasions,
that is, earlier than June 12, when you deposited blood in the Bronco.

A:  Correct.

Q:  Or at the various spots at the Rockingham location where blood
was found. Correct?

A:  Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have to ask you about the subject of documents
because we still haven't gotten anything, and there is a lot of things
we requested, including, for example, his own gloves and shoes and
various items.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We objected to it all.

MR. PETROCELLI: You've objected to everything, suffice it to say,
and we are going to have to take this to the court, and if we get further
documents, then there will have to be further questions. If we get
documents, I should say, because we haven't gotten anything.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: How we learned to do this was we looked at
your responses to our requests--

MR. PETROCELLI: No, that's not true.

MR. BREWER: That's not the test, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think you're right, Mr. Brewer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q:  Now, on Rosey Greer, when he came to the prison to visit you--
Well, he did come to visit you. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. You heard reports of a so-called confession that others
overheard?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did you tell Rosey Greer that you killed Ron and Nicole?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let him answer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. So what's the ground? The privilege?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q:  In all of your discussions with Mr. Greer, you--did you
understand that he was acting as a minister?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And it was only in that capacity that you spoke to him?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And in any of those conversations, were you ever speaking in a
loud or upsetting tone of voice?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  You don't know. Meaning you could or--

A:  Yes, meaning I could have.

Q:  And do you recall whether, when you were speaking in a loud or
upsetting tone of voice, there were others around who you believe
were in a position to hear you?

A:  No. I knew that's not true.

Q:  At no time did you ever see anybody around who might have
overheard what you were saying to Rosey Greer. Is that what you're
saying?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Are you aware of this fellow who came forward and said that he
overheard you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did he?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  When you were speaking to Rosey Greer, do  you know whether
this fellow was present?

A:  No.

Q:  What's this person's name? Do you remember?

A:  I don't know.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have his name?

MR. LEONARD: Let's call the Enquirer.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There was a photo opportunity for Ito after
that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You read that tabloid report about your telephone call with
Mercury Morris?

A:  Somebody told me about it.

Q:  Did you have any calls with Mercury Morris since you got out of
jail?

A:  No.

Q:  When was the last time you've spoken to him?

A:  I believe--I believe I ran into him sometime in the mid '80s. I
believe so.

Q:  And when was the last time you've spoken to Sugar Ray
Robinson?

A:  I did speak to him before he died.

Q:  What about--I must have the wrong--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sugar Ray Leonard?

MR. PETROCELLI: Sugar Ray Leonard.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Robinson has --

MR. PETROCELLI: Sorry. I have the wrong boxer.

Q:  When is the last time you spoke to Sugar Ray Leonard?

A:  I believe at his wedding.

Q:  When was that? Before you went to jail?

A:  Before I went to jail.

Q:  When did Sugar Ray Robinson die?

A:  I think in the '80s.

Q:  Oh, okay. Forget that.

MR. KELLY: Another bum lead.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  On your video you do a demonstration about the lights, and I want
to make sure that I understand that--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's right in front of you if you want this
one, Dan.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  When the lights in the room where the televisions are are turned
on, can you see those from the front gate at night, the Ashford gate?

A:  No.

Q:  Cannot?

A:  No.

Q:  Can you see the coach rights in the entryway from the Ashford
gate?

A:  That are outside?

Q:  Yes.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And can you see the kitchen lights?

A:  It depends. It depends.

Q:  What does that depend on?

A:  What lights are on in the kitchen.

Q:  Some lights you can see and some you cannot see?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And which ones can you see?

A:  I think when they're all on, you probably can see it, but like if a
lamp is on--I keep a lamp on there at night, and if it's on, you can't
see it from the street. And I believe maybe around the range, I'm not--
I didn't test around the range, but I would imagine at least from one
gate you couldn't see--you couldn't see it.

Q:  I am only now referring to the Ashford gate. Right?

A:  No, the Ashford gate I don't think you would be able to see--tell.

Q:  And from the Rockingham gate, could you?

A:  The range, if the range lights are on, maybe.

Q:  Okay. What are the main lights in the kitchen? Are there some
overhead lights?

A:  Overhead lights, yeah.

Q:  Now, when those lights are on, can you see those from Ashford?

A:  You should be able to, yes.

Q:  And can you see those from Rockingham?

A:  You should be able to, yes.

Q:  And when those are off but the lamp is on, can you see that from
Ashford?

A:  No.

Q:  Can you see that from Rockingham?

A:  No.

Q:  If only the range light is on, can you see that from Ashford?

A:  I really don't know about the range light.

Q:  And can you see that from Rockingham?

A:  I would think you could from Rockingham but I'm not sure.

Q:  And if the lamp and the range light are on, can you see those from
Ashford?

A:  Can't see the lamp from either one.

Q:  Okay. What lights, if turned on, could you see from Ashford at
night besides the kitchen and the coach lights?

A:  If my office lights were on, I would think you could see them.

Q:  From Ashford?

A:  Yeah. And if my daughter Sydney's room's lights were on, you
should be able to see.

Q:  Okay. And can you see the office lights from Rockingham at
night?

A:  I don't know. You should be able to I would think, but I'm not
sure if the trees get in the way.

Q:  And Sydney's room at night?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Now, if you were outside in your property in the backyard, could
you see the lights on in the kitchen?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Out by the pool area?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: If the doors are open, you may be able to detect
light. You couldn't see the lights, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Could you see the lights on--Withdrawn. If you were outside,
leaving Kaelin's room and going past the pool and circling around the
pathway to the driveway Okay?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  --what lights could you see on the downstairs if they were on?

A:  You should be able to see all the TV room, the living room. If my
drapes are drawn--not drawn, you should be able to see my bedroom
you should be able to see my bathroom as you go around the back. As
you come around the front, you should be able to see the kitchen, the
office and Sydney's room and the hallway. If the--you know, the
foyer lights up there. It depends what lights are on.

Q:  Okay. Now, between--From the time you got back from
McDonald's--By the way, you say on the video that was close to
10:00 o'clock. In fact that was 9:30 or so, wasn't it?

A:  I don't believe I said that on the video. I think I disagree with you
on that.

Q:  Okay. Forget what you said on the video. You came back--

A:  1-800-OJTELLS video?

MR. PETROCELLI: Could you redact that, Mr. Reporter?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think it was totally responsive.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And you got back around 9:30 p.m. Right?

A:  I believe it was 9:35. I don't know. Somewhere in that area.

Q:  Okay. From that time to the time when you--right before you came
downstairs for the first time. Okay? It wasn't asked and answered.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes, it was, and in excruciating detail.

MR. PETROCELLI: No. I am asking him this following question: Q:
What lights in the house were on?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've gone into that.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, I have not asked that question. Trust me.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: See?

MR. BREWER: He's got it on an alarm.

MR. PETROCELLI: He's got an alarm for everything. It's my last
part of this area, so...

THE WITNESS: Certainly my bedroom lights were on. Which ones,
I can't tell you. I had a lot of different lights in my bedroom. Certainly
my bathroom lights were on. I believe my entry lamp was on, and I
believe my kitchen lamp was on, because when I close up the house at
night, those are the lights I always leave on.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  All those lights were on during that interval from roughly 9:35 to,
let's say, quarter to 11:00?

A:  Well, I don't know about 9:35 because at 9:35 maybe most of the
downstairs lights were on. I turned them off at some point when I
went upstairs to do my final stuff.

Q:  Okay. So when you went upstairs to do your final stuff, then you
had the lamp light on in the kitchen. Right?

A:  I'm pretty sure they were on because they--that's what I normally
do, and I can't imagine I wouldn't have that night.

Q:  The entryway light was on inside your house. Right?

A:  The lamp entry.

Q:  By the way, can you see that from Ashford through the glass of
the front door?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. So that's two lights. And downstairs, any other lights on?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. And the other lights that were on were in your bedroom and
in the bathroom. Right?

A:  Yeah, for sure. And in my closet probably.

Q:  Okay.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Go back to 546, Dan.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm done with that Mr. Baker. We can move on.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: It took me too long.

MR. PETROCELLI: Asked and answered is not an appropriate
objection, anyway.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: The black robe's back on.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, that's that.
Q:  Did you play golf with Bill Thibodeau anywhere in May or June of
'94?

A:  I don't--certainly not June. Maybe I played with him once in May.
I'm not sure.

Q:  Did you tell him about plans to throw a birthday party for Nicole?

A:  Not in May I wouldn't have, no.

Q:  No time in May or June of '94. Right?

A:  Not in May I wouldn't have, no.

Q:  And not in June either, obviously.

A:  No. Her birthday was over at that time.

Q:  Did you tell Bill Thibodeau that Nicole is just ripping you up, or
words to that effect?

A:  No.

Q:  Tearing up your insides? Nothing like that?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have any kind of conversation with him about Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you heard him say that?

A:  Someone told me that he was saying that.

Q:  Do you know why he's saying that?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you know about any calls Nicole made to a battered woman
shelter?

A:  No.

Q:  Had she ever spoken with you about ashelter?

A:  No.

Q:  About Sojourn?

A:  No.

Q:  When we left off the first round of your deposition, I was coming
to the subject of your watching this movie GARP with Kato Kaelin.

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  You heard Mr. Kaelin testify about that. Correct?

A:  I don't recall exactly what he testified, but yes.

Q:  On Saturday, June 11, you were watching TV with Kaelin for a
while in your house?

A:  Yes, I believe so.

Q:  And this movie GARP came on?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And there is this scene where someone is performing oral sex?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And at that point in the movie did you make any comment about
Keith Zlomsowitzh?

A:  I doubt it, but it is one of my favorite scenes, not only when I read
the book, but when I saw the movie.

Q:  You mean scenes in the movie. Right?

A:  Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Yeah. Now, when you--And you've seen that scene many times.
Right?

A:  No.

Q:  But whenever you have seen that scene, do you think of this
incident when you observed--

A:  I think this is the only time I--

Q:  --Nicole performing oral sex on Keith Zlomsowitzh?

A:  I don't think so. That's probably the only time I saw the movie
since that incident.

Q:  Oh, that day in your house?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And did you say anything like that to Kaelin?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  But you're not sure?

A:  I don't think I discussed Nicole's personal thing with Kato.

Q:  That incident.

A:  I don't believe so. I don't ever recall discussing that--that incident
with--it wasn't something I talked about a lot.

Q:  Did you ever discuss that incident with Kaelin on any occasion?

A:  I don't recall. I don't recall ever discussing that with Kaelin. I
know he was at the house in the '93 thing, but I don't recall
discussing that with him, no.

Q:  Did you have a photograph of Nicole under your bed?

A:  They say I did, yeah.

Q:  Do you know how it got there?

A:  You know, the picture I saw at the foot of the bed--I don't know
how. I do recall once taking a picture off our bed stand, putting it
under the bed when Paula was coming to the house after we got back
together, because I'm not--I got so many pictures in my house, I'm
not aware of pictures, but women are always aware of pictures.

Q:  When you broke up with Nicole in May of '94, did you take any
pictures down in your house?

A:  I'm pretty sure, if there was a picture next to my bed, once Paula
came over I probably slid it. You know, if I'm in bed and Paula's
coming, I probably got rid of it some way, some way, shape or form,
yes.

Q:  You think you put it under your bed?

A:  I could have done that yes.

Q:  And did you take out or remove any other photographs of Nicole?

A:  Not that I recall, no.

Q:  Did you make a deal with a tabloid magazine or with some
independent company for money in return for pictures of you at
Nicole's grave site?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever enter into a contract that had such a provision in it?

A:  There was a contract that they wanted something like that, but I
told them I wouldn't do it.

Q:  Did Skip Taft sign such a contract on your behalf?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  That's with a company that sold the photos to the Star. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And how did you find out there was such a provision in the
contract?

A:  Well. at one point when Skip was going over--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to talk about  anything that
relates to Skip--

THE WITNESS. Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --any conversation you had with Skip.

THE WITNESS: All right.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to ask him about such a conversation.
You are not going to let him answer that question. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: True.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You are going to ask him about--

MR. PETROCELLI: I will ask him about another Skip Taft
conversation, because he mentioned it in a public statement.

Q:  Finishing this off, though, you didn't--did you authorize Skip Taft
to sign such a contract?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, when you say "such a contact," do
you mean that included--

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, I mean that.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That included--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Included a provision where you would get money for pictures of
you at Nicole's grave.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. That's irrelevant to any
issue in this case, in any event, but he has already answered that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Goes to consciousness of guilt.

Q:  Anyway, do you want to answer the question?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, he is not going to answer the question.
That is a quantum leap, I'll tell you, "Petrocelli on Evidence."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you sell any pictures of you at the grave site?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  How many times have you been there?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's irrelevant to any
issue.

MR. PETROCELLI: He discussed this on your video.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: So what? Does that make it relevant.?

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he thought it was important enough to put
on his video. He's made a statement out there. The video was done
with the cooperation of attorneys of record in this case on your side. I
think I am entitled to ask about it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We disagree. Don't answer it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Okay. When you were informed of Nicole's death in Chicago, did
you call your lawyer and ask him to go to your house and go to
Nicole's house?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, don't answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he said this on national television.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't care what he said on national
television.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You told that to Roger Cossack and Gretta Van Susteren, didn't
you? And I asked you those questions in the deposition, and you
wouldn't tell me. Would you answer the question now?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: On what ground?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: How can it be privileged? He waived it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: By saying he did it doesn't waive the content
of the privilege. You can ask him if he did it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Okay. Did you call your lawyer and ask him to go to your house
and Nicole's house?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, no, the content-- Well, go ahead and
answer since it's in there.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And who was the lawyer?

A:  Skip Taft.

Q:  And before Skip Taft picked you up in Chicago--excuse me--at
LAX with Cathy Randa, do you know whether he had gone to your
house?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That calls for attorney--client
communication.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he might have found out from Randa or
someone else.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you found out from Randa, you can
answer the question.

THE WITNESS: I didn't find out from Randa, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did he go to Nicole's house?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And you cannot answer that if the only way
you found out is from Skip.

THE WITNESS: I can't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know, when you arrived in Los Angeles back from
Chicago, had Cathy Randa been to the Bundy property? Do you know
that?

A:  I don't know that.

Q:  Had she been to your home in Rockingham?

A:  I think so, but I don't know that for sure.

Q:  And what did you ask her to do at Rockingham?

A:  Nothing.

Q:  What clothing did you put on when you left Chicago to go back to
LA.?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've been through all of this.

THE WITNESS: I started off with some jeans, and I ended up before
I left with some black pants and a white shirt and whatever.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Before you left the hotel?

A:  Yeah, I changed before I left the hotel.

Q:  Okay. So when you left the hotel, you had black pants on and a
white shirt, and you stayed in that outfit all the way--

A:  Yes.

Q:  --till you got to--the rest of the evening. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you never changed your clothes. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  You mentioned something to Gretta Van Susteren and Roger
Cossack that I want to follow up on, make sure I understand, and it
concerns the buzzing of your gate at Ashford.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What page are you on?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's on Page 24 of this transcript of the show.
Q:  And as you're talking about Alan Park, and you say: "He called
me on two occasions at that time. You don't buzz my gate. My gate is
not a buzz gate. He could have pushed it eight times. The phone is
going to ring X amount of times and stop. It's not a when you push
the button the gate buzzes. It doesn't work that way. I don't know if
the prosecution ever took the time to figure that out. It just doesn't
work that way." What did you mean by the gate not being a "buzz
gate"? I don't understand what you were saying there.

A:  It's not--when you push the button, it doesn't buzz.

Q:  When you push the button at the Ashford gate, what happens?
Your phone rings. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean from the exterior of Ashford and
the button outside--

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --the Ashford driveway door--driveway
gate, rather?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  There is a button and there's a little speakerphone there--not a
phone, but a little speaker outlet?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Box.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Speaker box. Right?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And there is no telephone or any thing. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  And when the person presses the button, does that person hear
anything from pressing the button?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  The only thing that person might hear is the phone ringing inside
your house. Right?

A:  Possibly.

Q:  Okay. And if that person--When you pick up the phone and talk,
the sound comes out of a little speaker box. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Now, if that person wants to talk back, can he just start talking and
you'll hear?

A:  Yes.

Q:  He can only hear, however, once you have picked up the phone
receiver. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  He can only speak, I mean, once you--and be heard by you once
you pick up the receiver. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  So if he starts talking right away, you won't hear anything in the
house. Right?

A:  That's right.

Q:  Now, when the phone rings in the house, does it ring exactly like
an ordinary phone call?

A:  I believe so. Maybe a little different, but basically it's the same.

Q:  And if it rings and rings and rings and you don't pick up, it will
just continue to ring until he stops. Right?

A:  No. I think it may ring eight or nine times and then stop.

Q:  And then it won't ring anymore until you press the button again?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you may have told me this already, but when you went to let
him in from your telephone, what do you do upstairs in your
bedroom?

A:  I push a number.

Q:  Push a number and then the gate can open. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  How long will the gate remain activated such that it can open?

A:  I don't understand the question.

Q:  In other words, if he is on the phone and you're pressing the
button, he has to get off--or get out of the speaker box area, get into
the car--

A:  When the gate opens, there's no timer.

Q:  When the gate opens, it stays open?

A:  Yeah, till you push the button to close it.

Q:  I see. It doesn't close automatically. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  What didn't the prosecution figure out that you were referring to?

A:  That there is no--my phone is not a buzzer.

Q:  That your phone is not a buzzer?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  As opposed to a normal ringing phone. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Who were the two or three witnesses that you were praying
they would put on the stand?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  You don't recall?

A:  I don't recall.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Gretta was one of them.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Excuse me?

A:  I don't know. Maybe I'll be refreshed in this trial.

Q:  You do recall, but you don't want to tell me?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Actually you do say, "And these guys might put them on the
stand," I guess referring to us. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  So let us know who you're talking about, and maybe we'll
comply.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't bother, 0.J.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.
Q:  You also said in--to a national television audience that there was no
doubt in your  mind whatsoever that the answer to these murders are
in the world of Faye Resnick.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Now, tell us what you know that leads you to that belief.

A:  That she's lied about every--so much, I should say, since this
thing is over, and I can't believe that a person would lie the way she
has for no reason. She claimed her life was in danger early on, which
I guess it was, and she claims her life is in danger now. Certainly not
from me, but I wouldn't be surprised. But when a person--when a
tragedy like this hits and a person starts changing the truth and lying to
the police or to the prosecutors, to me that's a consciousness of guilt
of some sort, and, you know, I just noticed that the bizarre--what I
thought, the bizarre way Nicole was acting seemed to somehow be
related to Faye Resnick.

Q:  Is that the only thing on which you base your conclusion?

A:  Yeah, lying, the way she's been lying so much. I think that's
pretty good.

Q:  You don't know of any witnesses to the murder, do you?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Had anyone ever told you that the killer or killers were
somehow related to Faye Resnick?

A:  Told me that they were?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  Or had something to do with Faye Resnick?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you have any other information other than the fact that she lied
in her book?

A:  Not only in her book. She seemed to lie everywhere. She lied
under oath to you guys, from what I gather, so that's probably more
than anything.

Q:  Do you know who she was buying--excuse me. Do you know
who she was purchasing drugs from?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know of any confrontation that she had with any drug
dealers?

A:  Know of firsthand?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  Or secondhand?

A:  Well, I've been told about something that happened in San
Francisco once.

Q:  When?

A:  I guess before she moved to LA.

Q:  What year?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Early '90s?

A:  I have no idea. Before she moved to L.A. is all I know.

Q:  What happened?

A:  And once again, this is rumors. I'm as bad as she is maybe. But
that a friend of hers was murdered, and her husband at the time or--
Hutchinson r Hallaby or something, they both got out of the country,
ended up in Australia, and when things calmed down she came back.

Q:  Did you ever talk to Faye about that?

A:  No, but Nicole evidently did because Nicole was the first person
to tell me that story.

Q:  Is that the only way you know that: From Nicole?

A:  I don't know. Since that time I think I read where some ex-
boyfriend of her--or the guy that she was having an affair with went
on some show and talked about this--all this stuff happening.

Q:  Faye was admitted to a treatment center on June 9. Right?

A:  I don't know, but I'm told that, yes.

Q:  Yeah. What did she lie about in her deposition?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't answer
that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You said she lied in her deposition. What did she lie about?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said he thinks she lied, so he's not--
that's irrelevant to any issue in this case, and he is not going to answer
that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What his opinion of what her lies are.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not his opinion. He said she flat-out lied.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The only way he could tell when Faye
Resnick was lying was when his lips--her lips were moving, so that's
our view of Miss Resnick.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:  Do you agree with your lawyer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't--you don't have to answer that, and
you don't have to agree with me or disagree with me. We are not
going to get into that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you know--Excuse me. Do you know if anyone spoke to
Nicole after she came back from Mezzaluna on June 12?

A:  You mean had a conversation with her?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know any of her movements or activities after she returned
from Mezzaluna till the time of her death?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you spoken to anyone who said he or she spoke to her
during that time frame?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you spoken to your children about their mother's movements
or activities in the home that evening?

A:  No.

Q:  You ever spoken to Sydney about it?

A:  No.

Q:  You said something on the video or perhaps in the burden of proof
interview about Sydney's last observations of her mother.

A:  Yes.

Q:  You said that Sydney heard her mother crying. Do you recall that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  How do you know that?

A:  It was in a police report.

Q:  I see. The only knowledge you have of Sydney's observations is
what you read in the police report?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you have never once spoken to Sydney about that evening?

A:  And never will. Till she wants to when she gets older.

Q:  And you've never spoken to your son Justin either. Correct?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Have you, since you were released from prison, done
anything to track down the real killer or killers?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's irrelevant to any issue
in this case.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You made a statement or a statement was read on your behalf
following your acquittal that you would devote your life's work to
finding the real killer or killers. Is that right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  What have you done in that regard?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you don't have to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Have you done anything?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You know, he doesn't have to answer that.
That has nothing to do with this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I disagree, but you're not going to let him
answer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you sleep at all on the plane going to Chicago?

A:  I may have dozed, but I wouldn't call it sleep, but I may have
dozed for a while.

Q:  Were you--Quick, Phil. Were you agitated?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Come on. Enough. Enough. This is enough.
Seven days is enough.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Were you agitated or nervous on that flight?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Now, when I questioned you about your calling the house
that evening on June 12th, I believe you told me that Nicole answered
the phone and you said, "Let me speak to Sydney," and the phone
was handed to Sydney, and there was no conversation at all with
Nicole. Do you recall that?

A:  There was no conversation with Nicole, that's correct.

Q:  Now, when you called Gretta Van Susteren, you said, "Is Sydney
asleep yet?" And Nicole said, "No."

A:  No. I said, "Is Sydney asleep?" and she handed the phone to
Sydney.

Q:  Well, the transcript said she said "No."

A:  Well--

Q:  Is that correct, or--did she say "No" to you?

A:  That's probably incorrect. She handed the phone to Sydney. And
she may have said "No" and handed the phone to Sydney.

Q:  I see. You asked the question, "Is Sydney asleep yet?"

A:  Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  Or did you say, "Can I speak to I Sydney?"

A:  I believe I said, "Is Sydney asleep yet?"

Q:  And what's now your best recollection?

A:  I believe that would be the best recollection.

Q:  And what is your best recollection of what Nicole said or did?

A:  She handed the phone to Sydney.

Q:  With no conversation.

A:  No conversation.

Q:  And Sydney hung up the phone without giving it back to Nicole?

A:  Yes. I assume she was in Sydney's room or Sydney was in her
room.

Q:  You heard Denise Brown testify about an incident at the Red
Onion where you grabbed Nicole's crotch?

A:  Yeah, I believe we talked about this.

Q:  I didn't find it in the transcript. Let me just ask you: Did that
occur?

A:  No.

Q:  You never grabbed her crotch. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  At any time. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  You're saying "No." You mean correct. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. Have you ever talked to Sydney about whether she
observed any incidence of abuse?

A:  No.

Q:  Or your son Justin?

A:  No.

Q:  At any time?

A:  No.

Q:  Was there an incident in--Withdrawn. Do you recall an incident in
Cabo in April of 1994 where you were flirting with a woman in a
restaurant and Nicole got upset?

A:  No.

Q:  That never occurred?

A:  Never occurred.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, that's all I have for now, subject to a
number of objections and instructions not to answer and, of course,
not getting any documents or materials that we requested, and also
subject to the final phase on the punitive damage examination.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Roll 'em. Michael, how long do you have
approximately? And how long do you have approximately, John?

MR. BREWER: Seven days.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't do that to me.

MR. KELLY: No one wants to lay the foundation at  Unintelligible].

MR. BREWER: I probably have half a day.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

MR. BREWER: Possibly a day. Half a day.

MR. KELLY: Or more.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We can finish this up by Tuesday if--

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Dan's still got --

MR. PETROCELLI: I've got to do the punitive damage. I guess that'll
take half a day at the most.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Half, half and a full.

MR. KELLY: Are we on right now or --

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. All I'm trying to do is--I'm tired. But
I don't want--you've got to get back to Boston one of these days.

MR. LEONARD: Yeah, I mean, let's go.

MR. KELLY: Can we go off the record?

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the
time is approximately 3:13.

[ Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the
time is approximately 3:17.

EXAMINATION

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Mr. Simpson, I want to focus for a couple minutes on the
Rockingham property, and on three specific time periods, the first
being 6-12-94, and then the second time period the time that you were
shooting the videotape. All right? You awake?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Yes?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You okay to go on?

A:  Yes.

Q:  All right. Between those two time periods has there been any
substantial changes in the foliage of the property?

A:  I'm sorry. Between when I shot the video?

Q:  6-12-94 and when you shot the video, has there been any
substantial changes in the foliage? Have you done any plantings, any
changes in the foliage to the property?
.
A:  Okay. Since the 6-12 of '94 to the video that was shot this time?

Q:  Yes.

A:  I would think that it's alot thinner. That I could tell you
specifically: It's a lot thinner along the southern portion.

Q:  By the pathway?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Was that thinned out under your direction?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Was that through the gardener?

A:  Evidently.

Q:  Okay. And you didn't have any discussions with the gardener
about thinning out that area?

A:  No.

Q:  Any other foliage that changed during that time frame?

A:  My whole property seemed to when I got back seemed to be
changed. I mean, stuff was growing where it shouldn't have grown
and flowers weren't blooming. Yeah. You know, in general, yes, I
think it looked not to be as kept up as it was when I was around.

Q:  Between the same time frame, were there any changes that were
made under your direction to the foliage of the property?

A:  No. I mean. Once I got back home, I--you know. I had made
some things--I wanted him to try to get some color back and to cut
some of the trees that were growing through the tennis court fence,
and the tennis court was basically being overwhelmed.

Q:  Okay. Were those changes made prior to the videotape being shot,
the 1-800-OJTELLS videotape?

A:  I don't think they--I don't think the tennis court shows on the 1-
800 videotape.

Q:  Okay. The areas of the property that are depicted in the 1-800-
OJTELLS videotape, are those areas substantially similar at the time
that the videotape was shot as of 6-12-94?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: With the exception of the south pathway?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Yeah, with the exception of what you've already mentioned. In
terms of just the foliage now.

A:  I can't tell. It just seemed it was better kept when I was around
than it was when I came home. There was areas that we normally had
flowers or roses that there weren't any, so...

Q:  Okay. With respect to the operation of the Ashford and Rockford
gates, were there any changes between 6-12-94 and the shooting of
the videotape to how those gates worked?

A:  How they worked?

Q:  Yes.

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. So what's depicted in the videotape as of--the OJTELLS
videotape in terms of the operation of both gates is the same as of 6-
12-94?

A:  You mean how you could--you know, I walked out of the Ashford
gate then. I mean--I'm sorry. I walked out of the Rockingham gate,
which I obviously could have disengaged the controls back then. So
basically, as far as I know the basic mechanisms are the same.

Q:  Okay. The operational aspects of the gates, the Ashford gate and
the Rockingham gates, were the same at the time that you shot the
videotape as of 6-12-94?

A:  Yeah, the ability to operate them various ways as far as I know is
the same.

Q:  How about the lighting outside on your property, not inside but
outside around the property? Was that substantially similar at the time
that you shot the videotape as of 6-12-94?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: With the exception--obviously we're in
December and there's Christmas lights up, and 6-12 is June.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Talking about permanent lighting rather than, you know tansitional
lighting like Christmas lights.

A:  I believe the security has beefed up lighting.

Q:  Okay. Well, was there nighttime filming? There was nighttime
filming in the videotape. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Were the outside lights activated at the time that the
nighttime filming was done?

A:  I think where the lighting was beefed up was--you couldn't see
from the footage of what you were looking at. I don't think they
impacted that.

Q:  Okay. The nighttime filming that was done, were the outside lights
activated during that filming?

A:  I think the coach lights were on.

Q:  Okay. And any other lights that you're aware of that were on
during that film?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Exterior?

MR. BREWER: I am just talking about exterior right now.

THE WITNESS: That you can see on the video, I don't think any that
wouldn't have been operational then.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Okay. So the lights were substantially similar as of the videotape
Strike that. The lights were substantially similar as of the time of
shooting the videotape as compared with 6-12-94. Correct?

A:  The lights that you can see on the nighttime shooting, those lights
that are visual I think are similar and the same. There are other lights
that has been beefed up in other areas of the property, but I don't
think--they come to play on that. The only nighttime video I recall is
the show that you can't tell what lights are on in my house, and from
what I can see on that, the lights are virtually the same.

Q:  After 6-12-94 was there any change in the wattage of the coach
lights, making them brighter or less bright?

A:  I can't say for sure. I do know inside the house there was.

Q:  Well, how about the coach lights? Did you--Were new lights put in
under your direction that added more brightness--

A:  No.

Q:  --or more wattage?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. The new lights that you're talking about that aren't
necessarily depicted on the videotape where are those lights? Exterior
lights--

A:  In some trees and focusing on some areas which the security
people think my property may be vulnerable from.

Q:  Okay. Are these in the back of the house, the side of the house or
in the front?

A:  In all areas, I believe.

Q:  Okay. Including the front?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Have there been any new structural changes--Strike that. Have
there been any structural changes since 6-12-94 to the shooting of the
videotape? And what I mean by that, where you have had some
change in--some new structure put up or a change in the garage or a
change in the inside of the house or something of that nature?

A:  Other than some bamboo--I mean, some what they call bamboo
sheeting that we have up now so that the lookie-loos can't see
through. I think they put a solid board on both gates. So before where
you could see through the gates, you can't now.

Q:  Okay. Is that permanent or temporary, the bamboo?

A:  The bamboo hopefully is temporary, but who knows.

Q:  Okay. How about the benches in front of the front door, are those
still there?

A:  Yes.

Q:  The two benches?

A:  Yes.

Q:  In the same position?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Now, you've described the locks, the various locks throughout the
property, indicating that there was a master key that you had and that
the rest of the locks were controlled by individual keys. Is that
correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. Is that the same at the time of the videotape as it was as of
6-12-94?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Well, were there any changes made to the locks under your
direction?

A:  No.

Q:  So presumably they'd be the same. Correct?

A:  I can only--it would only be a guess on my part.

Q:  Well, do you have any information that the locks were changed
after 6-12-94?

A:  No.

Q:  Any changes to the--Now, again I want to go inside now and talk
about flooring. Any changes to the flooring since 6-12-94 and the
shooting of the videotape?

A:  I'm sorry?

Q:  Any changes to the wooden flooring inside the foyer area--

A:  No.

Q:  --between 6-12-94 and the shooting of the videotape?

A:  No.

Q:  Any changes in the carpeting that go up the stairs between 6-12-94
and the shooting of the videotape?

A:  No.

Q:  Interior lights, any changes in any of the interior lights? And I'm
not talking about changing light bulbs to increase the wattage, but
where you've had new lights put in between 6-12-94 and the shooting
of the videotape.

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Has there been any change in light bulbs inside your home
where you've increased the wattage in, any particular rooms?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. What rooms did you have lights put in that, would increase
the wattage?

A:  I think I increased the wattage in all my lamps.

Q:  Was that done for a specific purpose?

A:  I don't know. Maybe just to show the lamps off a little more, and
I'm yeah, no specific person--purpose.

Q:  Was it done for a specific purpose in relationship to shooting the
video?

A:  No.

Q:  Was it done all at the same time?

A:  I don't know. I don't know if it was done--I'm sure it was done
while I was in jail.

Q:  Well, do you have a specific recollection of having that done under
your direction?

A:  Under my direction, no.

Q:  Okay. Why do you think that was done?

A:  I think--because people were just in the house, and when lights go
out--a couple of lamps, I would only burn one or two bulbs in them
because they burn all night, and I think people weren't aware of that,
and when they changing bulbs, they see they're all out. They put all
new bulbs in.

Q:  Okay. Are you assuming that when they put new bulbs in, they
increased the wattage of the bulbs?

A:  Well, they put more bulbs--I don't know about the wattage of the
bulbs, but most of my lamps I will only burn--they have room for
four to five or six bulbs in the lamp. I would only burn two or three
bulbs in the lamp, and evidently during the course of changing lamps,
they put more wattage in those lamps.

Q:  You said a moment ago that there are some lamps that you burn all
night. Is that a practice that you follow: Burning particular lamps all
through the night?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. What lamps are those?

A:  My entry lamp and the lamp in my kitchen.

Q:  So those are on all night long, and you turn them off during the
day?

A:  Yes. Normally, yes.

Q:  Are they on a timer?

A:  Now they are. They weren't before.

Q:  Okay. When did they first go on a timer?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Well, but were they on a timer as of 6-12-94?

A:  I'm not sure.

Q:  Did you put them on a timer for--Strike that. Do you burn them all
night for security purposes?

A:  No. I wake up every night and walk my house, and so it keeps me
from turning on lights.

Q:  Okay. So you need some illumination in order to walk around
your house?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Because otherwise--

A:  I don't need it. You could without it, but, you know, it's easier to
have it.

Q:  Is there any light that comes into the house--any artificial light that
comes into the house that would provide some illumination if you
didn't have any of the interior lights off--on?

A:  I think any lights--I don't know if it provides illumination. I can
walk around my house with no lights on. If all my outdoor lights are
on, I can--you know, I can--I'm not going to trip over a couch or
nothing.

Q:  Because of the illumination provided by the outdoor lights?

A:  To an extent, yes.

Q:  But those are lights on your property?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Are there any lights, streetlights, lamps off your property that
provide illumination into your house that would facilitate your seeing
as you're waking around?

A:  I wouldn't be able to tell. I wouldn't be able to answer that.

Q:  And you have no recollection with respect to whether these lights
were on a timer--these all-night lights were on a timer as of June 12,
'94?

A:  None, no.

Q:  The practice of your sometimes walking around at night, is that
consistent with the entire time that you've lived at Rockingham?

A:  Yeah. I don't sometime. I always take at least one walk around my
house at night.

Q:  Because of insomnia? You can't sleep?

A:  No. I check on my kids, look out at the dogs, you know, take a
leak. It's just always been my practice.

Q:  Does the dog normally sleep outside?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Chachi?

A:  Yes.

Q:  How about in inclement weather?

A:  Yes. I open the garage door.

Q:  And you leave the door open, or do you shut the garage door?

A:  No. I leave it open.

Q:  The--There has been some--a lot of description and discussion
relative to some gates along the south pathway. There's essentially
two gates there. Is that correct?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Okay. And the first gate, if you were to walk around the garage
and then head in an easterly direction along that southern pathway,
there is a gate that Mr. Kaelin described as having to pick up and
kind of move to the side. Do you recall that description?

A:  I recall that description.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are we talking about the gates in June or as
they presently are?

BY MR. BREWER: Q:  Are those gates--Was that an accurate
description?

A:  I don't know if it was an accurate description. I recall where the
gate might have been, yes.

Q:  Is there still a gate there today?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Okay. When is the last time you were along the southern pathway?

A:  You mean all the way back the southern pathway?

Q:  Well, crossing past the garage and then heading easterly through
these two gates that have been described.

A:  Maybe a month ago.

Q:  Okay. Did you have to walk past two gates or open two gates to--

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  --walk back there?

A:  I don't recall if the gates were open or not.

Q:  Okay. Have you made any repairs to any of the gates along the
southern pathway since June of 19---June 12th, 1994?

A:  I don't know what state of repair they were in then, so I can't
answer that.

Q:  Okay. Well, you would know whether you hired somebody to
come out and make a repair to the gate, wouldn't you?

A:  No.

Q:  You wouldn't know that.

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Have you ever picked up the phone and contacted anyone to
come out and make a specific repair to any of the gates along the
southern pathway?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you ever asked anyone to do that on your behalf?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you ever been told that that was done in your behalf?

A:  No.

Q:  Is it your understanding that the first gate that we're talking about,
that Kaelin described as having to move aside, is in the same condition
today that it was as of June 12, 1994?

A:  I don't have an understanding one way or the other on that.

Q:  On those occasions where you had to go back along the southern
pathway, do you recall having to, in a similar fashion as described by
Mr. Kaelin, pick up the gate and move it aside to walk in an easterly
direction?

A:  I don't have no recollection of that, no.

Q:  Do you recall it being a chain-link type of gate?

A:  I believe if there were gates there, they would be chain-link type
gates.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Mike, let's take a break. He's getting tired.
Any problem with that?

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

MR. BREWER: No.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the
time is approximately 3:33.

[ Recess.]

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the
time is approximately 3:48.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, we are focusing on a time period between 6-
12 -94 and your shooting of the videotape. We have gone through a
number of items where I've asked you whether there have been any
changes. And focusing for the moment on Kato Kaelin's room and the
interior of that room, were there any changes in the layout or
configuration of that room between 6-12-94 and the videotape?

A:  I'm not in a position to answer that because I hadn't been in that
room in so long previous to that date. So, you know, I can't tell you.
I can't answer it.

Q:  Well, you've seen photographs that were introduced into evidence
at the criminal trial of his room. Right?

A:  Yeah, but the bed--the bed's in the same place.

Q:  Okay. The picture on the wall to the right of the bed, is that still in
the same place as of the shooting of the videotape?

A:  I don't recall. I don't think so because I think--I don't think so. I
don't know about as of the shooting of the videotape. As of the
shooting of the videotape, maybe. I don't know. I just know that
other pictures are up right now.

Q:  Were there any changes made to the interior of his room under
your direction?

A:  I don't believe--of the interior of his room I don't believe so. I
know--I don't believe so. Not to my direction, I don't believe so.

Q:  Any part of his room exterior or interior, any changes made under
your direction?

A:  Maybe they got a new bedspread. Maybe-- I do know now, but I
believe it's since the video, that there are different pictures and things
in there, so I am aware of that. But as of the shooting of the video,
because I wasn't aware of what was in there before and I never--I can
honestly say what ever pictures came up in Kato's room I never really
looked at it, so I can't--and I haven't been in that room you know, in a
tremendous long time before Kato--you know, before that day. Since
Kato lived in there, I hadn't been in there in--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've more than answered the question.

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Were there any changes that you're aware of with respect to the
interior of Kato's room that were done specifically for the videotape?

A:  No.

Q:  You mentioned a moment ago about a couple lights that you leave
on through the night. Where exactly are those lights located inside
your house?

A:  One's on a built-in desk type thing in the kitchen, and one is built--
one is on a--well, it's no longer an armoire. Sort of a sideboard in my
entry.

Q:  In your entry. Any other lights that you have a custom or practice
of leaving on through the night other than those two?

A:  Sometimes I'll leave--No. That was basically it, yeah.

Q:  Are there lights that from time to time you leave on through the
night other than those two?

A:  From time to time, yes, but those are basically the lights.

Q:  Other lights that you leave on purposely through out the night from
time to time?

A:  Those are two that I leave on. There's one other one that
sometimes since I've been home I might have on from time to time.

Q:  And where is that light located?

A:  In my TV room. It's a lamp on the table in my TV room.

Q:  What would dictate your leaving that on through the night?

A:  Depending who's staying in the guest room and how active they
might be as the evening goes on.

Q:  Okay. How about Arnelle's room, either the interior or the
exterior, between 6-12-94 and the shooting of the videotape, any
changes that you're aware of?

A:  Shooting of the video? I don't--were their rooms in the video?

Q:  I am just asking: Were there any changes made to the room?

A:  More than likely there were, but I don't know because I never--I
didn't go out there so I don't know.

Q:  Between--Strike that. At any time after June 12, 1994 did you
direct that any repairs be made to the window outside Mr. Kaelin's
bathroom?

A:  No.

Q:  How about outside Arnelle's room?

A:  No.

Q:  And now I am going to the third time frame I want to focus on is
today, but I just want to go through like a checklist, and when I
mention the item just tell me whether there has been any substantial
changes made to that particular item so we can go through this. All
right? You with me?

A:  Yes,

Q:  All right.

A:  Today.

Q:  Interior lighting? The time frame is between the shooting of the
videotape and today. Okay?

A:  I moved a lamp, and--other than maybe lamp bulbs, I moved a
lamp.

Q:  Okay. And what lamp did you move?

A:  A lamp out of my formal living room into my TV room.

Q:  Okay. And what was the purpose of moving that lamp?

A:  Just to give it a different look.

Q:  And did you replace any light bulbs since the shooting of the
videotape that you specifically recall?

A:  I'm sure we may have, but I can't specifically recall.

Q:  Do you recall either yourself or directing someone to replace light
bulbs, increasing or decreasing the wattage of those bulbs?

A:  The lamp that we moved I think only had two bulbs in it, and since
it's one of my favorite lamps, maybe the first one I purchased, and
when we
moved it to put it in another room, I think I filled it up with bulbs just
to, you know, to get the full effect of the lamp. I don't know if we
kept it that way. I think we burn two or three of those bulbs in it now,
but when I first did it, I know I wanted to look at the full effect of the
lamp.

Q:  Okay. Other than this lamp, any other changes inside your home
between shooting the videotape and today with respect to lighting?

A:  I may have added a lily pad lamp to my bedroom.

Q:  Okay. When you say "I may have," do you have a specific
recollection between this time frame adding--

A:  No, I don't know if it was there before I we shot the video or after
we shot. You know, it is  there today. I know that. It's by my bed.

Q:  Okay. Was this a lamp that you added specifically for shooting the
video?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Was it a lamp just for aesthetic purposes or lighting
purposes?

A:  Yeah. Yeah. It's a lamp that was in a closet because some of the
shades were missing, and I just wanted to use it.

Q:  Was the lamp--Do you remember exactly when you pulled it out of
the closet and started using it?

A:  No.

Q:  Before or after the video?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Okay. Your bedroom, do you have drapes on the windows in your
bedroom?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Those drapes in the same condition now that they were as
of June 12, '94?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you have a practice whether you close them or leave them
open?

A:  I close them at night.

Q:  Okay. When you're sleeping?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Otherwise you leave them open?

A:  Well, normally when I go up to my bedroom I close the drapes,
because I don't know when I'm going to fall asleep and I don't want
to have to get up and have to, you know, close them.

Q:  Do you have a practice during the summertime with respect to
whether you sleep with windows open or closed?

A:  No way, no. Not one way or the other.

Q:  Not one way. So sometimes you may open them, and sometimes
you'll close them?

A:  I don't have any windows open in My bedroom. I do have a door
I could open. There is no windows really to open upstairs in my
bedroom.

Q:  Okay. In the same time period, again, I am not--I am talking now
about shooting the video at present day, and focusing now on exterior
lighting,  any changes?

A:  Well, I know that they've added since

1  June 1 th--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The video in December is the time period.

THE WITNESS: No, I don't think any changes since the video.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  So the lighting should be substantially similar to as it was as of
shooting the videotape. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Foliage? Again, I am not talking about natural growth. I am talking
about where you have specifically put in plants or had things
removed.

A:  Well, I've thinned out my trees, not in the front yard but in the
backyard. I've had those pruned. I don't know if that was before or
after the video. I don't think--I don't--I can't recall. I think along the
walk drive that goes into Rockingham he may have planted some
ground flowers, but I don't know if that was before or after either.

Q:  Same time frame, but the question is with respect to locks.

A:  I don't--I have no knowledge of us changing any locks.

Q:  Okay. So presumably they're the same now as they were as of
shooting the videotape in December.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Flooring inside the foyer?

A:  I think I added a rug.

Q:  You did that since the videotape?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Was that just for aesthetic purposes?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Carpet inside the house?

A:  The same.

Q:  Window coverings?

A:  They're the same.

Q:  The two gates along the southern pathway between shooting the
videotape and the present time?

A:  I have no idea.

Q:  Okay. How about Kaelin's room same time frame?

A:  Since the video, I think we have different pictures in there and--
yeah, and a leak has been added. No. I know pictures are a little
different. It my have been spruced up since then a little bit. I got--
yeah, I think some--definite for sure some pictures have been added.

Q:  By the way--

A:  And I don't know if they were there before, but they were there
since, since the video. Yeah. pictures have been added in there.

Q:  How about Arnelle's room? Since the video, any changes either
inside the room or outside of the room?

A:  Since the video?

Q:  Yes.

A:  Well, I don't know when she moved, so I don't know. So when
she moved,--she took most of her stuff out of there.

Q:  Since the videotape, any changes to the window outside Kato
Kaelin's bathroom?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Well, did you make any changes or authorize any?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. How about outside Arnelle's room?

A:  I got to say this: Any repairs that are done, even though my people
who work for me know to make the repair if it needs to be done, so in
a sense that's all authorized by me because I got to pay for it, but no
specific knowledge of anybody doing any of this.

Q:  Were there any repairs made under your direction where you
specifically asked them to make repairs with respect to Kaelin's
window?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. How about Arnelle's windows?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Okay. In the entire time period that you have lived at Rockingham
has anyone ever--who was in Arnelle's room or Kato's room ever
reported noises presumably emanating along the southern pathway?

A:  I can't recall.

Q:  Okay. I want to go back to an exhibit that was previously marked I
believe as 1. I'm not Sure. What number do you have on that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: 6.

MR. BREWER: 6?

Q:  Exhibit 6, which was the--

MR. KELLY: A description--

BY MR. BREWER: Q:  --which was the June 15, '94--it's dated June
15, '94, "To 'Whom It May Concern" letter, which I think you've
indicated it was actually on 6-17-94. Is that correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Mr. Simpson, at the time that you drafted this letter, had you heard
from any source, excluding conversations, with lawyers, that the
police theorized that a killer or killers had left blood at the Bundy
crime scene?

A:  I don't recall. There was so much on TV, I'm sure I probably
heard something.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to speculate. If you don't
recall, you don't recall.

THE WITNESS: I'm sure--No, I don't recall. There was so much
going on and being said at that period of time, I don't know.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, do you recall at some point learning that the police were
theorizing that blood had been left by a killer or killers at the Bundy
crime scene?

A:  I may have.

Q:  Do you remember how you learned that information?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember when you learned that information?

A:  Not particularly, no.

Q:  Do you remember whether it was before or after you began
drafting this letter?

A. I don't know.

Q:  At some point after the murders did you learn that a glove was
found on your property?

A:  As I said, I heard so much that day, and during that week that I'm
sure I had heard about--I know I heard about a glove and ski mask.

Q:  When did you hear that for the first time?

A:  I believe the first day.

Q:  Okay. I mean, that would be a pretty significant piece of
information, that evidence linked with the crime scene was found on
your property.   Right?

A:  I don't know if anybody linked anything at that point.

Q:  Well, what did you hear exactly about the glove?

A:  I don't know. I was hearing everything. I was hearing bloody ski
mask. I don't know if I heard glove the first day. I know I heard
bloody ski mask right away.

Q:  Well, when you said you "heard bloody ski mask," did you hear a
bloody ski mask was found on your property?

A:  That's what they were reporting, something about a bloody ski
mask, I believe.

Q:  And when you first heard--Strike that. At some point did you
determine or learn that a bloody ski mask was not found on your
property,   that that was a false report

A:  At some point, yes.

Q:  Do you remember when that was?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember what evidence, if any, you knew about at the
time that you began drafting this letter?

A:  I didn't know what was evidence and what wasn't evidence. I was
hearing everything that was in the--everything that was being
reported, I was hearing it all. So whatever was being reported that
week, I heard it.

Q:  Well, do you remember hearing about any evidence that you
believe may tend to implicate you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, the point that he has just made is he
didn't know what was evidence and what wasn't, so your question is
without foundation.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Did you hear about any information that may tend to implicate you
in these murders?

A:  I heard they were going to arrest me, and that was the information
that was implicating me.

Q:  Okay. That's the first time in your mind there was any information
that was implicating you in these murders, was when you actually
heard that you were going to be arrested?

A:  I heard everything on the news. I heard newscasters theorizing and
making claims about things that I didn't think were true.

Q:  Okay. Well, what reports do you remember by newscasters--

A:  Well one of them--

Q:  ---regarding information that you didn't think was true?

A:  --DeVilla, Bob DeVilla, somebody with Channel 4.

Q:  Avila?

A:  Avila. He was doing a report about when I arrived at the hotel in
Chicago, I was loud and boisterous as if I was attempting to draw
attention to my self, and I'm saying that was not true. There was
nobody in the lobby except the people who were greeting me, and I
was dragging when I walked through the door. So, I mean--and other
than specifics--I know that was a specific, and there was a lot of that
type of stuff being said.

Q:  Is that a report that you heard at Rockingham?

A:  I may have. I may have. I just know that week I heard it, and it
was on TV.

Q:  And that's a report that specifically sticks out in your mind as
you're testifying here today. Is that true?

A:  Because that was something I knew was not true.

Q:  Okay. I mean, you knew for a fact that that was totally inaccurate.
Is that correct?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And because it was inaccurate and it was being reported on
television. it's something that you have a specific recollection of as
you're sitting here
testifying during this deposition. Is that true?

A:  That one, yeah. There was a lot of stuff, and I can't recall a lot of
it, but that was one that--you know why? It may have been the first
thing I heard, and then so much was being said and implied after that,
it was almost like I had to kind of turn off and my focus went to my
family.

Q:  Okay. Well, I just want to make sure I understand your testimony,
which I understand isn't the test, but for me it's going to be the
premise of
this question: With respect to this report that you heard from the
reporter, Bob Avila, was there something about the way in which he
reported the
information or was it the substance of the report that caused you to
have some difficulty with his reporting?

A:  It was a lie.

Q:  Okay. It was a lie.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, are there any other reports relative to information in
the case that you specifically recall as you sit here today because you
felt the information was false or untrue?

A:  There was--I can't give you specifics, but if you take tapes of that
week, there was just so much being said that--so much I didn't know
if it was true or false, and there was numerous things that I knew were
not true and--as they were reporting it. And so there were things that I
heard that week that were just--just--you know, I just didn't believe
them.

Q:  Well, Mr. Simpson, you knew that they were reporting that your
blood was actually found at the crime scene, didn't you?

A:  I don't know if they reported that that week. I'm not sure if they
reported that that week, but whenever they reported it, I was aware of
it, and I don't recall if that week that was reported or not.

Q:  Okay. Well, the first time that you heard that your blood was
found at the crime scene or a claim that your blood was found at the
crime scene was through the press. Isn't that true?

A:  I would imagine so.

Q:  Okay. And you knew that to be absolutely false. Isn't that true?

A:  I knew that I hadn't deposited any blood at Nicole's house that
night.

Q:  You knew that it was virtually impossible for your blood to be at
that crime scene. Isn't that true?

A:  I don't know if it's impossible for me to have blood at Nicole's
house or not. I knew--

Q:  Well, was it possible--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let him answer the question.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Excuse me. Go ahead.

A:  I knew that--and I don't know if I knew this that week. I'm telling
you as I know today. I knew I didn't deposit any blood at Nicole's
house that  day. So that's what I know today. I don't recall in the
scheme of things when this blood drops became an issue in all of this.
I don't recall if that was that week or the following week or what.

Q:  So you're saying that when you first heard that report, you
weren't certain whether you had deposited blood at the crime scene?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Wait a minute. "At the crime scene"? That
isn't what he said.

MR. BREWER: I am just asking.

Q:  Is that what you're saying?

A:  No. I'm saying that as I can tell you now today, I did not deposit
any blood that day at Nicole's house. It just--it didn't happen. So
that's what I know for a fact today. During the course of all of this,
when whose blood was where, I don't know when I found that out. I
don't know if that was that week, the next week. I don't know if it
was weeks later. I really don't know.

Q:  Well, when you first heard that report about your blood being at
the crime scene, in your mind did you know that that wasn't possible?

A:  I knew it was impossible for me to have deposited that blood that
night at anywhere. If it was my blood or wherever they may have
found blood of
mine, I knew it was impossible for me to have deposited that blood at
Nicole's house that night.

Q:  That's because you weren't there. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And you weren't bleeding on her property. Is that true?

A:  Not that day, certainly not, no.

Q:  Well, some other day do you recall bleeding on the Bundy
property?

A:  I do recall at some point, and it may have been when we first got
Kato, the dog, I do recall at one point Sydney and Justin getting me a-
-I don't   know if it's Flintstones or something Band-Aid. I just don't
recall when. That could have been months previous to this. I just
don't recall.

Q:  Well, did you cut yourself and were you dripping blood up the
walkway at the Bundy property?

A:  At that time? I don't know.

Q:  At any time prior to June 12 , 1994--

A:  Not that I'm aware of.

Q:  --did you ever drip blood up the Bundy walkway?

A:  Not that I'm aware of

Q:  Is it possible?

A:  Anything's possible. But not that I'm aware of.

Q:  You have a specific recollection of having the kids get you a Band-
Aid because you cut yourself at the Bundy property?

A:  I don't know. I just have a -- I remember having a--I think a
Flintstones--I'm not sure. One of these Band-Aids, I remember
Sydney getting me one. It may have had something to do with Nicole
closing my hand in her car door.

Q:  Was that an accident?

A:  Yeah. Yeah. But I don't recall dripping blood at that time. I know
it was like a tear or something [indicating] , but I don't recall dripping
blood at that time.

Q:  You're pointing to the pinkie on your left hand.

A:  I think so. I think it was one of my hands. I can't even remember
what hand it was. But she--the window part of her thing, she closed
the door on my hand.

Q:  And do you remember the reporter that first made that report that
was reporting your blood being found at the Bundy crime scene?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember what channel it was on?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember where you were when you first heard that
report?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember saying anything in response to the TV or
anyone else in the room when you first heard that report?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have a verbal response when you first heard the report
your blood was being found--your blood had been found at the crime
scene?

A:  Possibly.

Q:  Okay. What did you say?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  You have no recollection whatsoever?

A:  No.

Q:  When did you first learn about the location of the blood drops
found at Rockingham? Do you understand that question?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. As you sit here today, do you know where blood drops
were found at Rockingham?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. For example, they were found in the foyer. Is that correct?

A:  I'm told that, yes.

Q:  Well, when you say you're "told that," you've seen the actual
photographs that have identified the location in the foyer where the
blood
drops were found. Isn't that true?

A:  Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you put blood drops there, they're not
found.

MR. BREWER: Excuse me?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If blood drops are placed there, they're not
found, but go ahead.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, aside from semantics, you have seen photographs where
there are identifying marks indicating that blood drops were found in
your foyer. Is that true?

A:  I've seen those photographs, yes.

Q:  And, similarly, you have seen photographs where identifying
marks have been placed on blood drops found in your driveway. Is
that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. Now, Mr. Simpson, when is the first time that you learned
or had any information relative to the location of blood drops found at
Rockingham?

A:  Some of it I think I learned upon arriving at my house.

Q:  Okay. And how did you learn that?

A:  A police officer. I don't know if it was Phillips. When I was
handcuffed by the house, I kept saying, "Why am I handcuffed?" And
somebody said something about blood, "There's blood here, and that,
'We got blood there; we got blood here," and I saw these cards, and I
assumed--I guess I made an assumption that maybe that was some
blood drops.

Q:  Okay. So there was some discussion in your police statement
about blood being found at Rockingham. Is that correct?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  And in fact you knew before you even went down to the police
station that there was blood found--at least you speculated that there
may have been blood found at Rockingham because you saw cards
identifying blood spots. Is that true?

A:  I really didn't speculate anything. This guy said, "Blood was
found" or "There's blood here and there's blood there," or something,
and--

Q:  Who said that?

A:  I believe it was Phillips or it was--whoever had--said it had a
mustache.

Q:  They have white cards identifying where the drops were?

A:  I don't know. I don't know. There were just--there were--yes,
there were cards. I don't know if they were white cards or what, but
there were   things, you know, sitting in spots and--I don't know. The
guy just said that, and, you know, that wasn't prevalent--that wasn't
foremost on my mind.   That wasn't what I was focusing on.

Q:  Well, you came back from Chicago because your wife had been
killed. Is that correct, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Because my ex-wife had been killed, yes.

Q:  Okay. And then you were told as you entered the property, after
being handcuffed, that blood was found on your property. Is that true,
sir?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Did you tell them "Hey, I cut myself last night. Maybe that's from
me"?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you offer any explanation at that time with respect to those
blood drops?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you conclude in your own mind that perhaps those blood
drops were left by you because you had cut your finger--

A:  No.

Q:  --the night before?

A:  No.

Q:  You had no thoughts one way or another how those blood drops
got there?

A:  I didn't think about blood drops. I was thinking about Nicole, my
kids and why was I handcuffed.


Q:  Well, all the way back from Chicago you were making phone calls
to a number of different people, trying to investigate exactly what
happened. Isn't that true?

A:  No. I was trying to have people go by my house, see what my
family was doing, what was going on with my family, and, yes,
information--I like to know what was going on, what happened, and
still to this day want to know what happened.

Q:  And when you saw the blood drops, you made no statements
whatsoever with respect to those possibly coming from you from the
night before, to Detective Phillips?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Did you ask him whether he knew how those blood drops got
there?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ask him how long they believed they were there?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ask him any questions whatsoever with respect to how
those blood drops got there?

A:  I asked him. "Why am I hand---cuffed?"

Q:  Well, you saw blood drops on your driveway. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  You just indicated that you were told that blood drops were on
your driveway.

A:  No. The guy said, "There's blood around here" or "blood here and
there's a lot of blood there," so--

Q:  Well, did you ask him, "Hey, did it come from the murderer?"

A:  I didn't ask him anything. I didn't know what to ask him. I
wanted to know where my kids are. I want to know, "Why am I
handcuffed? Where are my kids? Why can't I go in my house?" Those
are the things I wanted to know.

Q:  So you had no interest in finding out any information with respect
to blood drops found--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer. That's--

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  --on your property?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: --argumentative.

THE WITNESS: At that time, no.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Okay. Prior to Detective Phillips telling you about blood drops on
your--

A:  If it was Phillips. I'm not sure it was Phillips. There's another guy
I see sometimes, and it could have been that guy, but whoever did it
had a   mustache. I wasn't paying attention to him. It was so much
going on, and as things were happening, you know, my lawyer was
there and Vannatter was there. You know. it was a tough, tough time.

Q:  Let's kind of hone in here and see if we can identify possibly who
you spoke with. It could have been Phillips. Is that what you're
saying?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. There is someone else that was there that it could have
been?

A:  There was a lot of other people there, but there is one other guy I
have seen since, and when I think about it, I wonder was that Phillips
or this  other guy.

Q:  That spoke to you about the blood drops.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And was the other person a detective or a uniformed
officer?

A:  Detective.

Q:  And can you describe him?

A:  He has a mustache. That's all I can tell you.

Q:  Have you ever learned his identity?

A:  I may have seen him and heard his name, but I can't recall now.

Q:  Did he testify at the criminal trial?

A:  No.

Q:  Was he ever in the court?

A:  I can't recall.

Q:  Okay. Other than having a mustache, do you have any other
information that would help identify him?

A:  No.

Q:  Any other description of him other than having a mustache?

A:  White guy with a mustache.

Q:  How tall was he?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  What color was his hair?

A:  I wasn't paying attention to him. I don't--you know, I don't really
study guys.

Q:  Okay. Was it Detective Lange?

A:  No.

Q:  You're able to definitively rule out that it was Detective Lange?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Was it Detective Vannatter?

A:  No.

Q:  Able to rule out that it was Vannatter?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was it Detective Fuhrman?

A:  No.

Q:  Are you able to rule out that it was Detective Fuhrman?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. You know it was a detective, though.

A:  Well, he was on my property, had on a suit. and I assumed it was
a detective.

Q:  Did he have a badge?

A:  I didn't see a badge.

Q:  Did he represent himself as a Los Angeles police officer or
detective?

A:  I don't recall that.

Q:  Going back to Exhibit 6. Now, when you wrote this letter, you
indicated that you were in a lot of pain from the loss of Nicole. Is that
true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you felt suicidal. Is that true?

A:  I wanted the pain to stop.

Q:  Okay. And the secondary component to your feelings at that time
were other things. There were other things going on, I think is how
you    described them earlier. Is that correct?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Well

A:  Everything was going on. I was in pain. I wanted the pain to stop.
That's all I can really say about it. I was in a lot of pain.

Q:  Okay. And the pain, as you've indicated already, is because of
Nicole, the loss of Nicole.

A:  I would say that was obviously the genesis and the major portion
of it all. Yes.

Q:  And were you beginning to feel like you were being targeted as the
person that committed these murders?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And wasn't that based upon news reports of evidence that was
being developed in the case?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  And you knew at the time that you were told about these murders
and thereafter that the Los Angeles Police Department was conducting
an investigation. Isn't that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And I take it, Mr. Simpson, that you assumed that they would
continue the investigation and develop evidence and leads and follow
those leads in
connection with this case. True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  At the time of--Strike that. As of June 12 ,1994, did you have any
concerns about the competency of the Los Angeles Police Department
in conducting murder investigations?

A:  I didn't give it any thought.

Q:  Okay. Did you assume that they would competently follow
through with any leads that they developed in connection with the
case?

A:  At the time I didn't give it any thought.

Q:  Did you have any reason to believe they wouldn't?

A:  No reason whatsoever.

Q:  Did you have any reason to believe that they would not ultimately
locate or identify the person or persons responsible for these murders?

A:  At the time I didn't think about that.

Q:  Okay. Well, were you confident that they would conduct an
investigation and hopefully find the person that murdered your wife--
ex-wife and Ron Goldman?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: How can you be confident if you didn't
think about it?

THE WITNESS: I have--you know, I read a lot of--a lot, and I know
that normally they don't. In most cases they don't. So, I mean, that
was just    knowledge I had from you know, years of reading, and,
you know, in most cases they don't.

BY MR. BREWER: Q:  Well, Mr. Simpson during the first--

A:  I don't know if I thought about that that day. I'm pretty sure I
didn't even think about that then.

Q:  When you talk about everything going on, you're talking about
press reports that are intimating that you killed Nicole and Ron
Goldman. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean to the exclusion of everything
else, that's what he's talking about?

MR. BREWER: No.

Q:  When you said earlier that the reason why you were suicidal--you
gave two reasons: One was the pain associated with the loss of
Nicole. The  second reason was what you characterized as
"everything." I want to figure out what is the everything. And in
relationship to that, you've
indicated that you began to hear press reports about you possibly
being the number one target or the suspect in connection with these
murders. Is that
true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Which one do you want him to answer?
Don't answer that question. There's about four questions in there, and
it's compound. Don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Well, were you concerned, Mr. Simpson, about the press reports
that were indicating that you were the number one suspect in
connection with these murders?

A:  I don't know if I was concerned. I was hurt by it all, and it just
added to the hurt that I was feeling.

Q:  Okay--And did you believe that the information that was being
reported as tending to indicate that you had some responsibility was
false?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that--Let's take, for example, the information relative to your
blood being found at Bundy. Did you have a belief that any
information
that reported your blood being found at Bundy was false?

A:  I don't know if I knew or heard that that week, so I can't answer
that because I don't have any--I can't tell you when I heard that. That
could   have been three weeks later or four weeks later, as far as I
know. So that wasn't anything that I could focus on right now and
say that that was a part of it.

Q:  As you sit here today, is the only report that you recall indicating
anything about you in connection with these murders the NBC report
referring to your demeanor and attitude when you got to Chicago?

A:  I'm sorry. Ask the question again.

Q:  As you sit here today, is the only news report that you recall in this
first week that you have a specific recollection of the NBC news
report by Jim Avila about you coming to Chicago and being loud and
boisterous? Is that the only one you recall?

A:  I have a specific recollection that there were numerous things being
said that week that gave an impression that I was--I committed this
crime. I do remember that. Avila's--I remember because I believe it
was the first thing I heard to be--that I knew personally was totally
false.

Q:  Okay. And did you perceive his report as having a tendency to
implicate you in these murders?

A:  That's the way it sounded to me, yes.

Q:  Okay. Is there any other report that you have a specific recollection
of other than the Avila report?

A:  Right now I can't at this moment not say. I just know there were
numerous things that week.

Q:  Well, when you say "numerous things," what is the numerous?
What--

A:  I don't know.

Q:  --items were being reported that you were responding to or
concerned about?

A:  If you--maybe you should do go and listen to all the reports that
week, and you'll find them. I have no specific memory right now. I
know they were there, I know I heard them, and I know that at the
time that they were--all of it was causing more pain.

Q:  well, as of the writing of this letter, did you assume that eventually
this would all be sorted out and that the murderers would eventually
be found or identified?

A:  I certainly hoped so.

Q:  Okay. And you had every reason to believe that that would
happen, didn't you?

A:  I certainly hoped so.

Q:  Okay. And that was your frame of mind at the time that you wrote
this letter. Isn't that true?

A:  When I wrote this letter my frame of mind was stopping pain that I
was feeling. Everything else was--everything else at the time,
everything else was almost irrelevant to me. I just wanted to stop the
way I was feeling.

Q:  Well, part of that pain could be alleviated if they identified the
murderers or the murderer. Isn't that true?

A:  I don't know. I don't--that day I was feeling so much pain that I
don't know what could have alleviated it.

Q:  Was it was on the 17th that you were feeling this pain?

A:  I was feeling it all week, but it came to a crescendo on the 17th.

Q:  Well, did something happen in particular on the 17th that brought
it to a crescendo?

A:  I think that I was then arrested, yes.

Q:  Okay. So prior to the 17th did you have any occasion where you
began to think about suicide?

A:  Maybe.

Q:  When did you first--when did it first cross your mind?

A:  I don't know if it ever crossed my I mind. I just know I wanted
the pain to stop, and at that point on the 17th I wanted to be with
Nicole, and     that's what I attempted to do.

Q:  Well, when did you first think about doing anything affirmatively
to stop the pain?

A:  I don't know. It was kind of a spontaneous thing. At just a
moment I remember looking at A.C. I said,'Take me to Nicole's
grave," and I don't know when at any point in any of that that
anything ever became affirmative in my mind. If it had, I'd be dead
right now. So I don't--I can't say that it ever got affirmative at any
point, but I know I just wanted to stop the pain.

Q:  Well, you just mentioned that you looked at A.C. and said, 'Take
me to Nicole's grave." Was that after you learned that you were going
to be  arrested?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And would it be fair to say that that was the first time that you
decided to do anything affirmatively to stop the pain?

A:  It was the first time that I--yeah, I wanted to go to Nicole's grave,
yes. I did want to do that.

Q:  Did you begin to draft the letter after you were advised that you
were going to be, arrested?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. So prior to that information -- Strike that. Prior to learning
that information, you hadn't undertaken any effort to draft this letter.
Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  You also said that you made some amendments or an amendment
to your will. Is that correct?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Okay. And you don't recall what you changed or what you were
going to after, if anything.?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Do you recall whether any of those changes included making
dispositions to the Goldmans?

A:  I know that didn't. I know that's wrong.

Q:  Any of those changes include dispositions to the Browns?

A:  No.

Q:  To your children.?

A:  I don't know. I think it just had to do with my family.

Q:  When you say your "family," you're talking about Sydney and
Justin or Arnelle and Jason or--

A:  Yeah, basically. My mother, my family.

Q:  Was there anything in there that stated anything about the Browns?

A:  I--in my will? I don't believe so.

Q:  Was there anything, whether it be a dispositive provision or not,
just a statement --

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  --or comment

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Let me finish my question. Whether it be a dispositive provision,
whether there was a statement or comment mentioning the Browns?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  How the about the Goldmans?

A:  No, definitely not.

Q:  You're positive there is no mention in the amendment with respect
to the Goldmans. Is that correct?

A:  Positive.

Q:  I want you to look at, if you would, Mr. Simpson. Exhibit 6, and
in large part, as you've already indicated, this letter or this "To Whom
It MayConcern" letter was drafted because of the pain that you were
experiencing from losing Nicole. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. You've answered it six
times.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Prior to drafting this letter had you heard news reports about any
marital discord between you and Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall any specific reports?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall what you were specifically told or what you heard?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall the general tenor of the reports?

A:  Negative, but, no, not anything specific to it other than that.

Q:  Well, when you say 'negative,' what do you mean by that?

A:  I know that it--I felt negative. I felt it was a negative report. I felt it
was negative. It made me feel more pain.

Q:  Okay. Did the reports include claims that you had battered Nicole?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Did they include reports that you had beat Nicole?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Did they include reports that you had choked Nicole?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Do you recall any of the specifics as they relate to your relationship
with Nicole that were being reported?

A:  Right at this day, I don't recall the specifics, but there was a lot of
stuff, and I just don't recall the specifics.

Q:  Well, the first paragraph of this exhibit is really defending your
relationship, isn't it?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well. that's your characterization.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Well, I am asking for your state of mind.

A:  I don't know

Q:  Isn't that what you were doing?

A:  As of the date, my state of mind then was to stop the pain or
whatever the hell was going on in my life. I was in a lot of pain at the
time, and, you know, I was just not the way I normally am.

Q:  Well, the first paragraph of Exhibit 6 relates to your explanation as
to problems you had with Nicole. True?

A:  Let me read that. [ Witness reviews document.] I don't think so.
No, I don't agree with you there.

Q:  Well. You are describing a relationship that has ups and downs in
the first paragraph, aren't you?

A:  No. I think I'm describing a relationship that had come to a place
where we were both comfortable with who we are and where we
were, and we were going in our--on with our lives.

Q:  And in fact you indicate on the 10th line down that you mutually
agreed to go--"We mutually agreed to go our separate ways." Do you
see that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that an accurate statement?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  And are you referencing the time frame of April-May 1994?

A:  No. I'm referencing--I'm doing either Mother's Day or the day
after Mother's Day of May.

Q:  1994.

A:  Yes.

Q:  That's the time period that you're referring to?

A:  Well that's when we split and had no problems and were--you
know, that's when we sat and talked and went our separate ways.

Q:  Okay. And the adjective that you used, "mutually" agreed--

A:  Yeah.

Q:  --that's a fair characterization of how you --

A:  Yeah, she was accepting of it. She was very accepting. She
wouldn't go to therapy, so she was accepting of it. That was a choice
she made.

Q:  When do you first recall reading any press articles that said
anything about your relationship with Nicole in a negative context?

A:  Oh, months after all of this.

Q:  Months after the murders?

A:  Yes.

Q:  So during the week--

A:  Maybe not months. Weeks after the murders.

Q:  Well, up until June 17, then, you didn't read any press reports that
spoke negatively about you and Nicole?

A:. No.

Q:  Is that true?

A:  That's true.

Q:  Were you anticipating then that there were going to be press
reports subsequent to June 17, 1994 that portrayed your relationship
with Nicole in a negative way?

A:  No. That was the tenor I got off TV, the reports that I heard on
TV.

Q:  Prior to June 17, 1994.

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Did you read anything that related to a negative relationship
between you and Nicole?

A:  I didn't read anything.

Q:  Okay. I mean a press report, newspaper?

A:  I didn't read anything.

Q:  You didn't read anything at all that week?

A:  That's correct

Q:  You got all of your information from TV?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Were there particular stations that you watched?

A:  I'm sure all of them.

Q:  You were just looking for information?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You wanted to obtain information relative to these murders?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Were you following the investigation?

A:  Only what I saw on TV when I was watching TV

Q:  Were you doing anything else to develop information relative to
the investigation other than watching TV?

A:  At this time, no.

Q:  Were you continuing to contact the police department to determine
the status of their investigation?

A:  I believe my lawyer was. I wasn't.

Q:  Did you personally contact the police department?

A:  No.

Q:  Let me finish my question. Did you personally contact the police
department after June 13, 1994 in an effort to learn the status of the
investigation?

A:  I think my lawyer was under my employment, and he was doing
that. My concern was to bury Nicole and try to get through the week
with my kids and deal with what I was trying to deal with there, the
pain of it all.

Q:  The lawyer that you thought--

A:  I wasn't in a place--

Q:  I'm sorry.

A:  I wasn't in a place that first week to-- I had family to consider, and
I had myself to consider, and I wasn't into an investigative mode that
week.

Q:  Okay. So it would be--your state of mind was really one wanting
to stay with the family and --

A:  My state of mind was to get through the week and for Nicole to be
buried and hopefully that my kids would be fine through it, which
they which they were.

Q:  And that was your focus?

A:  That was my focus.

Q:  And that focus made it difficult for you to do anything else?

A:  It was tough. I mean, yeah, it was tough doing other things that
week, yes.

Q:  Okay. But you found time on the 14th to go down and get your
golf clubs at the airport. Right?

A:  Yeah.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't-- okay.

THE WITNESS: No, I think that's wrong. Yeah, the 13th, was it?
Was that the 13th?

BY MR. BREWER: Q:  Was it the 13th?

A:  No. It may have been the 14th. Yes, that's correct.

Q:  You went down with Mr. Kardashian in his car to the airport to get
your golf clubs. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And you weren't going to play golf that week, were you?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Were you in some need of having  your golf clubs with
you?

A:  I was in need to have something to do while I was waiting for my
kids.

Q:  Okay. And so the thing that you chose to do was to go get your
golf clubs at the airport?

A:  Because I was near it, yes. That's correct.

Q:  Did it help you at all deal with the pain associated with losing
Nicole to drive down to the airport and get your golf clubs?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. That's argumentative.

MR. BREWER: No, it's not. He's already said that

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He is not going to answer it, so you can just
save your speech.

BY MR. BREWER: Q:  By the way, did you go anywhere else that
day with Mr. Kardashian other than the airport to get your golf clubs?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Where else did you go?

A:  To my office, to Nicole's house, to his house.

Q:  Okay. And the visit to Nicole's house was really a drive-by visit
because there was too much media there to stop. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And from there you went down to the airport to get your golf
clubs. Right?

A:  No. From there he just drove, and at one point when we realized
that A.C. was 40 or 50 minutes away and he said, "Where do you
want to drive?" I said, "Just drive." And we were near the airport and I
said, "You know, I have some bags at the airport or bag at the airport.
Let's go by and get it," which we did.

Q:  Was there anything that you needed out of that bag?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Had you finished Mr. Simpson?

THE WITNESS: Huh?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Had you finished your answer?

THE WITNESS: Well, so it was a matter of killing time. It was a
matter of just trying to do something while I was waiting for my kids
to come, and not just to sit and look at the news. It was just a matter to
occupy myself while my kids were coming, and we just happened to
be in that--in the general vicinity, and my kids were still 40 or 50
minutes away.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Is there anything that you needed out of your golf bag?

A:  Needed at that moment?

Q:  Sure.

A:  No.

Q:  On Page   at the top of the page of Exhibit 6, you indicate--you
make the statement that "What's being said, most of it, totally made
up." You
see that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  What specifically are you talking about is made up?

A:  Well, as I told you, I can specifically remember the Avila story,
and there were other things being said. and I can't specifically
remember them.
Bbut there was numerous things being said. I'm sure all the people
still have the video of their reports that we can go through it.

Q:  Well, I don't know--I want to know what you were thinking when
you made that statement.

A:  Just what I told you.

Q:  --what were you--excuse me. What were you referencing when
you said most of what's been said is totally made up?

A:  What I told you before: That in the reports they were saying
various things. I don't recall all those things right now. I believe they
may have had to do with Nicole's and my relationship, but various
things were being reported, and it was negative--certainly had negative
tones to it.

Q:  Well, when you say, "various things were being reported," what
was being reported?

A:  I don't know how many times I have to tell you, I don't recall that
week, but they--I'm sure they have tapes of all of that stuff. I don't
recall what it was. I just know it was.

Q:  Okay. The reason why I'm asking you .

A:  I don't have a memory of this date ---as of this date what they
were. It was so much stuff in this trial that's been negative, I don't
recall what I learned after the 17th or before the 17th. I do know that
during the course of that week it was painful to me, some of the things
that were being said, and it all added to my state of mind that I was in.
And we can go talk about the same thing over and over if you want,
but that's--I don't remember anything specific other than Avila at this
particular time.

Q:  That's the only thing you remember?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. Don't answer that. He's
asked it numerous--innumerable times.

MR. BREWER: Well, I haven't asked that innumerable times.

EXAMINATION BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Good morning, Mr. Simpson.

A:   Good morning, Mr. Brewer.

Q:   Mr. Simpson, since Friday have you  reviewed any documents to
prepare for today s session?

A:   No.

Q:   Have you reviewed any photographs?

A:   No.

Q:  Other than your attorneys, have you  spoken with anyone concerning
your deposition here today?

A:   No.

Q:  Has anyone read anything to you?

A:  No.

Q:   Okay. I want to just go back to where we ended on Friday. We were
talking about you coming to Rockingham and being advised by either
Detective Phillips or some other detective regarding blood that was found at
the Rockingham premises. Do you remember that testimony?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Okay. Was it your understanding that  Rockingham, when you got
there, that Rockingham was declared a crime scene?

A:  I didn't have an understanding one way or the other.

Q:  When you got back to Rockingham from Chicago. did you see any
yellow tape anywhere on your property?

A:  Not that I had noticed.

Q:  When you first got back to Rockingham at some point, were you
handcuffed?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Can you describe how that happened?

A:  I got out of the car, I started walking towards my front door, and a police
officer said he couldn't let me go in, and, "Mr. Simpson, I've been told I
need to handcuff you," or words to that effect.

Q:   Okay. Now, you got out of the car  and you were walking towards your
front door. Did you have your grip with you at the time?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you have any other luggage with you at the time?

A:  In the car we were--Yes. Yes, there was-- I assumed everybody  else
was getting out with me because they wouldn't let us drive on, and they were
getting out with luggage, and I just was trying to get in the house, so...

Q:  Okay. The only luggage that you had on your person. though, was the
grip that you were carrying. Is that correct?

A:  On my person as I got out of the car. Yes.

Q:  Okay. And were you expecting to be arrested when you got back to
Rockingham?

A:  No.

Q:   Were you expecting to be handcuffed when you got back to
Rockingham?

A:  No.

Q:   At the time that you arrived at Rockingham, were you aware of any
information that the police had which had a tendency to implicate your
involvement in these crimes?

A:  No.

Q:  When you were handcuffed, what did you say, if anything?

A:  I don't know. I think I inquired, "What are you doing? What's going on
here? "

Q:  And what did he say?

A:  I don't recall. He just said he was following orders. I'm--I shouldn't be
saying this because I don't really recall the conversation the officer and I had
at that point. All I know is I was kind of bewildered.

Q:  Was this a uniformed officer?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   Was this a black uniformed officer?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And as you were walking--were you  walking up the driveway when he
stopped you?

A:  I think he stopped the car and just walked up the driveway with me.

Q:  Okay. And at that point he handcuffed you?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Do you recall protesting or yelling or saying anything when you were
handcuffed?

A:  Yelling?

Q:  Yes.

A:  I don't believe so, no.

Q:  The only thing you recall saying was something--

A:  "What's going on?"

Q:  "What's going on?"

A:  "What is this about? Why are you doing this?" or words to that effect,
yes.

Q:  And do you recall anything at all that the police officer said to you?

A:  No. Not really.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall saying anything else to the police officer after you
were handcuffed other than, "What's going on?"

A:  I knew I wanted to talk to somebody because he wasn't in charge, and I
guess they--I--once again I'm real sketchy here, but I'm assuming that he--

MR.ROBERT BAKER: Don't assume.

THE WITNESS: I can't assume. I know I wanted to find out -- needed to
talk to somebody that was in charge.

BY MR.BREWER:
Q:  I assume that you were surprised when you were handcuffed?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Would shocked be a better word or better description of how you felt?

A:  I think I already was in shock.

Q:  Well, in terms of you being handcuffed, that had certain implications in
your mind, didn't it?

A:  My mind was where my kids was and what had happened. That was
probably the prevalent thing that was on my mind. You know, I thought this
was just--I didn't know what this was. I just wanted to talk to someone in
charge.

Q:  Okay. You wanted to find out what happened.

A:  Yeah, what was going on.

Q:  Okay. And you felt, as the ex-husband of Nicole Brown Simpson, that
you had a right to obtain information relative to her death. Is that correct?

A:  I don't think--I don't know--I don't think any of those thoughts went
into my head like you're saying. All I know is that Nicole had been murdered,
from what I understood; my kids were somewhere; my daughter, oldest
daughter, was in a bad way; I had no idea how my other son was;  police
were at my house, and I was --other than that, I can't tell you what process
my mind was going through.

Q:  Okay. So you were really focused on your family and your kids and just
the loss of Nicole again at the Rockingham--

A:  I don't know what I was focusing on. I just wanted to know what was
going on. And focus may have been what I wasn't, was focused.

Q:  Well, the last thing on your mind was the fact that you were going to be
handcuffed and arrested when you got back. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Now, at some point after you were handcuffed, did you ask that the
handcuffs be removed?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Who did you ask?

A:  I think my lawyers had gotten to  me by then. and they went to find who
would take them off or something, and they were removed.

Q:  Okay. Did your lawyers come over to the  location where you were being
handcuffed?

A:  I don't think so. I think after they handcuffed me, I went and stood by a
doll house, and then things started happening. People were coming and
going, and I was trying to, you know--I knew Skip was supposed to be
there. I knew--Skip was there with me, and I was just, you know--I don't
know. I was just--you know, whatever was happening, was happening.

Q:   Okay. So after you were handcuffed, you went over and stood by a doll
house by yourself?

A:  No. I think a police officer was there.

Q:   Okay. And then at any point did you ever personally ask that the
handcuffs be removed?

A:  I asked the guy, why is he handcuffing me. He said he was just doing
what he was ordered. And I said, "Well, find who's in charge," and evidently
somebody went off to find who was in charge. By the time that person came
up my lawyer was there, and they took the handcuffs off of me.

Q:  Okay. So you asked the uniformed police officer to find someone who
was in charge. Correct?

A:  Something to that effect, because it was--he said he was only doing what
he was told to do.

Q:   Okay. After you made that request, did someone come over to you  and
talk to you who you believed to be in charge at that point?

A:  At some point, and I can't tell you when, Vannatter showed up and,
consequently, took my handcuffs off.

Q:   You were still handcuffed when Vannatter showed up?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Did you personally ask Vannatter to have the handcuffs removed?

A:  I believe my lawyer did.

Q:  Okay. You didn't ask him, though.

A:  I believe my lawyer did.

Q:   Approximately how long were you at the Rockingham premises before
you were transported downtown to give a statement?

A:  I have no idea.

Q:  Was it a matter of a half hour? Couple hours? Three hours?

A:  I have absolutely no idea.

Q:   Okay. Do you remember anything else you did other than stand by the
doll house being handcuffed before you were transported downtown?

A:  No.

Q:   Do you remember talking to Detective Vannatter at all relative to the facts
and circumstances concerning Nicole's death?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: While he is still at Rockingham?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Yeah, all of this is while you were still at Rockingham before you were
transported down to the Los Angeles Police Department.

A:  I remember Vannatter, and I don't --I can't really recall what the
conversation was about. I knew it was about the handcuffs and about taking
to the police or an interview or something, but my lawyers were there doing
most of the talking at that time.

Q:  Were you standing in close proximity to where Vannatter was talking to
your lawyers?

A:  I believe so. They kinda moved around. They were there. They moved. I
believe at some points in times I was.

Q:   Did you overhear some portions  of their discussions?

A:  Not really, no.

Q:   Was it your understanding there was some discussion relative to you
going down to the police station and giving a statement?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you recall any discussion between you and Detective Vannatter
concerning blood that was found at Rockingham?

A:  Vannatter, not really. He may have said something to my lawyer about
stuff there, but I can't recall. I don't really recall.

Q:  Do you recall overhearing some discussion between Vannatter and your
lawyers concerning blood found at Rockingham?

A:  I just knew--I don't--I can't recall. I know one guy said something to
me, and then they were talking about something, and it was my impression
when I was going downtown that blood or something was found around my
property. That was my impression. Exactly how I got that impression was
just whatever was going on that-- during that period of time.

Q:  When you say some guy mentioned something to me," you're referring
now to the Phillips or the other detectives --

A:  Yeah.

Q:  statement to you?

A:  Yeah.

Q:   Did that statement also include or imply the notion that blood was found
inside your Bronco?

A:  I don't know. I have absolutely no idea. They were just saying
something was there, and I wanted the handcuffs off, and they wanted to talk.

Q:   Okay. So would it be fair to say that at the time that you left
Rockingham to go down to the Los Angeles Police Department to give a
statement, that the only areas where you had any information relative to the
location of blood was on the driveway at Rockingham?

A:  I don't know if I had--I just--I saw things there, so--

Q:  You say things." White cards?

A:  I don't know if they were white. They were markers, though, and
outside of that and what this guy said to me and whatever was being said at
the time, I--that wasn't my focus.

Q:  Okay. Well, you understood the white card--the white markers that you
observed were identifying blood or some type of evidence in the driveway,
didn't you?

A:  No.

Q:   You had no idea whatsoever?

A:  No, not really.

Q:   Okay. I mean, you've seen white markers used like that in television and
news reports in the past, haven't you?

A:  I don't know if I have.

Q:   Mr. Simpson, as you were still at Rockingham and became aware that
blood was found on your property, did you begin to make some association
in your mind between the cut that you had--or the blood that you had
observed the previous evening on the 1h and the blood that was found at
Rockingham on the driveway?

A:  No

Q:  Had no association whatsoever?

A:  No.

Q:  Didn't even cross your mind that possibly that was blood that you left the
previous evening, on the 1h?

A:  Nothing about the blood crossed my mind at all. I was thinking about my
kids and what might have happened to Nicole.

Q:  And by the way, at the time that you were at Rockingham thinking about
what might have happened with Nicole, you understood that this  was -- she
was probably murdered. Right?

A:  Yeah, I think I was trying to digest that, yes.

Q:  Okay. And at that time you didn't know whether the means of
committing the murder were a gun, a knife, strangulation, anything of that
nature, did you?

A:  I don't know if I thought about it at that time, but I didn't. correct.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall thinking about how she was murdered?

A:  At that time, no.

Q:  : Now, when you went from Rockingham down to the police
department, you went there specifically give a statement to the police. Is that
correct?

A:  No.

Q:  Well, what was your purpose in going down to the Los Angeles Police
Department?

A:  To do whatever they wanted me to do to -- so that I could,  you know,
go and see my kids and find out what's going on.

Q:  Well, did you think you were going down there to give--to make some
kind of identification of Nicole's body?

A:  I didn't know.

Q:  You had no idea why you were going to the police department?

A:  I knew they wanted to talk to me, but I  didn't know what else they
wanted to do, no.

Q:  Okay. I mean, you understood they wanted to talk to you because you
were possibly a suspect, didn't you, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Yeah, I think that probably crossed my mind, yes.

Q:  Okay. And then as you were driving down to the police department, you
were beginning to think about the events of the previous evening because you
knew you were going to be asked about those events. Right?

A:  No, that's incorrect.

Q:  Well, did you think about what you had done the previous evening as
you were driving down to the police department?

A:  No.

Q:   Did you begin to make an association in the car between the blood that
was purported being found at Rockingham and the blood you noticed on your
finger the previous evening?

A:  No.

Q:  Made no association whatsoever?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you begin to think about any of your activities in the last 24 hours as
you were in the car headed down to the police department?

A:  No.

Q:   What were the--what was the focus of your thoughts, if any, as you
were en route to the police department to give a statement in connection with
these murder?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he didn't ever say that he knew he was going
to give a statement. He knew they were going to talk to him.

MR. BREWER: Let me rephrase it.

Q:  What was your thought process, if any, as you were headed down to the
police department to talk to the police in connection with these murders?

A:  My kids.

(Daniel Petrocelli enters the deposition.)

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  And your "kids" meaning what?

A:  All of my kids.

Q:  Well, how about--

A:  Where they were. I probably thought if--you know, like my other kids,
my younger kids, if they were all right, and I was just trying to, you know--I
don't know if I digested that Nicole was dead. It was just kind of a hard thing
to digest.

Q:  When you say your kids, not knowing whether they were taken care of,
had you made arrangements to take care of your children before you are en
route back from Chicago?

A:  I think when I talked to my daughter, they were going to go get them
and take them to Laguna. Uh--

Q:  Okay. So--Go ahead.

A:  That, but my daughter was in sort of a bad way, my older daughter was
in sort of a bad way, so I was a little concerned about her, too. Not a little.
Just as much as concerned about her. I was pretty concerned about my older
daughter, because when I spoke to her, she was in a bad way.

Q:  Did you specifically ask Arnelle to take care of the children?

A:  I think they said they were going to get them. I said, "Go get them
immediately," and it may  have been mentioned that they were going to take
them to Laguna. I'm not really sure if that was mentioned in that particular
conversation.

Q:  Laguna meaning the Browns?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And I take it you had great confidence in the Browns' ability to care for
your children at that time?

A:  At that time, yes.

Q:  So you knew that if they were successfully transported to the Browns
they would be well taken care of by family members?

A:  Yeah, they aren't my family, but my -- their family was a lot closer than
my family, so yes, was confident in that.

Q:  And after you had asked Arnelle to make arrangements to transport the
kids down to Laguna, did you ever obtain any confirmation that in fact they
had arrived in Laguna?

A:  I don't know about arrived, but I knew that they had gone. A.C had
taken them and evidently had gotten them there.

Q:  Did you learn that before you got to Rockingham?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  You have no memory whatsoever with respect to when you learned
that A.C had transported the kids down to Laguna?

A:  No, but I knew as the day went on that he had, and I don't know if Skip
Taft or Cathy Randa or somebody else had communicated that to me.

Q:  Okay. So I take it that once you learned that A.C had transported the kids
to Laguna, you were satisfied that the kids for the time being were taken care
of.

A:  Yeah, the minute A.C or Arnelle had gotten them, I would have assumed
they were in good hands.

Q:   And did you learn that information before you left to go down to the
police department to talk to the police?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:   You don't know when that was in relationship to talking to the police?

A:  No.

Q:  You don't know whether it was before or after?

A:  No.

Q:  Now, when you got down to the police department, you agreed to talk to
Detectives Vannatter and Lange--is that correct?--without the presence of your
lawyer.

A:  Yeah.

Q:   And,  Mr. Simpson, you knew that in  talking to them, they were going
to question you relative to the murder of your wife and another man. Is that
correct?

A:  I assumed that would have been the subject, yes.

Q:  And I take it this is the first time in your life that anyone had ever
questioned you in connection with a murder. Is that correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And you were going to be questioned without your lawyer. Is that
correct?

A:  Well, they--Yes.

Q:  And you understood. sir the seriousness  of the conversation or the
statement that you were going to have with the detectives. Right?

A:  For the most part.

Q:   And in fact before they started,  they read you your constitutional rights.
Is that true?

A:  The second time. They had read me the rights at --at Rockingham.

Q:   Okay. When did they first read you your rights at Rockingham?

A:  Whenever Vannatter or somebody came up.

Q:  Was it Vannatter that read you your rights at Rockingham.

A:  I believe so, but--

Q:  Were you still--

A:  --I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.

Q:  I'm sorry. Did you complete your answer?

A:  I'm not a hundred percent sure of that, but l believe it was Vannatter,
yes.

Q:  And did--were you still handcuffed at the time that they read you your
rights?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you understood those rights. Correct, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You understood the implication of Detective Vannatter reading you those
rights, didn't you?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, what do you mean by "the implication"? I
don't understand "the implication."

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Well, that anything that you said to Detective Vannatter or Lange or
anyone else could be used against you. You understood that. Right?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And then when you got down to the  Los Angeles Police Department,
they read you your  constitutional rights again. Is that true?

A:  Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.

Q:  Okay. And you didn't have any questions with respect to what it meant
when they read those rights to you. Right?

A:  Well, at one point they started reading the rights, and I said something to
them, and they stopped the tape and then they started over again. They
explained something to me, and then they started over again.

Q:  Well, on the tape.that we have a transcript of, you were read your
constitutional rights. Is that true?

A:  On that tape? Yeah, the second time they started it, yes.

Q:  Okay. And at the end of reading you your rights, they asked you whether
you understood those rights. Correct?

A:  Right.

Q:  And you indicated to them that you did understand those rights. Is that
true?

A:  Correct.

Q:   And you were being honest with them when you told them that. Is that
true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And in fact you understood, Mr. Simpson, that anything you said during
the course of that statement could and would be used against you if you were
tried in this case. You understood that.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you understood that it was very important, in connection with
giving the statement, to be honest and truthful about the questions and
answers that you gave. Is that correct?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And you also understood that it was important to be accurate about the
information that you provided to these detectives during the course of their
examination. Is that true?

A:  Yeah, we talked about that, and I said,  "I'll be as accurate as I can." I
was a little tired at the time.

Q:  Okay. But you understood in your mind that it was important to be
accurate. Right?

A:  Well, I told them I would be as accurate as I could.

Q:  Okay. And they had asked you questions, as you testified earlier, off the
tape and then on the tape, and then I think they turned it off again. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

0: It didn't matter to you whether it was being tape-recorded or it wasn't
being tape-recorded; you were going to be honest in your answers. Is that
true?

A:  I wanted to be honest and as accurate as I could be, and it didn't matter to
me if it was taped or not.

Q:  Irrespective of whether that tape was running, you were going to be as
accurate as possible?

A:  As I could be. I was tired, and I was a bit concerned that both sides had
at the time, and, yes, I was going to be as accurate as I could be.

Q:  Well, did you ever tell the detectives that you were concerned about your
ability to provide an accurate statement because you were tired?

A:  They said it to me, and I said I'll try the best I could, because they were
very -- they really wanted to talk and I really wanted to get out of there -- and
as I said before, that's why they stopped the tape the first time and Vannatter
said, Hey, OJ., we're just trying to get you to go home, so, you know, do
the best you can." I said, I'll do the best I can. So -- but, you know, they
stopped it because they said something about having a lawyer present.

Q:  Was there anything that you were aware of at the time that you provided
the statement which caused you to have an inability to recollect significant
events from the night before?

A:  I was tired, so--and I was in, I gather, shock, but I thought I'd do the
best job I can do, and that's what I attempted to do, yes.

Q:  You weren't on any medication, were you?

A:  Other than maybe some Motrin, but other than that--

Q:  Does that affect your memory?

A:  I doubt it.

Q:  Does it effect your ability to recall events from the preceding 24 hours?

A:  Certainly no more so than not sleeping and being tired and other
circumstances.

Q:  It doesn't affect your ability to provide honest and truthful information,
does it?

A:  Not Motrin, I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. So other than the fact you were tired and perhaps somewhat in
shock from losing your ex-wife, you can't think of any other reasons why
you wouldn't be able to recall significant details from the preceding 24 hours.
Is that a fair statement?

A:  I think that's a tough question to answer because I would have no idea
what's significant.

Q:  How about your whereabouts at the time of the murders?

A:  I didn't know what time the murders were.

Q:  You had no information about that. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  So you didn't know whether those murders occurred at 8:00 o'clock,
9:00 o'clock, l0:00 o'clock, 11:00 o'clock, 12:00 o'clock. You had no idea.

A:  Well, I knew they couldn't have occurred a little before 9:00 o'clock, so
I knew it couldn't have occurred before then.

Q:  Okay. So you knew that the murders had to occur at least after 9:00
o'clock. Is that true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  When you spoke with Sydney. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And did you know whether there was -- they occurred before 12:00?

A:  As I told you, I had no idea.

Q:  Okay. So as far as you knew, you could have been at Rockingham, in
the limousine on the way to the airport, in the air on the way to Chicago or in
fact in Chicago at the time of the murders based upon what you knew at the
time you gave this statement. Is that a fair statement?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. And also when you gave this statement, Mr. Simpson, you had no
information that blood from the murder was left at the Bundy crime scene.
True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you had no information, Mr. Simpson, with respect to how Nicole
and Mr. Goldman were in fact murdered when you gave this statement to the
police. Is that true?

A:  That is correct, yes.

Q:  The only information that you had relative to any evidence was a
statement from either Detective Phillips or some other detective that blood had
been found at Rockingham. True?

A:  Found there, found here, yes.

Q:  What do you mean, found here"?

A:  Rockingham.

Q:  At Rockingham?

A:  Yes. He says, you know, There's blood there. There's blood here. We
got a problem, was the way he worded it. "Well, we got sort of a problem,"
was the way he worded it.

Q:  Prior to actually sitting down and talking with Detectives Vannatter and
Lange, did you ever draw any association in your mind between the blood
that was reportedly found at Rockingham and the  blood that you had noticed
on your pinkie the preceding evening?

A:  No.

Q:  Not once did you think about that?

A:  No, not at that time. no.

Q:  Okay. Now, Mr. Simpson, one of the areas that you were questioned
about during the course of this talk or statement that you gave to the police
was a cut that was on your left joint of your middle finger. Is that correct?

A:  During the course of the whole interview?

Q:  Yeah.

A:  Yes. Yes.

Q:  And the reason why that topic came up was because Detective Vannatter
or Lange or both had observed that you had a cut on the left joint, the joint of
your left middle finger. True?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you volunteer that information?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall the context in which the discussion came up?

A:  They asked me about a bandage I had.

Q:  On your middle finger?

A:  Well, it was on my--yeah, on my hand.

Q:  This is the cut that you claim you did -- you had in Chicago. Right?

A:   Correct.

Q:  Okay. And they saw a bandage on your left middle finger at that time?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  They asked you about that bandage?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was this before or after they had told you that they found blood at
Rockingham?

A:  Well, as I said, I didn't know--I don't believe Vannatter or Lange ever
told me that.

Q:  That they found blood at Rockingham?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. You knew that they found blood at Rockingham because you were
told earlier by Detective Phillips or some other detective at the time that they
identified this bandage on your finger. Right?

A:  Well, the guy says--said that to me, yes.

Q:  Okay. When you say, the guy...said that to me," what do you mean by
that?

A:  The guy. It wasn't a girl. It was a guy.

Q:  "The guy...said are we talking about the blood that you were told about
or the bandage on your finger?

THE WITNESS: What was his question, please?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Let me just reask it. I want to make sure we're clear, on the same
wavelength. Someone identified or pointed out that you had a bandage on
your middle finger. Right?

A:  Someone asked me about it, yes.

Q:  Okay. And that was in the context of giving a statement to the police.
Right?

A:  Well, it was not in the--it's not in the thing, but, yes, it was in the
context of just talking to the police.

Q:  Okay. And you knew at the time that you were having this discussion
about a wound to your left middle finger that blood had been found at
Rockingham. You knew that?

A:  Yeah, the guy told me there was blood here and blood there.

Q:  Okay. And when you say "the guy told me," we are now talking about
Phillips--

A:  Yes.

Q:  -- or some other detective. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And at the time that they asked you about the cut on your finger, they had
asked you how you did it. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And I take it that you knew the implication of that question at the time
you were being asked about it?

A:  I wasn't thinking about implications. I was just trying to answer
their questions.

Q:  Okay. And the question about how you cut your finger was asked of you
in the context of discussing blood that was found at Rockingham,  wasn't it?

A:  I don't believe so. I think they just asked me a question, and I answered
it. I don't -- you know, if you let me read the thing, I can tell you if it was in
the context.

Q:  Okay. Why don't we go to your statement. Page 15--

MR. PETROCELLI: Is that the marked one?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  -- Okay?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Has it been marked?

MR. BREWER: It has not been marked

MR. KELLY: Do you have copies of it, Mike?

MR. BREWER: Well, mine's marked. Is yours unmarked Mr. Baker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes.

MR. BREWER: Okay. Maybe we can go off the record and make copies of
yours and--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure, of course.

MR. BREWER: All right. Let's go off the record.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 9:42.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 9:46.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, we made copies, and we are going to mark as next
in order 101, I believe, the statement that you gave to the police department,
and that statement is dated 6-13-94. The time of the   interview is noted to be
military time 1335 hours.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit l01 was marked for identification by the reporter and is
attached hereto.)

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  When is the last time you reviewed this statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And other than your discussions with counsel, you
can certainly answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  I don't want to know when you talked about it with your lawyers. I want
to know when is the last time you reviewed the statement.

A:  Make two weeks ago.

Q:  Did you take a look at it over the weekend?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you glance through it over the weekend at all?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you have a copy, your own personal copy of the statement?

A:  If I do, I don't know where it is.

Q:  Now, we're talking about the question that you were asked relative to the
cut on your hand, your finger, during the course of this statement. And by the
way, Mr. Simpson, when you were giving this statement to the Los Angeles
Police Department, you understood or believed that you were the number one
target in connection with this murder investigation. Isn't that true?

A:  I don't think I had those kind of thoughts at the time, no.

Q:  Okay. Let's turn to page 31 on your statement, Mr. Simpson. Look on
lines 15 through 18. Reading from line 15, You understand the reason we're
talking to you because you're the ex-husband." Suspect: I know, I'm
the...number one target." Did you say that, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Yes. I always figured that husbands or ex-husbands are, but I didn't
have that thought process going at this time when they were interviewing me
earlier until he told me why he was talking to me.

Q:  When you told the detectives during the course of an interview in
connection with these two murder investigations that you were the number
one target, were you accurately reporting your state of    mind?

A:  I don't think so. I think just from reading books and everything, a
husband is somebody who's always a target. I didn't know if they had
someone else they were talking to. I didn't know if I was the number one
target in this case. I just know in all cases normally that is the case, that they
talk to the husbands or boyfriends.

Q:  Okay. So just from your life experience, you know that in cases where
there is a wife or ex-wife killed, that the ex-husband is always a target of a
murder investigation. Is that true?

A:  A target, yes. Yes.

Q:  Okay. And you were Nicole's ex-husband. Right?

A:  Yeah. But I didn't know if they had someone else that they were talking
to or not.

Q:  Well irrespective of whether they had other people they were talking to,
based upon what you just told us, you understood that you were a target in
connection with this murder investigation?

A:  At the time I just knew they had to talk to me.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Yeah.

Q:  In addition to wanting to talk to you, you knew that there was blood that
they found in Rockingham?

A:  By this time, yes.

Q:  Okay. Now going to page l5, Mr. Simpson, starting at Line 8, they
asked you, Okay. How did you get the injury on your hand?" Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, that's the injury to your left middle finger at the joint. Is that
true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And then you go on to describe what you did in Chicago.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And moving down to line 17 -- actually 16, they say, "Is that how you
cut it?" And you answer, "Mmnh, it was cut before, but I think I just opened
it up again. Do you see that statement, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Did I read that correctly?

A:  You didn't read all of it, but what you read was correct.

Q:  Let me read all of it so we're clear: I don't--I'm not sure. I'm not sure, I
didn't feel it. Did I read all of it?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And, Mr. Simpson, during the course of talking to these detectives in
connection with this murder investigation where you were asked about the
origin of a cut to your left finger, you told them that it was cut before. True?

A:  I told them I wasn't sure, and that's what I believe that this statement
said. I saw some blood the night before, and since I didn't feel anything or
see where it was coming from, I gather the next day when they started asking
me questions I assumed it may have been from the same place, but I didn't
see a cut or I didn't see where the blood was coming from, but I assumed I
was cut.

Q:  Okay. Well you've testified already that the blood that you saw was on
your pinkie. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You didn't even see a cut on your pinkie. Correct?

A:  I didn't see a cut anywhere.

Q:  And that was the night before you didn't see a cut anywhere?

A:  Correct.

Q:  You didn't see any blood from your left middle finger, did you?

A:  No. I just saw blood on the counter.

Q:  And you didn't see blood anywhere near your left middle finger.
True?

A:  Well, that's relatively near. I guess if it's on your pinkie, so that near
your middle finger, yes.

Q:  Okay. And that's the closest that you observed blood on your hand, was
on your pinkie, relative to your left middle finger. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. And when you told the police that you cut it before, were you
guessing?

A:  No--yes, exactly. That's exactly what I was doing.

Q:  So in the context of talking about the origin of this cut during this murder
investigation, you started guessing about the origin?

A:  No. I told them I cut it in Chicago but it may have been cut the night
before because I saw blood, and there was no other cuts on my hand at the
time, so I assumed that it may have come from the same area.

Q:  Mr. Simpson, did you cut your finger on June l2, l994, the left middle
finger at the joint?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  When you say, "Not that I know of," are you still uncertain as you sit
here today whether you cut the left middle finger at the joint area on June 12,
1994?

A:  It's not that I know of.

Q:  When you say, "not that I know of, are you able to definitively rule it out
one way or the other?

A:  I didn't see any cuts, but I saw blood, a drop of blood on my counter
and a drop of blood on one of my fingers. I didn't know where it came from.
So not that I know of.

Q:  When you were talking with these detectives, did you assume that the cut
that you had received--Strike that. When you were talking with these
detectives in connection with this murder investigation, did you assume that
the blood that you observed on your pinkie was also blood that you had
dripped all over the driveway at Rockingham?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Wait a minute. Don't answer that question.
Dripped all over the driveway? No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Dripped on the driveway.

A:  I didn't--You know, it was hard to assume anything. I didn't--I don't
think l was assuming anything. They were asking questions. Some questions
I had no answers and I didn't know the answers to, so--and I was just trying
to answer them as best I could under the circumstances.

Q:  Okay. And you knew at the time that you were being asked these
questions, it was in connection with a murder investigation. Right?

A:  Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You asked that 15 times.

MR. BREWER: 14.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. I agree: 14.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Now, Mr. Simpson, going on, you talk about on line 24--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Same page?

MR. BREWER: Same page.

Q:  -- I recall bleeding at my house." This is when they have asked -- Let me
read 22 so we have a context: That's okay. Do you--do you recall bleeding at
all.. .in your truck, in the Bronco? And your answer: I recall bleeding at my
house, and then...I went to the Bronco. The last thing I did before I left,
when I was rushing, I went and got my phone out of the Bronco." And they,
mmnh-mmnh, which is the detectives. Subject: Well, whatever that is,
reading through line 28. Now, the recollection that you identify on line 24,
recalling that you bled at your house. is that what you've already described to
us: The blood on the pinkie and the blood drop on the counter top?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. When you were talking with the detectives, did you then recall
bleeding on your driveway?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you recall bleeding in the foyer?

A:  No.

Q:  By the way, Mr. Simpson. the areas -- you know where they found
blood--as you sit here today. You know where the found blood on your
property. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  All of the areas where they found blood were areas that you were in on
June 12, 1994, that you had walked past or walked over. Is that true?

A:  At some time or another, yes.

Q:  And, for example, you had walked up the driveway that evening. Is that
true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And you had walked in the foyer. Is that true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And they found blood in the foyer. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And they found blood in the front entrance area right before the foyer --is
that true?--where the benches are?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  And they found blood on the driveway near the Bentley.True?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And they found blood at the entrance gate On Rockingham. Isn't that
true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Those were all areas where you were. Right?

A:  I went all over the place . I was upstairs; I was downstairs; I was in my
living room; I was in my washroom. I was all over my house.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Well, they didn't find blood. for example, out on the tennis court. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And you weren't out at the tennis court, anyway, that evening, were
you?

A:  No.

Q:  They didn't find blood out near the Ashford gate, did they?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Now, you also mentioned, Mr. Simpson,  that you were getting your
phone out of your Bronco. Do you see that on line 26?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Now, you testified that you weren't in fact getting your phone: you were
getting a case for your phone. Is that true?

A:  The case for my phone, the rest of my phone stuff, yes.

Q:  Excuse me?

A:  Yes, the case and the rest of the stuff that goes with my cell phone.

Q:  Okay. But when you used the term "phone, you already had your phone
with you, didn't you?

A:  Yes. I believe it was already in my bag.

Q:  Okay. So what you were telling the police was inaccurate. You didn't get
your phone out of there; you were getting your phone case out of there?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And when you went to the Bronco to get your phone case out of the
Bronco before you were leaving, did you to your knowledge touch any of the
foot pedals in the car, either the accelerator or the brake?

A:  No

Q:  Did you touch the inside of the driver's-side door?

A:  Possibly.

Q:  Okay. And do you recall the nature of touching the door, what happened
that would cause you to come in contact with the door?

A:  Just opening a door and getting in the car normally, and you kinda use
your hands, the steering wheel and the door thing.

Q:  Do you recall getting inside the car?

A:  Yeah, I leaned in. I had to lean in and ended up getting it, and I ended up
getting a jacket.

Q:  Did you physically get inside the car?

A:  I'm sure my body had to be inside the car to an extent, yes.

Q:  Okay. Well, did you get into the car and sit in the driver's seat?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. When you're talking about getting in the car, you are talking about
leaning across the console to the passenger-side seat and grabbing your phone
case?

A:  That's right.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall coming into contact with the dashboard?

A:  I don't recall any of that, no.

Q:  Do you recall coming into contact with the console?

A:  Recall, no, I don't recall that.

Q:  Do you recall coming in contact with the passenger-side seat?

A:  I'm sure I must have, but I don't recall it, no.

Q:  Did you rest your hand on the seat, your left hand, at all in order to get
the travel case for your phone?

A:  I may have.

Q:  Where was the windbreaker located inside the car?

A:  In the back seat.

Q:  Okay. Did you have to climb into the back seat to get the windbreaker?

A:  No. I just kind of leaned--I don't know exactly how I did it. It was just
on the back seat behind the driver (Indicating).

Q:  Okay. You are making a motion with your right hand. Do you recall
reaching into the back seat with your right hand?

A:  No, but I'm right-handed. so I would think I may have done that.

Q:  Okay. That would be a logical and customary way for you to grab
something if you were reaching for it in your back seat?

A:  Yeah. My glass I keep here (Indicating). It would be logical, but not
necessarily. You know, I grab things with my left hand also.

Q:  Sure.

A:  But, yeah, I'm thinking in most cases, yes.

Q:  How about opening up the Bronco door? Would you typically
grab the door handle with your left hand if you were going to insert a key
with your right?

A:  If it was locked, probably, yes.

Q:  And that would be the normal and customary way in which you would
open the door?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Okay. And the door handle on the Bronco, is it a door handle that you
have to reach under with the top side of your hand facing the door and lift up
the latch to open the door?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  You don't recall the mechanism that's on the door in order to open the
door?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Going to page 31 of your statement, Mr. Simpson, going to line 17 and
18 where you make the statement, 'I know I'm the...number one target. And
now you're telling me I got blood all over the place." Do you see that?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Yes?

A:  Yes

Q:  Okay. And, Mr. Simpson, you were responding to information that was
provided to you by these detectives that reaffirmed what you already had been
told: That there was blood that was found at Rockingham. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And at that point did you begin to draw an association between the blood
on your pinkie and possibly blood that was found at Rockingham that these
detectives were telling you about?

A:  The blood on my pinkie and the blood found at Rockingham, I don't
think that that's what I was thinking at the time. I understood at that time why
they were talking to me more so than I probably had earlier.

Q:  Well going down to line 27 and 28, it says--they ask you, Is that your
blood that's dripped there?" They just flat-out ask you whether that's your
blood, don't they? Right?

A:  Well, you just read the question.

Q:  Did I read it correctly?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that how you interpreted the question?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Is how?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  They were asking you whether that was your blood. Right?

A:  Is that your blood that's dripped there?"

Q:  Okay.

A:  That's the way it sounds to me.

Q:  And then you tell them on line 28, If -- if it's dripped it's what I dripped
running around trying to leave. Right?

A:  Yes. If it's mine, that's what it would have been.

Q:  Okay.

A:  As far as I knew.

Q:  Well, then you drew an association between the cut that you saw, the
blood you saw the previous evening and the blood that they were reporting to
you that they found on Rockingham. Is that right?

A:  Well, I knew I saw a drip of blood that I assumed came from me, and if
this was my blood, I would have -- probably was making an assumption that
that's what it would have come from.

Q:  Okay.

A:  But I wasn't--obviously I didn't know, but it was just an assumption on
my part.

Q:  You were making what you believed was a logical assumption, that, you
know, within 24 hours, you were in the kitchen and observed blood on the
counter top and blood on your pinkie, and then you're   being told by these
detectives that there was blood found on your driveway.

A:  Yeah. I don't know how logical it was. It just--if that was the case, that
was the case, because I didn't see any blood anywhere else, and I certainly
had luggage and stuff that I was handling quite freely during that period of
time.

Q:  Well, you didn't think it was Kato's blood. did you?

A:  I didn't know.

Q:  Well, you didn't even suggest to them it was Kato's blood. Right?

A:  They wasn't asking me about Kato.

Q:  Okay. And if you thought it was Kato's blood, would that have been
something you would have suggested to them?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. That calls for pure speculation.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Did you have any basis to believe that it was Kato's blood?

A:  I didn't have any basis to believe it was mine or anybody's blood, for
that the matter. I didn't know. I was just trying to answer their questions
when they asked me questions and be as helpful as I could under the
circumstances.

Q:  So when you acknowledged to them that "if it's dripped it's what I
dripped running around trying to leave," that you had no basis in your mind
to tell them that statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's argumentative. Don't answer that.

MR. BREWER: Well, he just said he had no basis to believe It was his
blood.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, that's your interpretation of what he said.
That isn't what I think what he said and that question is argumentative, and
he is not going to answer that one.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well Mr. Simpson, did you have a basis to believe it was Arnelle's
blood?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have a basis to believe it was anyone else's blood other than
yours?

A:  I didn't have a basis really to believe it was mine.

Q:  Okay. So you're telling us now that you didn't have a basis to believe it
was your blood?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. So when you told the investigating  officer that "if it's dripped it's
what I dripped running around trying to leave, n your testimony today is that
in your mind you had no basis--no factual   basis to provide that statement. Is
that what you're saying?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  At no time did you ever draw an association between the blood on your
pinkie and blood that was found at Rockingham the following day?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You already asked him that. He's already told you
he had an association, and that was--

MR. BREWER: Mr. Baker, he has not said that. He had said he has no
factual basis to provide the statement. That's why I'm going into it. He said it
twice.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. Well, that's your interpretation. But he said
when you read it to him and you talked about the pinkie. You've already been
over that.

MR. BREWER: He has said he has no factual basis. That's all I want to find
out.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's right: He doesn't have any factual basis.
They didn't tell him anything.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, you knew that you cut your finger. You're the only one who knew
that the night before. Right, Mr. Simpson?

A:  I assumed I did.

Q:  Okay. As far as you knew, Kato didn't know that you cut your finger.
Right?

A:  I didn't know what any of these people knew. I didn't have any
knowledge of any of it. I just--I assumed I cut my finger because I saw a spot
of blood, period. Outside of that, I didn't know anything.

Q:  Okay. And my question to you is: Given the fact that on the 12th you
observed blood on your finger, did you use that as a factual basis to tell the
police officers that "if it's dripped it's what I dripped running around?

A:  Not really. I just didn't know what. They were saying that there were
blood in places,and I thought I could have possibly had done it, but I didn't
know because other than that one drop of blood and what was on my finger, I
didn't see anything. You know, I didn't see anything. And at that time I
didn't make--I wasn't making any assumptions one way or another. I was
just trying to be as honest as I could with the police officers.

Q:  Were you being honest with them when you told them that if it's your
blood, it was the blood you dripped running around?

A:  It could have been. It could have been, yes.

Q:  When you say you "didn't see anything, are you talking about you didn't
see anything on the driveway?

A:  I didn't see anything other than a drip of blood on the--on a counter and
on my finger. I didn't see any blood anywhere at any time that evening.

Q:  Okay. And when you say that you didn't see anything," the blood on the
driveway--you didn't see blood on the driveway at all that evening. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  Nor in the foyer. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  As you sit here today Mr. Simpson, do you believe you reopened a cut
on the left middle finger?

A:  I have no idea what happened.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What do you mean? While he was in the police
station? Do you mean--

MR. BREWER: Let me clean up the question.

Q:  Mr. Simpson, as you sit here today, do you believe that when you cut
your finger in Chicago, you reopened a cut that already existed on your left
middle finger at the joint?

A:  I don't really have any belief on that. I just know that I never saw a cut
on my hand.

Q:  Did you ever get a tetanus shot?

A:  I'm sure I have.

Q:  On the week of the 13th?

A:  On what? Pardon me?

Q:  On the week of the 13th, did you ever go and get a tetanus shot?

A:  I may have, yes.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection of doing that?

A:  No.

Q:  When you say you may have, what is the basis for that statement?

A:  I believe Huizenga was doing some things, and I don't know exactly
what he did. You know, I was kind of in a little bit of space then. I saw a lot
of--seemed to me I saw a lot of doctors that was dicking around with me that
week. So I don't recall if anybody give me a shot or not.

Q:  So were you just guessing when you said that?

A:  I think I said I believe I did. I didn't think I did. I didn't know for sure. I
don't really know. I believe it might have happened that week.

Q:  When you say, "I believe that might have happened," do you have a
recollection of somebody putting a needle in your arm and injecting you with
what you believed to be a tetanus shot?

A:  I believe needles going into my arm --I have a recollection on that week
of numerous needles going into my arm, but I was sort of in space a lot that
week, so I don't recall exactly what they were doing.

Q:  Well, do you remember whether they were injecting you with something
or pulling something out of you; for example, blood?

A:  I knew they pulled some blood out. I don't even recall if Peratis gave me
a shot or not, other than I knew he went in a few times with needles, so--and
I don't--I really don't recall exactly what he did.

Q:  Do you recall asking anyone for a tetanus shot?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall anyone suggesting you should get a tetanus shot?

A:  I don't have any recollection of that, no.

Q:  You gave blood at the police station. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  How did they withdraw the blood from you?

A:  Stuck a needle in my arm. A few times. Because I think they screwed up
the first time he was doing it.

Q:  All right. Did they use a syringe to pull it out, or did they just use a vial?

A:  I don't know. One of those--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Syringe.

MR. BREWER: It's early.

THE WITNESS: I'm a little squeamish about that kind of stuff, so I never
looked.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  So you don't know how they pulled it out?

A:  No.

Q:  When you say they screwed--

A:  I just remember he screwed up and had to do it again.

Q:  Okay. When you say, "he screwed up," what do you mean?

A:  I don't know. He did it, and then he--I was talking to Vannatter, I
believe, whatever opposite side the guy was doing it on.Then he said he
screwed up, and he talked to Vannatter a little bit, and then he did it again, but
I wasn't looking.

Q:  Okay. Well, when you say, he did it again," do you recall where he
pulled blood or withdrew blood from you?

A:  lt. was one of my arms.I don't recall which one.

Q:  Okay. And then he made some comment to Vannatter that he screwed
up?

A:  Yeah, it was something--something--I don't know. Something was not
right. I wouldn't look, so I don't know exactly what it was. And Vannatter
was asking me questions, I believe, during this time.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection of him pulling--withdrawing blood
from you on this first occasion?

A:  I didn't look. So I knew he took the needle--he put the needle in did
something; then took the needle out. Then he put the needle in again, and I
remember I was complaining about having to do it again.

Q:  And do you recall at any point looking and observing that blood was
being withdrawn from your arm?

A:  I absolutely never do that. I'm a little squeamish about that.

Q:  Which arm was your--When you say you're "squeamish about that, just
the sight of blood or blood being pulled from your arm?

A:  Yeah. Not necessarily the sight of blood, but to an extent, yes, I'm a
little squeamish about blood. But, hey, I played football, so you see it.

Q:  Okay. I just want to make sure I understand what you--when you say
you're squeamish, you're squeamish about the sight of blood?

A:  To an extent, yes.

Q:  What happens when you see blood?

A:  Well, I don't know. I just--I don't -- I never look when they take blood
out of my arm, and there are some other things women will tell you about me.

Q:  Well, I don t know what that means. I'm asking you.

A:  Well, you'll have to ask them. I'm sorry.

Q:  We may ask them. I'm asking you right now.

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. So, for example, when you see blood on your finger, do you
become squeamish?

A:  Not really.

Q:  Okay. But when you see that you have a cut that's bleeding, does that
cause you to become squeamish?

A:  I've had some yes, that I've been squeamish about, yes.

Q:  Okay. Because just the very presence of blood causes you some
discomfort?

A:  I don't know if the presence. The presence of blood coming from me or
on me is a little discomforting, yes. And needles, I hate.

Q:  Okay. So when you say it's uncom--it's something that's significant to
you?

A:  Let me put it this way: I have never, ever in my whole life watched
anybody take blood out of my body, and I've had it done many times. So
whatever that is, I'm squeamish about that.

Q:  Okay. How about just blood being on your body? Does that bother you?

A:  I mean, bother me?

Q:  Yes.

A:  I don't like it, but I've lived a whole career with blood on my body, yes.

Q:  Okay. When I say, "does it bother you," you used the term "squeamish.
Do you become squeamish when you see blood actually on your body?

A:  I have, yes.

Q:  And does that cause you to do anything in particular: Clean it up quickly,
you know, dress it. Or do anything of that nature?

A:  Normally, yes.

Q:  Okay. So the way in which you respond to blood on your body is to
dress it and clean it as quickly as possible because you're squeamish?

A:  No. Not to look at it, basically, or if it's a trainer around, have the trainer
do it and not look at it--not view it. I just don't like looking at blood. If it's
coming from me, I don't like looking at it.

Q:  Okay. Well, you haven't had a trainer around for years. Right, Mr.
Simpson?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  So if you are at home and you see blood on your person, is there
anything you do because of the fact that you are squeamish when you look at
blood?

A:  I think I do the same thing you do: Clean it up.

Q:  Okay. Put a Band-Aid on it?

A:  If it needs--if it requires a Band-Aid.

Q:  When you say that you do--you do the same thing I do, are you
assuming that there is some reasonable response that typically people have
when they're cut or wounded--

A:  Yes.

Q:  --in dressing that wound?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you would fall in line with what reasonable people would ordinarily
do, as far as you know, in terms of addressing a wound?

A:  To an extent, yes.

Q:  At any time during the course of giving a statement to Detectives
Vannatter and Lange, did you ever knowingly tell them anything that was
false?

A:  Knowingly? No, I was -- they knew and I knew, because we stopped
once or twice and they asked me if I was tired and could I go on, that I was
tired. So I knew at certain points I was tired and maybe not as sharp as I--as
they would want me to be or if--I would have wanted to be.

Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, that's not my question. At any time during the
course of providing information to Detectives Vannatter and Lange, did you
ever knowingly provide them any information that's false?

A:  Knowingly, no.

Q:  How about unknowingly?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, don't answer that. I don't know how you
could unknowingly provide information that was false.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well by-- have you ever gone back and seen information in there that you
now believe to be false?

A:  I saw some of it was confused, yes.

Q:  Okay. Well, we will talk about confused. Let's talk about false
information. Is there anything in there that you have observed since    giving
the statement that you believe to be false?

A:  Because of the confusion, it was inaccurate, is what I'll say.

Q:  Okay. And what do you recall as being inaccurate," using your term?

A:  For instance, I went out to the car to get the--all the stuff that goes with
my cell phone. I said a phone. At one point I was under the impression that I
went and got my daughter's flowers after the recital when it was obviously
during the recital, and I think I caught that one at the time.

Some of the things that happened right when I got back from the recital,
because they almost were duplicate to what I had done the night before, a few
of the things kinda ran together, and I may have said some things that weren't
accurate at that particular time, at 7:00--7:00 to 7:30.

Q:  Okay. And were you nervous during the course of giving this statement?

A:  I wasn't aware of it, no. I was--I think I was a little out of it. I had things
on my mind, obviously.

Q:  Okay.You don't remember being nervous as you sit here today?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember being anxious?

A:  Yeah, I'm sure I was a little anxious.

Q:  Okay. Because you were being questioned in connection with a murder
investigation?

A:  No. Because I wanted to get out of there and get to my family and find
out what had happened.

Q:  Do you recall any information that you provided in this statement being
inaccurate as it relates to Paula Barbieri?

A:  No. Well, yes, a little--somewhat, yes.

Q:  Okay. You indicated to the detectives during the course of providing this
statement that you called her as you were driving to her house. Do you recall
that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that was after the recital. Is that true, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Well, that was inaccurate, yes.

Q:  Well, the statement that you provided to the police officers was that you
called Miss Barbieri as you were driving to her house after the recital. Is that
true?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What page are we looking at?

MR. PETROCELLI: Are you looking at 9?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: 9, I think.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You want to take a minute to review it, Mr. Simpson?

A:  No, I don't need to.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes, you do.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do. Starting where?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You can review any part of it. Your lawyer wants you to review it, and
he'll tell you what he wants you to review.

A:  What do you want me to talk about?

Q:  I am going to ask you questions about Paula Barbieri and driving to her
house.

(Witness reviews document.)

A:  Okay.

Q:  Okay?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Now, Mr. Simpson, the first time that you ever provided any testimony
under oath relative to the events of June 12th, 1994 was during the course of
this deposition. Is that true?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Okay. And would it be fair to say, Mr. Simpson, that your memory
relative to the events of June 12th was better within 24 hours of those events,
of describing those events, than it was during 1996?

A:  I think to an extent that's incorrect.

Q:  Okay. You think your memory is better now, almost two years later,
than it was the following day in terms of describing the events of June 12th,
1994?

A:  I think my memory was better, after I got some sleep, even the next day
than it was when they were interviewing me.

Q:  Okay. So you had some problems with your memory during the course
of giving information to these detectives while they were interviewing you
regarding this murder investigation?

A:  As you can see here, what you told me to read, I was trying to--and I had
pointed out here, well, I'm trying to think. I did. I was even having problems
because I was tired. I was having problems recalling when I bought the
flowers for the recital, even though it became obvious that I had to have
bought those flowers during the recital, even though at the time they were
interviewing me, because of the state I was in, I was thinking that maybe I
bought the flowers after the recital, but I think we all know now those flowers
were bought during the recital. But I was tired; I believe I was in somewhat
shock, so things were running together, and I was having trouble putting all
of these things together.

Q:  You said, "As you can see here." Are you talking about kind of the
stammering way in which you provided the statement, at least between lines
15 and 20?

A:  Yes. It was, am I--I'm trying to think, did I leave? This is during the
recital, and we know I did leave, but at that time I was having trouble
recalling that, but if you read the statement, you can see that I was having
some problems at that time.

Q:  And you think it's obvious, just in looking at the statement, that you
were having problems recalling that specific information. Is that true?

A:  I think it's obvious in light of the fact we knew I bought flowers during
the recital and not after the recital.

Q:  And the reason -- your reason that you've given us today is because you
were tired.

A:  Well, I was in shock. My wife -- my ex-wife had been murdered; my
kids were wherever they were; last time I spoke to my daughter, she was in a
bad way, and I hadn't slept.

Q:  It wasn't because you were making this up as you were going along,
was it, Mr. Simpson?

A:  No, that's incorrect.

Q:  Now, the first call you made to Paula Barbieri after the recital, just
answering that question, was at 10:03. Is that true?

A:  I don't believe so. I believe I tried her once I got home from the recital.

Q:  The first call that you made on your cell phone after the recital was at
10:03. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And your testimony during this deposition was that you had begun
walking out to your car, and before you even reached your car you decided
that you were not going to drive down to Paula Barbieri's. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  When you say, lines 18, 19, 20, Then -- then I came home, and then I
called Paula as I was going to her house and Paula wasn't home," that's
inaccurate?

A:  Well, it depends how you interpret it. At the time I was running two days
together, but I did call her as I was going to her house. I tried her on my
phone at home. I gather there was -- her machine     was on. And at that point
if she wasn't home, I didn't -- I couldn't--I didn't know where to go find
Paula. I've never found Paula anywhere except at her house, so I decided not
to go.

Q:  Well if taken literally and you called her after the recital on your cell
phone as you were going to her house, that would have been at 10:03. True?

A:  No, that's inaccurate.

Q:  Well the first call you made to her on your cell phone after the recital was
at 10:03. Is that true?

A:  Well, as I told you, I was putting a few things together, a few nights
were running together, Saturday night, Sunday night was running together,
and if you look at my cell phone records, you will see at roughly this time on
Saturday, as I was going to Paula's house, I called her.

Q:  Okay.

A:  So there were -- I hadn't slept, and last night was whatever night it was
to me, and the nights were running together to me at this time.

Q:  Okay. So as you were providing this information to the detectives in
connection with this murder investigation, did you begin to think that all the
information was running together and it may be inaccurate?

A:  No. I was very tired, and they were concerned about me being
tired because they mentioned it a few times to me.

Q:  Did you ever tell them that you want to stop the statement because --

A:  No. I said I wanted to get out of there.

Q:  Excuse me. Did you ever tell them that you wanted to stop giving this
statement in connection with the murder investigation because you were so
tired that you thought you were beginning to provide    inaccurate
information?

A:  No.

Q:  In fact you answered all the questions that they asked you, didn't you?

A:  As best as I could. yes.

Q:  And you never once asked them to stop to rest or ever indicate to them
that you were tired. Is that true, sir?

A:  I think the way I was answering questions indicated to them, because at
one point they asked me could I go on, and I said, "Yes, let's just get this
over with."

Q:  At any time after you got home from the recital, did you ever get into
your Bronco and drive towards the house of Paula Barbieri?

A:  No.

Q:  By the way, Mr. Simpson, at the time that you were giving this
statement, you didn't have your cell phone records in front of you, did you?

A:  No.

Q:  You hadn't reviewed your cell phone records, had you, sir?

A:  No.

Q:  You hadn't reviewed any of your phone records. Is that true, Mr.
Simpson?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And you didn't know -- Strike that. Did you pay your cell phone records
yourself, or did Cathy Randa pay those?

A:  I'm sure not Cathy, but my office paid.

Q:  Okay. So in other words, on your phone bills for your cellular phone,
they go to your office, and then they're paid by your office staff or
administrator?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Now, I take it, Mr. Simpson, that when you reviewed this statement for
the first time, you had had an opportunity to rest.

A:  Yes.

Q:  After it was transcribed. Is that correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you were of -- your state of mind was a little bit clearer when you
had a chance to review the actual transcript of what you said.

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And I take it that you reviewed this statement very carefully at that time?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Well, you had given a statement to the police in connection with a murder
investigation, and this was your first opportunity to look at what you said.
Right?

A:  Yes. I was in jail at the time, and I was still a little spacy.

Q:  Were you spacy because you were still tired?

A:  No. Because they had me on drugs, and the whole experience
was --I hadn't really been able to deal with it yet.

Q:  Okay. Well, you've read the statement that you gave to the Los Angeles
Police Department detectives on a number of different occasions, haven't
you?

A:  A few times, yes.

Q:  Okay. And at any time after you reviewed the statement, did you ever
contact the Los Angeles Police Department either directly or through any agent
and indicate to them that any of the information in this statement was
inaccurate?

A:  We had hoped it would come out in court, but the LAPD didn't want it in
court, so--

Q:  That's not my question, Mr. Simpson.

A:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Q:  Did you or anyone under your direction ever contact the Los Angeles
Police Department and indicate to them that this statement was inaccurate?

A:  We assumed it would come out in court.

Q:  Well, I know you want to answer your--

A:  They didn't want it to come out in court, evidently.

Q:  See if you can answer my question.

A:  Okay.

Q:  Did you ever contact the Los Angeles Police Department or direct anyone
on your behalf to contact the Los Angeles Police Department to change the
statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that as it relates to any lawyers.

THE WITNESS: I can't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, did you ever personally contact the Los Angeles Police
Department?

A:  From jail, no.

Q:  Okay. Did you ever ask anyone who was a non-lawyer to contact  the
police department on your behalf?

A:  A non-lawyer?

Q:  Yes.

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever file a supplemental report or ask to have filed a
supplemental report with the Los Angeles Police Department?

A:  I didn't ask anything, no.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You want to take a break?

MR. BREWER: Yeah.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:27.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:55.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, you have the statement in front of you. I want you
to go to page 12, and specifically lines 25 and 28. We are going to go through
that, and page 13, lines through 18, but let's just go through it piece by piece.

A:  Say that again. I'm sorry.

Q:  So I am just letting you know I am going to go through page 12 and 13,
but 12 starting at lines 25 through 28. Okay? And this is in reference to Paula,
and the questions you were asked at the time you gave this statement in
connection with this murder investigation was: What time was the recital?
Your answer: Over at about 6:30. Like I said, I came home, I got in my car, I
was going to see my girlfriend, I was calling her and she wasn't around."

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did I read that correctly, sir?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And at the time that you gave that statement, was that accurate?

A:  No.

Q:  At any time on the 12th did you ever get in your car to go to Paula
Barbieri's?

A:  No.

Q:   And did you ever call her to say you were going to her house?

A:  No.

Q:  And--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Again, on the 12th you're talking about.

THE WITNESS: On the 12th.

MR. BREWER: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: On the 12th, not the 11th.

MR. BREWER: Yeah. Thank you.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You just didn't put a date on it. I'm sorry.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Now, is this inaccurate because you were running the 11th and the 12th
together in your mind?

A:  Partially, yes.

Q:  Turn the page, and it says, page 13 at the top: "So you drove the--"
You say Bronco. You got home in the Rolls in the Rolls --" Subject: ''Yeah."
Question: --and then you got in the Bronco? Subject: Bronco 'cause my phone
was in the Bronco."  Did I read that correctly?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Now, on the 11th when you saw Miss Barbieri, you went out to a
function with her for  the Prime Minister of Israel. Is that correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And you took the Bentley on that occasion. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   At any time on the 11th did you ever drive the Bronco down to Paula
Barbieri's?

A:  I may have.

Q:   Well did you?

A:  I don't recall, but I may have.

Q:   But you specifically recall driving the Bentley down there. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Because you picked her up. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you went to a function that evening. Correct?

A:   That's correct.

Q:   And you dropped her off. Is that correct?

A:   That's correct.

Q:   In the statement that you're talking -- in which you're talking to the
detectives, you made specific reference to the Bronco. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  That you called her from the Bronco as  you were headed to her house.
Correct?

A:   That's correct. That's what I said here (Indicating), correct.

Q:  Now that--it's a statement that you made to the detectives in connection
with the murder  investigation that you now say is inaccurate.

A:  Yes.

Q:   You didn't make a trip at any time that  day to Paula's. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That day being the 12th?

MR.BREWER: You're right. The 12th.

THE WITNESS: I was going to go there on the 12th. I got probably
halfway and decided not to go.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. So the answer to my question is that you did not make a trip --
you didn't actually get in the car and drive to Paula's on the 12th. Is  that true?

A:  I got in the car with the intentions to drive to Paula on the 12th, and
about halfway there she hadn't answered, and I turned around and went
home--called Nicole, actually, and then tried her again and went home.

Q:  What time was this?

A:  Right after the golf match.

Q:  That you got into your car?

A:  Into my Bronco, yes.

Q:  And you drove to Paula's?

A:  I was driving to Paula's.

Q:  And you got about halfway there?

A:  I would say till about -- I believe it was Barrington where I turned.

Q:  Okay. And then so we are clear, this is on June 12th that you did this?

A:  Yes.Yes.

Q:  You have a specific memory of this on June 12th?

A:  Yes.

Q:   After playing golf?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Coming home?

A:   Pardon me?

Q:   Did you come home first?

A:  No.

Q:  So you went from the golf course to --

A:  I was driving down Sunset. I was going to Paula's and spend a few -- a
little time with her.

Q:  Okay. And you got to about Barrington?


A:  Yeah. I was having trouble getting through, and I got to about
Barrington, yes.

Q:  Okay. And then because you couldn't get through, you decided not to
continue your trip to her house?

A:  Sort of. I didn't turn right around. I  went down Barrington because if
Justin was home, I  would have -- Yeah, that's right. That's right.

Q:  Well, when you say that -- you just made a statement that "if Justin was
home." Did you then head by Nicole 's?

A:  I was heading towards Nicole's when I called Nicole's house.

Q:   Well, let's be clear on this,  Mr. Simpson. Were you heading to Paula's
when you  made this call, or were you heading to Nicole's when  you made
this call?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Which call are we talking  about?

MR.BREWER: The one to Paula.

MR.ROBERT BAKER: Oh, okay.

THE WITNESS: I made more than one call to Paula.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Well, you were headed to Paula's  and trying to call her. Is that
true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And this was right after you played golf?

A:   That's correct.

Q:   So you went directly from the golf course heading to Paula's--

A:   Going down Sunset, yes.

Q:  Going down Sunset, attempting to call her from your cellular phone.

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And during this same drive did you also attempt to call Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Was this before you had made a decision not to continue on to
Paula's?

A:   Well, I tried Paula again directly after.

Q:   After you had called Nicole?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Okay. And Paula wasn't home?

A:   Correct.

Q:   And was it at this point that you decided  not to go on to Paula's?

A:  Yes. I was on my way back home at that time, yes.

Q:  Well did you turn around and were you headed home when you made
this phone call to Paula  after you had spoken--after you had called Nicole?

A:  I didn't turn around, but I was going I believe west on San Vicente.

Q:  Would that have been in the direction of Paula's house?

A:   No. That would have been in the direction of home.

Q:  Okay. What I am trying to figure out here is: Are you calling Paula as
you're driving to her house and then at some point, because she is not there,
you decide to turn around and not go there? Is that what's going on?

A:   Essentially, yes.

Q:  And then when you turned around or decided not to go there, did you
then place another phone call to her home?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And she still wasn't home?

A:  Correct.

Q:   Okay. Were you leaving messages for her?

A:  Not the first time. I think I did the last time, told her I was off the golf
course, I believe, and I was heading to the house.

Q:  When you say, "Not the first time," what  are you referring to?

A:  The first time, when I heard her machine, I just hung up. and then I tried
Nicole.

Q:   Okay. The first time, was that after golf?

A:  Yes.

Q:  While you were in your car?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Driving to her house?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   Okay. The second time is when you left a message?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Okay. And it was at the second-- Strike that. The second phone call that
you made was after you had already decided not to continue on to her house.
Is that it?

A:  If she would have answered, I would have gone to her house, but she
didn't, so I continued home.

Q:  But you were heading west on San Vicente when you made the second
phone call. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  That was not going towards her house. Right?

A:  If she was home, I would have gone to her house, but she wasn't home.
so I continued to go home to my house.

Q:  Okay. But if she was home, would you have had to turn around?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Okay. And is it this conversation --  Strike that. Is it at this time that you
had a conversation with Nicole about tickets?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Was that an argument?

A:  No.

Q:  You  had stated during Mr. Petrocelli's  examination that the last time that
you had--you   were asked the last time you had an argument with Nicole. Do
you remember that testimony?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And you had mentioned in connection with that answer, although you
didn't finish the answer according to my recollection, you had mentioned
something about tickets. Do you remember that?

A:  Not with an argument, no, I wasn't. That's incorrect.

Q:  There was no argument in connection with  the tickets?

A:  None whatsoever.

Q:  It was just a matter-of-fact conversation you had with her?

A:  Yes. She was wondering about-- Yes.

Q:   And she was wondering about what? How many tickets you
needed?

A:  Yeah,  and Jason and Arnelle,  stuff like that.

Q:   What do you mean "stuff like that?"

A:  Well, Jason and Arnelle were going to attend, and, you know, who
could get there first.

Q:   Going to page 13 and now focusing on line 11, you make the statement
in response to the discussion of the Bronco, "You know, I drive -- rather
drive it than the [sic] other car." Do you see that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that statement made in reference to the Bronco?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. And is it--was it your preference to drive the Bronco versus the
Bentley?

A:  It was an easier car to drive, and I enjoyed driving it. Even though I
didn't drive it a lot other than going to golf, I liked driving it.

Q:  Okay. That was an accurate statement then in terms of your preference --

A:  Yes.

Q:  --as to which automobile you prefer driving?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Then going on with line 13, it says, "And   I-- you know, and, uh --
and, uh, as I was going over there I called her a couple times and she wasn't
there, and that she had left a message." Now, this is going back to page 12
where you're talking about going over there after the recital, and this never
happened, did it?

A:  Excuse me?

Q:   Well, there was never an occasion after the recital where you were going
over there, calling her a couple times. Isn't that true?

A:  This was during the day after the golf match, not after the recital that's
correct.

Q:  Well, let's read this, because I want to make sure that we have this in
context. Okay? We'll  just read this--

A  But this is not in context. As I was explaining to you before, these things
were running  together at the time because of whatever condition I was in,
trying to remember not only Saturday --  these--all of these things were
running together to me, and that's why it got a little confused.

Q:  Okay. So when you say, "these things were running together" with
Saturday, you're talking   about the statement where you were -- " as I was
going" -- and again, page 13, lines 13, 14, l 5, where you say, "as I was
going over there I called her a  couple times and she wasn't there, and that she
had left a message ' Are you running together the 11th and the 12th in
connection with--

A:  I think--

Q:  -- providing that information?

A:  Excuse me. I'm sorry. I think I'm running it all together, the 11 to 12,
that day, that night, it's all sort of running together to me at that time.

Q:   Okay. Let's just go back to page 12. If it's out of context, you let us
know how it's out of context.

A:  Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  That isn't a question. That's just a prelude to reading this. Okay?

On page 12, if you read along with me, Mr. Simpson, there is a question--

A:  From what line?

Q:  Starting on page 12, line 25.

A:  Okay.

Q:  The question you were asked is, "What  time was the recital?" And your
answer is: "Over at about 6:30. Like I said, I came home, I got in my car, I
was going to see my girlfriend, I was calling her and she wasn't around."

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  And we are now at page 13, top of the page, line 1, We will continue on:
"So you drove the--"

Your answer: 'Bronco."

The detectives: "You got home in the Rolls, in the Rolls--"

Subject--Suspect: "Yeah."

"-- and then you got in the Bronco?"

And your answer: "Bronco  'cause my phone was in the Bronco."

Detectives: "Okay."

Suspect: "And, uhm--and  'cause it's the Bronco, it's the Bronco is what I
drive."

Detectives: "Yeah."

Suspect: "You know, I  drive -- rather drive it than any  other car.

"And I -- you know, and, uh -- and, uh, as I was going over there I called
her a couple times and she wasn't there," she had -- and that she had left a
message. And then I checked my messages, she had left me a message that
she wasn't  there, that she had to leave town. And then I came back and, uh.
ended up sitting with Kato.'

Question: "Okay. And about what time was it [sic] again that  you parked the
Bronco?"

Suspect: "8:00  something, maybe."  Okay? Now, the statement that you
make at Lines  13 through 18 on page 13 is in reference to a  discussion
where you're describing what happened after the recital. True?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  And, Mr. Simpson, what you described to them with respect to what you
did after the recital  was that you were headed to Paula's house and you were
calling her. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And you also said that you had checked messages and that she left you a
message that she wasn't there. You said that, didn't you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Was that true?

A:  She had left a message on her message machine that she was not around,
or words to that effect. I can't tell you specifically what it was.

Q:  Okay. So there is a message that she had left on her message machine
indicating that she wasn't there and she had to leave town?

A:  I believe. It's just that she wasn't  around. She may have said that she
was out of town  for a few days. I just don't recall.

A:  Okay. Was that a standard--

A:  Pardon me?

MR. PETROCELLI:  Mike, your question said "her message machine." You
meant his.

MR. BREWER: No, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

Q:  Are you saying that on her message  m machine there was a message that
was particular to you  that she was out of town and wasn't there?

A:  No. I think it was to everyone.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Yeah.

Q:  So we're clear on this, you called Paula, and her message machine
would come on, her voice, presumably--

A:  Yeah.

Q:  -- indicating that she wasn't there and she had to leave town?

A:  Or words to that effect, yes.

Q:  And I take it that you heard that message the first time you called her on
the 12th?

A:   I may have, but sometimes she does it just to avoid people. Yeah, I may
have, yes.

Q:  Okay. Well, when you first called her on  the 12th, the first time after
golf, was that message on her machine?

A:  I believe so. I don't recall a change of message.

Q:   Did you not believe the message?

A:  I don't think I paid any attention to it.

Q:   Okay. So when her message indicated that she was out of town and
wasn't there, is that something that was inconsistent with her schedule or
habits?

A:  I'm sorry. You have to repeat that.

Q:  Well, you indicated in earlier testimony  that Paula was a busy person --

A:  Yes.

Q:  --she was working. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And it was not uncommon for her to go out of town. Isn't that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And the reason why she  would go out of town was because she would
be involved in various employment endeavors that necessitated her going out
of town. Is that true?

A:   Correct.

Q:  And so when you heard this message on the 12th that she was out of
town and wasn't there, that was consistent with her past practices with respect
to these employment endeavors. Isn't that true?

A:  Correct.

Q:   And is there any reason why you didn't believe that message at that
time?

A:  Well, I didn't know. As I said, she told me she might be leaving town.
Quite often she'll  leave messages that she's leaving town to avoid people,
and she's still in town. So I really didn't know one way or the other.

Q:  Did you have any reason to believe that with respect to this particular
message on the 12th,  that she was giving -- that she was leaving that message
because she wanted to avoid people?

A:  I didn't know.

Q:  Do you think she wanted to avoid you?

A:  That was a possibility.

Q:  And what was that based upon? What was that belief of yours, if any,
based upon?

A:  That I played golf that morning.

Q:  Okay. Did you have any discussion with her about your playing golf that
morning?

A:   No.

Q:  Did she ever say anything to you about your playing golf that morning?

A:  That morning?

Q:   Yeah.

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. In fact, the earlier evening you've already testified you had a
wonderful evening. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   There was no indication that she was angry or dissatisfied with you
when you left her on the 11th. True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And after you heard her message that she indicated that she was not there
and out of town, you called her again.True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you called her during the same drive after you played golf. Isn't that
true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And it was at that point that you left her a message. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And what was the message that you left?

A:  That I was back from golf and I'd be at the house.

Q:  That you would be at your house?

A:   Yeah.

Q:   Okay. And I assume that you expected  that if this was one of these
occasions where she was  leaving a message to avoid people and she got your
message, she would call you at your home. That was your hope. Right?

A:  If she wasn't avoiding me yes.

Q:   And you didn't--you've already testified you didn't check your cell
phone messages that day. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  If you received a message at your home on your answering machine,
would there be any record of that?

A:  I don't know. It depends where the message came from, I guess.

Q:  Well, for example, if you had a local call made to your residence where
someone left a message on your machine and you got that message, would
there be any record of any sort relative to that effect?

A:  I don't think so. I don't know.

Q:  And your belief that this statement that you made to the detectives in
connection with this murder investigation is inaccurate is based upon your
running together the 11th and the 12th?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: As well as he said--

THE WITNESS: Well, the whole day of the 12th, the 11th to 12th, and
everything that was going on, this -- yeah, a lot of this is just kind of ran
together, and at that point in time I was a little fuzzy about it all. I had other
things on my mind.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  In the following--same page on Line 23 through 26, you mention that
"wee had," referencing Kato, "We had went and got a burger." You see that?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Lines 24, 25, 26. You see that?

A:  Okay. I'm just trying to see it all leading up to it. "She wasn't''--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Read the whole lines starting at Line 23, OJ.

THE WITNESS: Pardon me? I'm just trying. . .

(Witness reviews document.) Yeah.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You see that?

A:  Lines 23?

Q:   Well, specifically the reference that you  and Kato "went and got a
burger." You see that?

A:  Yeah. Well, let me see it again.

Q:   You see  what I am looking at?

A:   I see 23 and 24, they're talking about  earlier than--we had taken an
early-- "relatively -- he hadn't taken a -- "he hadn't done a jacuzzi." He hasn't
gone. "We had went and got a  burger and I came home and kind of leisurely
got ready to go."

Q:  Okay. When you talk about ''he hadn't done a jacuzzi," who are you
talking about?

A:  Kato.

Q:   Okay. I take it that your state of mind was sufficient to recall that detail
to the investigators in connection with this murder investigation.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's a self-evident truth.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

MR. BREWER: Well, I want to make sure that it's inaccurate. Some things
are inaccurate. Let's find what is and what isn't.

Q:  I take it that you were able to recall that detail for them, Mr. Simpson?

A:  Well, I knew he took a jacuzzi. I may be a little confused here at what
time he took it, but  I'm--this here, it sounds like I got him--I don't know
what it is here.

Q:  Well, when you say that Kato -- your reference that Kato took the
jacuzzi, that was based upon your recollection of what Mr. Kaelin did on the
12th. True?

A:  What he asked me to do and that the jets were still on at some point.

Q:  Well, there was some circumstantial evidence, in your view, that he had
taken a jacuzzi then.

A:  I didn't see him in the jacuzi, no.

Q:  And you had in fact assumed that he had taken a jacuzzi. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And you told the detectives that. Right?

A:  Yes. I told them he took a jacuzzi, but I had assumed--I didn't tell them I
assumed he took jacuzzi. I told them he did, but assumed that,  yes.

Q:   Okay. So in your mind you had gone through a process where you had
taken what Mr. Kaelin had told you coupled with what you observed and
concluded that he took a jacuzzi, and that's what you related to the
investigators.

A:  I don't recall thinking about all of that at the time. I just recall telling them
he took a  jacuzzi.

Q:  Okay. And then you indicate we went and  got a burger. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that's accurate. Right?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Okay. I take it your state of mind was such that you were able to relate
to them that information.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then you indicate that you "kind of  leisurely got ready"-- Strike
that. You said, "...I come home and kind of leisurely got ready to go." You
see that statement?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that accurate?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Truthful?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You were able to relate that to them accurately then?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. I am going to jump back up and  just ask you a couple more
questions on this statement  you made relative to the messages. At line l5, 16
and 17 you state, in providing information to the detectives "And then l
checked my messages. . . "

A:  Yes.

Q:   You see that?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:   "...she had left me a message that she wasn't there, that she had to leave
town." Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  That doesn't say anything about a message on her machine. You're
talking about your machine, aren't you, sir?

A:  I'm talking about I got a message from her, but there was no message on
my machine.

Q:  Well, Mr. Simpson, what you were telling them in the English language
is you checked your messages, aren't you?

A:  Yeah. What I was trying to relate them was that I got the message she
was out of town,  even though I still wasn't quite sure if she had left town.
but she had not left me a message and I had not picked up a message and I
think your records will  show that.

Q:  Well, I don't care what our records will show. I'm trying to figure out
what you're telling--

A:  Obviously you don't.

Q:  When you say "I checked my messages" and  "she had left me a
message," what you were intending to tell them was that there was a message
on her machine telling you that she was out of town;  she wasn't there?

A:  I don't know if that was what I was meaning to tell them at the time. I
think I was just trying to tell them that I had gotten a message that she was out
of town.

Q:  Irrespective of whether it was on your machine or her machine.

A:  Well, I know it wasn't on my machine because she never called my
machine, and the machine she calls, as you know, I didn't pick up any
messages. So, yes, I had gotten a message she was out of town, even though
I got to admit I still didn't totally believe it.

Q:  Was this information based upon your memory at the time that she would
check your messages and that she had left you a message? Was that your
recollection at the time?

A:  At the time it was just based on trying to give information that -- what I
thought I knew at the time. I was trying to let them know what I felt I knew at
the time, and I was inaccurate. That's an inaccurate statement. I did not check
my messages. I did check my machine at my home, and there was no
message from Paula, and she never called my machine and left me a message
at home.

Q:  And you just made a statement that one of the reasons you know that is
because your phone bill. Is that true?

A:  Pardon me?

Q:  You just made a statement to me that if you check the phone bill, you
would know that you  didn't check your messages. Do you remember that
statement?

A:  Partially, yes. I was surprised that I  didn't, because it seems to me that I
normally will call my car phone, and I was surprised that I didn't.

Q:  Okay. When you say you're "surprised that  you didn't," are you
talking about an occasion where you reviewed your phone bill relative to cell
phone charges and looked at what calls you made that evening?

A:  No. It went further back than that. It went to when Paula told me she had
left a message, and since I knew I had never received a message, at that point
in time I realized I must have never picked up any messages from her.

Q:   When did Paula tell you this?

A:  In jail.

Q:  When in jail?

A:  I don't know. Later on when I was in jail at some point.

Q:   You were having a discussion with Paula about messages that you had
left one another?

A:  No. I think our discussion was about  just everything that had happened,
and somehow it came  up. It wasn't a vital point at the time, which I don't
think it is now, but that's my opinion, and she had said something about she
was upset with me and she  had left a message.

Q:  She brought it up?

A:  I don't know who brought it up. We were just talking about what was
going on. She spent a lot of time with me while I was in jail.

Q:  Was that the first time after the murders that you ever had a discussion
with Paula relative to messages that either she left you or you left her?

A:  That was the first time in jail I had a discussion with Paula that I was
aware that she was pissed that I got up to go play golf.

Q:  That wasn't my question. Was that the first time after the murders that
you had had a discussion with Paula relative to what messages she left you or
you left her or any discussion whatsoever related to messages?

A:  I don't recall. I just recall it was the only time I had a conversation with
Paula concerning how she was feeling that day, and I don't recall if we talked
about messages. I didn't see -- you know, it didn't stand out, any
conversation I had with her.

Q:  The discussion that you are now referencing where you asked Paula
about how she is feeling that day, when did that happen?

A:  At some point when we're in jail.

Q:  Okay. This is while you were in jail, you had this discussion with Paula?

A:  Yes.

Q:  The statement that you "kind of leisurely got ready to go, " do you see
that on line 25 on page 13?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Did you have a desire or an intention to be late for your plane that
evening?

A:  I've only missed one flight in my whole life.

Q:  And this is a business trip. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  It's important for you to be there in  Chicago, isn't it?

A:  And I was there in Chicago.

Q:  It's important for you to be there. You knew that on the l2th. Right?

A:  Yes, and I was there in Chicago.

Q:   Okay. And I take it that you have a  practice of making sure that you get
ready with enough time to make it to the airport to assure yourself that you'll
be able to get on the plane and get to Chicago  or your business appointment?

A:  Well, it's debatable. My limo drivers would say no, and I will point out
to them that I've only missed one flight in my whole life.

Q:  Your limo drivers would say no?

A:  Well, they always wish I'd be ready when they get there, and I
never am.

Q:  Okay. Is this because you have a  practice of running late?

A:  I don't consider it late. As I said, I only missed one flight in my whole
life, and that's because the guy took the midtown tunnel instead of the 59th
Street bridge, which I told him to do.

Q:  And so, for example, on the evening of June 12th, you didn't consider
yourself running late?

A:  I considered it just the way I always  am. I really thought I had had
plenty of time to get to the airport, which I did, and I would have had more
time if I wouldn't have taken the time that I took with Kato.

Q:   Well, would you ever use that term to characterize your status in talking
to a limousine driver as of June 12: That you were running late? Would that
be a term you would use to describe what your time situation
was?

A:  Yeah, but every time a limo driver comes to my house, it's the same act;
it's the same thing: "You're late. You're running late," and I'm hustling, but I
always know in my head that I got plenty of time, and I've never--and I travel
more than just everybody in this room combined, and I've only missed one
flight in my whole life, but it's the same--I had less time earlier that week
trying to catch a  plane to go to Washington. The limo driver said, "You
running late." And I say, "Yeah, I know I'm running late," but in my mind I
was --well, on that trip I thought I was running late, but once again I had
plenty of time when I got to the airport, and I made   my flight.

It's a habit of mine to get ready, put everything basically where I want it to
be, and at the last minute it's sort of a whirlwind, and it's--it is consistent
with what I do all the time.

Q:  So even though you may tell a limousine driver you're running late, in
your mind you're really   not running late--

A:  That's right.

Q:   - you're on time?

A:  That's right. I didn't believe that I would miss the flight.

Q:  So if you told Alan Park on June 12th that you were running late, in your
mind you may have believed that you were actually running on time?

A:  Not necessarily on time. I just knew I wouldn't miss my flight. I knew I
had time to make  the flight. I wasn't concerned really--that concerned about
missing the flight, and so, no, I  didn't think I would miss the flight.

Q:  Other than the Kato discussions that you had that evening where he was
talking to you about the noises, was there anything else that impeded or made
it difficult for you to get ready on time?

A:  I have a habit, and I don't know why, but I have a habit that once the
limo get there, that sometimes my -- well, my golf clubs were packed this
time. Normally they're not. He -- the limo driver sometimes has to do that.
And historically I'm always looking for my cell phone. That's just -- don't
ask me why. It's just a situation that normally Michelle will go out to the car
and get it if she 's there or  the limo driver would go look somewhere for it if
he's there. It's just--you know, it's just the way I am.

Q:  That wasn't a problem on the 12th with respect to your cell phone,
because you had it. Right?

A:  No. When I came down, I didn't have it. I walked back in the house and
got it off a counter, and I didn't have the rest of the stuff to go with it, which I
consider -- you know, it's like a football helmet: You know, if you don't have
your helmet, you don't have your uniform. Even though you might have on
all the other stuff, you're still not properly  dressed. I needed the rest of my
stuff, so I didn't have it all together, no.

Q:  When you went upstairs at 10:20 --

A:  10:15, 10:20.

Q:  -- 10:15, 10:20, and then looked at the clock at about 10:35, 10:40--

A:  Yes

Q:  -- between that time frame, you were just sitting on the bed doing
nothing. Right?

A:  Yeah, I was kind of spacing. I had a book in my lap and my TV was on,
so I was just sort of spacing.

Q:  But, I mean, if you wanted to, you could have gotten up and jumped in
the shower at any time that time frame. There is nothing that would have
prevented you from doing that. Right?

A:  Nothing.

Q:  Now, you didn't get a phone call or get interrupted during that time
frame. Right?

A:  No. I was actually waiting, which is my custom, for the phone call to
initiate me doing those things. That's the way I normally work it.

Q:  And the phone call that you're talking about is the phone call from the
limousine driver?

A:   Yes,

Q:   And so your practice is that you'll sit and wait until you get that phone
call?

A:  Yeah. Normally I'm doing something else, may be eating. I may be --if
it's daytime, I may be out back. I may be doing just about anything, but
normally I got things laid out, and I use that as my   okay, get -- you know, it
puts me in my high gear.

Q:  Okay. And you travel extensively, more so than anyone else in this
room, just as you indicated. Right?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And this is a practice that you routinely follow as a triggering event to
you getting ready?

A:  At home, yes. Not so much on the road.

Q:  Well, let's just talk about at home because that's what we're concerned
about.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that is that when you get a phone call from the limousine driver, that
will trigger taking a shower or finishing your packing or dressing or anything
that you have to do to get ready. Is that true?

A:  Normally, yes. I mean, there are times when the limo driver is late and
Michelle or somebody will say, "You better get going."

Q:  Okay. And did you know what time your plane took off?

A:  Roughly. I think I had just looked at it. So when I was on the bed, I
know that was one of  the things. I had looked at my travel folder, yes.

Q:  That would be kind of important for you to know in order to know
whether you're running late or not, right, what time your plane was going to
leave?

A:  Yeah. I had a rough idea it was I believe 11:45.

Q:  Okay. And in your mind, based upon your experience traveling, you
knew roughly how long it would take you to get from the airport --   Strike
that. Based upon your experience traveling, you knew roughly how long it
would take to get from your house to the airport. True?

A:  Yes

Q:  And I take it that that estimate would be based upon normal traffic
conditions for a Sunday evening?

A:  No. I probably take as many red eyes as anybody, so, yes, I'm pretty
much--I'm pretty aware of how long it normally takes to get
to the airport,  yes.

Q:  Okay. And do you know what time Mr. Park was scheduled to be there
that evening?

A:  It's the habit of my limo--I don't know about Park, but it is--I have a rule
that you guys, because there were a few times they were late, whatever time
we call, they get there 15 minutes early so that I don't have to worry if they're
there or not. So it's --I think they had a 10:45 call that night, so they should
have been there at 10:30.

Q:   And that is a directive that either you or someone on your behalf has
given to the limousine service?

A:  I believe so. Over the years, it just became a standard thing with me and
my limo service.

Q:  Okay. So the limousine service presumably knew that they were to be
there 15 minutes before the scheduled time?

A:  Well, that's normally the way it is. I'm just telling you what has been
normal over the years with me.

Q:  Okay. Well, let's talk--

A:  There have been times they've been late, but that's normally the way it
is.

Q:   Well, that's what we are talking about:  What normally the--the normal
way it is.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And the normal way it is is based upon  your experience with this
limousine service. True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that experience is based upon your request to have them there 15
minutes early. Is that true?

A:  Well, I'm comfortable with that, yes. I don't recall actually saying it to
them, but I know we've had some problems in the past when they were
running late, and it's their practice to be there 15  minutes early.

Q:  So they knew, presumably, if they were following your directive, that if
they were to pick you up at 10:45, they were  to be there by 10:30. Is that
true?

A:  I can't say it's my directive. It's just their habit to be there 15 minutes
early, and that's the way it's always been, basically.

Q:  And when you say it was "their habit to be there 15 minutes early," did
that include actually acknowledging that they were waiting there for you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that the triggering event that you would generally rely upon to start
getting ready and finalizing your packing and so forth before leaving to the
airport?

A:  The majority of the time. I mean, I had housekeepers sometimes that
would push me, but -- or my kids -- "Come on, Daddy, get ready," as my
daughter testified to -- but basically that's it, yes.

Q:  So if we follow what the normal practice was, if we're to assume that the
limousine was scheduled to be at your house at 10:45, they would arrive at
10:30. True?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  They would buzz you then. True?

A:  Ring me, yes.

Q:  Ring you. And that would trigger your getting  ready?

A:  Well, doing the last things that I needed to do, yes.

Q:  Okay. And on this particular occasion the limousine was scheduled to be
there at 10:45. Is  that correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And based upon the normal custom and practice that you had experienced
with your limousine service, you expected to hear a phone ring at about
10:30. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And at 10:30 you were sitting on your bed   doing nothing. Is that true?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  And at--

A:  Well, I may have been reading. I may have been reading.

Q:  You weren't engaged in a discussion or conversation with anyone.
Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And you weren't on the phone to anyone?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. And had you received a phone call at 10:30, presumably that
would have triggered your getting ready. Right?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And at 10:35 you were still sitting on your bed. Is that true?

A:  10:35 or 10:40. I'm not sure because -- I'm just not totally sure. It was
right at those times.

Q:  Anywhere between 10:35 and 10:40, in that time period because you're
not certain, you were still on your bed. Right?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And you hadn't -- Had you appreciated at  any point the fact that the
limousine driver was not  running, as they customarily ran,  l 5 minutes early
from their scheduled--

A:  Yeah, I got a little concerned that I may  have to drive myself to the
airport or I may have--I   may have checked to see if Kato was home and told
him  to do it.

Q:   Well, do you have a recollection now of  checking with Kato to see if he
was home--

A:  No. I said the limo hadn't come.

Q:   Excuse me, Mr. Simpson. Do you have--

A:  I can't have a recollection of something  just told you. If he hadn't  of
come, I would   have -- I was thinking at the time I would have driven  myself
or I would have asked Kato to take me to the   airport, and since he had come
before I was ready to  go, I didn't have to do those things.

Q:  Okay. So that we're clear, at some point, 10:35, 10:40, you began to be
somewhat concerned about the fact that the limousine driver  hadn't rang.

A:  I don't know about concerned. I looked and said  where was the limo
driver and then I just started doing the things that I had to do to get ready  to
go.

Q:   When you say you "looked," did you look out your window--

A:  No, no. I had--I became--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've got to wait, OJ.,  till he finishes.

THE REPORTER: Okay. Everybody is just going  to have to slow down. I
cannot keep up with this   testimony. I cannot keep a record. So you are just
both going to have to slow down for me here. Okay?

MR. BREWER: Okay.

Q:  Go ahead.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't even know if there is a question pending.
Is there?

(Pending question read.)

THE WITNESS: That's a figure of speech again. When I say  "I looked," I
looked at the clock. The    limo driver I noticed, hadn't rung me, so I didn't
know if he was running late or not. I just knew that I had to start getting ready
to go.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You never looked out your window or made  any effort to look outside at
the Ashford gate to see if the limousine was sitting there. Is that true?

A:   No. No. No.

Q:   Okay. And so that at roughly between  10:35 and 10:40, I guess you
decided that you were  going to get up and get ready on your own without this
triggering event occurring. Right?

A:  It was time to go. It was time for me to  do the things I needed to do to
be ready to go, yes.

Q:  Okay. And at any time before you got in the shower, do you recall
making any effort to determine whether Mr. Kaelin was still home--

A:   No.

Q:  -- in the event--

A:   No. I mean--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You have to wait till he's finished.

THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  -- in the event that you needed him to   take you to the airport?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you make any effort to determine whether Arnelle was home in the
event she had to take out to the airport?

A:  At that time there was no need to, so the answer is no.

Q:  Did you make any telephone contacts with anyone as kind of a backup in
the event that the limousine driver didn't show up and you needed a ride to the
airport?

A:  There was no need to, so I didn't. No .

Q:  And it was at this point that you got into the shower--you went to the
bathroom and then got into the shower?

A:  Yeah, I went to the toilet and then I jumped in the shower.

Q:  Mr. Petrocelli asked you during the course of his examination whether
you were asleep between I believe 10:00 o'clock and 10:45, and you indicated
that you were not. Is that true?

A:  Yeah, I was fighting sleep, and that was the biggest problem I was
having, falling asleep. So I was sitting there trying not to nod off, that's why
I was trying to read and keep myself active.

Q:  Okay. Because you were going to take a red eye, and you normally sleep
on a red eye. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  In fact it wouldn't make a lot of sense to take a nap or sleep before you
go on a red eye. Right?

A:   At that late time, no.

Q:  Okay. And you deny that you told Mr. Park that you overslept. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And other than your lawyers, have you ever told anyone that at the time
of these murders, you overslept?

A:  No.

Q:  If someone made a statement on your behalf that you were asleep at the
time of these murders, would that be a false statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. BREWER: Why not?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Because if someone made a statement on his
behalf, it's irrelevant. I mean, you know what the facts are, what his
testimony is going to be, and he is not going to answer it.

MR. BREWER: Well, I want to know, if somebody who was an agent of
his made a statement that he was asleep at the time of these murders, the basis
for that statement.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you are not going to know because he is not
going to answer the question.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Did you ever-- Do you recall when Robert Shapiro first became your
lawyer?

A:  I believe sometime Tuesday. I don't know if we had really decided
Tuesday. I know I for the most part spoke to him Tuesday and liked him, and
it may have been Wednesday.

Q:  Okay. Tuesday, Wednesday, roughly?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And, Mr. Simpson, as you've already testified in this deposition, you
were the only person that knows your whereabouts between 10:00 o'clock
and 10:45. Is that true?

A:  My whereabouts?

Q:  Yes.

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:   When Mr. Shapiro took over the -- your representation, do you recall
him making a statement on national television that at the time of the murders
you were asleep?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  No?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that, I said.

MR. BREWER: Why?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Because it doesn't make any difference what Mr.
Shapiro said.

MR. BREWER: Well, Mr. Shapiro is a lawyer, gets on national television
and says that Mr. Simpson is asleep?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: So what? You are not going to get it out of this
witness, and if you get it -- you know, if you get a ruling out of the judge that
it's relevant, good for you. It won't surprise me in this case, but it's--

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Your answer is no, though, that you never heard him make that
statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that question.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Moving--fast forwarding a bit to your trip to Chicago on the plane, you
were in first class. Is that correct?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And I take it that other than takeoff and landing, the lights were off inside
the plane during the trip?

A:  I think the overhead lights were, yeah, the plane lights. You have the
ones at your seat.

Q:   Did you have that light on?

A:  Sometimes.

Q:  Is that because you were reading?

A:   Yeah.Yeah.

Q:  Do you remember what you were reading?

A:  "Inca Gold."

Q:  And other than reading "Inca Gold," did you do anything else, write or
work or anything of that nature on the trip back to Chicago?

A:  I probably did. I may have looked at what I was doing in Chicago. I may
have thought about some of the things that I would say.

Q:  Did you have one particular stewardess that waited--not waited, but that
handled the people in First Class?

A:  You know, I know there's always a First Class stewardess--

Q:  Flight attendant.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: There you go.

THE WITNESS: Flight attendant. I know there's always a First Class flight
attendant. I know the girls from the back came up once and got me a glass of
water, I believe, but I--you know, I really wasn't paying attention to the
stewardesses.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Okay. Flight attendants.

A:  Flight attendants.

Q:  All right. During the trip to Chicago,  can you estimate how long you
were in the air for?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall having used the restroom?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you recall having to use the restroom on approximately 15 occasions?

A:  I'd say that's incorrect.

Q:  Ten?

A:  I'd say that's incorrect.

Q:  That is?

A:  I would say that would be incorrect.

Q:   Five?

A:  Possibly.

Q:  Okay. Between five and ten or less than five?

A:  Maybe about five.

Q:  About five?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And was there any particular reason, other than just using it for --
because you had to go to the bathroom, that you had to utilize the restroom on
the trip to Chicago?

A:  Other than taking a leak, no.

Q:  So you believe there were five separate occasions, roughly, that you had
to actually use the facilities in the air back to Chicago?

A:  Correct.

Q:   Okay. And while you were in the restroom, when you activate the lock
the lights go on, don't they?

A:  I guess so.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: In the bathroom?

MR.BREWER: Yeah. Not the plane. The bathroom.

MR.ROBERT BAKER: The bathroom on the aircraft. Yeah, okay.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  So, for example, it will be vacant -- you'll go in, you'll shut the door
you'll push the lock, and the lights go on inside the restroom.

A:  Yes.

Q:  And on these roughly five occasions -- by the way, do you have a
practice of washing your hands after you go to the bathroom?

A:   Sometimes.

Q:  Well, is it a practice of yours?

A:  Sometimes.

Q:  Okay. And do you recall any specific occasions where you washed your
hands en route back to Chicago?

A:  Either way, no.

Q:  Do you recall on any of these five occasions looking down and seeing
any wounds or cuts to your hands?

A:   No, I never saw any wounds.

Q:   Just so I am clear, you don't have a specific recollection of actually
washing your hands headed back--as you were going back to Chicago?

A:   No.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection of putting a Band-Aid on any cut on
any of your fingers--

A:  No.

Q:  -- as you were headed back to Chicago?

A:  It didn't happen. No.

Q:  You're certain of that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  When you got back to Chicago and you got to the hotel room, you
indicated that you kind of put your toiletries out, and then I think you went to
sleep. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Approximately what time was it when you went to sleep?

A:   I don't know.

Q:  Was it light or dark out?

A:  I think it was getting light. I'm not sure of that.

Q:  Did you close any curtains to make the room darker so that you would be
able to sleep?

A:   They were closed.

Q:   Already when you got in there?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And --

A:  I believe they were. They may not have, but I believe they were.

Q:  Okay. Was it roughly 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock when you got back to the
hotel?

A:   I believe it was after--I'm guessing. I believe it was after 6:00.

Q:  That's your best estimate?

A:  Yes.

MR. BREWER: Why don't we just stop right here and we can change the
tape.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No.1 of Volume VIII. The
time is approximately 11:42, and we are off the record.

(Pause in the deposition.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is approximately
11:45. This is the beginning of tape No. 2 of Volume VIII.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   We have journeyed back here, Mr. Simpson, to Chicago with you, and
we are in your hotel room now and -- sometime after 6:00, and you have
arrived at the hotel, and I think you've put out the toiletries in your bathroom.
True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you believe--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't say  "sometime after 6."  He said he
didn't know the time.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, it may have been after 6:00. I'm not sure.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Don't let me put words in your mouth.

A:  It may have been after. You know, I only think that because of what I
hear now, but at the time I had no idea what time it is. I assumed it was about
6:00 o'clock.

Q:   Okay. And do you assume that because the sun was coming up as you
were going from the airport to the hotel?

A:  No. I assumed that for--I knew the flight and the time it took to get the
luggage and get to the hotel that it would be getting close to 6:00.

Q:  And am I correct on the rest of it, that you put out the toiletries when you
got in the room?

A:  Yeah.Yeah.

Q:  And then you went to bed to get some--

A:  I brushed my teeth and then went to bed, yeah.

Q:  Okay. When you got the phone call from Detective Phillips or one of the
detectives--do you remember that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you turn on the light?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Do you recall whether your room was dark at that time?

A:  No.

Q:  You don't recall one way or the other?

A:  One way or the other.

Q:  And I take it that when you were told by one of the detectives that Nicole
had been killed, that that was -- you were in shock.

A:  I don't know what I was. It was -- you know, it was a lot--it was -- I
don't know.

Q:   Well, you were awakened early in the morning and told by a detective
that your wife had  been killed.

A:  My ex-wife had been murdered, yeah.

Q:   And that was shocking information.

A:  I don't know what it was. I just know it was like--I can't describe it. It's
-- you can't  describe it. I can't describe how I was. It was...

Q:  Did you start crying?

A:  I don't think so.

Q:   Okay. Did you start screaming?

A:  While I was on the phone with him, you  know what? I don't know what
I did, basically. I know I -- it was hard to believe and I know I was saying
something to him, and then I was at that point trying to hear what he was
saying to me.

Q:  Well, you've already related, and I don't want to go back over it, a
discussion with the detective, and then you spoke with Arnelle. Right?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  After you hung up with Arnelle, was there a period of time where you
were crying after learning of this shocking news?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: While he is in Chicago?

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Yeah, while you were in Chicago, and the time period that I am focusing
on right now, Mr. Simpson, is when you hung up with Arnelle.

A:   I don't--

Q:  At that point did you cry or scream or yell or do anything in response to
hearing this?

A:  I know I was pissed and I was like feeling--I don't know what I was
feeling. It was just so hard to digest. And I may have cried. I    don't know. I
know I did on the plane a little bit because I was trying not to let--for the
people not to see, but I don't know.
I may have.

Q:   Let's just talk about what you do remember doing. You don't remember
one way or the other whether you cried. True?

A:  True.

Q:  You don't remember whether -- one way or the other whether you
screamed. True?

A:  I'm not-- what do you mean, "screamed"? Was I loud? Probably was
loud. I mean, I wasn't screaming like, you know, Fay Wray or nothing, but I
was probably loud. I have a habit of being loud.

Q:  Talking to yourself?

A:  Yeah, venting. I don't know if I'm talking to myself. Just I have a habit
of thinking out loud.

Q:  Okay. And as you described it, venting?

A:   Yeah.

Q:  Were you walking around the room as you were venting upon hearing
that your wife had been killed -- your ex-wife had been killed?

A:  I was going back and forth to the telephone, yes.

Q:  Going back and forth between the telephone and where?

A:  The bathroom, the telephone and the closet.

Q:   Okay. What I am trying to focus on, Mr. Simpson, is after you were
told that Nicole had  been killed, was there a period of time where you just
had to go through some emotional response, where you  weren't making
phone calls or using the restroom or brushing your teeth, where you were
sitting on the bed or walking around trying to deal with this news
emotionally?

A:  The whole time I was, even when I was sitting and walking and even fell
back on the bed a few times, I was doing -- during the whole period of time I
was trying to deal with it emotionally. There's no -- you don't turn on your
emotions and turn your emotions off. The entire time I was trying to deal with
it emotionally. No matter what I was doing, I was trying to deal with it
emotionally.

Q:  Was there a period of time where you were trying to deal with it
emotionally before you affirmatively started getting ready to leave?

A:  The whole time from the time I heard it I began to try to deal with it
emotionally.

Q:  And then you've described a process where you were going back and
forth between the restroom and the phone making phone calls trying to make
travel arrangements, and it's at some point there that you  broke the glass.
Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you indicated to Detective Vannatter and Lange that you broke the
glass as you were going bonkers a little bit. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And were you indicating to them that upon hearing the news you were
angry and, as a result of that anger, broke the glass?

A:  I don't know what I was indicating to them. I just broke the glass while I
was doing the things that I was doing, trying to get out of there and trying to
get back home.

Q:   When you used the term "bonkers," were you attempting to imply that
you were out of control?

A:   Yeah, I think I probably was a little bit, yes.

Q:  And is it your testimony sir, that you were out of control at the time that
you broke the glass in Chicago?

A:  I may have been. It may not have happened while I was--I just know that
I was -- I was -- I don't know what I was.

Q:  Well let's not talk about  possibilities. Let's talk about what you recall.
Because you recall telling the detectives that you   were bonkers when this
glass broke. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection and -- strike that. You've also
indicated that by the term "bonkers" you're referencing a state of mind where
you're out of control. Right?

A:  Sort of. When I say "out of control," I mean, I wasn't jumping out of
any window or anything, but, yes, I was charged.

Q:  Charged?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And the reason why you were charged is you had just learned this awful
news about Nicole.

A:   That's correct.

Q:  And it was in that context that this glass was broken. Is that true?

A:  Yeah, you told me not to say what I don't know for sure, so I can't
answer that.

Q:  Okay. When you told the detectives that you broke the glass as you were
going bonkers, was that inaccurate?

A:  I need to read that because I don't think I said, "I was going bonkers." I
said, "I kinda went kind bonkers for a little bit," and I don't know if I said,
"as I was going bonkers I broke the glass." I don't know if that was what I
said.

I just know during this period of time I would reach the point where it was
just like just trying to digest it all was a little much.

Q:  Let's go to that then. Page 15, f you have the statement in front  of you,
Mr. Simpson and we are going to start at line 12, and the question that you
were asked, and this is in reference to how you cut the finger, "How did you
do it in Chicago?'

Suspect: "I broke a glass. I just was -- you had -- one of you guys had just
called me and I was in the bathroom and I just kind of went   bonkers...a little
bit."

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let's, so that we're clear, we are on -- there are
three stars that indicate something is undecipherable, at least that's my
interpretation, and we certainly don't have the tape. But you read it
accurately. I don't mean to imply you did not.

MR. BREWER: Okay.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Because as you'll see in the logo, three stars means
unintelligible, first page.

MR. BREWER: Okay.

Q:   Other than that, I read it accurately. Correct, Mr. Simpson? You
following along?

A:  No, I wasn't.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You did. You did.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, you wanted to revisit that--

A:  Yes.

Q:  -- that statement. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You see where it says or where I read, "I...went-- "kinda went bonkers a
little bit"?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you were relating that state of mind to the detectives in connection
with describing at what point you broke the glass. True?

A:   Yeah, I went bonkers for a little bit. I don't know if that's when I broke
the glass. It could have been but, as you told me, I shouldn't comment if I
don't know for sure, and I don't. I just know I went bonkers; a glass got
broke. I wasn't -- I was trying to get on the phone. I was trying to get a flight
out. So I was going back   and forth, and during the course of all of that, and
I--I broke the glass.

Q:  Okay. Let's try to be real clear here then on a couple things. When you
say you "went   bonkers"--

A:  Yes.

Q:   - and in the context of describing how the glass was broken, you're not
certain today whether that was your state of mind when the glass broke or
not. Is that true?

A:  When it actually broke, I don't know what my state of mind--I was
agitated from the time I heard the call to the time I left, and during the course
of getting on and off the telephone, trying to get packed, the glass broke.

Q:  Okay. Would you say that when you first learned of Nicole's death from
one of the detectives, that your emotional reaction kind of reached a crescendo
and then diminished as time went on?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Did you tend to gain a little bit more wits about yourself as time went on
after having the opportunity to digest this information a little bit?

A:  I don't know.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: From what point to what point?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Just while you were in the hotel room.

A:  I don't know.

Q:  You had mentioned during Mr. Petrocelli's examination that you didn't
recall whether you slammed the glass down. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We can get that if you want.

THE WITNESS: Why don't you get it. I mean, I may have slammed it
down, I may not have slammed it down, but it broke.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Okay. Let's go from that. As you sit here today, is it your testimony that
you could have slammed it down, as one possible explanation for the glass
breaking?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And when you're talking about you could have, do you have some
memory or recollection that you slammed the glass down?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. What I would like to do in the next five minutes before we break
is I want to rule out things that are possible, because a number of things are
possible, and try to focus on what you have some recollection of doing.
Okay?

A:  Okay.

Q:  You have no recollection one way or the other of affirmatively doing
anything to break the glass. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:   You have no recollection one way or the other of slamming a glass
down and breaking it. Is that true?

A:  I may have.

Q:   Well, when you say you "may have"--

A:  I may have. Somewhere in my mind that may have happened because I
was slamming everything around, so that could have happened,
yes.

Q:   Okay. What else did you slam around that day?

A:  Just everything that I was throwing around. I was rude on the telephone.
I was throwing things together to pack to get out of there. Yes, that could
have happened. That could have been it.

Q:  Did you break anything else in that hotel room?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Did you break anything on the airplane ride back?

A:  Not that I know of.

Q:  Did you break anything in the automobile ride from your hotel back to
the airport?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you break anything while you were at the airport?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  And were you slamming things around on all these occasions or just
while you were in the hotel room?

A:  I think I was a little aggressive, yes.

Q:   Well, when you say  "aggressive," I'm talking about you said that you
were slamming things around." You used that term. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And to me that means that you were physically taking objects and
slamming them down--

A:  No.

Q:   - or slamming them around?

A:  (Indicating.) You know, to me that's slamming things around. I was
doing that all day, yes.

Q:   Okay. So when you're talking about slamming things around, you've
just demonstrated physically taking cups, pens, slamming them down on the
table. Is that true?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. Other than the glass that you broke in Chicago, did you break
anything else that day while you were slamming things around?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. And so the basis for the statement  that you've made that that is a
possible explanation is the recollection that you have of slamming things
down all day. Right?

A:  No. The basis is that the glass broke, so that's the basis.

Q:  Okay. But you don't have a specific recollection of slamming the
glass down and having it break while you're doing it. Right?

A:  As I say, it might have. I just know that it broke when I was moving
things around in the bathroom, and it broke.

Q:  Wait a second. Now, you're saying that it broke when you were moving
things around the bathroom?

A:  Yes. I was trying to get my stuff out of the bathroom. I either slammed
the glass down or knocked it over. I don't know exactly what it was. But I
know that was my state of mind at the time, that I was like--I was like a little
bonkers, and the glass broke during the course of that, and that's the best I
can answer it no matter how many different ways you talk about this.

Q:  Okay. And I don't want to go over it, Mr. Simpson. You've discussed
it. But what I want to do is focus on what's possible versus what you have a
recollection of doing. Okay?

A:  Okay.

Q:  And just see if we can flush this out a bit.

A:  Okay.

Q:  Because you've talked about slamming things down throughout
the day because of your state of mind. True? You did that.

A:   Yes. I mean, I was aggressive throughout the day. I may have
thrown my suitcase. I may have -- I was pretty aggressive throughout the
day.

Q:  Okay. Now--

A:  At least until I got back to L.A.

Q:  Okay. Now, do you have a specific recollection of slamming down a
glass inside that bathroom?

A:  I may have. As I said, I wasn't thinking about slamming at the time . It
was my state of mind. So it's possible. As you say, what's possible and not
possible--it's possible.

Q:  Well, it's possible I woke up in China this morning, but I know that I
didn't. I am just trying to find out what you recall, not what's possible. Do
you have--

A:  You said earlier "possible," and I'm telling you it's possible that's how it
happened. That's the only way I can answer the question.

Q:  Do you have any memory at all as you sit here today of taking that glass
and slamming it down on the table?

A:  It's possible that that happened, yes.

Q:  It's possible you have a memory of it?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you have a memory of it?

A:  Possibly, yes. It seems like I was throwing everything around.

Q:  Well, either you have some recollection of it or you don't, Mr. Simpson.
Do you?

A:  It's possible that that's when it happened, yes.

Q:  Okay. And that's based upon some memory that you have?

A:  It's possible that that's when the glass broke, because I was being a little
aggressive.

Q:  Okay. You don't want to answer my question?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that last question.

THE WITNESS: It's possible.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  It's possible that you have a memory of breaking a glass? Is that the best
you can do?

A:  I broke a glass. I know that's a fact. It's possible how it happened is
when I was slamming things around or trying to pack things. I was a little
aggressive.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Evidently the glass broke, so it's possible that that's when it broke.

Q:  Okay. So what we have established is that you broke a glass and that it's
possible that it happened when you were slamming it around, so far. Is that
correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  As you sit here today, do you have some memory -- some specific
memory of breaking that glass by slamming it down while you're in Chicago?

A:  It's possible.

MR. BREWER: Let's just take a break for lunch.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and the time is
approximately 12:01.

(At the hour of 12:01 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken, the deposition to
resume at l:0l p.m.)

(At the hour of 1:38 p.m., the  deposition of ORENTHAL JAMES
SIMPSON was resumed at the same place, the same persons being present
with the exception of Daniel Petrocelli.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 1:38.

EXAMINATION Resumed)

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Mr. Simpson, we are back from our lunch break, and let's pick up where
we left off. We were trying to narrow down some of these issues in Chicago,
and we were talking about whether or not you recall slamming down a glass
and breaking it in Chicago. Do you recall that discussion?

A:  Yes, sir.

Q:   Okay. You indicated in connection with some of my questions that it's
possible that you don't recall. Do you recall that?

A:  Well, I'm saying it's possible it could have happened at times that you
indicated. I just knew it happened during that period of time. I just l can't tell
you specifically at what instance it happened. It just happened during a time
when there was a lot of--I can't call it confusion, but where I was being
somewhat emotional, and I was trying to get out of Chicago.

Q:  Okay. I want to go through a number of questions, and what I would
like to try to focus on is what you recall today or don't recall today--

A:  Okay.

O: -- versus what may or may not be possible. Are we clear with one another?

A:  Yes.

Q:  As you sit here today, do you recall whether or not you slammed a glass
down, causing it to break?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall whether you knocked over a  glass with your hand,
accidentally causing it to break?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall whether you broke the glass intentionally?

A:  I don't believe I did, no.

Q:  Okay. So you have some recollection that however the glass broke, it
was not done by you intentionally. Is that a fair statement?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And is it fair to also assume that, by your answer, that you broke the
glass accidentally?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And do you recall the breaking of the glass included some
involvement of your hand?

A:  Not really.

Q:  Okay. Is it possible that you kicked it over--

A:  I doubt that.

Q:  -- with your foot?

A:  I doubt that.

Q:   Do you have any recollection of hitting it with any part of your body
other than your hand?

A:  Not really, no.

Q:  Do you recall whether you hit it with any luggage?

A:  That could have been.

Q:  Okay. When you say it "could have been," do you now have a
recollection as you sit here today of some luggage being involved in
connection with the glass breaking?

A:  Well, yeah, in my bathroom I had my overnight toiletry kit, and I believe
I brought my big bag in there at one point, too.

Q:  Okay. And do you remember the purpose of bringing your big bag into
the bathroom?

A:  I think I was just packing. It was just a part of packing and whatever I
was trying to do at the time.

Q:  When you say your big bag, you're talking about your grip?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you bring your grip into the restroom or the bathroom before or after
the glass broke?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Do you remember some involvement in your  grip in causing the glass to
break?

A:  No, I don't recall.

Q:  So as you sit here today, you have no recollection at all that your grip
was involved in any  way with breaking this glass. Is that true?

A:  One way or the other, no.

Q:  Is that true, what I just said?

A:  Yeah. Either way I don't have any recollection of was it before or was it
after--

Q:  That's not--

A:  -- or during.

Q:  I'm sorry. That's not my question. My question is: Do you recall as you
sit here today right now any involvement whatsoever in your grip in causing
this glass to break?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Okay. Do you have a recollection of the glass that broke being on the
counter sink -- I'm sorry--on the sink counter at the time that it broke?

A:  I just recall pushing the glass off the counter.

Q:  Okay. So at the time that the glass broke, is it fair to say that as you sit
here today, you have no recollection with respect to where it was located?

A:  I'm sure it was on the counter, but other than that, I have--it's just not
something that's been in my mind, no.

Q:  Okay.

A:  You're right: I have no recollection.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection of it being on the counter, or are you
assuming it was because that's where the broken glass was located?

A:  Yes, at this point it's an assumption I'm making.

Q:  Okay. So you have no specific recollection as you sit here today whether
it was  actually on the counter at the time that it was broken. Is that true?

A:  I'm sure it was.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: But he is asking you if you have a specific
recollection.

THE WITNESS: Specific recollection, no, I don't.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Do you have a specific recollection of whether or not you threw
the glass at something to break it?

A:  No.

Q:   Is that something that's possible, or are you able to rule that out as a
potential explanation for how the glass broke?

A:  Well, I didn't take it and throw a glass. I do know I didn't do that.

Q:   Okay. So that's something we are definitively able to rule out as you sit
here today.

A:  I believe so, yeah. I don't recall throwing a glass, no.

Q:   Okay. And that would also be true throwing it either at a wall or
throwing it on the floor or throwing it on the counter. Are we able to rule all
of those scenarios out as you sit here today?

A:  Except the counter, if I kind of knocked it over or put it down hard.
Except for the counter. I can rule out that I didn't throw it at the wall or the
floor.

Q:  Okay. What I am talking about is not putting it down hard, but actually
throwing it like a baseball at the counter--

A:  I don't recall doing that.

Q:  -- we haven't ruled that out?

A:  I'm sorry. I don't recall doing that.

Q:  Okay. When you say you don't recall, is that one of the possible
explanations in your view? Can we definitively rule out the fact that you may
have thrown the glass at the counter top, causing it to
break?

A:  I'm pretty sure I didn't do that, but I don't -- I don't -- you know. I
don't -- the glass is not something I -- I don't--no, I don't.

Q:  Okay. Let me just make sure I'm clear. Are you saying you're able to
rule that out definitively?

A:  I'm saying I don't recall that.

Q:  "I don't recall that" meaning that's a possible explanation?

A:   It's possible, I guess.

Q:  That you may actually have thrown the glass down on the counter
top?

A:  I doubt it, but it's possible.

Q:  Okay. Are you saying that anything that you don't remember is possible?

A:  I think you said that earlier.

Q:  Is that in your state of mind, that anything that you don't remember is
possible?

A:  In that bathroom at that time, I can't say "anything." If you were
specific, I can answer as best I can specific questions.

Q:  Okay. Now, you have described in earlier testimony the mechanics of
what you were doing at the time that you cut your finger. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And as I understand your testimony essentially you were in a sweeping
motion moving the glass towards the sink with your left hand. Is that true?

A:  Well, I don't know about a sweeping motion. Maybe I indicated that
with my hand. I knew I was trying to get the glass out from around my stuff
into the sink, and I cut my hand at that time.

Q:  Okay. Now, do you recall as you sit here today moving, and if you
watch my hand, moving the glass towards the sink in a sweeping motion
using the back of your hand as a leading edge?

A:  Not using my hand. I was using a towel to do it, but l do recall trying to
sweep the bits into the sink, and I do recall noticing that I had cut my hand.

Q:  Okay. So as you sit here today, you have a specific recollection of using
a towel as kind of a broom, moving the glass towards the sink?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And was the towel located on the upper right towel bar--

A:  I don't know.

Q:  -- inside the restroom?

A:  I don't recall.

(Daniel Petrocelli enters the deposition.)

MR. BREWER: Do you have Exhibit 71?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. They're in order.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  I just want to show you a copy of Exhibit 71. If you need to look at the
original, we'll pull it. Faintly, it's better than my   photograph, if you want to
see it. Do you see a towel bar in the upper right portion of the photograph?

A:  I can't see it distinctively, but that appears to be one, yes.

Q:  Okay. This is a little better. Just look at mine just to see if it refreshes --
Do you see what appears to be a towel bar in the upper right portion of the
photograph--

A:  Yeah.

Q: -- the photocopy of the photograph? Is that where you got the towel from
that you were using to assist you in sleeping up--  sweeping up the glass?

A:  I don't recall. I don't even remember this room.

Q:  You don't remember where you got the towel from?

A:  It was in the bathroom. That's all I recall.

Q:  Was it a hand towel, a bath towel where you dry yourself off, or a
washcloth?

A:  I don't--it was just a small towel because I also used a little toilet paper.
So it was just a towel. It was just whatever was sitting   there. I don't know if
it was a towel I had used the night before or a towel that I just grabbed at that
time, but -- it wasn't what I was--what was on my   mind, so I don't recall.

Q:  You just characterized it as a "small towel." When you use that term, are
you talking about a hand towel or a washcloth as opposed to a towel that you
would use to dry yourself off?

A:  Yes. Yes.

Q:  Okay. So we're able to say at least with some degree of definity that it
was either a hand towel or a washcloth that you used to sweep up the glass,
as you sit here today?

A:  I believe so, yes.

Q:  Okay. And you pulled that towel --  Strike that. You used that towel to
sweep up that glass before you ever cut yourself. Is that true?

A:  I think during the process of doing it, I cut myself.

Q:  Okay. And were you holding that towel in your left hand?

A:  I believe so. yes.

Q:   And were you applying the towel to the surface of the counter top,
moving the glass towards the sink?

A:   At one point. yes.

Q:  And was that the process that you were engaged in at the time that you
cut your finger?

A:  I believe so. yes.

Q:  Okay. And did something happen while you were doing that that caused
you to cut your finger that you now -- that you recall as you sit here today?

A:  I was going back and forth to the phone, and I don't recall if someone
was waiting on the phone for me or if the phone had just rung, but I was
going back and forth to the phone. I do recall that was  what was going on
during this particular time.

Q:  When you were going back and forth to the phone, are you talking about
before you ever began to clean up the glass, or after you had started cleaning
up the glass you went back to the phone for some reason?

A:  I believe through all the time I was in the room, once I received the call
from the LAPD, I was -- it's almost a continual thing until I left the room.

Q:   And when you say--

A:  When I was going to the phone, back and forth to the phone.

Q:  Back and forth to the phone from the bathroom?

A:   From everywhere. From everywhere. Whatever was going on, I would
-- whatever I was doing. I'd be on the phone. I'd be off the phone. I'd be on
the phone. I'd be off the phone.

Q:  Okay. Other than packing up your toiletries and perhaps cleaning up and
shaving or brushing your teeth, was there any reason why you had to go back
and forth from the restroom to the phone?

A:  It was just basically packing and just trying to get everything together.

Q:  Okay. And as you sit here today now, do you have a specific recollection
of cutting yourself after you began the process with this towel of moving the
glass into the sink?

A:  I know it was during the time that I was cleaning up the glass that I cut
myself.

Q:  Okay.

A:  And -- but it was at that particular time that it happened.

Q:  Now, as you sit here today, do you have a specific recollection, after you
began the process of cleaning up the glass, of going from that point to the
phone either to make a call or to receive a call that was coming into the hotel
room?

A:   Well, I know I was back and forth to the phone, yes.

Q:  Well, when you say, "I know I was back and forth to the phone," what I
am asking you for today is a specific recollection, whether you have one or
not, of going to the phone after you began the process of cleaning up the
glass that you've just described for us.

A:  Well, I know I was back and forth to the phone, and I know that--that I
cut--I believe it was in the midst of all of that I cut my hand, so... I know I
was back and forth to the phone before and I   would believe after. Yes. Yes.
So I can't tell you what phone call--I was coming in or going out or if I was
on the phone at the time it happened, but I do know I was back and forth
before and after it happened.

Q:  So in your mind as you're sitting here today, you have some recollection
of attempting to clean up this glass and then at some point moving towards the
phone. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And did you cut your finger before you made any movement towards the
phone?

A:  I don't know. I don't get the question, so I don't know.

Q:   Okay. Well, you've described a process where you were moving glass
into a sink. Right?

A:  Uh-huh.

Q:  Yes?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then you're talking about having to go to the phone to use the phone
either to make a call or to receive a call. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You have a recollection of that as you sit here today. Right?

A:  I know I was back and forth to the phone, and I know during the midst
of doing all that I cut my hand. At what point that happened--I wasn't
thinking about at what point that was happening. I was trying to get out of
Chicago and I was trying to get to L.A.

Q:   I understand all that, Mr. Simpson, and all I'm asking for is what you
know today. What's I your recollection as you're sitting here today in this
deposition?

A:  My recollection is during the course of trying to get out of Chicago, I
was on and off the telephone. In the midst of all that I cut my hand at some
point, and I was still back and forth trying to  get out of Chicago, trying to get
a flight out, trying to get someone to take me to the airport, and in the midst of
all that I cut my hand. That is my   recollection.

Q:  Okay. Well, let's see if we can break it down a little bit, maybe stir your
recollection. Focusing on the time period that I'm focusing on where you
began to move the glass into the sink, as you sit here today, do you have a
specific recollection of going to the phone?

A:  I know I went to the phone--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask that. Just, do you have a recollection
in your mind's eye right now of doing that? If you don't, just say, I don't.

THE WITNESS: I don't.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. Do you have a recollection of -- in your mind's eye as you sit here
today of what you were doing as you cut your finger?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Do you have a recollection of feeling any pain at the time you cut
your finger?

A:  I don't have a recollection, no.

Q:  Do you have a recollection as to the position of your hand at the time that
you cut your finger?

A:  No recollection, no.

Q:  Do you have a recollection as to whether your hand was moving at the
time that you cut your finger?

A:  No recollection, no.

Q:  Do you have a recollection with respect to where your hand was in
relationship to the towel at the time that you cut your finger?

A:  No.

A:  Do you have a recollection as to whether your finger began to bleed after
you cut your finger?

A:  At some point obviously it did.

Q:   Do you have a specific recollection of that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  As you sit here today?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And do you remember where you were in the hotel room when you first
recall seeing any blood that you associated with this cut?

A:  In the bathroom.

Q:  And when you first saw blood associated with the cut, where were you
located in the bathroom?

A:   Just in the bathroom. It wasn't a big bathroom. So at some place in the
bathroom. I wasn't sitting on the commode, and I wasn't in the shower. I
was standing in the bathroom, a relatively small  bathroom, yes.

Q:  Okay. Were you still cleaning up the glass when you made this
observation that you had in fact cut your finger?

A:  I don't know. I don't know. I don't recall if I was at that point or not. I
know I grabbed some toilet paper and I believe went back to the phone, but
once again it was a continual thing that was going on.

Q:  Okay. Is it fair to say then that as you sit here today, at the time that you
cut your finger, you have no recollection as to whether you had completed
this process of putting the glass into the   sink or whether you were still
involved in that process?

A:  That's correct.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he didn't say he was putting the glass in the
sink. He said glass chips in the sink.

MR. BREWER: That's what I meant. I'm sorry.

THE WITNESS: Yeah. That's correct.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. When I use the term "glass" you understand I am talking about the
glass particles as a result of the glass breaking.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's fine.

THE WITNESS: That's correct.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. All right. And then when you cut your finger, you observed it
was bleeding. Right?

A:  Well, I saw blood. yes.

Q:  And you saw the location of the blood?

A:  It was on my hand.

Q:  Okay. Did you get a little squeamish  when you saw it?

A:  No. My mind was on other things that was more pressing.

Q:  Okay. That was Nicole, the loss of your ex-wife?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He's gone over that 15 times.

MR. BREWER: Well, I don't know whether it's his travel arrangements or
his ex-wife.

Q:  What was on your mind that was more pressing?

A:   You're really being an asshole right now. My wife's -- the murder of
my wife.

Q:   And then when you saw that you had glass on your--Strike that. When
you saw that you had a cut on your finger, you put some type of toilet paper
on it?

A:  I grabbed something, yes.

Q:  And what did you grab?

A:  Toilet paper.

Q:  Okay. Did you also grab a washcloth?

A:  Maybe .

Q:  Maybe meaning you don't recall?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. So you have no recollection as to whether you used a washcloth in
order to dab blood off your finger?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Okay. You have a specific memory, however, of grabbing some type of
toilet paper?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And did you apply that to your finger?

A:  I don't know about applied it. I wrapped it.

Q:  Okay. How did you wrap it?

A:  Just wrapped it.

Q:  Did you tie it off?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Did you somehow affix it to your finger to stop the bleeding?

A:  I don't think -- I don't know if I stopped the bleeding or not. I just
wrapped my hand -- finger with some toilet paper, yes.

Q:  Okay. At any time after you first noticed that you had cut your finger, did
you ever get back into your bed?

A:  Every time I talked on the phone I was on the bed, yes.

Q:  Okay. Did you ever get back into the bed under the covers and pull the
covers up?

A:  l didn't have to. The covers were flipped back.

Q:  Okay. My question is pretty specific: After you cut your finger, did you
ever get back into the bed as though you were sleeping, pull the covers back
up over on top?

A:  No. I fell back on the bed a few times while I was waiting on the phone,
but the covers were all flipped back at the time.

Q:   Okay. So when you got out of the bed, did you pull the covers down in
order to get out?

A:  Probably.

Q:  Well, do you have a specific recollection as you sit here today?

A:  I probably did.

Q:  Well, when you say you "probably did," do you have a recollection as to
-- one way or the other whether you did or you didn't?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. And you recall, however, at some point when you were on the
phone sitting on the bed. Is that true?

A:  Everytime I got to the phone. The bed was next to the phone that I was
using.

Q:  Okay. So every occasion where you would get on the phone and talk to
someone about travel arrangements or whatever, you would sit on the bed.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And do you recall when you were sitting on the bed whether you
were sitting on a bedspread or bed sheets?

A:  I believe the sheets.

Q:  Okay. And would you sit on the edge of the bed?

A:  Yeah. As I said, while I was waiting sometimes I fell back on the bed.
Sometimes I was just sitting up on the bed. Whatever.

Q:  Well, when you say you were "sitting up on the bed," what do you mean
by that?

A:  Just what I said.

Q:  What does that mean, "sitting up on the bed?" You got physically on the
bed and were sitting up with your back against the headboard?

A:  Sometimes my shoulder may have been leaning up against the
headboard, yes.

Q:  Did you ever get on the bed and physically lie down?

A:  Yeah, I laid back on it a few times.

Q:   Okay. And you were sitting there, laying back, as you were waiting for
phone calls or something?

A:  No. Sometimes they had me on hold, and sometimes they were trying to
find things, you know, whatever they were doing on the other end.
Sometimes I was waiting for a call, but I don't think I sat on     the bed while
I was waiting for a call. I think it was normally when they were trying to find
flight arrangements or whatever was -- when I was actually on the phone.

Q:  Do you ever recall on any of those occasions sliding your left hand
underneath the covers?

A:  Sliding, no.

Q:  Yeah.

A:  No, no recollection of it.

Q:  Were you eventually successful in pushing all the glass into the sink, or
most of it?

A:   From what I could see, yes.

Q:  When you say, "From" -- are you talking about your recollection now?

A:   Yes.

Q:  Okay. So you have a recollection at some point of looking into the sink
and seeing most of the glass being successfully deposited into the sink?

A:  No.

Q:  What are you saying?

A:  l have a recollection of not seeing any glass that I could further injure
myself on. So when I was collecting my things, I didn't see anything.
Anything I saw, I kicked into the sink.

Q:  Okay. And when you say that you didn't see any glass at all, you are
talking about the counter top?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Do you have a specific recollection as you sit here today of putting your
toiletries inside the toiletry bag after you successfully put the glass into the
sink?

A:  I don't know if that was after or before or what. Maybe some of it was
before, some of it may have been after, but I don't have a memory as to the
exact sequence of events at that time.

Q:  Okay. Let's just focus now on packing up the toiletries and see what you
recall and what you don't recall as you sit here today. As you sit here today,
do you recall putting any toiletries into your toiletry container or luggage prior
to the glass breaking?

A:  No.

0: Do you recall putting any of the toiletries into the container that contained
the toiletries after the glass was broken?

A:  No.

Q:   Okay. And do you have a specific recollection of putting any of the
toiletries into the luggage after you cut your finger?

A:  Specifically, no.

Q:   Okay. So is it fair to say that you have no recollection at all with respect
to the sequence that we're talking about when you packed your toiletries? Is
that fair?

A:  I know that I was trying to pack it without the glass, you know. I know
it was broken around my toiletries. But specifically when I took my
deodorant or something and put it in there, I don't--  can't tell you when that
was.

Q:  Okay. So you have some recollection, however, of packing some of the
toiletries while working around the glass. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Do you know what you--

A:  Or moving the glass.

Q:  Excuse me?

A:  Or moving the glass; then putting it in, one or the other.

Q:  Do you recall what you were putting away at the time?

A:  Whatever was in my -- whatever was in my overnight bag.

Q:  Do you recall -- do you have a specific recollection of what you were
putting away at that time?

A:   Whatever was in it. Toothpaste, toothbrush.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he just asked if you have a specific
recollection. If you don't, just tell him.

THE WITNESS: Specifically, no. No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  When you cut your finger, did you look at the finger and assess whether
you thought it needed some type of sutures?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. You didn't examine it for glass?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you see any glass particle that you believe was the source of your
cut?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you look to see whether you could identify the piece of glass that cut
your finger?

A:  No.

Q:  And then you left from the hotel room and you went back downstairs. Is
that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And that's where you got the Band-Aid?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And you got on the plane and headed back home to Rockingham.
True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You mentioned in some of the -- of your  earlier testimony that you
thought you were crying on the plane. Do you remember that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Were you on First Class again going back?

A:  No.

Q:  You were in Coach?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And do you remember at what point you were crying on the
plane?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you remember how long you were crying for?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know whether anyone was sitting -- Strike that. Do you recall
whether anyone was sitting next to you as you were crying?

A:   Well, there was a guy sitting two seats over from me. I know that. A
seat over, I should say.

Q:  Okay. And did he comment to you at all as you were crying?

A:  He commented to me a few times during various times of the trip.

Q:  Well, do you have a recollection as you sit here today as to whether this
gentleman made any comment to you as you were crying, headed back from
Chicago to your home?

A:  Today, no, not specifically.

Q:  You said no, you don't recall?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You've made the statement in the past that all of Nicole's friends knew
how much you loved her. Is that true?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Have you ever made such a statement?

A:  I may have.

Q:  Okay. Is that something you believe?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is that something you also believe with respect to the Brown family?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And--

A:  At least Lou and Judy Brown, yes.

Q:  Okay. It was your belief as of June 13th that the Brown family,
specifically Judy and Lou, knew how much you loved Nicole?

A:  Yeah. I think anybody that's ever spent time with Nicole and I knew we
loved each other, yes.

Q:  Okay. And the basis for that statement is that if they spent time with you,
they would have a chance to see how you are together--how you were
together and formulate what you believe is the correct   interpretation that you
were good together. Is that true?

A:  No. You asked me about loving together.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's pretty argumentative.

THE WITNESS: I don't think there has been any doubt in Judy and Lou's
mind that Nicole and I loved each other.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. How about Denise? Do you think she had-- is it your
understanding she had the same belief?

A:  Well, I never thought about what Denise thought. Denise was never--and
I were never like close.

Q:  Okay. Did you believe that most of Nicole's friends had the same
opinion of your relationship?

A:  The people I consider her friends, yes.

Q:  Okay. That they felt you had a good relationship together?

A:  Her friends, yeah. They knew that we had our problems, but any time
you split, you got problems. But I would say if you went to her close friends,
the people who knew her over the years that spent time with us, that they
would say we had a decent relationship, yes.

Q:  Decent relationship?

A:  Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  And when you were coming back from Chicago, you attempted to
contact the Browns. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And Denise answered the phone. Correct?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And the first thing she did--one of the first things she said was to accuse
you or suggest that you were somehow responsible for the murders. Is that
true?

A:  Yeah. She was yelling, but that was the implication that I got, yes.

Q:  Okay. Did that surprise you when you heard her suggest that you were
somehow responsible for the murders?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And did it surprise you because you thought she would know, based
upon your relationship, that it's something that you could never do?

A:  Didn't surprise me for any other reason. It's just a surprise that she was
talking to me the way she was, yelling at me the way she was. It surprised
me, yes.

Q:  Did you ask her whether she had any information that was the basis for
her accusation?

A:  I couldn't. She hung up.

Q:  Did you ever say anything in response to her when she accused you or
suggested that you were somehow responsible for the murder?

A:  I couldn't. She hung up.

Q:  How long was this phone conversation?

A:  Quick.

Q:  Under five seconds?

A:  I don't know. She just was yelling, and then she hung up.

Q:  And did you ever have occasion to--did you have a chance to deny to
Denise that you were responsible for the death of Nicole?

A:  She hung up. I couldn't say anything.

Q:  Did you ever call back after she hung up?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Was that on the same plane flight?

A:  Maybe not. I talked to Judy, I believe. May have been Lou.

Q:  When you heard this comment from Denise, were you at all concerned
that somehow Lou or Judy shared the same view: That you were somehow
responsible for the death of Nicole?

A:  I didn't give it any thought.

Q:  Did you ever attempt on the flight back to find out whether they shared
that view?

A:  No.

Q:  Who were the good friends of Nicole that you believe felt that you and
Nicole had a strong relationship?

A:  When you say "strong relationship," they knew that we loved each other.
I don't think there's any doubt that Nicole and I loved each other. Even when
we were apart, we always said we loved each other.

But the people who I think were her good friends were Suzie Rehoe over the
years, Pam Schwartz, Cora Fishman. I would say of all of her friends, the
ones that were her friends for years and were still   her friends at her death,
that these were the people who probably knew her best and knew her longest.

Q:  So the three women that you identified would be the people--the friends
that would come to mind of Nicole's that would have some knowledge of the
quality of your relationship?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that it was a good relationship?

A:  Yes, for the most part, yes.

Q:  And that you loved one another?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Cora Fishman ever suggest to you that you were responsible for the
death of Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:  She ever ask you whether you were responsible for the death?

A:  No.

Q:  She ever ask you whether you had any knowledge--

A:  She might have asked me. Not then, but maybe later on, but I'm not
sure. l can't answer that question. She may have asked me later on.

Q:  Do you have a recollection as you sit here today of some conversation or
discussion with Cora where this topic came up, your possible involvement in
these murders?

A:  I think when I was in jail, I may have talked to Cora once when I--on the
phone.

Q:  Okay.

A:  And she may said, "You didn't do this, and I said, No, and then we
talked about whatever there was, you know.

Q:  And did you call or her or did she call you?

A:  No. I had to call. I had to make the calls.

Q:  Okay. And you remember having a discussion where she said something
to the effect that you didn't do this?

A:  She may have said, OJ. you didn't do this, did you?" or something to
that effect.

Q:  OJ. you didn't do this, question mark?

A:  I can't quote it. That was the gist, I believe, of what she asked.

Q:  Okay. Well, what I am trying to discern, it was a question as opposed to
a statement.

A:  Yes.

Q:  True?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And given your understanding of what she knew of your relationship,
were you surprised that she would even ask you the question?

A:  No.

Q:  You weren't surprised?

A:  No.

Q:  And were you not surprised because of information that had come out
implicating your involvement in the murders?

A:  No.

Q:  Was what the reason why you weren't surprised?

A:  Because I was in jail and accused by the prosecution of committing this
crime.

Q:  So by the mere fact that you were in jail and accused--

A:  The mere fact?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Mere fact? If you're in jail for 15 months, it
wouldn't be a mere fact, I can assure you of that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, did you know at the time you were going to be in jail for 15
months when you had this discussion with Cora Fishman?

A:  I was in jail.

Q:  Okay. How long had you been in jail at the time you had the discussion
with her?

A:  Maybe three, four months.

Q:  Okay. Had the prosecution already begun?

A:  I don't know. When you say, "Had the prosecution, they had arrested
me and they had me in jail.

Q:  Let me ask it differently: Had you already gone through a preliminary
hearing?

A:  I don't recall. I believe so.

Q:  You believe you had already gone through the preliminary hearing at the
time you had this conversation with Cora?

A:  I believe it was three or four months into my incarceration, so that would
have been--I believe that would have been after any hearing.

Q:  Was this the first time that you had spoken with Cora after the murders?

A:  Other than commiserating with one another at the wake, I believe,
yes.

Q:  Okay. So you had a brief discussion at the wake. Right?

A:  Well, it wasn't a discussion. She was crying and I was hugging her, and
she was, you know--and it was more of a commiseration, you know,
whatever you say at times like that to one another.

Q:  Okay. Other than that occasion that you just described, this was the
second occasion where you had a discussion with Cora Fishman?

A:  This was the first occasion I had a discussion with Cora Fishman, yes.

Q:  And did you call her specifically to discuss your alleged involvement in
the murders?

A:  I believe I called her just to find out what had--what was going on. I may
have asked her what had been going on.

Q:  What do you mean by that?

A:  I felt I was out of the mix as what was going on with the girls, you
know, at that time, and I was--you know, I was, like everybody else, trying
to find out what was going on.

Q:  Well, did you call Cora because you wanted to find out what she would
say if she testified?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you want to find out what she recalled about your relationship with
Nicole?

A:  You know what I wanted? I remember specifically. I wanted to make
sure that I wasn't deluded, and I think I may have said this to her, because --
this may have been a lot more than three or four months, because I know
things were coming out that Faye Resnick had been saying, and what I
wanted--I just wanted to hear someone say that the Nicole that I knew--that I
wasn't this far off base, that the Nicole I knew wasn't the person that I was
hearing. And some of the things that I was hearing at that time I wasn't
buying, and I just needed to hear from someone who I felt was a friend of
Nicole's have the same--you know, that we were talking about the same
person.

Q:  Was the impetus behind your call to Cora the information that had come
out in Faye's book?

A:  I believe so. I know it was just a lot of--and most of the negative stuff I
heard was from Faye's book or, you know, Faye was saying, and it was just
disillusioning.

Q:  And the negative information that you're referring to in Faye's book was
information that relates to you beating Nicole?

A:  No, no. It was about things that Nicole--this Brentwood hello and all of
this horrible stuff that was just not Nicole, just not the  Nicole that I knew.

Q:  I missed that one. The Brentwood hello"?

A:  Yeah. Read the book. You'll know what it is. I'm not going to discuss
it.

Q:  Was any purpose behind your call to Cora to try to corroborate or check
claims by Faye Resnick in her book relative to your battering of Nicole?

A:  No. No.

Q:  None whatsoever?

A:  None whatsoever.

Q:  Didn't come up in the conversation?

A:  For what reason? There was never any battering of Nicole other than
'89, and Faye was--four years before she came into our lives, so whatever
Faye would say on that area would not know.

Q:  You asked Cora whether Nicole had said anything to her about these
alleged incidents. Did you ask her something like that?

A:  No. Nicole and I had one incident. That was in '89. I knew Cora knew
about that, so there was no reason for me to talk about that.

Q:  So you deny that there was any discussion between you and Cora at that
time regarding alleged incidents of spousal abuse. True?

A:  There was none.

Q:  You were present when Mr. Kaelin testified. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you remember his description of the bag that was behind your
Bentley?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you remember him describing it as kind of a knapsack?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you own a knapsack similar to what Mr. Kaelin described?

A:  No.

Q:  Have you ever?

A:  A book bag, no.

Q:  Not a book bag. Anything that's reasonably similar to the description of
the bag that Mr. Kaelin gave at his deposition.

A:  Well, his description was much like the bag that we saw in the picture.

Q:  Okay. He described something like a college book bag or something of
that nature. Do you recall that?

A:  Yeah. but I don't--the backpack things, I've never owned one, no. My
kids have, but I haven't.

Q:  Well, when you say your "kids have, did they have one at your residence
at Rockingham as of June 12, 1994?

A:  I doubt it, but they may have.

Q:  It's possible that one was around the premises?

A:  It's possible.

Q:  Do you have a recollection as you sit here today of seeing one around the
premises on or before June 12th, 1994?

MR. PETROCELLI: What is it we're talking about?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: He is talking about--

THE WITNESS: Kind of a backpack.

MR. PETROCELLI: A backpack that mounts on the back.

MR. BREWER: Right.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You have a recollection of seeing that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Where do you recall seeing one of those?

A:  On my kids' backs, in my kitchen, in their rooms. Whenever they're
going to school, that's what they carried.

Q:  When is the last time you have a recollection of seeing a backpack similar
to what you just described?

A:  Specifically, I can't say.

Q:  Do you know whether your kids had one in their rooms at Rocking-
ham?

A:  No.

Q:  When you say you've seen one in the kitchen, was there a backpack of
that type that was stored in the kitchen?

A:  No, but whenever they came in from school, that's where they dumped
everything: In the kitchen.

Q:  Talking about just temporarily sitting on the counter top?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Mr. Kaelin also described an outfit that you were wearing that included --
he used the term jogging suit or something of that nature, that had a white
zipper down the front. Do you recall that description?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you own a jogging suit or a jogging top that's similar to the
description that Mr. Kaelin provided?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you own any garment that has a white zipper down the front?

A:  I don't know.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: In a dark background, I take it.

MR. BREWER: No.

Q:  Let's just talk about the white zipper. Do you own any garment that has a
white zipper down the front?

A:  I don't know. I would have to look at all my things--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I mean, you mean--

THE WITNESS:-- and see if something has a white zipper.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Pardon me. You mean something that not--a jacket
may have a white zipper, a windbreaker, I mean, anything. Is that--

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  I want to include that. I want to include a windbreaker or a jacket or
something that you would put on your upper body, and this is as of June 12,
1994, that has a white zipper down the front.

A:  I may have, but I have no--I'd have to look at all my clothes and see.

Q:  Well, do you have a specific recollection as you sit here today of owning
such a garment?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you have a closet downstairs where you keep jackets like that?

A:  No.

Q:  All of your clothes would be kept upstairs in your bedroom?

A:  Yeah. I may have some things in my entry closet that I just had her put in
there because of this cold weather, but my things are normally kept upstairs in
my closet.

Q:  Okay. When you say I...have some things in my entry closet that I had
her put in there," are you talking about asking Gigi or someone?

A:  Yes.Yes.

Q:  Is that something you did recently?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. As of June  994, did you store any jackets or garments in your
entryway closet?

A:  I mean, coming in from being out, sometimes maybe temporarily I may
have put something in there, but basically my stuff is kept in my closet.

Q:  When you heard Mr. Kaelin describing the garment that he observed
you in, did you know what garment he was talking about?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Did you believe he was mistaken when he was describing a
garment that you wore to McDonald's having a white zipper?

A:  I knew he was mistaken.

Q:  Okay. And why did you know that?

A:  Because I knew that's not what I had on.

Q:  Okay. Because you knew you were wearing a different type of garment?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Had you worn anything that entire day that resembled the garment that
was described by Mr. Kaelin in his deposition?

A:  You know, I can't say yes or no because I can't--the way he talks, I
don't know what he perceives when he sees things, you know, so I can't say.

Q:  Well, he described something fairly specifically: A jogging top or
jogging suit with a white zipper. My question to you is: At any time on the
12th do you recall wearing anything that fit that description?

A:  Jogging stuff, no.

Q:  Well, any type of upper-body garment, whether it be a windbreaker,
jacket, jogging suit, with a white zipper. Anything that's similar to that?

A:  I don't know if it had a white zipper, but I had on a jacket, yeah.

Q:  And what color was the jacket that you had on?

A:  Blue.

Q:  And when did you put that jacket on?

A:  To go to McDonald's.

Q:  Okay. Does that--Do you believe that may have a white zipper?

A:  Doesn't seem like it does, but it could have.

Q:  Okay. So as you sit here today, we're not clear one way or the other
whether it has a white zipper. Right?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Is it a windbreaker?

A:  I think it could be used as a windbreaker, yes.

Q:  Okay. Well, can you describe--When I say "windbreaker, I'm talking
about kind of like the polyester-type material. Is that what this material is
made out of, or cotton or some other material?

A:  I'm sure it's cotton.

Q:  Okay. So it's a soft cotton material?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And is it a jacket that you put on or--

A:  Yes.

Q:  It's like a sweat jacket?

A:  No.

Q:  Well, what is its purpose? I mean, help us with this.

A:  When you play golf, if it's a windy day or maybe you get a little rainy,
you would put this on.

Q:  I see. So it kind of keeps you warm but has--makes--you're able still to
swing a golf club?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is it something that you've purchased at a golf course?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Do you know where you got it?

A:  No.

Q:  Did it have any particular insignias on it, Riviera" or anything of that
nature?

A:  No.

Q:  And it was a zipper in the front?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And so you could zip it up if you wanted to make yourself
warmer, theoretically?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And was it dark blue or light blue?

A:  Little lighter, lighter than what you have on, but, you know. blue. It
wasn't ocean, it wasn't aqua blue. but blue.

Q:   This to me is a dark blue suit (Indicating). Is that--

A:  A little lighter than that.

Q:   Little lighter than that?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay. It wasn't as light as sky blue, was it?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Somewhere between dark blue and sky blue?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And where did you get that jacket from?

A:  What do you mean?

Q:  Well, did you get it from your closet?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Upstairs?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And is the first time that you recall putting it on that day prior to going to
McDonald's?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And were you also wearing dark blue pants at that time?

A:  My golf pants, yes.

Q:  Okay. Those were dark blue. Right?

A:  Yeah.Yeah.

Q:  And so if you had this jacket zipped up, you would have had dark blue
pants on and a somewhat of a dark blue top on. Correct?

A:  Correct.

Q:  And you don't recall the color of your shirt. Right?

A:  No.

Q:  And is that basically how you were attired when you went to
McDonald's?

A:Yes.

Q:  Okay. And when you got back from McDonald's, did you take that
jacket off?

A:Yes.

Q:  I am going to call it a jacket, so we are clear. Okay?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Do you recall what you did with that jacket?

A:  Hung it up in my closet.

Q:  Okay. And did you put it on hanger?

A:  Probably, yes.

Q:  Okay. Still have it today?

A:Yes.

Q:  And if we asked you to go in your closet and locate it and identify it, you
would be able to do that?

A:  Maybe. Depending if I can get it back. You guys keep all my things. I
showed it to Detective Lange, and he didn't find it interesting.

Q:  Well, I am not sure I understand what you're saying. Are you concerned
about us taking possession of it?

A:  Yes. I said I can't get nothing back from you guys.

Q:  Assuming we didn't do that, you'd be able to go in your closet and locate
that jacket--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: He wouldn't do it unless you get a court order, I
can assure you.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  Well, let's assume that in a perfect world we got a court order, and Mr.
Baker was in a good mood that day and actually allowed us to go in and get
that jacket.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I wouldn't even allow you on the property, so I am
not going to allow you to go in the closet.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  Would you be able to locate that jacket, Mr. Simpson?

A:Yes.

Q:  And when is the last time you looked at that jacket?

A:  Maybe yesterday. I may have wore it yesterday.

Q:  Do you have a recollection of wearing it yesterday?

A:  Not really, but I know I wear it a lot. I even wore it here one day.

Q:  It's one of your favorite jackets?

A:  No. It's just a windbreaker. It's a good windbreaker, like this jacket I
have with me (Indicating).

Q:  Okay. We would ask that you preserve it and not discard it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to take any advice, legal or
otherwise.

MR.BREWER:

Q:  We are going to ask that you preserve it.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've asked.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  How about the pants that you were wearing when you went to
McDonald's? Do you remember what you did with those pants?

A:  I think I laid them in the bathroom.

Q:  Did you hang them up?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you tell the detectives that you hung them up?

A:  No.

Q:  If you did, would that be inaccurate?

A:  I took them and showed them to him. I think they were still there the next
day. After they took all their pictures, they were still in there.

Q:  Who did you show them to? Detective Lange?

A:  Lange, yes.

Q:  And you said, These are the pants that I wore last night"?

A:  Yeah, "Those there are the pants that I wore last night.

Q:  Okay. When you say those there"--

A:  Well, he was with me with Bob Kardashian and Skip Taft, and we went
into my closet, and we came out and walked into my bathroom.

Q:  Okay. And when you said. "those there, you were in the bathroom when
you pointed them out?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay. And where were they located in the bathroom?

A:  They were laying across the tub. They had evidently emptied my hamper
and laid a lot of other stuff out.

Q:  And you have a number of pants that are similar to the pants that you
showed Detective Lange, don't you?

A:  Yes.

Q:  I believe they're Bugle Boy or something like that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you get those for free, don't you?

A:  Yeah, I got a lot of them for free. I bought them before I started getting
them for free, yes.

Q:  Okay. And you have a lot of pants in the same color as the ones that you
showed Detective Lange?

A:  Not anymore, but I did.

Q:  At the time?

A:  Yes.

Q:  More than 10 pair, for example?

A:  The same color?

Q:  Same color.

A:  No. No. No.

Q:  More than three pair?

A:  No, maybe two or three pair.

Q:  So you had two or three pair that were the same color as the pants that
you showed Detective Lange on the 13th?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  You know the gentleman that you told us about who was on the plane
next to you when you were--there were occasions when you were crying?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, that's the guy -- There was apparently a seat
between them.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. The one that we talked about, the person that was next to you with
the seat in between.

A:  Do I know him?

Q:  No. Do you remember that, that --

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did that person--do you know that person's name?

A:  Well, I saw him in court, but l can't tell you his name right now.

Q:  Okay. Did he sit in that same seat all the way back from Chicago?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that was a five-, six-hour flight, roughly?

A:  No. I would say about a four-hour flight, four to five maybe.

Q:  Okay. And so you were basically sitting roughly in the same position
next to him for about four or five hours?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Mr. Simpson, have you ever seen the location of the socks that were
found by the Los Angeles Police Department?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What do you mean by that?

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  The location of your socks when they were found by the Los Angeles
Police Department on the carpet.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Do you mean has he ever seen a picture of where
they say they were found, or was he ever in the room after he got back on the
13th and saw the socks in his bedroom where the police say they were found?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, since you did that, let me just ask a different question: Do you
remember where you left your socks after you took them off?

A:  Specifically, no, but I would have put them either in my shoes or in my
dirty clothes hamper, one or the other.

Q:  And that would be under ordinary, normal circumstances. Right?

A:  That's virtually all the time, yeah.

Q:  Okay. And that's because you're a very neat person. Right?

A:  Basically, yeah.

Q:  So unless something unusual is happening, you would always put your
socks away and hang up your pants and hang up your shirts and things like
that. Right?

A:  That's what I did all the time, yes.

Q:  Okay. Now, have you ever seen a photograph that was actually
introduced into evidence at the time of your criminal trial by the prosecution
that depicted the location where the police indicated   or claimed that they
found your socks?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And do you recall whether you left your socks on the carpet in front of
your bed when you undressed on the evening of June l2, 1994?

A:  No, I wouldn't have, no.

Q:  Okay. When you say you wouldn't have, do you have a specific
recollection as you sit here today of taking your socks off and doing
something with them specifically?

A:  I have a specific recollection of undressing in my closet, yes.

Q:  Okay. Well, do you have a specific recollection as you sit here today of
taking off your socks?

A:  I specifically remember undressing in my closet. That's where I always
undress, there or my bathroom. That night I specifically remember undressing
in my closet because I was also getting   redressed in my closet.

Q:  Well, I am being a little bit more specific than just undressing. I am
focusing on a particular piece of apparel. Do you have a specific recollection
of taking off your socks as you were undressing the evening of June 12,
1994?

A:  I specifically recall totally undressing in my closet. I specifically recall
putting on my white socks in my closet.

Q:  Okay. And taking off your other socks while you were in your closet?

A:  Well, evidently I took them off, but I do specifically recall undressing in
my closet, yes.

Q:  And when you say evidently took them off," is it fair to say that you
don't have a specific recollection of actually taking them off as you sit here
today testifying?

A:  Well, I know I didn't have the socks on underneath white socks, so I
knew I took them off in the closet, yes.

Q:  You know, I am just asking what your recollection is. I mean, there are
certain inferences that you can draw, but I am just asking what you remember
as you sit here today.

A:  I remember other than my underwear totally undressing in my bath -- in
my closet and putting on other things in my closet except for my pants,
because I had to go in my bathroom to put them on.

Q:  Okay. So in your mind's eye can you envision as you sit here today
reaching down and pulling off your socks?

A:  I just remember undressing, don't remember, my mind's eye, unzipping
my pants, but I knew in my closet is where I changed, and  I specifically
recall doing that.

Q:  And putting white socks on?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And that was done inside your closet?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And as you sit here today, do you specifically recall exactly what you did
with your black socks?

A:  I either put them in my shoes, which is what I believe I did, or if they
were really dirty, I normally would throw them in the clothes--the hamper. So
they should have been in my shoes.

Q:  Okay. Now, you've indicated what you normally do and what you
believe you did. What do you recall if anything, doing relative to those socks
after you took them off?

A:  I believe--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you have no recollection--

THE WITNESS: I have no recollection.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  That's all I am asking for.

A:  I have no recollection.

Q:  Okay. So as you sit here today. you don't have a specific recollection of
what you did with the socks after you took them off. Is that a fair statement?

A:  I put them in my shoes, I'm pretty sure. If they were dirty, I would have
put them in the hamper, but I'm pretty sure I put them in my shoes.

Q:  Now, Mr. Simpson, do you have a recollection of what you did with the
socks?

A:  Other than taking them off in my closet, no.

MR. BREWER: Okay. Want to take five minutes?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Sure.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:30.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:49.

BY MR. BREWER:
Q:  Mr. Simpson, you indicated in earlier testimony that after you returned
from Chicago, you decided to go over to Bob Kardashian's house and spend
the night. Do you recall that testimony?

A:  Well, when I--yes. Yes.

Q:  Was that on the 13th or the 14th?

A:  That was the 13th.

Q:  13th?

A:  I believe so. No, it may have been the 14th. My days are confused. 14th.

Q:  Okay.

A:  On the 14th.

Q:  When you got back from the police station after giving your statement,
you basically stayed the rest of the day and evening of the 13th at your home.
Is that true?

A:  What was left of it, yes.

Q:  Okay. And do you recall approximately what time you got back?

A:  It was 5:30, 6:00 o'clock.

Q:  Okay. And there were a number of friends that had come by. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q:  And you spent much of that time watching television?

A:  I don't know about much. I spent an hour or two I believe watching TV,
and then I went up to my bedroom. I was exhausted.

Q:  Okay. And you spent the hour or two watching various news reports.
Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And is this the occasion where you heard the Avila news report:
On the 13th when you got back to your house?

A:  I don't recall. It was that week; I know that, but I don't know if it was
really that day or not.

Q:  Do you recall at some point hearing or learning, again other than
conversations you had with your attorneys, that the police suspected that the
murderer who dropped blood at the crime scene had cut his or her left
extremity?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  Did you ever hear that?

A:  In court.

Q:  Was that the first time you ever heard that?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  You recall some--Strike that. You have some recollection of hearing
court testimony wherein people testified that or    theorized that the killer had
cut himself on the left extremity as they were leaving because they were
dripping blood as they were leaving the murder site?

A:  There was--I think at one point that was a theory, one of the theories,
yes.

Q:  Okay.

A:  Or something to that effect. I can't tell you specifically, but I believe that
was one of the theories.

Q:  And do you remember in connection with that theory the notion that the
blood drops were located to the left of the bloody footprints?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am going to object and instruct him not to
answer. What he learned in court is irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in
this case.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  Well, let me just ask: Have you heard that at any point?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, if you heard it after-- No. I am going to
instruct him not to answer that.

MR. BREWER: Well, I don't think it's irrelevant because it may also
explain why there is a change in his police statement.

Q:  Have you heard that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  Were you ever--Strike that. Did you ever think about the idea that you
had cut your left finger and that there were reports that the murderer was
bleeding from his left extremity as he was
leaving the murder scene?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  On the 13th after you watched TV for about an hour or an hour and a
half, you went upstairs. Is that right?

A:  Yeah, whatever time it was. I don't think I used hour and a half, but
whatever time I watched TV, then I went upstairs, yes.

Q:  Do you have an estimate how long you watched TV for?

A:  Could have been a few hours.

Q:  Do you recall people screaming at the TV or yelling at the TV upon
hearing various news reports?

A:  Yelling at the TV?

Q:  Well, saying something to the TV to the effect that That's not true " or, oj
you know, "That's  false," things of that nature?

A:  People, no.


Q:  Okay. Did you hear anyone say anything in response to a news report
that implied that the news report was false?

A:  I can't recall.

Q:  Okay. And when you went upstairs, did you then fall asleep?

A:  I think I was asleep and awake and asleep and awake throughout the
night, yes.

Q:  Okay. And you don't recall any discussion, after you went upstairs, with
Ron Shipp?

A:  No.

Q:  When you say you don't recall, is it possible you had a conversation
with him and you don't recall the conversation?

A:  Everybody--not everybody, but numerous people I recall came up to say
good night to me, that they were leaving, and he could have been one of those
people.

Q:  Okay. Do you have a recollection as you sit here today of Ron Shipp
coming into your bedroom?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you have a conversation--Strike that. Do you have a recollection as
you sit here today of talking with Ron Shipp while you were upstairs?

A:  No.

Q:   Do you have a recollection as you sit here today of having any
conversation at all with Ron Shipp as of June 13?

A:   I knew he was there and like everyone else, you know, they spoke to
me from time to time, and I knew he was there.

Q:  Okay. Do you have a recollection as you sit here today having some
conversation with Mr. Shipp?

A:  Well, I knew he spoke to me, I knew he hugged me at one point, so I
kinda recall that.

Q:  Okay. When you say "he spoke" to you, do you have a recollection of
the subject matter of the conversation that you had?

A:  Other than condolences and stuff like that, no.

Q:  Okay. You recall specifically Mr. Shipp  giving -- extending some
condolences to you?

A:  Specifically everybody was, so maybe I'm assuming that he did, but
everybody was.

Q:  Don t assume for the purpose of my question.

A:  Okay.

Q:  I want to know what you have a recollection of.

A:  Okay.

Q:  As you sit here today, do you have recollection of anything that you
talked about with  Ron Shipp on June 13, 1994?

A:   Specifically what we talked about, no.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall talking to him at about DNA?

A:  No.

Q:   Do you recall talking to him about polygraphs?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall talking to him about dreams that you had of  killing Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well -- Go ahead.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Do you recall having any conversations at all concerning dreams?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall having any conversations with Mr. Shipp at all concerning
thoughts that you had about killing Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:   With respect to the events of June l2th that we have gone through and
you've gone through for some period of time, are there any periods of time
for like an hour or longer where you have absolutely no  memory of what you
did, where you blacked out?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean while he was asleep on the airplane?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   No, forget about sleeping. Where you were awake, alert, where you
believe you may have blacked out for some reason.

A:  I know I was always awake. I don't know how alert I was, but I was
certainly awake all -- you know.

Q:  Okay. l am not talking about when you're asleep. I am just talking about
-- let's just take the 12th, for example. Do you recall -- after 6:00 o'clock,
between 6:00 and 12:00 on June 12. Do    you recall any occasions where you
just blacked out for an hour, where you just don't remember what you did for
a solid hour?

A:  For an hour? No, I don't think so. I think I may have--when I first got
back, maybe from 2:00 to 5:00 I may have dozed once in a while, but I'm not
sure because I was reading my book and the TV was     on, and I may have
dozed during that period of time.

Q:   In the five years before Nicole's death, do you recall any occasions
where you became so angry with her or under any circumstances where you
simply  blacked out a particular event?

A:  No.

Q:   Has that ever happened to you in any context, where you have lost your
memory for an appreciable period of time?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can answer it within a five-year span.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Yeah, within a five-year span.

THE WITNESS: Within a five-year span?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: No. not within a five-year span, no.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, has that ever happened?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, don't answer that. That's too remote to be of
any--

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, say within 10 years?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: Ten years, no.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: Oh, sorry.

MR. PETROCELLI: You are a potted plant.

MR. BREWER: Why is that irrelevant if he is implying that there may be--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: If he answers--

MR. BREWER: If he has a systemic condition that somehow causes him to
have memory loss or blackouts--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Really?

MR. BREWER: Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Thank you, Doctor, thank you very much. The last
time I heard you got a medical degree will be the next time, and he is not
going to answer the question.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Let me ask it this way: Do you have to your knowledge any medical
condition that causes you to have a memory loss?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of that causes you
to have a diminished capacity to recall significant events?

A:  A medical condition that I have? No.

Q:   Did you sleep the entire evening of the l3th into the l4th, the best you
recall?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Other than what he just testified to, that he was
awake and asleep and awake and asleep?

THE WITNESS: I was up -- I was awake and asleep and awake and asleep.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Did you have any conversations with anyone on the morning, say
between 12:00 o'clock p.m. and 6:00 o'clock a.m. on the -- between the 13th
and 14th?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know what you mean by  12:00 o'clock
p.m. Do you mean midnight and 6:00 a.m.?

MR. BREWER: Yeah. Very good.

THE WITNESS: Conversations, no. My sister -- I may have had a word
with my sister during that period of time, but it wouldn't have been a
conversation.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Didn't talk to anyone on the telephone?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. The following day, on the 14th, you've already described a trip
that you took with Mr. Kardashian to get your golf clubs. Right?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he described a trip and--

THE WITNESS: And then during the course of the trip, we also got--during
the course of driving  around, we did pick up my golf clubs.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Okay. I am not going to go back through it. I just want to highlight the
fact that you've already testified about that. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Do you recall what else you did that day, not just--Strike that. Do
you recall what time you left Kardashian's house?

A:  When?

Q:  On the morning of the 14th.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Left Kardashian's house on the morning of the
14th?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Well, did you leave Kardashian's house on the morning of the 14th or
your house to go get the golf clubs?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, he didn't leave from either house--

THE WITNESS: Not on the 14th. No. No. No is the answer.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Where did you meet up with Mr. Kardashian on the 14th?

A:   At my house.

Q:  Okay. Did you leave from your house with him?

A:   Yes.

Q:  And is that when you went to Nicole's and ultimately went down and got
the golf clubs?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. Where did you go initially?

A:  My office .

Q:  And then you went from your office to?

A:  To--well, when we left my office, we were waiting for my kids, and we
drove by Nicole's.

Q:  Okay. And then you went to the airport.

A:  Well, then we drove, and then during the course of driving around we
did stop at the airport, yes.

Q:  And then did you go back to Kardashian's?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did you spend the rest of the day there?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did you go anywhere else that day?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. You slept there that evening?

A:  Yes.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Were you here the first five days?

MR.BREWER: Is that a question? Statement?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think you're being an asshole.

MR. BREWER: Well, that's two of you.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You're next, Dan.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You bet.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Now going to the 15th, you saw Dr. Huizenga for an examination.
Right?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Okay. And when you saw Dr. Huizenga for an examination, did you fill
out a history?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Okay. And did you also have any X rays taken?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  You mentioned earlier you thought you had some blood withdrawn?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And that was the same day as the wake: On the 15th. Correct?

A:  l believe so.

Q:  Now, after the murder of Nicole, you  offered--you made an offer, a
public offer of half a million dollars, I believe, for any information leading to
the names or identities of individuals involved in the murders. Is that correct?

A:  l believe so.

Q:   Do you recall when you first made that offer?

A:  No

Q:  Is that something that you came up with on your own?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. We are not going to get into any
more questions about that. Or you can go into all the questions you want; he's
not going to answer.

MR. BREWER: Okay.

Q:  Do you recall how information was processed in connection with this
offer?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Do you know whether anyone called in with information that implicated
you in the murders?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Do you know whether anyone called in with information that implicated
anyone else in the murders?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: And don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Do you know whether any information has been stored or preserved
relative to leads or information that came in?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

MR. BREWER: On what grounds, Mr. Baker?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in this
case.

MR. BREWER: Okay. Relevancy?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You're not taking my depo.

MR. BREWER: I just want to know the basis for your objection.

Q:  When Mr. Kaelin testified at his deposition, he described a process
where you and he went to the eastern -- one of you went to the eastern portion
of the pathway or in that direction and the    other to the western portion of the
pathway to look back behind you. Do you recall that?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall any occasion on the 12th where you and Mr. Kaelin agreed
that you would go around to the pathway and look down there to see what
was the source of the noises that he described to you?

A:  Yeah, I recall us talking about that. Me making that suggestion, that is.

Q:  You made that suggestion?

A:  I believe so.

Q:  Do you recall ever actually moving towards -- making any affirmative
effort to move towards the pathway to look down to see whether you could
determine the origin of the noises that he described?

A:  I tried at one point when I was coming back from the Bronco. I did look,
but it was dark, and that's when we talked about getting a flashlight.

Q:  This is when you went out to the Bronco--

A:  Yeah, and I was coming back, and they were -- I guess they were talking
about flashlights at the time.

Q:  Okay. Just so my question is on the record, this is when you went out to
the Bronco to get the telephone case?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then on your way back, you went over and made some effort to
look up the pathway?

A:   No. As I was walking back, l could see it was dark there, and I said,
"well, let's" -- "you go one way and I'll go around the other way.' It was at
the time -- Yes. I said, "You go one way and I'll   go the other way," and
that's when he made a comment about flashlights, and that's what initiated all
the flashlight stuff.

Q:  Okay. Going inside and looking for the flashlight?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And after that, other than making a comment, did you ever then go to
either side of the pathway to look down to see whether you could   determine
the origin of the noises that he referred to?

A:  We never found the flashlight, and I had to go.

Q:  Did you make two trips to the Bronco at the time that the limo was in the
driveway?

A:  No.

Q:  Just one trip?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And this was on the trip back from the Bronco, so we're clear.
Right?

A:  When I was coming back from the Bronco, he was standing --they were
like in the front there. I can't tell you exactly where they were. Kato was still
talking about going around the side, and as I was coming back, I was talking
to him, and I said something about, "You go one way and I'll go the other
way," and that's when I became aware that there was a real flashlight
problem.

Q:   Okay. And then after you went through the flashlight episode, trying to
locate a flashlight, you came out and got into the limousine?

A:  Got directly into the limo.

Q:  The '89 incident that you've described in some detail during the course
of this deposition, you indicated that that altercation or the "harassing," as
you've described it, was basically an effort on your part to get Nicole out of
the bedroom. Is that fair?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Did you ever rassle her and attempt to get her out of the house?

A:  No. She actually ran out of the house. No, I didn't rassle her to get her
out of the house.

Q:  Okay. There were a couple episodes where she came into the bedroom
and you rassled and got her out, and then she came back in and you rassled to
get her out again. Is that correct?

A:  There was only one episode of that.

Q:  There was only one?

A:  Yeah. She went out and I locked the door at one point, but she got a key
and got in.

Q:  Okay. Did the altercation start inside the bedroom?

A:  Yeah. It started with me. I was in bed,  and she came to the bed.

Q:  Okay. Did it start with the conversation and escalate to an argument and
escalate further to an altercation?

A:  Yeah, I believe. I don't know a conversation, but it started -- pretty much
started off as an argument.

Q:  Just started right off with somebody arguing?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  Okay. Did she start it?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And you got her out initially by rassling?

A:  Initially.

Q:  She came back in, and then you got her out again. Is that correct?

A:  No, that's not what I said at all.

Q:  Okay. How am I wrong?

A:   She went out. I locked the door. She evidently went downstairs and got
a key and came back in, and that's when the wrestling portion--

Q:   I see.

A:  --the physical portion, began.

Q:  I see. And then the wrestling was basically inside your bedroom then?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then you eventually were able to get her outside of the bedroom?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you lock the door?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And then you have some understanding that she left the house at that
point?

A:  I saw her leave the house.

Q:  Okay. How did you see her leave the house?

A:  I came downstairs at one point because my alarm went blank, and she
was smoking a cigarette at the back door, and when she saw me, she went out
back.

Q:   When your "alarm went blank," what do you mean by that?

A:  You know, if a door or something is open, it goes blank, no color at all.
Green if it's off and not engaged, red if it's engaged, and nothing if there's a
door open or something.

Q:  So the alarm, was it deactivated?

A:  Yeah. Yeah.

Q:  You mean she pushed in the code and deactivated the alarm?

A:  I don't know, but the--there was a door open somewhere, something
was open somewhere, and the alarm signal showed that.

Q:  Well, what I am trying to find out is: Was the door open during the
period where the alarm was activated, or was the alarm deactivated and then
the door was --

A:  I don't recall. I just know that when I noticed, that there was a door open
somewhere.

Q:   Doesn't your alarm have an audible noise that is made if a there is a door
open during an activated period?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. Did you hear any noises?

A:  No. As I said, I looked at one point and saw that there was a door open
somewhere.

Q:  Okay. And then you went downstairs, and that's when you saw her
leave?

A:  Well, she saw me, and she was smoking a cigarette, and then she ran out
the back door.

Q:  Okay. Were you coming towards her when she ran out the book door?

A:  When I saw her, I wasn't really coming towards her. I was just trying to
observe things. And when she went out the back door, I went upstairs and
got a robe, and then I came out and went out the    back door.

Q:  As you were coming towards her downstairs, were you just walking
towards her?

A:  As I told you, when I saw her, she went out the back door and I went
upstairs and got a robe, and then I came back downstairs and went out the
back door.

Q:  Before she left the back door, did you say anything to her?

A:   No.

Q:  Were you yelling at her?

A:  No.

Q:  And when she went outside, you went upstairs and got your robe and
came back downstairs?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you have any further altercation outside?

A:  No. I didn't see her outside.

Q:  Do you know whether she slipped and fell outside?

A:  She wouldn't have at that point, because when I did see her, she didn't
have mud on her.

Q:   I'm sorry?

A:  She wouldn't have at that point, because I never saw her with mud on
her until I saw the pictures.

Q:  Okay. Do you know how she got the mud on her that you indicated was
depicted in the photographs?

A:  I know what was told later.

Q:   And what's your understanding of what was told?

A:  That when she was running out of Michelle's room, she fell.

Q:  Did you ever see her go to Michelle's room?

A:  I saw her in Michelle's room.

Q:   Okay. And did you see her run from Michelle's room.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you see her fall?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know where she fell or where she allegedly fell?

A:  No.

Q:   During any of the rassling that you were engaged in during the '89
incident, did you ever take her face and push it into a wall?

A:  No.

Q:   Did you ever push it into a door?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ever take her face and push it into the floor?

A:   No.

Q:  Was the altercation that you had  with her always on a carpet?

A:  Well, it's only carpet in that -- well, in her -- I believe so. I don't know if
we got into  her bathroom at all, because as you get to the door, she has a
hard floor there. But, yeah, there's carpet  throughout the house. I would
think so.

Q:   Do you recall any of the altercation occurring on that hard floor that
you've described?

A:  No. No. It could have, could not have. I really don't recall.

Q:   Do you know--Strike that. Do you have any information that any of the
bruises that were apparent after the '89 incident  were self-inflicted by Nicole?

A:  No.

Q:   And you've indicated on a number of occasions that you have taken
responsibility for those bruises. Is that correct?

A:  That's correct.

Q:   And do you mean by that statement that you have taken responsibility
that you caused them?

A:  If I caused them or if they happened when she fell. I think was the
genesis of it all. So if it happened anywhere, I take responsibility for it.

Q:  Do you have any information that any bruise on her face was caused
when she fell?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know if she struck her face when she fell?

A:  No.

Q:   Was she on the grass or the driveway when she fell?

A:  I don't know. I didn't see.

Q:  Have you ever seen any reports or information wherein she described her
location when she fell?

A:  No.

Q:  When the police came in connection with the '89 incident, you spoke
with the police officer. Right?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you believe at the time that you spoke with the police officer that
there was a possibility you were going to be arrested?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you believe that at the time you spoke with the police officer you
may have committed a crime?

A:  No.

Q:  You had no idea?

A:  Correct.

Q:  While you were -- Strike that. While the police officer was present at
Rockingham, you got in your car and left. Is that true?

A:  Correct.

Q:  Did you tell the police officer that you  were leaving?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you leave because you wanted to avoid being arrested?

A:  No.

Q:  Did the police officer ever indicate to you that you were going to be
arrested?

A:  Absolutely not.

Q:  Did he ever indicate to you that you were going to be questioned?

A:  No.

Q:  Did he ever indicate to you a desire to have you come down to the police
department to provide further information relative to this incident?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ask permission to leave?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you ask if the police officer had completed his investigation before
you got in your vehicle and decided to drive away?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know whether they -- any police cars followed you after you
left?

A:  I doubt it, but I don't know.

Q:  As you left the Rockingham residence, did you drive normal speeds?

A: Yes.

Q:  Were you driving in an effort to try to evade anyone that was trying to
follow you?

A: No.

Q:  Where did you go from there?

A:  To a friend's house.

Q:  Who is the friend?

A:  Alan Schwartz.

Q:  Now, fast forwarding a bit to the '93 incident with Mr. Zlomsowitzh--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's too late.

MR.BREWER: Huh?

MR.ROBERT BAKER: It's too late to fast forward to anything.

BY MR.BREWER:

Q:  On the '93 incident, you indicated that you were-- you went over to
Nicole 's unannounced. Is that true?

A:  What?

Q:  93 October 25th. 1993.

A:  No, that's wrong.

Q:  I'm sorry. Backing up. With the Keith Zlomsowitzh-- I am talking about
the 911 call. Earlier when you went over to Nicole's where Keith
Zlomsowitzh was present you went over there unannounced. Is that true?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you call and let her know you were coming?

A:   You're totally confused. I don't ever recall Keith Zlomsowitzh being
anywhere near Nicole's house in 1993.

MR. PETROCELLI: He is talking about May of '92.

MR. BREWER: No, I changed that. I said I was incorrect.

MR. PETROCELLI: May of '92, Gretna Green.

THE WITNESS: Pardon me?

MR. PETROCELLI: He is talking May of '92 Gretna Green.

THE WITNESS: Okay. So what's the question?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You went over to her house unannounced?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Okay. And when you got there, can you describe the pathway up to her
front door?

A:   It's a pathway. You walk up the driveway, you turn right a little bit and
you turn left and walk to her front door.

Q:  Okay. And the -- can you describe where the front window is in
relationship to that pathway?

A:  Front window's around the front that faces the street.

Q:  To enter the front of the house, would you ordinarily enter the pathway
that you just described?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you'd ring the bell or knock on the door?

A:  Yes, or go around back.

Q:   Okay. And if you entered in the front as you just described, would you
be able from the pathway to look into the front window inside her house?

A:  You could, but you couldn't see much looking in the front window.

Q:   Would you have to make some affirmative effort to go around and look
inside the window to see inside the house?

A:  To see the whole room, I would think so.

Q:   Did you have to do that in order to see her and Mr. Zlomsowitzh that
evening?

A:  No.

Q:   How were you able to see them?

A:  I walked by this window which is in the front of her house, but it's not
one of her front windows. It walks right along the path as you approach the
front door. It's about six feet from the front door, and you can see right into
the living room.

Q:  So you were walking on the pathway or towards the pathway to enter in
the front door?

A:  I was on the pathway approaching the front door, and I saw her head,
and I looked and saw she was obviously engaged.

Q:  And you were able to see that without making any affirmative effort to
look inside the window?

A:  True. Yes.

Q:  Just normally walking towards the front door as if to ring the bell or
knock on the door?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And did you ever take a different position to get a better look at what she
was doing?

A:  Once I saw her head, I stepped towards and saw that she was obviously
engaged, and then I left.

Q:  When you say stepped--

A:  It wasn't something I wanted to look at.

Q:   When you say  "stepped towards," you made a movement towards the
window?

A:  Yes.

Q:   Did you have to step off the path?

A:  No.

Q:   Did you step to the edge of the path?

A:  No. No, this is all along the path.

Q:  Okay. Did you step towards the window to get a better look inside?

A:  Yeah. To see what was going on.

Q:   And when you saw her head, what was it about her head that caused
you to move more towards the window to get a better look inside?

A:  Nothing. I just saw her, and I looked and then saw that she was
engaged.

Q:  Well, when you first saw her head, could you tell what she was
doing?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. So you just saw she was home inside the--

A:  Yeah, it was like -- it was a spontaneous thing. It wasn't like you're not
talking about a lot of time here. You know, it's like if you're walking,
sometimes I would have -- if she was just sitting   there, I would have hit the
glass and she would have -- I wouldn't have had to -- I didn't want to ring the
door bell. l didn't want to wake anybody. So if she was just sitting there, I
would have hit the glass, and she would have come and opened the door, but
when I looked and I saw she wasn't just sitting there, I left.

Q:  And you just looked in there for a matter of seconds?

A:  Yes.

Q:   The--your relationship with Mr. Kardashian, he has been a friend of
yours for a number of years. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you indicated that a number of years ago you had actually utilized
his legal services. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:   And that was how long ago, approximately?

A:  I don't know. Years. Years previous to this.

Q:  Okay. And as of June 1994, was he one of your best friends?

A:  He wasn't a guy I saw often, but if I had to list best friends, I would
have listed him in my list of best friends, yes.

Q:   He's someone that you saw socially?

A:  Yeah, from time to time. Like I may have seen him twice in the
previous year.

Q:  Okay. Did you have any business relationships with him?

A:   In our life together, yes.

Q:  In the last five years before Nicole's death, did you have any business
relationship with Mr. Kardashian?

A:  I don't believe so, no.

Q:   After June  994 at some point did you consult with Mr. Kardashian in a
professional capacity?

A:  Almost immediately.

Q:   Okay. And when you say "Almost immediately," when was the first
time you ever contacted Mr. Kardashian with a view towards either   asking
him something or telling him something that you  l considered to be within the
context of an attorney-client relationship?

A:  I didn't have to contact him. He came. He came to the house. And I
know --I don't want to discuss what I talked about with him on the 13th, but I
kinda relied on him a little bit from that point on.

Q:  Okay. The first time you talked with him  as on the 13th?

A:  No. I talked to him, I'm sure, on the 12th that night, but I wasn't in
much of a mood to have conversations. I mean--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: The 12th?

THE  WITNESS: The 12th-- I mean the 13th. It wasn't really like--I know
we had made arrangements to go to his house--we may have made
arrangements. We may have done it the next morning. I'm not totally   sure.
But I think I was just a person who was reacting to things on the 13th, and
then on the 14th I know specifically -- you know, I sorta asked for his help,
and he was there for me.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  When you say on the 14th you know specifically you sort of asked for
his help--

A:  Yeah.

Q:  --are you referencing some discussion you had with Mr. Kardashian that
was within the context of an attorney-client communication?

A:  As I know it to be now, yes.

Q:  Well, how about at that point? Not now, but on the 14th when you talked
to Mr. Kardashian, were you talking to him with a view towards either --
telling him something that you considered to be  confidential?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, that's a legal conclusion. Don't answer that.

MR. BREWER: His state of mind is relevant.

Q:   Were you consulting Mr. Kardashian on the 14th as a lawyer?

A:  I knew he was a lawyer, and I wanted his view on a few things--

Q:  Okay.

A:  -- and he was there for me.

Q:  All right. And that was the context of that discussion on the 14th.

A:  Yes.

Q:  Your knowledge that he was a lawyer and your desire to have some of
his information or knowledge.

A:  Yeah, to have him help me with you know, determining some things.

Q:  Okay. Now, on the 13th did you see Mr. Kardashian at your house?

A:  I believe so, but I really don't remember, but I believe so.

Q:  Okay. And did you have any conversations with him at all while he was
at your house on the 13th?

A:  If he was there, I would have, but I just l don't recall.

Q:  Okay. And on the 13th do you recall, for example, having any
discussions with Mr. Kardashian about luggage?

A:  No.

Q:   Do you recall having any discussion with Mr. Kardashian on the 13th
with respect to your whereabouts on June 12, 1994?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you recall having any discussions with Mr. Kardashian on the 13th
concerning your possible involvement in the deaths of Ron Goldman and
Nicole Brown Simpson?

A:  No.

Q:   Did you know whether Mr. Kardashian was a licensed lawyer in the
State of California at the time that you spoke with him on the 14th in
connection with seeking legal advice?

A:  I assumed he was.

Q:  On the 13th when you spoke with Mr. Kardashian, did you have any
discussions  whatsoever that relate to the facts and circumstances of Nicole's
death?

A:  As I told you, I don't recall if I spoke to him on the 13th.

Q:  You have no recollection at all as you sit here today of speaking with Mr.
Kardashian one way  or the other--

A:  One way or the other.

Q:  --on the 13th?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Do you recall at some point terminating the attorney-client relationship
you had with Mr. Kardashian--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  -- in connection with this case? Well, do you still consult with Mr.
Kardashian in connection with this case?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:   Well, Have you communicated with Mr. Kardashian in connection with
this case in the last two weeks --

MR.ROBERT BAKER: Do not answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  -- as an attorney, seeking information from him as an attorney?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Have you sought the legal services of Mr. Kardashian with respect to
any other matter other than this case since June 12, 1994?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: "This case" being which case? The civil case? The
criminal case? The facts surrounding--

MR. BREWER: Well, you won't let me ask about any of it, so   just--the
whole case, meaning--

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay.

BY MR. BREWER: --both cases that relate to the death of Ron Goldman
and Nicole Brown Simpson. Other than any work that he did in connection
with this case for you and any conversations or communi-
cations you had in connection with this case, have you had any other
opportunities wherein you have retained him since June 12, 1994?

A:   I don't understand the question. I don't understand the question.

Q:  Okay. I want to set aside any legal relationship you had with Mr.
Kardashian arising out of the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown
Simpson, and my question is: Since June 12, 1994,  have you retained Mr.
Kardashian in connection with any other matters?

A:   Retained. I have not paid him a retainer. I have relied on him on some
issues that stem from this case and -- yes.

Q:  I want to exclude those. Okay?

A:  Other issues that--

Q:  Exactly. And I want to exclude all issues that relate to this case.

A:  My whole life has been issues relating to this case since this--since it's
been over, and there's been numerous things, and some of the things that Bob
has been an adviser on.

Q:  And those items are related to this case?

A:  They're ancillary things to this case .

Q:  Is there anything that you would --

A:  Not to any criminal or civil prosecution. They're things -- other things.

Q:  Okay. Is there anything that you would consider to be separate and
distinct from this case or ancillary issues related to this case wherein you have
retained the services of Mr. Kardashian or spoke with him in an effort to
obtain legal advice?

A:  Outside of this case?

Q:   Yes.

A:  My life has been this case, so I haven't talked to virtually anybody about
any other thing, so the answer would be -- I don't know what the answer
would be because I don't know what the question was again.

Q:  Other than this case or ancillary issues related to this case, have you had
any discussions with Mr. Kardashian seeking his legal counsel concerning
any other matters?

A:  No.

Q:  Okay. You indicated in earlier examination that you had discussed or
denied your involvement in the murders with Mr. Cowlings. Do you recall
that?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Say again?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  You had testified in earlier examination that in a discussion with Mr.
Cowlings, you had denied any involvement in these murders. Do you recall
that?

A:  I don't recall discussing that here.

Q:   Have you ever had a discussion with  Mr. Cowlings concerning whether
you were involved in any way in the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole
Brown Simpson?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:   Okay. You had discussions with Rosey Greer while you were in jail. Is
that correct?

A:  Correct.

Q:   And when was the first time that you ever spoke with him?

A:   What do you mean? In my life?

Q:  No. After these murders.

A:  It was in jail.

Q:  Do you remember the date?

A:  No.

Q:   Prior to June 12, 1994 did you ever attend any services where Mr.
Greer, Reverend Greer, was a minister or pastor?

A:  No.

Q:  Did you have a church that you regularly attended?

A:  Regularly?

Q:  Sure.

A:  Semi-occasionally, yes.

Q:  Okay. And where was that?

A:  St. Martin's in Brentwood.

Q:   And as part of your religious beliefs, does that include periodic
confessions?

A:  I'm not Catholic. No.

Q:  Okay. What religious affiliation would you assign to yourself, if any?

A:  Baptist.

Q:   And as part of being a Baptist, does that include any process where you
go through a confessional?

A:  No.

Q:  You don't give confession as part of the ordinary religious services,
then?

A:  That's correct.

Q:  Do you know what religious affiliation Reverend Greer is?

A:  I think he's almost non-denomination. I think he's a guy who preaches
the message to just about anyone that -- I can't say anyone that would listen. I
know he speaks a lot. He travels a lot and  speaks a lot.

Q:  As you sit here today, do you have any understanding with respect to
whether he has any affiliation with a recognized religion?

A:  I think his affiliation--I believe he has some credentials. I've never asked
him about those, but I think in court that came out. I believe his affiliation is
with the Lord through Jesus Christ, and that's what he preaches.

Q:  Okay. Is that the name of the religion, or is that just how he interacts
with people that he sees, that he is somebody who is talking to them through
the Lord Jesus Christ?

A:  Well, I think anyone who has any religion in their life knows that the
Lord Jesus Christ is Christianity, so I think that would be the name of the
religion.

Q:  Do you know whether Reverend Greer as part of his religious affiliation
has as part of it confessions?

A:  No.

Q:   And in fact the only recognized -- in fact, you don't know of a
recognized religion that he is affiliated with. Is that a fair statement, as you  sit
here?

A:  No. I just told you he's affiliated with Christianity, Christian. The Lord
Jesus Christ is what he's affiliated with.

Q:  Okay. What I mean is Baptist, Episcopalian, Catholicism, some--

A:  Christianity is what it is. And I believe even though I was raised Baptist,
that's the way I see it also.

Q:  When did you first learn of Reverend Greer's religious affiliation? Is it
before or after he came to your jail?

A:  Before.

Q:   And in the course of talking with Reverend Greer, did you give him --
did he have a confession for you?

A:  No. The only thing we talked about was our belief in the Lord Jesus
Christ. There was nothing to confess except my belief in the Lord Jesus
Christ.

Q:   Okay. And what I mean by confess. I'm not necessarily--about
confessing to committing murders, but having a confession where you
absolve yourself of sins as a part of this experience with Reverend Greer.

A:  That's not his religion, or mine for that matter.

Q:  When you would meet with Reverend Greer, would you always do so
in the same place?

A:  No.

Q:  Would you meet in your jail cell?

A:  No.

Q:  Where would you meet?

A:  In the various attorney rooms.

Q:  Would there always be a guard present?

A:  I mean not that I could see, but I know there's one in the  vicinity, yes.

Q:  So during any -- Strike that -- At all times when you were meeting with
Reverend Greer you had knowledge that there would be a  deputy in close
proximity to where you were meeting?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And were there any walls or doors to your knowledge that separated the
location of this guard that you knew about from you and Reverend Greer?

A:  A wall, yes. Glass wall.

Q:  During any of these occasions where you spoke with Reverend Greer
while you were in jail, did you ever actually see the guard standing there as
you were having a discussion?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was that the exception rather than the rule?

A:  Standing would have been the exception, but see the guard, standing
and/or sitting, would have been the rule.

Q:  Okay. So generally speaking, you would have some visual contact with
the guard as you were communicating with Reverend Greer?

A:  Yes. It was difficult, but you could see him.

Q:  And after you had completed your discussions with Reverend Greer,
would you then tell the guard that you were done?

A:  He would.

Q:  Reverend Greer?

A:  Yes.

Q:  How would he do that?

A:  Knock on the glass.

Q:  And then what would he say?

A:  I don't know.

Q:  Did you believe that when you were communicating with Reverend
Greer, that your communications were private?

A:  I probably didn't give it any thought.

Q:  Did it matter to you whether they were private or not?

A:  Me personally?

Q:  Yes.

A:  No.

Q:  So the fact that a guard was sitting there and possibly could hear your
communications didn't matter to you?

A:  To me it didn't, no.

Q:  And was that because you didn't consider the communications to be
confidential?

A:  I don't know what I considered them to be. I just never thought of
thinking, here, I could hear them; I could hear them in the hall. I assumed
they could hear me.

Q:  So when you say, "I could hear them," you're talking about the guards
or deputies?

A:  Yes.

Q:  You could hear them talking?

A:  Yeah.

Q:  And you assumed that given the fact that you could hear them,  that they
could hear you as you were talking with Reverend Greer?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Okay. And--

A:  And I assume that we were being bugged, so I assumed that also, but
that was an assumption.

Q:   So is that true? You assumed that you were being bugged?

A:  At all times, yes.

Q:  Okay. And so then I take it that at all times while you were having
discussions with Reverend Greer, you didn't assume that any of those
discussions were confidential.

A:  I assumed that they were bugging us.

MR. BREWER: You want to change the tape? We will go off the record
here.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 2 of Volume VIII. The

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Mr. Simpson, on June 17 while you were inside your Bronco, did you
ever speak with your mother by cellular phone?

A:  I think I tried to, but I'm not sure.

Q:  As you sit here today, do you have a recollection of talking with her?

A:  No.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Where is the crescendo? We've got to ask him the
Rosey question. Come on. Come on, you can't waste 30 minutes on that.

MR. PETROCELLI: They were giving you the bait. Swallow it.

MR. KELLY: Whole.

MR. PETROCELLI: I like my Mercury Morris line of questions. That went
real far, didn't it.

MR. KELLY: No. No. That was Sugar Ray Robinson.

MR. PETROCELLI: Sugar Ray Robinson.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  The same trip where you were in the Bronco heading to Nicole's grave,
you indicated there was a police car blocking the entrance. Do you recall that?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Was it a police car or some other -- some type of security service that
was blocking the entrance?

A:  I don't know.

A:  Do you know the police department--

A:  No.

Q:  --if there was one?

A:  No.

Q:   Did you speak with your children from your Chicago hotel room on
June 13th?

A:  No.

Q:  Positive about that?

A:  Arnelle. Arnelle.

Q:   Okay. Sydney and Justin?

A:  I don't believe so.

Q:  Okay. When you say you "don't believe so" do you have some
recollection that you may have?

A:  No.

Q:   Okay. You're fairly certain you did not speak with Sydney and Justin
from your Chicago hotel room on the 12th?

A:  Pretty certain, yes.

Q:  And did you call on the way back from Chicago someone by the name of
Jonah Wilson?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Did you speak with Jonah Wilson?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:   What was your purpose in calling Jonah Wilson?

A:  I was looking for my daughter.

Q:  Do you recall speaking with Arnelle at Jonah Wilson's house?

A:  I don't recall.

Q:  You have no recollection of talking with Jonah Wilson on the way back
from Chicago as you sit here today. Is that true?

A:  Yes.

Q:  And you have no recollection of talking with Arnelle at Jonah Wilson's
house as you sit here today. Is that true?

A:  You mean coming back from Chicago?

Q:  Yes, on the airplane.

A:  No, I don't have a recollection of that, no. I may have, but I don't have a
recollection.

Q:  Does Christian Reichardt presently live with you?

A:  No.

Q:  Has he stayed at our house on occasion the last couple months?

A:   No

Q:   He's been there. Is that true?

A:  Yes

MR. PETROCELLI: Taking golf lessons.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:  Swinging golf clubs in the front yard with you?

A:  He did one day, yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: l know. I saw it on TV.

I'm sorry. No. 
 
Q: Okay.  So between--  
 
A: June 6 and--which I believe was a Tuesday, no.  
 
Q: Okay.  So no time between that Tuesday and the time of 
Nicole's death were you over there?  
 
A:  Correct.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And do you wear a size 12 shoe, Mr. Simpson?  
 
A: At times.  
 
Q: Okay. Let me ask you: Did you ever have golf shoes in your 
golf bag that came back from Chicago?  
 
A: Were there golf shoes in there?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: Do you know what size they were? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  As you sit here today, Mr. Simpson, do you have a 
visible scar on the middle knuckle of the middle finger of your left 
hand?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And is that approximately an inch to an inch and a half 
long? 
 
A: I would think not.  
 
Q: About an inch long? 
 
A: I would--maybe a little less than an inch, possibly. 
 
Q: Okay. And is that scar on the middle knuckle of the middle 
finger of your left hand a result of the cut you had on or about June 
13th, 1994?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And can you tell me with certainty exactly how you 
received that cut on the middle finger of your left hand?  
 
A: In the process of cleaning up some glass, I cut myself.  
 
Q: Okay. And you're certain that's when you cut that finger, 
resulting in the scar?  
 
A: Yes. When I saw--yes, when I knew it was cut, yes.   
 
Q: But you're certain that you caused the cut in that bathroom with 
that piece of glass?  
 
A: I'm certain that while I was cleaning up some glass I cut myself, 
and I noticed that it was coming from this middle finger, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And that was the first time you had ever seen that cut: In 
that bathroom in Chicago?  
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Going to June 12th of 1994, could you tell me at what time 
Arnelle left the house that day or evening?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she go to the recital with you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you see Arnelle at any time after the recital on June 
12?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me when the last time you saw her prior to 
the recital on June 12th was?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the last time you had spoken to Arnelle prior 
to the recital on June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q:  Okay. Could you tell me whether you told Arnelle what your 
plans were for the night of June 12th, 1994 after the recital?  
 
A: I don't know.  I don't recall. 
 
Q: Well, do you recall having a conversation with Arnelle at all 
that day on June 12th?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall having a-- Did you see Arnelle on June 
11th, 1994? 
 
A: I may have, but I don't have any memory about what--if I had or 
didn't. I may have, though.  
 
Q: You may have seen her?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I just don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you have a memory of actually speaking to her?  
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you recall telling Arnelle at any time on June 11th 
or 12th what you would be doing between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. on 
June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever tell Arnelle what your plans were for between 
7:00 p.m. and 11 :00 p.m. on June 12th 1994?   
 
A: I had no plans.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, you heard Mr. Kaelin's  testimony. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you've answered several questions about Mr. Kaelin 
also?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Could you tell me whether from -- Kato, I will refer to him as --
whether Kato could see the front of your house from his room at 
his Rockingham residence?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And I believe you indicated 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean the front by the entranceway? 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: The front entranceway from his room.  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: Could he see the driveway from his room at Rockingham.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Could he see the Ashford gate from his room at Rockingham.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Could he see the Rockingham gate from his room at 
Rockingham.  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay. MR. PETROCELLI: From his room at? 
 
MR. KELLY: At Rockingham. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.  
 
MR. KELLY: The Rockingham gate.  
 
Q: Now, and I believe you indicated earlier that you often had 
friends pick you up for go if, and Mr. Kaelin never knew about it?  
 
A: I've never seen him in the morning. 
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: I play golf almost every morning. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see Kato when you're leaving for golf?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him when you're coming back from golf?  
 
A: Possibly, but I rarely saw him, period.  
 
Q: Period.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And as far as you know, he rarely saw your movements, 
period, also.  Is that correct?  
 
A: That's correct.  
 
Q: Okay. And was there any-- is there any 
 
place from your residence in Rockingham that you can see inside 
the room Kato was occupying? 
 
A:  Anywhere in the backyard. Well, most places in the backyard 
around the pool. 
 
Q: Okay. But I am asking from the interior of your house, can you 
see into Kato's house? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, Kato doesn't have a house.  You 
mean his space. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: His room. 
 
MR. KELLY: His room. 
 
THE WITNESS: Possibly.  I've never really thought about it, but 
possibly. It depends on what slats were loose or if the door to the 
room next to his is open.  If that door is open, you can see in there 
fairly well from the living room and dining room and probably 
even from upstairs. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Q: Well-- 
  
A: If that door is not closed and the slats on his door are open, you 
probably can see part of the room, but you'd have trouble seeing all 
of the room from my house.  
 
Q: Well, from your house, when you say, "if that door was open," 
that's just the door to your office, is it not? 
 
A: Yeah, it's a door to the room next to his room, and it's normally 
open- Q: Okay. So-  
 
A:--yeah.  
 
Q:  So you'd have to be in that office to see into his room if that 
door was open. Is that correct?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Either from that door or his front door? 
 
A: I'm sorry? I'm sorry, I'm a little confused. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You want to get out the drawing, and 
maybe we will put it in your mind's eye? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I've tried to put it in everybody's mind's eye.  
No, I don't need the drawing.  Let me just ask a couple more 
questions. 
 
Q:  Where from the interior of your house other than your office 
could you see into Kato's room? 
 
A: You mean if that door to the room next to his is open?  
 
Q: Correct.  
 
A: From the--anywhere in the entertainment portion of my house, 
from the TV room, the bar, the little bay window I have, possibly 
from the dining room.  
 
Q: Okay. And is that- 
 
A:  And possibly from upstairs. I'm not sure.  Possibly from 
upstairs. 
 
Q: Okay.  And is that a glass front door to Kato's room that goes 
out to the pool area?  
 
A:  Now you're talking about another door. Right?  
 
Q:  I'm talking about Kato's door now. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And does he have any windows in his room facing the 
back of your house on the front area of his room? 
 
A: Well, the door's all glass. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a 
minute. Let's go back to that question. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: The back of my house. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: There are no doors that face--or windows 
that face the back of Mr. Simpson's house because his bungalow, if 
you will, is perpendicular to the house. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay.  
 
Q: Is that correct, Mr. Simpson?  
 
A: Yes. But it faces the pool area.  
 
Q: Okay. So all these rooms you discussed, 
 
 the entertainment room and the like, are perpendicular to Mr. 
Kato's room? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And do you ever recall being in your residence in 
Rockingham and being able to hear Kato's TV on-  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:--in his room.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you ever remember being in your residence at Rockingham 
and being able to hear the phone ring in his room?  
 
A: You mean he had a different phone. Right?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Probably I couldn't.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: But I don't ever recall hearing it.  Maybe if I was trying to, but I 
don't recall ever hearing it ring.  
 
Q: Okay. If somebody would come over to your house between 
9:30 and 10:45 on June 12th, 1994, could that have been done 
without Kato knowing it? 
 
A:  I would imagine so, yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. And if you had made any long distance call between 
9:30 and 10:45 on June 12th, 1994, you certainly could have done 
that from your residence without Kato knowing. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And if you had even, say, left  your residence at 
Rockingham at 9:30 on June 12th, 1994 and gone to visit a friend 
till 10:45, you could have done that without Kato seeing you. Isn't 
that correct?  
 
A: I would imagine so, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And with regard to Arnelle also, you could have had 
someone over between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. and she wouldn't 
know, if she was home. Is that correct?  
 
A: I'm sorry. You got me--What do you mean? Where does Arnelle 
fit here now?  
 
Q: Well, from her residence-  
 
A: Arnelle lives at my home. If she was in her bedroom sleeping or 
something? Q:  Yeah. 
 
A: Now, what's the question?  
 
Q: Did you have any--I will ask it differently. Did you have any 
discussions--Strike that. When the police officers woke up Arnelle 
on the morning of June 13th, she had no information from you as 
to what you had been doing between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. the night 
before, did she? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well- 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no idea. I don't know one way or the--I 
don't know if she talked to Kato or what, so I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q:  But you hadn't discussed it with her, had 
you?  
 
A:  What I had done from--I hadn't seen her. 
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And when the police officers woke up Kato, he had no 
information from you as to what you had been doing between 9:30 
and 10:45 the night of June 12th, 1994, had he? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, you are asking him to speculate 
what information he had. 
 
MR. KELLY:  I am asking from him, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Whether he told him- 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:-- what he was doing? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That has been gone into at least 10 times.  
Go ahead, OJ 
 
THE WITNESS: I think Kato was aware that I was trying not to 
sleep, and I was preparing myself to go to Chicago, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Okay. But no specific conversations as to 
what you were going to do in that time period?  
 
A: That I was not going to sleep and that I was preparing to go to 
Chicago. I thought that was pretty specific. I thought he was aware 
of that, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. That juice is right in the shot. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Which juice are you referring to? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's o.j. in front of OJ. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Couldn't resist. 
 
MR. KELLY: I think that's even been gone over before in this 
deposition: The juice. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I think you're right. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: On June 12th, 1994, Mr. Simpson, on the way to the airport did 
you discuss with the driver, Alan Park, what you had been doing 
between 9:30 and 10:55 before he drove in the driveway at your 
residence? 
 
A:  I doubt it.  
 
Q:  Okay.  On June 13th now, was there any time during that day 
that you discussed with Kato any of the evidence the police 
officers had collected at Rockingham? 
 
A:  I didn't know what they had collected. 
 
Q:  Did you-  
 
A:  I didn't know.  I just heard some rumors, I believe, but I didn't 
know.  
 
Q:  Okay. The specific question is, Mr. Simpson: Did you have any 
discussions with Kato regarding any evidence that had been 
collected at your  Rockingham residence?  
 
A: Not that I recall, no. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you have any discussions on June 13th at any time 
with Arnelle regarding any evidence the police officers had 
collected at Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't think so, no.  
 
Q: Okay. Was there any time during June 13th that you discussed 
with A.C. Cowlings any evidence collected at Rockingham?   
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q:  Okay. By the way, Mr. Simpson, did you know before noon on 
June 13th, 1994 that A.C. had taken Sydney and Justin down to the 
Browns' house?  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you know that even before 9:00 a.m. on June 13, that 
A.C. Cowlings was taking Sydney and Justin-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: L A. time. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's what I wanted to  know.  You 
mean L A. time or Chicago time? 
 
MR. KELLY: LA. time, first of all, with the noon question. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That would be 11 :00 in Chicago. So he 
is asking you 11 :00 o'clock on Chicago time on the 13th, did you 
know? 
 
THE WITNESS: I knew sometime that morning. I knew--by the 
time I got back to L.A., I knew A.C. had. I'm not sure if I thought 
both A.C. and Arnelle had, but I knew A.C. was involved. I knew 
A.C. was driving. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. And you knew that when you were still on the flight 
back--  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  --to L.A.?  
 
A:  I just knew that morning. Before I got to my house, I knew 
that. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you spoke to the police at any time on the 13th, 
did you ever discuss with them or they with you blood that had 
been found at Bundy?  
 
A: Discuss other than in the interview, when it came up in the 
interview, and somebody mentioned it when I was handcuffed. I 
don't know about Bundy.  They said, "There was blood at Bundy.  
There's blood at your house." You know, other than that, they  
didn't specifically say anything.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: That I recall, anyway.  
 
Q: When do you recall them hearing --when do you recall hearing 
them say there was blood at Bundy?  
 
A: The guy when I was handcuffed said, "We got sort of a 
problem. We got blood there. We got blood here." It was like 
blood was everywhere. 
 
Q: Did he specifically say Bundy?  
 
A: He may have, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did he mention anything about shoe prints at Bundy?  
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q:  Did he mention anything about a bloody glove behind Kato's 
room?  
 
A:  Not that I recall. 
 
Q:  Okay. At any time during the day other than when you were 
handcuffed, do you recall anybody discussing with you blood 
found at Bundy?  
 
A:  I can't recall. I just know that by the time I got to my house, I 
knew that the murder--a murder had taken place at Bundy, and then 
whatever  that guy was saying to me when I was handcuffed.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Other than the guy talking to you when you were 
handcuffed, do you recall having any discussions about blood 
being found at Bundy on the 13th?  
 
A: Not really, no, other than there was blood everywhere, yeah. 
 
Q:  That's what he said to you. 
 
A: Words to that effect. "We got blood there. We got blood here." 
It was something to that effect, yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And you never recall any  
 
discussions with anybody on the 13th regarding the shoe print? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall any discussions with anybody on the 
13th regarding a bloody glove?  
 
A: I don't recall, but I--you know, by  that night there was rumors 
about everything: Ski masks, I believe. and something--everything.  
So there was a lot of talk about a lot of things, and I can't recall 
exactly where--who or from where it was, news or it was 
somebody with us that I heard any of this. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, you keep--you mentioned ski masks several 
times, Mr. Simpson. What I am asking you specifically: Do you 
recall at any time on the  13th discussing with anybody a bloody 
glove found behind Kato's room at Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know if I did or not, so I just--I don't know when that 
came up.  So I don't know. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now-  
 
A:  I never discussed it.  So I know I never had a discussion with 
anybody about it, but I don't know when I first heard all of that 
stuff because it was a lot of things being said, and I can't recall 
when the information was coming. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've more than answered the question. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: You indicated earlier that there was a time that you went out 
behind Kato's room by the air conditioner. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me at whose suggestion that was, Mr. 
Simpson?  
 
A: Maybe mine.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall who you  suggested it to?  
 
A: No. I just know a couple of people  walked with me back there. 
And I can't recall who it was.  
 
Q:  Okay. Now, that space between the house and the Cyclone 
fence behind Kato's room, that's very narrow, is it not?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you be able to approximate how many feet wide it 
is?  
 
A: Four feet maybe.  
 
Q: Okay.  And as you sit here today. is it your testimony you don t 
recall who you were back with where that evening? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And do you recall any discussions you had back there behind 
his room that evening when you were 
 
with a couple other people? 
 
A: No.  Just we went to look. Kato said he had heard noises, and I 
didn't know if the--I don't know why. We just went to look. 
 
Q: You're talking about Kato when he was out in front of your 
house before you left for the airport? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And is it your testimony that  that's what caused you to 
go back there the next evening to look back there?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Did Kato tell you he had heard noises by the air 
conditioner the night before?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: What specifically had he told you, if you recall?  
 
A: That behind his -- there was noises. "Was there an earthquake? 
There was some noises." I really wasn't paying that much  attention 
to him because I was trying to leave, but he seemed concerned, and 
at one point I suggested he go one way and I go another way. In 
case somebody was there, there would be only two ways they can 
go, but we ended up not doing it. 
 
Q:  Would it be fair to say that an  earthquake noise would suggest 
a very general-type occurrence?  
 
A: I don't know. You know, that was his description, and I wasn't 
really, as I said, paying that much attention to him.  
 
Q: Okay. But you specifically went back by the air conditioner on 
the evening of the 13th.  
 
A: No. We walked back--the whole back of the thing and just 
looked. Wasn't the air conditioner. The air conditioner is there. It's 
hard to walk down that walkway without walking by the air 
conditioner. It's in the middle of the back wall. So we didn't go to 
the air conditioner and turn around. I walked the whole thing back 
there. 
 
Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, as you sit here today, do you recall the last 
golf ball you hit in your front yard at about 10:00 p.m. on June 
12th 1994?  
 
A: What do you mean?  I don't get the question. 
 
Q: Well, you indicated you skulled your last chip in your front 
yard. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And you specifically recall that?  
 
A: I remember that's when I  stopped, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you stopped because of a particular reason? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that was? 
 
A: Well, I think it was the last ball, but I could have grabbed 
another ball. There was a bunch of balls, one. And, two, I skulled 
it, and I didn't want to hit my Bentley.  I had just gotten all the 
dents out of my Bentley, and I didn't know where the ball went. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you recall actually hearing it hit something, didn't 
you?  
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  
 
Q: And you specifically remember even hitting the ball before that 
over a tree in your front yard, don't you?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. But you-  
 
A: I don't know if it was the shot before that. It could have been 
two shots before that. But I do know I hit one shot over to Mrs. 
Nebeker's, or in that direction.  
 
Q: Okay. But you don't recall who was on that back pathway with 
you on June 13th.  
 
A: No.   
 
Q: Okay. As of approximately noon on the 13th when you arrived 
back at Rockingham, could you tell me if there was any way 
Arnelle knew what you were doing between 9:30 and 10:45 the 
night before?  
 
A: I don't know. We talked a few times on the phone that morning, 
so I don't--you know, she was in a bad way, and ... You know.  
 
Q: When was the first time you spoke to her?  
 
A: When the police called me. 
 
Q: And to the best of-your knowledge did she just get on the phone 
after you had spoke to the police?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall the next time you spoke to her after that?  
 
A: I believe it was still that morning, and I just don't know when 
that morning.  
 
Q: Do you know where she was when you spoke to her the next 
time?  
 
A: You know, it was a lot of calls going back and forth or at least 
me calling, trying to get various people. I may have talked to her 
again before  she left the house. I know I talked to her probably 
after the kids were picked up. I just don't know when. I just don't 
know when. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you have any discussion with who you might have 
been with between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: I wasn't--Between what?  
 
Q: 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. the night before.  
 
A:  Did I have a discussion about it?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any discussion with her that morning who 
you might have spoken to between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. the night 
before?  
 
A: 9:30 and 10:45? No.  
 
Q: The night before.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any discussions with her at all where you 
might have been between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. the night before? 
 
A: Home.  
 
Q: Did you tell her that? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. I think we may have talked about 
what time she got home. We may have talked about that. I'm not 
sure.  No, I don't  have a clear recollection of it, but I might have 
asked her what time did she get home last night.  
 
Q: Did you tell her where you were between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m.? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Specifically between those two times. 
Did you tell her between those two times where you were? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Okay.  You saw Kato on the 13th at some 
point, didn't you?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Did you tell him specifically what you had been doing 
between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell him specifically  whether you had been with 
anybody or not between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you tell him specifically anybody you had spoken to 
between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you tell him specifically you had not spoken to anybody 
between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. And with regard to Alan Park, the same questions: You 
didn't give him any details on the way to the airport what you had 
been doing between 9:30 and 10:45 p.m. on the 12th?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, do you remember approximately what time you got 
down to Parker Center?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. It was afternoon, was it not? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  I don't think it was Parker Center. 
 
MR. KELLY: No?  
 
Q: Well, do you recall where you went?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you show up at some office building with your attorneys 
downtown?  
 
A: No. MR. KELLY: Wasn't it? Was it downtown? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: (Unintelligible.) 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh, that's right. 
 
MR. KELLY: Memory goes first, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  I think you're right, John. Everything 
else is gone, so it's amazing that I have anything left. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Mr. Simpson, do you recall giving statement 
to the police sometime on June 13th when you got back from 
Chicago? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall that being in the early afternoon on 
June 13th?  
 
A:  It could have been. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  I don't really--it could have been.  
 
Q: Well, prior to that statement had you-- and I am talking when 
you were in the office with Lange and Vannatter, had you ever told 
any police officers who you were or were not with between 9:30 
and 10:45 p.m. the night before? 
 
A:  I may have.  
 
Q: Do you know to whom you might have said that to?  
 
A: One of my calls to LA. that morning was to--the LAPD either 
answered the phone at my house or Nicole's house, and I'm not 
sure; it may have been Lange, because one of them said, "It's very 
important.  When did you leave last night and what did  you do 
before you left last night or words to that effect. 
 
Q:  Okay.  
 
A: But somebody with LAPD said to me "It's very important," 
because I didn't know these officers at the time, "what time did you 
leave last night" and I just can't recall if he asked more questions 
than that.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall what time that call or phone discussion 
with Lange was?  
 
A: It was before I left Chicago, so it would have been Chicago 
time before 9:00 o'clock, I guess. LA. time before 7:00 o'clock.  
 
Q: Okay.  Was that a call you initiated?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall how long that  conversation was?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did Lange answer the phone, by the way, when you called?  
 
A:  I didn't know the officers then. He may have said Lange--he 
may have said he was Lange. But I didn't know the officers, and 
whoever answered the phone.  
 
Q: Did you--do you recall at any time before giving your statement 
telling any police officer who you might have spoken to between 
9:30 and  10:45 the night before?  
 
A:  I don't think anybody ever asked, no. 
 
Q: Okay. But did you ever tell?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever tell any police officer prior to giving your 
statement where you had been besides home on 9:30,10:45 the 
night before? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: You're talking about the recorded 
statement. Right? 
 
 MR. KELLY: Prior to it. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yeah. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I hadn't been anywhere other than home. 
 
 BY MR. KELLY:  
 
Q: Did you tell any police officer that?  
 
A: Whenever an officer asked me what time I left, I think he may 
have asked me, "Where were you before you left," and I told him 
"Home."  
 
Q: Okay. Do you have a specific recollection of that?  
 
A:  I know there was a conversation -- somebody was asking me 
on the phone where I was the night before and I pretty much told 
him that.  
 
Q: Okay.  But you specifically remember it was a phone call you 
initiated?  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you were still in your room, 
 
 do you recall?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And, Mr. Simpson, they drew a sample of your blood after you 
completed giving your statement to Detectives Lange and 
Vannatter, did they not?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me  approximately how long a drive it 
is from where you gave that statement back to your residence at 
Rockingham in terms of time?  
 
A: Depending on traffic. 
 
Q:  Well, could you approximate for me?  
 
A: No. You guys--you have to ask one of these other lawyers. I 
couldn't.  Because depending on traffic, I don't know.  
 
Q: Is it less than a half hour?  
 
A: If there's no traffic, probably, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Can you make it in 15 minutes without traffic?  
 
A: Maybe.  
 
Q: Okay.  And the same holds true for  875 Bundy?  
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. By noon Pacific Standard Time, California time, on June 
13th, had you had any conversations with Cathy Randa as to what 
you had been doing between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Prior to noon Pacific Standard Time on June 13th- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: We're actually on daylight time at that 
time. It's not a big deal. 
 
MR. KELLY: You sure? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'm just suggesting that you might want 
to modify your question. You don't have to. obviously. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. Well, just at any time prior to your flight arriving back 
from Chicago, had you discussed with anybody, other than the one 
phone conversation you just mentioned, what you had been doing 
between 9:30 and 10:45 the night before?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you left Rockingham for the airport the night of 
June 12th 1994, did you lock the front door? 
 
A: I believe Kato was at the front door. My memory is he was at 
the front door, and I told him to see if he can find a flashlight and 
continue to look.  
 
Q: No. What I am asking you is: Do you 
 
 recall locking the front door to your residence?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you have a key to the front door of your residence when 
you left?  
 
A: I may have.  
 
Q: Okay. Well, I believe you indicated  previously you have never 
been locked out of your house before. Is that correct?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: Okay. But do you recall whether you had a key on the night of 
June 12th when you left for the airport \from Rockingham?  
 
A: There is an area I keep a key. So if I didn't have one on my 
person, there's a place where I keep a key at my house. 
 
Q: On the exterior?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Did Kato have a key to your main residence on the night 
of June 12th 1994?  
 
A:  Not that I was aware of. 
 
Q: Did he know where you kept the key to your main residence the 
night of June 12th 1994? 
 
A: Not that I'm aware of.  
 
Q: Did you tell him the night of June 12 where the key to your 
main residence was- 
 
A: Not that I'm aware of.  
 
Q: --on the night of June 12th 1994?  
 
A: Not that I'm aware of.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you have exterior motion detectors as part of your 
alarm system at Rockingham? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Now or June of '94? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Q:  As of June 12th 1994, did you have motion 
detectors--exterior motion detectors on your alarm system at 
Rockingham.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Was there any way to trigger the alarm system to your 
house from the exterior without opening a door or window?  
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: As of June 12th, 1994, was there any way to trigger the alarm 
system on your house from the exterior other than by opening a 
door or window? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean by a remote button-   
 
THE WITNESS: I don't believe so. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER:-- or by throwing a rock through the 
window or- 
 
MR. KELLY Yeah. 
 
Q: Or just by movement or sound or 
 
A: Outside of the house?  
 
Q: --contact. Yeah.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. When you called from the airport, did you ever ask Kato 
to lock the front door that you recall? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, first of all, I think he called from 
the car. 
 
 THE WITNESS: No. It was the airport. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Airport. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: It is gone. 
 
 MR. KELLY: It is gone. I don't want to steal your thunder, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: It's gone. 
 
 MR. LEONARD: It's no reason to leave, Bob. 
 
MR. KELLY: Let me take off my mike and ask a couple of the real 
questions now. 
 
Q: So, Mr. Simpson, even if Kato was on the exterior of your 
house with a flashlight after you left, there would be no way by 
just his movements  outside the house he would set off the alarm, 
would he?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q:  Okay. And once again, it's your 
 
testimony you don't recall whether you locked the front door or 
not? 
 
A: No. My recollection is I walked out of the front door and Kato 
was behind me, and I told him to look for a flashlight. I had 
mentioned to him about putting on the alarm, and it appeared as if 
it was gonna--you know, Kato was being Kato, and I said, " Look 
for a flashlight," and I'd give him the alarm--I'd call for the alarm.  
 
Q: Well, when you say "Kato...being Kato," did you think of him 
as a little scatterbrained?  
 
A: I don't know.  Just Kato being Kato.  You spent time with him.  
 
Q: Yeah, I did.  
 
A: Kato was being Kato.  
 
Q: I am asking you: Did you consider him a little scatterbrained?  
 
A: I considered him being Kato. That's the way I've always known 
him to be, and whatever that is Kato. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, is it your testimony you left the front door to your 
residence at Rockingham the night of June 12th, 1994 open?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And Kato didn't have a key.   
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And you didn't tell him where a key was.  
 
A: No. Q:  Okay. And you didn't have the alarm set.  
 
A: Correct. Q:  Okay. And you had never given him access to your 
house before without you being there, had you? A: No.  
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, just generally would it be fair to say that Nicole 
took a lot of photographs?  
 
A: Oh, yes.  
 
Q: Yeah. I mean, right up to 1994, from-- or say the last 10 years, 
she was always taking photographs, was she not?  
 
A: Ever since I met her, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And she would frame a lot of them? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And an awful lot of them were on display in your Rockingham 
house? A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And when she lived at Bundy that last year and a half, 
she had a lot on display there?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you know whether she kept 
 
the extra photographs that she didn't frame, also?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: You don't know?  
 
A: Well, I'm sure she did. She always had photographs.  
 
Q: Okay. Did she have photo albums? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: All right. And would she take pictures of. say, parties you guys 
had? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And during vacations she'd bring her camera?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall her even taking pictures of the house, 
inside and out?  
 
A: I don't recall it, but-   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You mean without human subjects? 
 
 MR. KELLY: Yeah, without human subjects. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I don't recall it. 
 
 BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Do you ever recall seeing her take  pictures of the decorating 
she had done in your house after she had completed it?  
 
A: I've never seen it. She may have, but 
 
 I've never seen her do it.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have a chance any time after June 12 to go 
through Nicole's collection of photographs at Bundy?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay.  Now, Mr. Simpson, you stated earlier at your deposition 
here and on your infomercial--you referred to the Bruno Magli 
shoes as I think "ugly'' and I think you said "nasty" once, too. Is 
that correct?  
 
A: No. I said, "I wouldn't wear those ugly shoes," yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And I think you also indicated that you had seen them 
during the trial? 
 
A: The pair that they had at the trial is the only pair I've seen that I 
knew was Bruno Magli shoes.  
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me as you sit here today, do you know the 
size of the shoe that left the shoe print at 875 Bundy on the night of 
June 12th?  
 
A: I believe Agent Bodziak said that they were 12s.  
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me the color of the shoes that left-   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That he saw in the trial? 
 
 MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry? 
 
 BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Could you tell me the color of the shoe that 
you saw at trial? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: I can't see how that's relevant to any 
issue in this case, but go ahead. 
 
 THE WITNESS: There were two pair of shoes. They may have 
been bluish-green or green and blue. Bluish-they were--yeah, I 
believe. I'm not a  hundred percent sure on that. 
 
 BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Okay. Well, do you know how many 
different styles men's Bruno Maglis come m?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know how many different colors they come in?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you know whether they come in tie-ups?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you know whether they come in slip-ons?  
 
A: Well, tie-ups I know they come in because I believe that's what 
they had in court.  
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether they come in a 
 
slip on shoe also? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether they come in high-cuts?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you know whether they come in low-cuts?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Well, high-cuts--I believe they were mid-cuts or-- I believe the 
ones that were in jail-- I mean when I was in court may have been 
high-cuts.  They may have been . Or mid-cuts.  I'm not a hundred 
percent sure.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you remember seeing a below- ankle height men's 
Bruno Magli?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall ever seeing those Bruno--men's Bruno 
Maglis in a brown color?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether they're made in brown?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know what material they were made out of?   
 
A: We're talking the ones in court?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: They seemed to be -- I don't know. I don't know  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Nicole ever took a picture of you 
in a men's Bruno Magli shoe?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know for certain that she did not?  
 
A: Shoes that looked like the ones I saw in court, yes, I know for 
certain that she didn't take a picture of me looking--in shoes like 
those, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether--if Nicole ever took a picture of 
you in men's Bruno Magli shoes?  
 
A: That were like the ones in court. no.  
 
Q: No, I am not--I will ask it once again, Mr. Simpson: Do you 
know if Nicole ever took a photograph of you in men's Bruno 
Magli shoes?  
 
A: Not that I know of, because I don't know if I've ever owned 
Bruno Magli shoes.  
 
Q: Do you know whether you owned a pair of men's Bruno Magli 
shoes in June 1994?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you know for a fact you did not own a 
 
 pair of men's Bruno Magli shoes in June 1994?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Okay. On the night of June 12th 1994, do you recall having 
cash up in your bedroom? 
 
A: Say that again.  
 
Q: Do you recall having cash, U.S. currency, up in your bedroom.  
 
A: When?  
 
Q: On the evening or night of June 12th, 1994.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And approximately how much was that?  
 
A: I left 5- or $6,000 there that I put under my sweater. I remember 
doing that, talking it out of--because it was all together at that 
point, so I recall leaving that amount there.  
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall what denominations it was?  
 
A: 100s, 50s, mostly 100s.  There may have been a 50 or two, but 
basically l00s.  
 
Q: Okay. But it wasn't all 100s?  
 
A: I believe it was. It may have been a couple of 50s, but I believe 
it was mostly 100s.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, you were employed by Hertz in 
 
June 1994, were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And part of your duties with Hertz, one of the things you 
would do is play golf with preferred customers there, would you 
not?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And sometimes you would attend parties and functions 
for them with their preferred clients?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Were there times you'd actually give talks at conferences 
and things for Hertz?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: Okay. And these various things I just referred to were all part of 
your job with Hertz, were they not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And was part of your job  responsibility to always be 
gracious and hospitable when you would attend these various 
functions and events?  
 
A: I think that's why they hired me. 
 
Q:  Okay. And would it be fair to say that you would keep personal 
matters or moods to yourself when you were attending these events 
for Hertz?   
 
A: I think I did it most of the time, yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And in June 1994 you were an announcer for NBC?  
 
A:  I was under contract with NBC. I wasn't doing any work for 
them in June, but I was under contract for them. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, the last couple years that you had done work for 
them, what type of work were you doing?  
 
A:  Football, color commentary work, and mostly in the pre-game 
show, and if--during the Olympics I did the Olympics. 
 
Q: Okay.  You had never competed in the Olympics yourself, had 
you, though? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you do a lot of on-site interviews with competing 
athletes when you were doing your color commentary?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you didn't have any script or rehearsed questions 
ahead of time when you would interview these people, would you?  
 
A: No.  You studied.  You studied your  subject, obviously, so that 
you could be prepared. So l like to think I was a guy who did--who 
studied a 
 
lot, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. But when you would, say, conduct a post-game interview 
with a competing athlete in a football game it would be based on 
what you had just observed, would it not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And some of your questions would be based simply on 
the responses you got from the person you were interviewing, also. 
Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And during your college and pro football career, there were 
many times you were interviewed by others, were you not?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And at USC would you at times give interviews right 
after you had come off the field when you were competing?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And when you were with the Buffalo Bills, were there times 
you would be grabbed right on the field after a game and give 
interviews?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And that was done without any rehearsal or forethought, 
your responding to these interviews, were they?   
 
A: Just like you and I right now.  
 
Q: Okay. Right. There was a time you did "Monday Night 
Football" also.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And were there ever times you just didn't feel like going 
to work when you were working on TV?  
 
A: I always liked what I did. You know, there's times you didn't 
want to get on a plane and go someplace, but I like to think 
whenever I was involved in it, I enjoyed doing it and I liked doing 
it, yeah. the plane portion of it was the uncomfortable part.  The 
actual doing it, I've always enjoyed doing.  
 
Q: Okay. And you were always able to put your personal matters 
or moods aside when you're going on air, weren't you?  
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: Okay. And in your acting career, I think there were some 
movies where you were one of the principals, say the NAKED 
GUN series, were you not? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: I don't know if I was a principal in NAKED GUN, but thank 
you. 
 
Q:  I don't want to disagree with your lawyer, but you had some 
sort of acting career. 
 
A: Thank you.  
 
Q: I didn't describe it. I just said you  had it.  Could you tell me--
with, say, for  example, the NAKED GUN series, you had actual 
written scripts you had to review and prepare with, did you not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And even in preparing with those scripts, you had to allow for 
your co-actors' lines and actions also, did you not? 
 
A: Yeah, it's like you'd work with a person, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you would often learn these right on location when 
you were getting ready for these movies? 
 
A:  No.  I'd study my script and know my part and then work out 
the movements on the set. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Since June 12th, 1994 have you ever--have you given 
any paid commentary or performances other than your 
infomercial?  
 
A: No. Commentary, you know, I talked to a photographer who 
gave some--sold some pictures to the Star, so if that's considered 
commentary. It was mostly his observations and my words. I don't 
recall if I ever really gave him any words with it, but I know I 
discussed my feelings to an extent, and since I never read the 
stories, I don't know if any of those  feelings were communicated.  
 
Q: Okay. Other than the Star Magazine-- Star Magazine we're 
referring to?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Other than that and your  infomercial, can you think of 
anything else?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you-  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Mr. Petrocelli wants you to ask that 
question. Please read it and ask that question. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry.  I can't read his  handwriting. Can you? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes. I can read it upside down. Do you 
want me to ask it? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want me to ask? 
 
 MR. KELLY: You know, you might want to write the answer for 
him, the way they're reading it here.  
 
Q: Did you ever get paid -- I should get paid for asking this. 
 
Mr. Petrocelli:. 
 
Q:  Did you ever get paid for conducting a magazine or newspaper 
interview since June 12th, 1994? 
 
A:  I told you, the Star. 
 
Q:  Other than Star Magazine. 
 
A: I don't know if I did an interview. I don't know if that was an 
interview. That was more for pictures. Other than the video, no.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, prior to June 12th, 1994, would it be fair to say 
that you had had a good relationship with the LA. Police 
Department? 
 
A: I had a good relationship with everybody. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But I am asking you specifically with the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, that assumes he has a relationship 
with the L A. Police Department. I don't have one, and I don't 
know that anybody has a relationship with the police department, 
so I think it assumes facts not in evidence or without foundation  
and instruct him not to answer the question. 
 
MR. KELLY:  Q: well, do you recall the book I WANT TO TELL 
YOU?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall a picture in there of someone with a Los 
Angeles Police Department hat on?  
 
A: Maybe my son might have had an LAPD cap in a picture.  
 
Q: Do you know where he got it from? 
 
A: I can only guess. A.C. or Ron Ship.  
 
Q:  And do you recall in your book I WANT TO TELL YOU 
discussing your relationship with the Los Angeles Police 
Department at all?  
 
A:  I might have, but I have no relationship with them. I didn't 
know anyone on the force at that time, so I didn't--I didn't have a 
relationship with them.  
 
Q: So if you indicated at some point that you had had a good 
relationship with the L.A. Police Department prior to June 12th, 
1994, there was no basis for that statement?  
 
A: The basis in that I had a good  relationship with the L A. Fire 
Department. I didn't know anybody on the L.A. Fire Department, 
but I assume I had a good relationship with them. So it would be 
along those lines. I mean, I didn't know anyone with the L.A. 
Police Department. I didn't know anyone with the L.A. Police 
Department. I don't think I knew any 
 
Marines, but I always go out of my way to be nice to them.  And 
even since I've been out of jail, if they show up at my house for 
autographs, I give them  autographs. So I didn't know anyone 
there. To say I was personal with them, I always like to think I'm 
on good terms with authority, yes.  
 
Q: well, did you ever support the Los Angeles Police Department?  
 
A: I support them now.  
 
Q: I'm--Was there any time you didn't support the Los Angeles 
Police Department? 
 
A: Emotionally after I--some of the things that happened in this 
trial for a period of time, emotionally I blamed the whole force, but 
now I don't. 
 
Q:  Okay. But prior to June 12th, 1994 did you support the L A. 
Police Department?  
 
A:  Yes.  And I still do. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you had no reason before June 12th, 1994 to think 
the Los Angeles Police Department didn't support you, did you? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, I don't know that there's --that 
presupposes a whole bunch of things that I don't know that he 
would have any way of knowing. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That calls for speculation. Instruct him 
not to answer. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. There was a time that a police officer or police officers 
came to your house when you had a bat in your hands.  Do you 
recall that?  
 
A:  When they came, I don't think I had it in my hand, but there 
was a time when after an incident they came to my house, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall what that was? 
 
A: I think '84. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall the name of any of the police officers 
that came to your house at that time?  
 
A:  I think it was only one, and he was only there for like 30 
seconds or so, and I don't think he introduced himself, and that was 
it. 
 
Q:  Well, as you sit here today, do you know who that police 
officer was who came in 1984?  
 
A: Today I'm told it was Mark Fuhrman. 
 
Q: Okay. That's Detective Fuhrman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And when he came there in 1984, he did not file a police 
report, did he?   
 
A: Well, there was nothing for him to do. As he testified in court 
on cross-examination, there was nothing for him to do. There was 
no reason for  him to be there at that time, and he left. So there was 
no report to file. There was nothing for him to do. If you look at his 
testimony, he testified to that, so...  
 
Q:  Okay.  Is your answer no, he did not file a police report? 
 
A: I don't know what he did.  I really  don't.  I know there was no 
reason for him to be there, and he realized that and left. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, he didn't come to your property because he heard 
the bat hitting the car, did he?  
 
A: And he didn't come on our property because anybody on my 
property called him. 
 
Q: Do you know how he- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Go ahead. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Q: Do you know how he had occasion to show 
up at your property?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And what property was this at? 
 
A: Rockingham.   
 
Q: Okay. That's, what, the gate to the  Rockingham entrance? 
 
A: We didn't keep the gate closed in those days.  
 
Q: Okay.  Was this a marked police car he showed up in?  
 
A: I never saw.  They were outside the gate.  
 
Q: Did he walk up the driveway?  
 
A: I believe so. I just saw him in the front yard at one point. 
 
Q: And you never called the police. 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Nicole never called the police. 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Was Michelle working there at that time?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Do you know if Michelle called the police? 
 
A: She didn't, no.  
 
Q: And he just showed up on your property, Detective Fuhrman, 
after that incident.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how long after you had broke the windshield did Detective 
Fuhrman show up on your property?   
 
A:  Half hour maybe.  
 
Q: And were you still out front with Nicole at that time?  
 
A: We had just walked outside. I had just walked outside because a 
Westec guy was--had come and was leaving, and I walked outside, 
and then Nicole came outside.  
 
Q: And why was the West person there, if you knew?  
 
A: Because Nicole hit a button for West. 
 
Q: Do you know whether West called the police?  
 
A: No. I don't know. 
 
Q: West is a security company? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And how long after the West person arrived did 
Detective Fuhrman arrive?  
 
A: The West guy came; he was there for about a minute, and as he 
was leaving I believe someone came up, and which I'm told now is 
Detective  Fuhrman. He stayed for about 30 seconds, and he left. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he look at the cracked  windshield? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you have any idea what- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Do you know--do you recall how close to the car with the 
cracked windshield he got?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. But he never talked to Nicole about filing a report, did 
he?  
 
A: No. He says, "Was everything all right?" He said--I recall the 
police officer saying, "Who broke the window?" I said, "I did."  
And he says, "Everything all right?" And we said, "Yeah, and he 
left. 
 
Q: You didn't hear of any leaks to the media regarding the fact--
regarding this incident after that fact, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. You didn't get any follow-up visits from police officers, 
did you? 
 
A:  There was no reason to. 
 
Q: With regard to the New Year's Eve/New Year's Day incident at 
Rockingham in 1989, I believe you indicated the police did not see 
fit to  take Nicole to the hospital?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: They-   
 
A: When I came back home, she hadn't been to the hospital, so I 
assumed they didn't.  
 
Q: Okay.  And when you left the house early that morning after the 
police Officer Edwards arrived, he didn't pursue you at all, did he? 
 
A:  Not that I know of. 
 
Q:  And if you know, did he put out a radio call for backup or 
anything when you left there? 
 
A:  I have no idea what he did. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Were you ever arraigned that-- any charge in that case? 
 
A:  Yes, I believe--well, arraigned, I don't know. I ended up going 
to court. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Were you ever fingerprinted?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Were you ever down Central Booking?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Were you ever handcuffed?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And in fact you indicated another detective came the 
next day who was checking on Edwards?  
 
A:  He came, and he was interviewing about the incident. He didn't 
come the next day. He talked to me the next day. He asked about 
the incident. I guess he talked to 
 
Nicole and he talked to myself. He  asked some questions about 
Detective Edwards, and I guess he said he'd put the report in. He 
was gonna put the --put it in, whatever-  
 
Q: Anything unprofessional about that visit that next day with you 
and Nicole?  
 
A: Well, the night it was, but the next day it wasn't. The next day 
was on the telephone, so, you know, it was-whatever. 
 
Q: And Ron Ship is an ex-Los Angeles Police Department officer, 
isn't he? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that prior to June 12th, 1994 when you were 
friends with him? 
 
A: Yeah. I have known Ron for a number of years, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet other Los Angeles Police Department 
members that he brought to your house? 
 
A: When you say bring to my house, yes. They stopped out front, 
and if I was outside, I talked to them. Occasionally they'll come in 
and have a Coke or Pepsi and leave, yes.  
 
Q: And on--You never had a fight or 
 
 argument with any of these guys, did you?  
 
A: No. They seemed like all-right guys.  
 
Q: Was there ever a time they asked you to contribute to something 
you didn't?  
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q: Do you recall them ever asking you to speak or appear 
somewhere that you didn't?  
 
A: I don't recall ever doing that for them, no.  
 
Q: Okay. Is there anything at all that you can tell me about that 
would cause you to think prior to June 12th, 1994 the Los Angeles 
Police Department  had anything against OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: As a department, no, but I've run into some police officers who 
were obviously problem police officers. 
 
Q: Well, you had told us about Police  Officer Edwards on the 
morning of January 1, 1989.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Could you relate any other incidents to me?  
 
A: At least five times in my life I've been stopped and taken out of 
my car. A year previous to--in '92, I believe it was, a cop stopped 
me on  Cliffwood and--two cops stopped me. One had his gun 
 
out, and when I asked why they got their gun out to me, the guy 
just asked for my driver's license. 
 
 I kept saying, 'Why has this guy got a  gun on me?" And then I 
guess they saw it was me, and they wrote me a ticket, and I wasn't 
speeding. 
 
 Yeah, like most black guys, I've been.  you know, stopped a few 
times, and until they saw it was me, and consequently they--then it 
was okay. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: But they stopped me only because I was black and in a nice car. 
That's the only reason I was stopped. 
 
 But they always let you go because of who you were?  
 
A: I don't know. Once they saw I hadn't stolen the car I guess they 
let me go. 
 
Q: On June 13th when you went down to the station with Lange 
and Vannatter, I think you indicated they were conscious of the 
fact that you were tired at that time? 
 
Yes.  
 
Q: And I think you indicated they were actually concerned about 
getting you back home and getting the statement over with? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't think he indicated 
 
any concern whatsoever.  He indicated what they said. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
Q: Did they state something to you to the effect, "OJ., we just want 
to get this over with and get you back home?  
 
A: Yeah, "We just want to get this over with so you can go home?  
 
Q: Okay. And were they polite to you when you were down there?  
 
A: I don't know. They were just, I guess, police officers, as far as I 
was concerned.  
 
Q: Doing their job. 
 
A: As far as I was concerned, yes.  
 
Q: And Detective Fuhrman wasn't with them during that statement 
you gave, was he? 
 
A:  Not that I recall. Other police officers were coming and going.  
I don't recall seeing him, but I couldn't--I wouldn't recognize him, 
anyway. 
 
Q: Okay. And to the best of your understanding on June 17th, you 
were given the opportunity to surrender to the police. Is that 
correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And to the best of your  understanding, did there come a 
time that police 
 
officers were sent to Kardashian's home?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. But as you understand it, your attorney, Mr. Shapiro, had 
reached an agreement with the LAPD for your surrender. Is that 
correct?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And as far as you know, prior to your surrender the 
LAPD agreed not to send any officers to Kardashian's home, did 
they? 
 
A:  I don't know.  I thought every time Mr. Shapiro said something 
to me-I don't know. I really don't know.  
 
Q: Okay. Did Mr. Shapiro indicate to you that the LAPD knew 
where you were at that point? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Do you know whether the LAPD knew you were at 
Kardashian's on the morning of June 17th? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  When you were on the telephone in your Bronco the evening of 
June 17th, did you have any discussions with Detective Lange? 
 
A:  I don't know. I don't recall. I may have, but I just don't recall. I 
believe I might have, but- 
 
Q:  Do you recall the substance of any of those discussions? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you recall talking to any police officers other than Lange? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you don't- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall talking --I don't know who I talked 
to.  Lange may have been one of them, but I was kinda in a daze at 
that time. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Do you have any recollection of anything you said to any of 
these officers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Do you have any recollection of anything these officers said to 
you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall hearing A.C. indicate on the phone that he 
wanted to get you back to Rockingham? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall driving back to Rockingham? 
 
A: Yeah, I do. I do kinda re---I don't know. I know A.C. at one 
point was yelling at somebody outside of the car, and I think when 
he was yelling at somebody outside the car, he said, "I'm taking 
him home." 
 
Q: But for the couple hours on the interstate--that was 405, wasn't 
it? 
 
A:  I don't know. I was laying in the back, so I have absolutely no 
idea where he was. 
 
Q:  Did you ever indicate to A.C. that you wanted to get back to 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And you eventually got back to Rockingham-  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did you not? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. The police didn't stop you at any time before you got to 
Rockingham, did they?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. And in fact when you got back to Rockingham, they 
allowed you to leave the Bronco and enter the front door at 
Rockingham, did they not, too?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what your actions were after you got 
in the front door at Rockingham on the 17th?  
 
A: I think I just went and sat in a chair, and they talked to me.  I 
can't recall what they 
 
talked to me about. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you make any phone calls?  
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall at what point they put handcuffs on you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  When you were sitting in that chair, did you have handcuffs 
on?  
 
A:  I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Do you recall making any phone calls before they put 
handcuffs on you? 
 
A:  I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Do you recall being frisked in the house? 
 
A:  I don't recall. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there anything discourteous or unprofessional in the 
way you were treated at Rockingham the night of the 17th when 
you got back  there?  
 
A: Not that I recall.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, Mr. Simpson, I believe you played two years of 
junior college ball. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And then you had two years at USC?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what position did you play at USC?  
 
A: Tailback. 
 
Q: Tailback. And were there times that you were on the receiving 
end of passes?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Flare passes?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Screens?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I have no clue what this is leading to. 
You're gonna have to tell me, because we  are nor going into his 
football career here. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay.  
 
Q: Did you ever drop a pass that hit you in the hands, Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't drop the glove, 
 
Mr. THE WITNESS: In a game I never recall dropping a pass. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: No?  
 
A: In a game I never recall dropping a pass. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He was never coached to fumble. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Did you ever fumble, Mr. Simpson?  
 
A:  I'm sure I did, but I wasn't considered a fumbler.  
 
Q:  But you weren't considered what? 
 
A: You know, some players have reputations of being fumblers, 
but I don't think I was never considered a fumbler.  
 
Q: Okay. But did you ever fumble in your years with Buffalo? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, I'd been hit a few times and gave up the ghost, as they 
say, yes.  
 
Q: Did you ever run into players on the sidelines when you were 
forced to the sideline?  
 
A: I may have. 
 
THE REPORTER: I'm sorry. "Did you ever" 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: - run into players when you--  
 
A: I was knocked into players, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever get knocked into walls?  
 
A: Into what?  
 
Q: Walls?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: During your playing days?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Benches?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Down markers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Officials?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you remember, when you were making your 
infomercial, making the statement that it was ridiculous to think 
you could have dropped the glove back there because you spent 
your whole life  avoiding players and things and not fumbling?  
 
A: Yes. I don't think I fumbled. I fumbled because guys were 
grabbing at me and hitting me. It's a little different, I think, yes.  
 
Q: And you play golf also now, don't you?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Favorite sport now?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you started playing in the late '80s?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you have a better than- average handicap?  
 
A: Today, no. 
 
Q:  Well, as of June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you play right-handed?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And I assume you always wear a golf glove when you 
play?  
 
A: Not always, but most of the time, yes.  
 
Q: Well, on June 11th when you played at-- I assume you played at 
Riviera on the 11th?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you wear a golf glove that day?  
 
A: Sometimes. Some clubs I have I don't wear a glove, but I would 
have worn a glove during the course of that round, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Other than a putter, is there a particular club you don't 
wear a glove with?  
 
A: Mostly par 3s.  
 
Q: Okay. Short irons?  
 
A: Short irons, bigger grip.  
 
Q: Okay. By the way, your Callaway clubs, do they have a special 
grip made for you?  
 
A: When they sent them to me, yes. I changed it at some point, but 
they sent me those clubs--well, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Were they oversized grips? 
 
A: They put on--when they sent them to me in May, they sent them 
to me with what they call arthritic grips.  
 
Q: Which were?  
 
A: Real big grips.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know the approximate diameter of those grips?  
 
A: No, but I think the name of them are arthrit---I think they call 
them arthritic grips, and that's the way they were sent to me from 
Callaway.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you play--you played golf Sunday on June 12, too, 
did you not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Did you wear day?  
 
A: During the course of the day, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Other than on the par 3s, can you think of a time when 
you were playing that you didn't have your glove on?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when you sent that bag off to Chicago the night of 
June 12th, was there one or more golf gloves in the bag, even?  
 
A: I hope so. 
 
Q: And I think you indicated you wear an Extra Extra Large? 
 
A:  Depending on the glove, as you know; you're a golfer. Some 
gloves I need XXL.  Some gloves I can wear Large. If they stretch, 
they just don't  last long because they tear. 
 
Q: Okay. And those snap over your wrist?  
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: Okay.  And generally golf gloves are soft leather?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And as you stated yourself, that you can stretch hem over your 
hand to fit, can you not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And I think when you--in giving your statement to the 
police on June 13th, 1994, you indicated that you would get nicks 
and things on your hands playing golf. Do you recall that?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Do you recall ever getting a nick or cut on your left hand with 
the golf glove on it any time June 11th or June 12th?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And had you played golf previous occasions that same 
week?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  What days were they?   
 
A: Every day.  
 
Q: And it's your usual practice, I assume, to wear a golf glove.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Except for par 3s?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: That was always on your left hand, was it not?  
 
A: Yes. MR. KELLY: Take a break?  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sure.  
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:56.  (Recess.)   
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 11:22.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: Mr. Simpson, I am going to just generally ask 
you about several people who I think are close to you in terms of 
friendship and the like, and we can just discuss them briefly.  With 
regard to Skip Taft--  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: -- how many years, approximately, have you known him   
 
A: 25 maybe.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you have a professional relationship with him  
 
A: Yes. He's my lawyer, what I call my  family lawyer and advisor, 
basically.  
 
Q: Okay. So is he a business manager, so to speak?  
 
A: You could say that, yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And as of June 12th, 1994, he had a general power of 
attorney from you, did he not?  
 
A: Possibly. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but possibly.  
 
Q: Would he enter into any contractual obligations for you or on 
your behalf without consulting you?  
 
A: Without consulting me?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: Okay. Does that hold true also for after June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: He may have without consulting me after June 12th, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Had you changed the power of attorney he had in any 
way?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, was he the business manager for Simpson 
Enterprises?  
 
A: Basically, yes.  
 
Q: And he would take care of all your --the personal type matters 
in terms of residence bills and things like that also?  
 
A: They would go across his desk, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And same--You had mentioned heating repair bills back 
a couple years. You indicated he would have them in his 
possession? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't think he- 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm totally lost, what you're talking about. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
Q: Well, when Mr. Petrocelli was taking your deposition, he was 
asking you about heating repairs that may have been done on your 
house in the last three years prior to June 12th 1994. 
 
 Do you recall that?  
 
A: I think it's something about me going to the back--me going to 
the back and lighting the pilot and stuff for my heaters.  
 
Q: Yeah.  And you indicated to check with someone regarding bills 
going back three years. Is that- 
 
  
 
A: I mean, if there's bills--I don't think I charged myself for 
lighting my heater, but if they're bills-  
 
Q: I wasn't asking you about billing  yourself, Mr. Simpson.  
 
A: Yeah, if they're bills concerning changing heaters or major bills, 
they would have gone through Skip's office, yes. 
 
 Okay. Does he actually write the check for the utility bills and the 
like?  
 
A: I think my--we had an accountant come through, and she 
probably wrote it. He may have signed them, yes. 
 
Q: But he keeps records of all those  
 
A: I believe-  
 
Q: --heating--I'm sorry.  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And so for, say, he would have records of all your 
heating bills that have been paid? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't speculate on what records he's got 
if you haven't seen them. 
 
 BY MR. KELLY:  Q: If you know.  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  Would those go to his office?  
 
A: In '91 if I had bills, they would have gone through his office, 
yes.  
 
Q: Would electric bills have gone through his office?  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Would phone bills have gone through his office?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: What about pool service bills?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: Tennis court maintenance?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: And do you know whether or not he kept permanent records of 
those bills that went through his office?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Now, Cathy Randa, how long have you known her for?  
 
A: About 20 years.  
 
Q: And has she worked for you for 20 years?  
 
A: The majority of the 20 years, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. In what capacity?  
 
A: An assistant.  
 
Q: Okay. At Simpson Enterprises?   
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Is that who she was an employee of?  
 
A: Orenthal Productions, Simpson  Enterprises, yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any substantial period of time she took a leave 
from that employment?  
 
A: What is "substantial"?  
 
Q: More than three weeks?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: More than a month?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: And for what purpose?  
 
A: Medical purposes. 
 
Q: Now--  
 
A: But she -- I paid her, you know, so she just wasn't able to be in 
the office and stuff.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall what the medical condition was?   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. It's invading her 
privacy.   
 
THE WITNESS: You'd have to ask her.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: A.C. Cowlings. 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. How long have you been-That's a childhood friend?  
 
A: Yes. Q: Okay. Would it be fair to say as of June 12th, 1994, he 
was one of your closest friends?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Jonah Wilson. How long had you known him for prior to 
June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: Maybe 15 years. That's a guess, but maybe 15 years.  
 
Q: Was he basically Arnelle's close friend?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: He wasn't a close friend of yours?  
 
A: He's a friend of my kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  Marcus Allen.  How long had you been friends with him 
for?  
 
A: Trying to think when he went to SC. --17-I mean till today, you 
mean? 17 years.  
 
Q: He would have been there in the late 70S wouldn't he, at USC?  
 
A: When he went to SC, and I can't --yeah, it would have been in 
the late 70s.  
 
Q: Well, you left in '69?  
 
A: Pardon me?  
 
Q: You left there in '69, didn't you?  
 
A: I left there in '69.   
 
Q: And he was 10 years behind you?  
 
A: At least, yeah.  
 
Q: All right. Would you have considered him as of June 12th, 1994 
one of your closest friends?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. What about Tawny Kitaen? Would you have considered 
her one of your closest friends as of June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: Closest, no, but friend, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And I think you indicated she was Cathy Randa's best 
friend?  
 
A: For a while for sure, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. By the way, how far did Tawny Kitaen live from your 
Rockingham residence in terms of miles? 
 
A: I don't know. She--when?  
 
Q: As of June 12th, 1994.  
 
A: It depends. I think she was living  between Newport Beach and 
Hollywood, so whatever Hollywood would be.  
 
Q: And she was in a 310 area code, as far as you know? A: Yes 
 
Q: Okay. Now, prior to June 12th, 1994 did you consider Cora 
Fishman a close friend of yours?   
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. How long had you known her for?  
 
A: As of what?  
 
Q: As of June 12th, 1994.  
 
A: Four, five years.  
 
Q: And what about Ron Fishman? Had you known him four or five 
years also?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And how would you come to befriend Ron and Cora Fishman?  
 
A: It had to do with Nicole and the kids.  
 
Q: In fact would it be fair to say that  prior to June 12th, 1994, 
Sydney was best friends with Cora's daughter?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And that friendship has  considered -- continued since 
June 12th, 1994, has it not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And did you know Cici Shahian at all? A:  Yeah, I met her, yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  You had no friendship with her, though, yourself?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Never called her on the phone? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A:  I may have when her father was dying, but ...  
 
Q:  What about Robin Greer? Did you have any sort of friendship 
with her?  
 
A: No. She was married to a friend of mine, and--years ago, and I 
think they had come by, and I used to have a lot of people over on 
weekends playing tennis, and then she was my ex-wife's sister's 
friend, so I knew her when she was an early teen, but not a friend 
of mine, no. 
 
Q:  Did you know Cici Shahian as a close friend of Nicole's in the 
last year or two prior to June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: She was a girl that was around. I don't know how close they 
were, but she was around. I'd see her around.  
 
Q: Okay. What about Robin Greer? Did you know her as a close 
friend of Nicole's in the two years prior to June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: I remember she was helping Nicole get a--A close friend, no, 
but I never-- I wouldn't socialize with her, so I don't know. But I 
would say no, not in the year I was back with her. 
 
 I know when Nicole went out, she may have seen her from time to 
time and I think once even spent the night at Nicole's house, but 
she wasn't a girl  Nicole hung out with, no.  
 
Q: What about Candice Garvey? 
 
A: Never hung out with Candice Garvey.  
 
Q: She wasn't friends with her?  
 
A: You'd see her at church and maybe Candice was a friend of 
Chris Jenner's, but Candice is not what I would call a friend of 
Nicole's, no.  
 
Q: What about Chris Jenner?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was she a close friend of Nicole 's?  
 
A: A friend, yes.  
 
Q: A close friend?  
 
A: A friend, I would say.  
 
Q: Okay. So the best of your knowledge, Cici Shahian was not a 
close friend of Nicole's?  
 
A: No. She was around. I guess when Cici was around Nicole, 
Nicole wasn't with me, and when Nicole and I came back together, 
I would see Cici around; but I think Nicole, I thought, had a 
falling-out with her at some point, and then I never saw her around 
after that.  
 
Q: In fact you indicated that you thought 
 
 Nicole had a falling-out with Linda Schulman also?  
 
A: Oh, I know--that's no secret with anybody. Nicole wouldn't talk 
to her for the last four years.  
 
Q: Four years?  
 
A: Three or four years, whenever my kids-- Sydney was starting 
school.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: From that point on Nicole did not 
 
speak to Linda Schulman, and hasn't as far as I know, and as far as 
I'm sure the Browns have told you.  
 
Q: Told me what?  
 
A: That Nicole would not speak to Linda Schulman.  
 
Q: Okay. And as far as you know, Robin Greer wasn't a close 
friend of Nicole's? 
 
A:  No.  I think when she went out, Robin was around.  I know 
Nicole mentioned to me in 1994 that; Robin had a relapse or 
something, a drug relapse, I believe, something to that effect. 
 
Q:  And you know Candice Garvey wasn't a close friend.  
 
A:  I know that. I know that for a fact. An acquaintance, at best. 
 
Q:  And Chris Jenner wasn't a close friend?   
 
A: Chris Jenner was a friend. 
 
Q: Okay. What about Cora Fishman? 
 
A: Her best friend.  
 
Q: Close friend? 
 
A: Nicole's?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A:  Her best friend. 
 
Q:  Okay. So other than all these people we just discussed, the only 
close friend you know of of Nicole's was Cora Fishman- A: Yeah.  
 
Q: - as of June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: And Chris -- Chris, yes, was a friend. I don't know if they went 
out much, but Chris was a friend. I know she knew Chris longer 
than any of these people, but they weren't--they were friendly 
because of Bob and I being friendly in the past. Nicole didn't really 
socialize with her away from that, and I think Nicole may have 
socialized with Chris more when Nicole and I split.  
 
Q: Okay. Well, I mean, Nicole was a rather social person, wasn't 
she? 
 
A: Not with girls, no.  That just started recently. She would always 
have a best friend--and she would always have one best friend and- 
 
Q:  Who was her best friend before-It's your testimony Cora was 
her best friend?  
 
A: During the last four years of her life, Cora was definitely her 
best friend.  
 
Q: And who was her best friend prior to Cora, if you know?  
 
A: I would think Linda Schulman for a while, for a couple years, 
and then for about seven or eight years, Suzie Kehoe .  
 
Q: Okay. As of June 12th, 1994, other than Cora Fishman could 
you tell me any other close friends Nicole had?  
 
A: I would--when I came back into her life, as of June 4, I would 
say Faye was considered a friend. As I said, when we first got back 
together, Cici was around.  Then all of a sudden I never saw Cici 
around for probably all of '94. Cora was the one I saw all the time 
with her. 
 
Q:  By the way, you still see Cora all the time, don't you? 
 
A: All the time, no.  
 
Q: Often?  
 
A: Basically when my kids are around.  
 
Q: Okay. Have you taken any family trips with her and her 
children since October 3rd, 1995?   
 
A: No. Her kids have come with me on trips, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Cora didn't go along?  
 
A: No. I think she brought her daughter to Santa Barbara once 
when I was staying with the Steinmans up there, and she brought 
her daughter up.  
 
Q: Okay. Getting back to what I think was the question I was 
asking, could you tell me other than Cora any other close friends 
Nicole had as of June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: I didn't know who she was hanging out with, so I can't tell you 
other --I would see her with Cora. Obviously Faye and Christian 
when we went out, we'd have dinner with them. Outside of that, 
I'm sure that, you know, people--when she went out, I know they 
went out with girls. So since I never saw them out as a group ever, 
so I have no idea who the girls were, even though I know Robin 
sometimes was involved. I don't  think Chris Jenner was involved 
in the going out portion. 
 
I think some old friends of ours,  Victoria--what's Victoria's--
Gordon White's ex-wife--or wife--he's passed--would join them. I 
think a girl named Marianna, used to go out with 
 
 Reggie McKenzie, I saw her a week before, and she said 
something about her and Nicole were friends again or  something. 
 
 But, see, I never saw Nicole when she  went out, and when she 
didn't go out, she was with me, and when I was around, the only 
people I would see  would be the Fishmans and sometimes Faye 
and Christian.  And, of course, the Jenners if we--if they went on a 
trip with us.  
 
Q: And between April of 1993 and May of 1994 when you and 
Nicole had reconciled, other than the Fishmans or Faye and 
Christian Reichardt, can you tell me any other couples you 
socialized with?  
 
A: Say that again. I'm sorry.  
 
Q: Well, during the reconciliation period, April '93 to May of 
1994, can you tell me any couples other than the Fishmans and 
Faye Resnick and Christian Reichardt you used to socialize with?  
 
A: The Jenners.  
 
Q: Anybody other than the Jenners?  
 
A: Couples? None that I can think of right now.  
 
Q: And what about just in general terms, that couple years, say, 
between '90 and '92 before your initial breakup?   
 
A: The people we socialized with?  
 
Q: Yeah.  Just, you know, who you go on vacation with or go out 
to dinner with or hang with if you were going to hang with other 
couples.  
 
A: The Schwartzes, Alan Schwartz and his wife . Years previous, 
Suzie and Billy Kehoe. Bob Kardashian and Chris. Allen Austin 
and whoever he was  dating.  Wayne Hughes and his wife. We're 
going back a number of years for that one.  
 
Q: Right.  That's okay.  
 
A: And then, you know, her family. Nicole's family was around a 
lot, especially when we were dating.  
 
Q: They were close, weren't they?  
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: Okay. The other day when you indicated that a couple of 
Nicole's closest friends, I think one you had mentioned, Susan 
Kehoe?  
 
A: Suzie Kehoe, yes.  
 
Q: Suzie Kehoe. And that was generally before 1992, was it not?  
 
A: Well, I saw Suzie--when Nicole and I got back, I saw Suzie. It 
was the first time I had seen Suzie in a while, but they were best 
friends probably our first eight years or so together. Then 
 
Suzie moved, so that kinda changed, and I think they were just 
seeing each other sporadically after that  
 
Q: Okay. So they weren't close friends as you knew it, say, in June 
of 1994?  
 
A: See, I disagree with you.  You know,  because I rarely saw A.C, 
but he's still considered my best friend. So I would think that they 
were still close even though they didn't see each other a lot.  
 
Q: So they didn't--I will rephrase my question, Mr. Simpson.  As 
far as you knew, Nicole didn't spend much time with Suzie Kehoe 
in, say, 1993 and 1994?  
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  And as far as Pam Schwartz went, as far as you know, Nicole 
didn't spend much time with Pam Schwartz in 1993 and 1994?  
 
A: As much as she always did, you know, which was, you know, 
when the kids were doing something, you know, but I don't think 
Pam went out  with the girls.  And I never saw them when they 
were out, so I can't tell you who was with them when they went 
out. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, this will all be regarding June of 1994 now. I am 
just going to ask you some questions about phones and phone 
numbers. 
 
A: Okay.  
 
Q: Could you tell me what the phone number was or phone 
numbers were at your Rockingham residence?  
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was it [Deleted]?  
 
A: That sounds right.  
 
Q: Okay. And I am going to ask all these as of June 12th, 1994.  
Does that sound right?  
 
A: That sounds right. 
 
Q:  Did you have more than one number at that time?  
 
A: I don't think so.  
 
Q: Do you know whether you had rollover capability at that 
number?  
 
A: I may have, but I don't know. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you have any outside phones at your Rockingham 
residence?  
 
A: What do you mean?  
 
Q: Well, did you have a phone jack, say, at your cabana?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have a phone jack near your tennis court?   
 
A: Well, the cabana and the tennis court are together.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have a phone jack on any outside terraces? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: With Simpson Enterprises, do you recall the phone number 
there?  
 
A: I think it was [Deleted].  
 
Q: Could you tell me what number, was [Deleted]?  
 
A: Say it again.  
 
Q: Area code [Deleted]?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And what was the Simpson Enterprises number again?  
 
A: [Deleted].  
 
Q: And was there a cellular phone listed to Simpson Enterprises?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Do you recall that number? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Would it have been area code  [Deleted]?  
 
A: Doesn't sound like my phone, no.  
 
Q: There was a cellular phone registered to 
 
 Simpson Enterprises, though?  
 
A: I don't know. I don't know what my phone was registered to.  
 
Q: But there was a cellular phone that you used or had access to 
other than the one you always carried with you and had with you in 
Chicago on June  13th, was there not?  
 
A: I don't think so.  
 
Q: Does this phone number, and I will state again, mean anything 
to you at this time as you sit there: Area code 213-712 8836?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you know whether Cathy Randa had a cellular 
phone?  
 
A: She did. I mean she had a car phone.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know the number now?  
 
A: No, I don't recall it now, but don't think that was it.  
 
Q: No? Okay. And your cellular phone was [Deleted]? 
 
A:  I believe so. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, when you got to O'Hare Airport on the morning of 
June 13, 1994, did you make any calls from a pay phone there?  
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: And did Arnelle have a separate phone number where she 
stayed at Rockingham? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And did Kato have a separate number where he stayed at 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: You've testified earlier as to a number of calls you either made 
or received when you were at the Plaza Hotel the morning of June 
12th, 1994.  Correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Could you tell me when you made your first phone call 
after leaving your room in the Plaza Hotel?  
 
A:  I believe it was when I was down stairs looking or waiting for a 
cab and when waiting for the Hertz guy to arrive. 
 
Q: That's Merrill from Hertz?  
 
A: Pardon me?  
 
Q: Merrill?  
 
A: Yes. I believe so.  
 
Q: Is he the one who took you to the  airport, by the way?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. He never arrived, did he?   
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you ever speak to him? 
 
A: The next day.  
 
Q: Okay. But not on the 13th?  
 
A: Well, I spoke to him a number of times on the 13th.  Yeah, a 
number of times.  
 
Q: Before you left the Plaza?  
 
A: Before I left my room, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall who you called on your first cellular call 
after you left your hotel room?  
 
A: No. May have been Merrill, but I don't really recall.  
 
Q: Okay. And you just took a regular cab to the airport from the 
Plaza?   
 
THE WITNESS: Didn't we talk about this?  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've been over this in detail. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am leaving that. I am just- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Just answer that question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Okay. Did you talk to anybody other than 
Denise Brown when you called her that morning?   
 
A: The first call? 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: By the way, did you as of June 17, 1994 have a safety deposit 
box?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Was there anybody other than you who had access to that?  
 
A: Maybe Skip Taft.  
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me what you kept in there?   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to answer that.   
 
THE WITNESS: No.   
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: Did you keep any currency in there?   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You don't have to tell him that.   
 
MR. KELLY: You instruct him not to answer?   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Yes.   
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Do you know how many times you called Kato before you left 
Chicago on the 13th? 
 
A: I don't know if I did call Kato before I left, but I wouldn't know 
how many times. I know I 
 
never got him. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know how many times, approximately, you 
called Cathy Randa before you arrived back in Los Angeles?  
 
A:  No.  I know I kept trying and kept  getting disconnected or 
machines or stuff, but no. 
 
Q:  Did you ever have any conversations with her before you got 
back to Los Angeles?  
 
A:  Yes, I believe so. Q:  More than one?  
 
A:  I believe so. Q:  Would it be fair to say you talked to her for 
approximately 20 minutes total? A: Could have been. It could have 
been. I don't know. Q:  Okay. And you made a number of phone 
calls to Skip Taft?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: Okay. Would it be fair to say that you spoke to him for 
approximately 20 minutes total before you got back to L.A.?  
 
A: You know, I don't know.  
 
Q: But you spoke to him more than once?  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, do you know where Jonah 
 
 Wilson's office is located?  
 
A: I didn't know he had an office.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know where his home is located?  
 
A: No  
 
Q: Do you know--Do you remember calling him the morning of 
June 13th from your American Airlines flight? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: No-  
 
A: Wherever Arnelle was, I know I was looking for Arnelle and-  
 
Q: Okay. Did you find Arnelle?  
 
A: I think I did, but I just don't recall.  I know I talked to her 
earlier. You know, I talked to her when I found out. I think I talked 
to her one time after that, but I just don't recall. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know any reason why you would have had two 
approximately five-minute phone calls with Jonah Wilson for any 
reason?  
 
A:  If I talked to him for five minutes, it would have been Arnelle 
or seeing that he would take care of Arnelle, because Arnelle was 
in a bad way, but  I don't recall having a five-minute phone call 
with Jonah, no. 
 
Q:  Do you remember having a five minute-- one or more five-
minute phone calls with Arnelle?  
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q: And therefore you recall none of the details of any conversation 
you had with her?  
 
A: I'm sure it was all about how she was feeling and how I was 
feeling and the kids. If we spoke, that would have been the topic. 
 
Q:  Okay. So you wouldn't have discussed anything about June 
12th, 1994, the evening, would you?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. You wouldn't have discussed anything about what the 
police may have been doing at your house at Rockingham in those 
discussions either, would you? 
 
A: I don't think so, but if the police were there, I may have--I may 
have asked, but I don't think so.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever actually speak to Marcus Allen when you 
were on your flight coming back to Los Angeles? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you speak to someone at his house?   
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q: You never spoke to Howard Weitzman before you got back to 
the Rockingham residence on June 13th, did you? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You just answer that yes or no. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY 
 Q:  Okay. Was Howard Weitzman at your residence at 
Rockingham when you arrived home on June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: At some point when I was home, I saw Howard, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And was Howard Weitzman the attorney who had 
represented you after the New Year's Day 1989 incident?  
 
A: That's correct.  
 
Q: Okay. I think you indicated earlier, with the phone calls you 
made on the way back to L A., you were trying to get people to get 
by Bundy and  Rockingham and help out. Is that correct?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you recall making any calls to any friend of Nicole's 
between the time you left the Plaza Hotel in Chicago and you 
arrived back to Rockingham 
 
that afternoon?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And who was that?  
 
A: My daughter, A.C, Skip, Marcus Allen, the people I called.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you make any calls to Paula Barbieri?  
 
A: I may have, but I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall ever speaking to her?  
 
A: I didn't.  
 
Q: Could you tell me the subject matter of the conversations you 
had with Cathy Randa when you got her on the phone before 
getting back to  Los Angeles?  
 
A: Getting back to L.A. 
 
Q: Just the arrangements about getting you back?  
 
A: Yeah. And I may--we may have  commiserated. We may have 
commiserated.  
 
Q: Anything other than that?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you call any neighbors of Nicole's before you got back to 
Rockingham that day?  
 
A: I don't know any of her neighbors. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you give any detective or anybody the Browns' 
phone number when you spoke to them? 
 
A:  I may have. If they asked, I would have given it to them.  
 
Q:  Okay. Mr. Simpson, do-- do-does the number area code 
[Deleted] mean anything to you as of June 13th, 1994?  
 
A: Say it again. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can you repeat the number? 
 
MR. KELLY: [Deleted] 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. Do you recall dialing that number at any time on the 
13th?  
 
A: I don't recall, no. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Does the number area code [Deleted] mean anything to 
you as of June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: [Deleted] 
 
Q: [Deleted] 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: ---[Deleted] 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And you at this time as of 
 
 June 13th, 1994, had no idea who had the Simpson Enterprises 
cellular phone?  
 
A: If mine was under Simpson Enterprises, it would have been my 
phone. 
 
(Peter Gelblum enters the deposition.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. But you didn't have more than one cellular phone with 
you, did you?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: And as I said, Cathy had a phone, but it was a car phone.  
 
Q: Do you know what the number was of that car?  
 
A:  I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Was it in the name of Simpson  Enterprises, the car phone?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  You've already asked that question, Dan. 
You didn't miss it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I didn't think so. I was starting to worry, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't be concerned. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Because thought I had redefined tedium 
 
MR. KELLY: See, these guys are shopping for a sound bite on 
tedium today when they're out of the loop. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: John, the truth is in the details, but keep 
going. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Somebody said that even before you did.   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You did?   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No. I said "Somebody said that even 
before you did." He was a philosopher, I thought. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I thought I made it up. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q: What about the number with area code 
[Deleted]. 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q: By the way, did you have a little phone book or something with 
you on that flight coming back from Chicago? 
 
A: I had my phone book, I believe, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Where is that phone book now, if you know?  
 
A:  I think LAPD has it. 
 
Q:  Okay. Who is Stuart Blasnick? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Never heard of him.  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Just take one minute. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Gonna wrap it up before lunch, huh?   
 
MR. KELLY: What, about these phone calls? I'll try to.   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: About everything maybe.   
 
MR. KELLY: Baker, I wouldn't want you to have free time on 
your hands.   
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That may be truer than you know.   
 
MR. KELLY: My mind is wandering already.   
 
THE WITNESS: Isn't Stuart Blasnick the guy running against 
Garcetti? I think that's who that is. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
Q:  Who? Stuart Blasnick?  
 
A: Yeah. Q:  Who is it? I'm sorry.  
 
A: The guy running against Garcetti? Isn't that--  
 
Q: Probably. Probably be the first call you made.  Did you have 
occasion to go to your  office the night of the 13th? 
 
A:  No. Oh, the night--no.  
 
Q:  The night of the 14th?  
 
A:  The day of the 14th.-  
 
Q:  Day of the 14th. Did you make any calls from there when you 
were there that day?  
 
A:  Did I make any?  
 
Q: Yeah. A:  No. 
 
Q: And on the 13th you were not in your office at all?  
 
A: 13th, yes.  
 
Q: In the evening?  
 
A: Yeah, I guess early afternoon.  
 
Q: Do you recall being there at about a quarter of 7:00 that 
evening?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you give anybody access to that office? 
 
A:  Whoever always have access to it.  
 
Q:  And who is that?  Cathy? 
 
A: Cathy, the cleaning crew, what ever.  
 
Q: Okay. And the number [Deleted] means nothing to you?  
 
A: Nothing to me, no. Could be 
 
Cathy's 
 
 mother. I don't know. That's a guess, though.  
 
Q: Okay. Mr. Simpson, Nicole left you on January 6, 1992. Is that 
correct? 
 
A:  She asked for a separation then, yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Prior to January 6th, 1992 would you talk to her mother, 
Judy Brown, on a regular basis?  
 
A: Semi-regular. Not a hell of a lot, but  yes, I talked to her, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Would you call her of your own initiative on occasion 
prior to January 6th, 1994 (sic)? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Would that happen more than once a month? 
 
A:  I don't know.  It depends what was going on with Nicole and I. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall after January 6th, 1992, you began to call 
her more frequently?  
 
A:  All the time. 
 
Q:  You'd call her all the time? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. I mean, there were days when you would speak to her 
every day, would you not? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Days when he would speak to her every 
day? That's pretty good. That's a Kelly 
 
question. 
 
MR. KELLY: I hope it's a sound bite. I mean, I've been polishing 
that up for a couple days now. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You want to rephrase that? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes, I will, Mr. Baker. 
 
Q:  Did you speak to her almost every day between January 6th, 
1992 and between October 992 when your divorce became final?  
 
A: No, but if you shorten that period, I spoke to her a heck of a lot 
and more than one time a n day till about May or June, and then it 
curtailed. 
 
Q: Okay.  And were there some times that you called Judy Brown 
three or four times a day?  
 
A: As I said, sometimes I called her often during the day, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Were there ever occasions you may have called her even 
10 times a day? 
 
A: I don't think so, but I talked to her  often, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And would you call there ever to discuss Nicole with 
her?  
 
A: The majority of the time. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there ever times you called there looking for 
Nicole? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Never?  
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Were there ever times you called her to speak to 
Nicole?  
 
A: I can't say never.  I called there  looking for my kids once when 
I was in Houston, I believe, when I was in Houston, I believe, but, 
you know, I was talking to Nicole, so I -- pretty much whenever I 
called, if Nicole was around and the kids were around, I talked to 
her.  If it was a weekend and I called, if I was on the road and I 
called home and they weren't there, I'd call Laguna to see if they 
were in Laguna, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. But there was never a time you called the Browns' 
residence to speak to Nicole other than when it concerned the kids? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Yeah. If they were not around for a weekend and I was 
out of town and I called and they weren't at her house, sometimes 
she would leave a message she was in Laguna, and I would call 
Judy. Sometimes they didn't leave a message. But if I  called a day 
or two and couldn't get her at her house, I'd see if they were in 
Laguna. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you ever call Judy wanting to know where Nicole 
was? 
 
A: On a weekend or so, yes.  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you ever call Judy wanting to know whether Nicole 
was out with her friends dancing or partying at all?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And you never called to ask Judy if Nicole was out doing 
anything in particular in the evenings?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever-  
 
A: Nicole wasn't in Laguna too often. I think she was in Laguna 
during the summer maybe, and by then her and I had gone--totally 
gone our separate ways.  
 
Q: Okay. But prior to that you never recall calling down there and 
looking for Nicole when she was out?  
 
A:  No.  Looking for the kids or her if they were in Laguna, but not 
looking for her if she was out, no.  
 
Q: And not looking to see what she was doing? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you remember calling Judy Brown during the same 
time period, January to, say, June of 992, from your cellular 
phone?  
 
A:  Oh, I'm sure I did, yes.  
 
Q:  And would that be the cellular phone you'd have in the car with 
you also?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Do you recall ever calling Judy Brown from outside Nicole's 
house on Gretna Green when you were in the car? 
 
A:  I believe I've talked to her numerous times going to or coming 
from Nicole's house, so there may have been a time or two that I 
was arriving at  Nicole's house and we're cutting off the 
conversation or I had just left Nicole's house, so that could have  
happened, yes.  
 
Q: Were there ever times you went to Nicole's house and never 
even went to the door and parked out front and called Judy Brown? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Never happened?  
 
A:  Never happened.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Would you be able to approximate the number of times 
you called Judy Brown between January 6, 1994 and, say, mid 
June 1994? 
 
A:  No.  It would be a lot, but I couldn't  approximate it, no. 
 
Q:  Would it be fair to say it would be more than a hundred?  
 
A:  I don't know.  
 
Q:  Now, we're talking a six-month period.  
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Would it be fair to say it was more than several hundred phone 
calls?  
 
A:  I don't know.  
 
Q:  I am sorry.  1992.  
 
A: We're talking '92, yes.  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question was '94. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't know. I know I talked to Judy a lot. She 
was-  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: All right. Let's go back. Let's go back.   
 
THE WITNESS: All of this is  
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Wait a minute, Juice. Let's go back. He 
asked you 1994. Mr. Petrocelli said 1992. You said 1992. Why 
don't we go back and redo these questions and get a straight answer 
or get what his recollection was if he has one. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: We've been talking about this time period where you made a lot 
of phone calls to Judy Brown. Correct?  
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  
 
Q: And was this the period between January 6, 1992 and June 
1992?  
 
A: Yeah, roughly in that period, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And after the conversation we just had about going to or 
leaving Gretna Green and calling her on the cellular phone, we are 
talking about the  same period in 1992. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yeah. Quite often, if I left my office or if I was going to 
Nicole's, I'd talk to Judy, and, you know, because I had arrived, I 
would cut the conversation off or vice versa.  
 
Q:  Okay. After June of 1992 did you  continue to call Judy Brown 
at all?  
 
A:  Occasionally. You know, I was still  going through the divorce 
and a couple of things came up from time to time, and I would talk 
to her occasionally, yes.  
 
Q:  Would you call her concerning Nicole?  
 
A:  Well, at that point I didn't want to get back with Nicole;  we 
had kind of moved on. But, you know, you get used to talking to 
somebody. You talk a lot of times. It was about what was going on 
in the Browns' family or in my family, and obviously Nicole  
would come up from time to time in those conversations.  
 
Q:  That wasn't the purpose of the phone calls?  
 
A:  No. It was just-- it was almost habit at that point in time. But 
then. as I said, after June it kind of cut back because I was in 
another relationship.  
 
Q: And did you have a speed dial apparatus on your cellular 
phone?  
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Okay. What about your home phone?  
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Okay. Between June of 1992 and March of 1993, did you ever 
call Judy Brown looking for Nicole? 
 
A:  June? When I came back from-I don't know.  Maybe if I--
maybe in August, you know. I mean, I'm always looking for the 
kids.  When you say,  "looking for Nicole," you make it looking 
for Nicole.  
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Nicole was always with my kids, so I would be looking for my 
kids. So there is a possibility that during the summer-that fall I was 
at the Olympics. I don't know if I Called Judy from the Olympics 
at some point because I couldn't get  Nicole, to find out where they 
were.  I mean, there could have been a time or so I may have called 
saying, "Is Nicole or the kids around?" There could have been. 
Yeah, that could have happened.  
 
Q: Okay. Between January and June of 1992 do you remember 
calling the Browns and speaking to Lou Brown at all concerning 
Nicole?  
 
A: Not much, no. I mean, if Lou answered the phone, we did our 
pleasantries and--but basically I talked to Judy.  
 
Q: Okay. Not Denise?  
 
A: Not Denise, no. On--one conversation I had with Denise once, 
but basically it was with Judy.  
 
Q: When was that?  
 
A: It was when I had gotten word from my lawyers that there may 
be some allegations of abuse or battery. This was during the point 
that they were  trying to get rid of my prenuptial agreement.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And you called Denise specifically?  
 
A:  I talked to Judy, and I wanted to speak 
 
to Denise, and then Denise came on the phone.  
 
Q: And did you speak to her?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall the substance of the conversation?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: What was that?  
 
A: I mentioned to Denise that Nicole might have been--might have 
been claiming that we had--I think it's a conversation Nicole and I 
had--I don't  recall--about what Denise eventually changed her 
story on the stand and said I pushed Nicole out of a  door in '92, 
but at this particular time Denise--her recollection was that it was 
Nicole that was the physical one and I didn't do anything. That was 
her recollection at that time . So it was a little different than it 
turned out to be.  
 
Q: Was this the--I assume this was the incident in the early '80s 
you spoke of earlier where you got home with Denise, Ed McCabe 
and Nicole-  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: --to your residence at Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  And when you say Nicole was "physical," what did she do that 
night when you got back to 
 
Rockingham?  
 
A:  At some point while I was at the  staircase she was hitting me, 
and I grabbed the banister and I said, "Denise, your sister's getting 
physical? So I just held the banister with my back to her 
(Indicating).  
 
Q:  Okay.  I think you had mentioned earlier something about 
pictures or-  
 
A: Yeah. Yeah. Then at the bottom of the stairs she slung off the 
pictures (Indicating), yeah.  
 
Q: You showed the back of your hand. They were on a table?  
 
A: Well, it may have been--I don't know how she did it.  I'm just--
she just knocked off the pictures that were on the table, yes.  
 
Q: Was that after she had been hitting you when you were on the 
staircase? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And did you do something in--She was sort of wrecking 
the house, wasn't she, Nicole?  
 
A: No. It was the entry. She broke some pictures. She may have--
she broke some pictures at the--I don't know if she broke--she 
threw them  down. Maybe a frame there cracked or something.  
 
Q: In your mind, was Nicole out of control at that point? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you get any closer to him, Mr. 
Petrocelli, people will start talking. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'll be very sick if he gets any closer, the way he 's 
hacking away. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I cannot shake this thing. I went to the 
doctor's last night, too. He said I'm on the road to recovery. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: And you just don't think you are. Shall 
we break for lunch? What do you want to do? Do you want to go 
ahead? Whatever you want to do. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, we'll break. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Baker looks hungry. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am hungry as a matter of fact.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
Q: Mr. Simpson, I believe right before we broke for lunch we were 
discussing an incident at Rockingham in the early '80s where I 
think you had indicated Nicole was a little bit out of control in 
your house after you had gotten home one night with  Denise 
Brown, Ed McCabe, yourself and Nicole. Is that correct?   
 
A:  That's correct. 
 
Q:  And I think you indicated at one point you were holding on to 
the stair railing and she was hitting you?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And was it after that she went and did something with the 
photographs? 
 
A: Yeah, as we got to the bottom of the stairs. 
 
Q: What did she do? 
 
A: Just knocked them off the table that was there. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Was she yelling or anything at that point? 
 
A: She may have been.  I don't recall. 
 
Q: Okay. And where were Denise and Ed McCabe at this point?  
 
A:  I think Ed was standing in the doorway, and Denise was 
standing-she was inside the house.  I know that. But we were all in 
the same area.  
 
Q:  And you didn't hit Nicole at that time, did you?  
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: You didn't push her or put her in a headlock? 
 
A:  No.  I grabbed her arms at the door and put her outside the 
door.  
 
Q:  Okay.  How close was she to the door when you put her outside 
the door?  
 
A: We were just in my entry, so three. four feet maybe.  
 
Q: Okay. You had no problem with just taking her by the shoulders 
and putting her outside the front door?  
 
A: None.  
 
Q: Okay.  She didn't push her war back inside?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  She didn't wrestle out of grip? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Didn't get away? 
 
A:  Get away? 
 
Q:  She didn't try to come back in, did she?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, going to Mother's Day of 1994, do you remember 
if any time after that date you called Judy Brown?  
 
A: No. Q:  You don't know?  
 
A:  I don't know, no. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know at any time after May 22nd you called 
Judy Brown?  
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Do you recall having any telephonic discussions with Judy 
Brown in May of 1994?  
 
A:  I know I did the early part of May when Nicole and I split 
because I was real concerned, and I may have talked to Judy about 
the pneumonia. I may  have.  I really don't recall, but I may have . 
 
Q: Well, when you say you talked to her about the split, do you 
remember the substance of that conversation at all? 
 
A: I was concerned about whatever was going on in Nicole's life.  
 
Q: Okay. This would have been after  Mother's Day then? 
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: Do you recall whether it was a long conversation or relatively 
brief?  
 
A: I don't recall. It could have been long, though. I mean, we 
talked-Judy had a lot of concerns, too, and when Judy and I talked, 
you know,  the substance may have started about Nicole, but then 
you end up talking about family and kids and everything.You 
know, you end up just having family conversation. 
 
Q:  Okay. Is it your impression she likes to talk a lot?  
 
A: Yeah. I'm sure you've found that out. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: OJ. doesn't, though. 
 
 MR. KELLY: I know. I was going to say. She found a good 
listener. Right? 
 
THE WITNESS:  Judy's a conversationalist.  She's very social 
verbally, and so am I. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
Q:  Okay.  Regarding Faye Resnick, do you recall whether you 
used any names other than your own when you called her house to 
speak to her?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: When someone else would answer the phone, you never used 
any code names or anything? 
 
A: Only other person that lived with her was Christian, and if I 
called to speak to Christian, it was me, yeah.  
 
Q: Any children in the house?  
 
A: She has a little girl.  
 
Q: Do you know how old she is?  
 
A: Sydney's age, I believe, so she may be around 10. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether or not she --Faye's 
 
 little girl was friends with Sydney?  
 
A:  When I say "friends," you know, if Nicole and Faye were 
together, then she would be around. She wasn't one of the--it was--
you know, I rarely saw  her unless Faye was around. She wasn't 
someone who-- Sydney and her would play together all the time.  
She as a girl that was around if Faye was around. At least when I 
was around.  
 
Q: So Faye's daughter was more or less incidental to the friendship 
between Faye and Nicole?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  On the other hand, with regard to Cora and Nicole, Sydney and 
Cora's daughters were very good friends?  
 
A: Very good friends, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. In 1994, in fact we'll say May 1994, did you ever call 
Faye Resnick to discuss Nicole?  
 
A: In May? 
 
Q: May. 
 
A: I don't recall. I know Faye had a few conversations with me 
telling me that Nicole was in love with me, and I was back with 
Paula. That came up few times. I know-  
 
Q: Do you know when that was? I' m sorry. 
 
A:  I don't know.  I don't recall.  
 
Q: Well, in April 199-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Did you get that, David? Did you get the 
conversation of Mr. Petrocelli kind of coaching- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not coaching. 
 
MR. KELLY: Hardly coaching, Mr. Baker, although you'd like the 
record to reflect, perhaps. Hardly coaching.  
 
Q: Do you recall getting any--making any calls in April 1994 to 
Faye Resnick- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Sensitive there, aren't you, John? 
 
MR. KELLY: Very. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I apologize. He wasn't coaching you. 
 
MR. KELLY: Thank you. I feel much better.  
 
Q: In April 1994 do you recall making any calls to Faye Resnick to 
discuss Nicole?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Do you know on how many occasions?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And do you recall where you were when you called her?  
 
A: Probably in my hotel room.   
 
Q: In Puerto Rico?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Do you know whether you called her more than once?  
 
A: Yes, more than once.  
 
Q: Do you know whether you called her more than twice?  
 
A: The problem being sometimes I would call to talk to Christian, 
and Faye and I would end up talking or begin talking if she 
answered the phone. 
 
Q:  Do you know how many-  
 
A:  But I know--I'm sorry.  
 
Q:  Well, how long were you in Puerto Rico for in April '94?  
 
A: A month.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: Roughly.  
 
Q: Do you know how many times you called Christian from there?  
 
A: If I called--I don't know.  
 
Q: Well, combining Faye and Christian together, do you know how 
many times in the month of April you called that residence where 
Faye and Christian were at? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Was it more than five times?  
 
A:  It would have been I would think at least five times. Especially 
in one particular week maybe at least five times. 
 
Q:  Well, you think there was one particular week you called there 
at least five times in that week?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: What week was that? 
 
A: My second week in Puerto Rico.  
 
Q: And is there any particular reason you remember those calls in 
that week? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And what's that?  
 
A: Because Nicole was saying she was having a nervous 
breakdown and she couldn't explain why, and I was trying to find 
out from her friends why, what was going on.  
 
Q:  And do you recall what you discussed with Faye about that?  
 
A:  Just what was going on.  
 
Q:  And what did Faye tell you?  
 
A:  In the beginning she said nothing, that Nicole was so happy; 
she had spent a great weekend with me before we left and that she 
was looking forward to coming to--meeting me in Miami. Then it 
went to Cora. Mostly Faye was blaming Cora for--she was saying, 
"Cora's driving us all crazy," and basically, you know-- or, "I'll talk 
to Nicole."  And I said, "Well, see what's happening, because I 
could tell something's going on, something's wrong with Nicole." 
And she would say, "I'll find out or "I'll call you back. "I think she 
might have left me a message once or twice to call. Essentially that 
was it." 
 
Q:  Did you ever find out what, if anything, in particular was 
causing Nicole to have this nervous breakdown? 
 
A:  Nicole just said it was pressure.  That's what she--when Nicole 
at one point called and apologized to me right before I came home 
and wanted to pick me up at the airport, and after I got home I 
wanted to-well, I forced the issue, and she never could explain it. 
She just said sometimes she just felt she was--you know, maybe 
this thirties thing. It was something we had talked about from time 
to time, and  she never could explain it, but she was aware that she-
-because she apologized to me about the way she was acting, and 
she could never--that's why I was trying to get her to go to therapy 
again, because she could never explain it.  
 
Q:  What about Faye?  Did she ever get back to you with an 
explanation? 
 
A:  Faye, as I said, continually blamed Cora. Continually blamed 
Cora.  
 
Q:  And in what sense? 
 
A:  That the problems Cora was having with her husband, and Cora 
was doing this and Ron was calling, and Nicole was, you know, 
you know, involved in whatever was going on with the two of 
them, trying to help Ron, trying to help Cora, and, you know, she 
was blaming everything on Cora.  
 
Q: Was it your understanding that certain things Cora was doing 
was causing Nicole a lot of anxiety?  
 
A: I couldn't believe that. I mean, it don't make sense to me. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  OJ., listen to the question. Answer the 
question and no more than that. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Q:  What hotel were you staying at in Puerto 
 
Rico, by the way?  
 
A:  I don't recall. 
 
Q:  Do you recall what city it was in?  
 
A:  San Juan. 
 
Q:  Do you recall what street or anything?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did anybody ever call you from-Strike that question. Now, you 
indicated you had made at least five calls to Faye during one 
particular week. 
 
A:  Could have been- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Five to the house where Christian and 
Faye resided, or the place. 
 
THE WITNESS: YES.  YES. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Q:  Okay.  In addition to those five phone calls, 
do you remember any additional calls being made to that house?  
 
A: No.  I'd say, yeah, around that amount of time, but I can't tell 
you. I don't know. 
 
Q:  Now, other than those five phone calls that one week, do you 
remember calling there any other times? 
 
A:  It may not have been one week.  It may have been over--yeah, a 
little over or a little less 
 
than a week, but I just know that one week it was very active going 
back and forth, calling both ways. 
 
Q: Those are the only phone calls you recall to that house during 
your period in Puerto Rico?  
 
A: You know, as I said. Christian and I were doing some stuff 
with--for the Playboy thing. He was having a thing made, and, you 
know, I talked to  him a few times. So, you know, there were--I 
don't know. I don't recall.  
 
Q:  When you were in Puerto Rico, did you ever call Cora 
Fishman?  
 
A: I called Ron Fishman a few times. I don't--I can't recall if I ever 
talked to Cora Fishman.  
 
Q: And you indicated that in the second week in April that Nicole 
was-  
 
A: Was my second week down there. I don't know if it was the 
second week in April, but it was my second week in Puerto Rico. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And she was having something like a nervous 
breakdown, she indicated to you.  
 
A: That's what she said. But she was acting like it.  
 
Q: Okay. And Cora Fishman was her best friend at this time? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you made several phone calls to the Resnick-Reichardt 
residence?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: And you recall no phone conversations with Cora?  
 
A: No. I know I talked to Ron quite a bit because I was just trying 
to be a friend to him.  
 
Q: But Ron wasn't friends with Nicole, was he?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Close friends?  
 
A: Yes. But I wasn't talking to Ron about Nicole. 
 
Q: Okay. And you weren't talking to Cora about Nicole. 
 
A: I don't think I talked to Cora during this period of time.  
 
Q: Okay. Prior to June 12th, 1994 at any time did you ever call 
Cora Fishman to discuss Nicole?  
 
A: Ever?  
 
Q: In the year '94 before June 12th. 
 
A: I don't recall. I don't ever recall calling her to discuss Nicole in 
'94.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever call Cora to find out 
 
where she and Nicole might be at a particular time or a particular 
place they might be going to?  
 
A:  No  
 
Q:  Did Cora ever call you from any location and indicate to you 
that she and Nicole were at a certain place?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  With New Year's Day 1989, I think you indicated earlier the 
police didn't see fit to take Nicole to the hospital that morning 
when they came by?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You've already asked him about this. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Did Nicole see fit to go to the hospital that morning? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's already been gone into. 
 
MR. KELLY: Not by me, Mr. Baker. I just want to ask a couple of 
questions. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: All right, go ahead.  
 
Q: Did Nicole see fit to go to the hospital?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Well, did she go to the hospital? 
 
A: I insisted, and A.C took her.   
 
Q: She didn't want to go to the hospital?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: To the best of your knowledge, did she ever make a phone call 
to anybody before she went to the hospital that morning? 
 
A: The best of my knowledge, no. 
 
Q: Okay. And did A.C see fit to take her to the hospital?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And you certainly did.  
 
A: Pardon me?  
 
Q: You saw fit to have her go to the  hospital.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. But you didn't know whether it was for a hangover or 
something?  
 
A: She said her--she was looking for aspirin, and being an athlete, 
you know, whenever somebody have a headache after a game or 
something for  whatever reason, you're very cautious about that. 
Just the way I've always been.  
 
Q: In any particular sport or just any sport when you have a 
headache?  
 
A:  Any sport. I mean, even my kids. If my kids had an accident, 
and, you know, we wouldn't let them sleep. We try to keep them 
awake.  If they said their head hurt in any way, shape or form, 
that's just something that you do.  
 
Q: So you're talking about a concussion-type situation, are you 
not?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. So we are talking about contact incidences, are we not?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And it was your concern about contact and concussions 
that caused you to be concerned about Nicole's headache, was it 
not? 
 
A: The fact that she said she had a  headache, and we had had a 
confrontation, and she was talking about having a headache, so I 
wanted her to be looked at.  
 
Q: Okay. By the way, did you notice her having any difficulty 
speaking when she said she was looking for aspirin?  
 
A: No. We--it was very emotional, so, you know, Nicole when she 
got emotional didn't speak clearly. She just spoke emotionally. So 
she was very  emotional when she was--during this.  
 
Q: Did she say anything about her jaw?  
 
A: No.  I think you also indicated in April of '94 when you were in 
Puerto Rico you spoke to Judy--  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: --Brown?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Do you recall how many times?  
 
A:  During the week of when she was supposed to be coming to 
meet me in Miami, we must have talked at least two or three times.  
 
Q:  And were those calls you made to Judy?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And do you remember the substance of those 
conversations?  
 
A: The first call was, "Did Nicole get her reservations? Did you get 
the reservations?" And I can't recall if they went to Laguna that 
weekend or  not. I'm not real sure. But the first call was about the 
reservations.  The second time she didn't, but Judy was-didn't want 
to bring it up. And--  
 
Q: Bring what up? I'm sorry.  
 
A: Bring up to Nicole about making the reservations, because 
Nicole was supposed to have made the reservations, or I was trying 
to bring business to  Judy. So I could have made them from where 
I was, but I was trying to get Judy to get some business, which 
 
I've done over the years.  And as the week went on, it was a little 
concern about Nicole.  Judy had the same concerns that I had.  
 
Q:  What were those concerns?  
 
A:  That Nicole was somewhat erratic in the way she acted. And 
Judy mentioned how I guess Thursday or Friday when I spoke to 
her, how she was  concerned that Nicole had--was putting words in 
her mouth from the previous conversation that day before that they 
had had, and it was kind of a concern to Judy.  
 
Q: Did Judy actually indicate to you that she thought Nicole was 
acting erratic? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. I think you also indicated Judy was otherwise evasive 
about discussing Nicole?  
 
A: No, no.  Judy was evasive--she- about--it was a funny thing in 
the family, that everybody's afraid to-Judy would say she was 
afraid to confront Nicole. So it became a thing where everybody 
would talk about Nicole, but they were all afraid to confront her 
with whatever their concerns were.  
 
Q: Did Judy ever express to you what she thought or what her 
concerns were, what Judy's concerns were?  
 
A:  Overall?  
 
Q:  Yeah.  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What was that?  
 
A: She didn't like the people Nicole was hanging around.  
 
Q: And that was Judy's main concern with Nicole?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And she told you that?  
 
A: Yes. On numerous occasions.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever indicate to any of your friends or to 
anybody prior to Mother's Day 1994 that you were going to stop 
seeing Nicole again?  
 
A:  I think I was consistent in--I think I was consistent in that I 
thought it was a lot of work and consistent in I didn't think it would 
work. But in Puerto Rico I was not with any friends, and when I 
came back from Puerto Rico I spent that first week mostly with 
Nicole. So I really wasn't around, you know, what I would call 
friends that I confide in.  
 
Q: Well, when you say you were consistent with the fact that it 
wasn't going to work-  
 
A: Until I went to Puerto Rico. And as I 
 
said, when I was in Puerto Rico, I really didn't talk to my friends. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you say you were  consistent- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He said consistent it was a lot of work, I 
thought. 
 
THE WITNESS: That it was a lot of work. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Not that it wasn't going to work. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Yeah, that it was a lot of work. That this, you 
know, this getting back together thing was a lot of work. 
 
 BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. Did you ever express that to any of your close friends-  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--during early '94?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: To whom?  
 
A: I'm sure Allen Austin. I'm sure A.C.  I'm sure Arnelle, Jason, 
Michelle, Cathy, Skip, yeah. 
 
Q: But you never expressed to them that you were actually going 
to break it off with Nicole-  
 
A: Well--  
 
Q: --before you did. 
 
A:  Well, when it happened, it happened.  It wasn't like something 
that you went three weeks discussing or thinking about.  We had a 
conversation. It happened. 
 
Q:  Okay. I think you said generally you usually go to bed early. Is 
that correct?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: 8:00, 8:30?  
 
A: Generally, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. On June 10th, 1994 do you recall what time you got back 
to L A.?  
 
A: I'm gonna guess.  
 
Q: Okay.    
 
A  7:00, 8:00 o'clock. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you go out at all with Paula then after she picked 
you up?  
 
A: I can't remember we--when she picked me up if we went 
directly and had sushi and then went to I believe my house or if we 
ate at my house, if  Michelle--I mean Gigi wasn't there.  We may 
have gone directly from the airport to have sushi.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: I didn't eat on the plane. I rarely eat on the plane.  
 
Q: Do you know what time you got home that 
 
night, approximately?  
 
A:  Whatever time it took to eat sushi and got home.  
 
Q:  Was it before 10:00?  
 
A:  I would think so.  
 
Q:  Okay. So it would be safe to say you  were up till at least 10:00 
o'clock Friday night?  
 
A: I can't say at least 10:00.  Whatever  time I got off the plane, I 
think we-you know, I had been out of town all week. We ate and 
then went home and went to--you know, got in bed.  
 
Q: Okay. And Saturday night you went to a formal affair?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know what time you got home that night?  
 
A: Oh, probably about 11 :00.  
 
Q: Okay.  And Sunday night you were  
 
A: Yeah, I had to stay up to go to-to go to Chicago. 
 
Q: Okay. In June of 1994 or before that, you said you always went 
to bed early, but you'd get up during the night to make sure the 
kids were settled  and everything?  
 
A: I said generally I go to bed early.  I mean if I don't have an 
affair to go to or something.  Every night, including last night, I get 
up in the middle of the night and walk around my house.  Every  
night.  
 
Q:  Back then, and I am talking about  May-June 1994, what time 
would Justin usually go to bed?  
 
A: We tried to put him to bed at 8:30.  With Sydney, too?  
 
A: But they, you know--that was the general time we tried, but, 
you know, hopefully by 9:00 they'd be in bed.  
 
Q:  Okay. When you gave your interview to Miss Van Susteren of 
"Burden of Proof," was anybody with you in the room when you 
spoke to her?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. You also indicated at some point during this deposition 
that you were scheduled to go to Knotts Berry Farm with the kids 
sometime in June.  
 
A: I was gonna take them on Father's Day.  
 
Q: Okay. Was that indicated in your  calendar?  
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Had you spoken to the kids about  
 
A: Yes. Sydney asked me. She actually wanted to go the Sunday 
before, and I was taking them to another affair, and then the next 
Sunday I would  have had them would have been the next Sunday-
-I mean not this Sunday that--because she had that, but the 
following Sunday. 
 
Q:  Now, as of June 1994, you--May 1994, you had been a public 
figure for about 25 years?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  I believe you never had bought a goatee before that time, had 
you? 
 
A: I've grown one, but I never bought one, no.  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: I didn't realize it was a goatee in this bag either until you guys 
started saying that. I didn't realize there was a goatee in there.  
 
Q: What did you think it was?  
 
A: A beard.  
 
Q: Okay. And mustache?  
 
A: A mustache and beard, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. You had never bought something like that prior to late 
May of 1994, had you?  
 
A: Yes, but not to go to Knotts Berry Farm, no.  
 
Q:  When had you bought something like that for?  
 
A: Maybe a Halloween or two, and then some--often when I'm on a 
set I may--in the past I've taken one once or twice in my life and 
would wear  home what Sydney and Arnelle and Jason--and come 
home looking like another person, you know, just tease the kids.  
 
Q: Okay. But you never purchased something like that to wear in 
public, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you hadn't played pro  football in what, about 15 
years?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And your Hertz airport commercial where you're jumping over 
the suitcases running down the hall, that wasn't airing anymore, 
was it?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: In fact, do you know when that had gone off the air?  
 
A: I don't think I ran through an airport for Hertz since the mid to 
late '70s. I've been in many Hertz commercials since then, though. 
 
Q:  Okay. And I think you also indicated in June of 1994 you 
weren't doing any actual broadcasting for NBC, were you?   
 
A: Not in June. I had during the football season, but in June, that 
month, no.  
 
Q: Okay. In fact you hadn't since maybe January?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: After Super Bowl?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And would it be fair to say that anybody under 14 had never 
even been born by the time you finished playing pro football? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can do the math. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: I know, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Good. Then don't ask him-- waste our 
time asking those kind of stupid questions. I'm trying to give you a 
sound bite. 
 
 MR. KELLY: I think you've been good at the sound bites, Mr. 
Baker. I could use stupid in another context 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: All right. 
 
MR. KELLY:--but I won't take the bait. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Doesn't rise to the level of your wonderful 
compliment to Mr. Brewer. 
 
MR. BREWER: You are going to have to step it 
 
up today. 
 
MR. KELLY: Your uncharacteristic patience is not lending itself 
well to this. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I can't tell you how slighted I've been feeling, 
Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Not to worry. I'm an equal opportunity- 
 
MR. KELLY: Insulter.  
 
Q  With the letter you eventually had hand-delivered to Nicole on 
June 6, 1994, can you tell me when you first drafted that letter that 
was ultimately delivered? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you drafted it. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I probably told Cathy to write something 
whenever -- whenever she called me. And  whenever Gigi told me 
about the problem, I'm sure I worded it to Skip or I went to Skip 
and to Cathy about that time, and so whenever that was. That was-- 
whenever that was. That was in May. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. Was that after the time Nicole had given you the bracelet 
back? 
 
A:  I don't--I don't recall.  I don't know if that was after, after that 
happened.  It might have been, but I don't know. 
 
Q:  I think you also indicated that in '94 there were times Nicole 
indicated to you that she was depressed?  
 
A:  Depressed in '94? When I was in Puerto Rico, she said a lot of 
things and she couldn't explain it. Earlier in '94--I don't know if 
"depressed" was a word she used earlier in '94.  
 
Q: Did you ever see her depressed?  
 
A: I saw--You know, I'm not capable of saying what depression or 
frustration--what does what. I just know that during '94 I know a 
few occasions she was despondent for whatever reasons, you 
know, and there were numerous reasons. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever seen someone grieving? Do you know 
what I mean by that?  
 
A: Doing what?  
 
Q: Grieving. 
 
A: Grieving?  
 
Q: Grieving. From the loss of someone or something?  
 
A:  I've seen a lot of grieving in the last two years, yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. Then you understand basically what I mean by that 
word?   
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. On June 17th, 1994 in the morning, you were at Robert 
Kardashian's house, were you not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And Bob Kardashian was there?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any conversations with him that morning? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can answer that yes or no, if you 
recall. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sure I did. I don't recall, but I'm sure I did. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. And you remember at least being in the room or rooms 
sometime that morning at Kardashian's, do you not?  
 
A: I don't really remember it.  I do remember he and Shapiro 
coming to my bedroom.  Other than that, I don't remember, you 
know, what was going on.  
 
Q: Okay.  And by "Shapiro," you mean Bob Shapiro, who was 
your attorney? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall seeing Dr. Henry Lee there that 
morning?   
 
A:  I don't really recall it, but I knew during the week at some point 
he was there. I don't totally recall that day too clearly, but maybe 
that was the day.  
 
Q:  Do you remember having some interaction with Dr. Henry 
Lee? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.  
 
Q: Okay. What about Dr. Baden, Michael Baden? Do you recall at 
some point on the 17th, first of all, seeing him? 
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know if you saw him at any time prior to the 
17th also?  
 
A: If it was the 17th when I saw him, that was when I saw him. I 
don't-you know, it's hard to tell who--the day before or that day, 
but I only  recall seeing him once, but I may have seen him more 
than once.

A: No.  
 
Q: Did you have a personal physician?  
 
A: I don't believe so.  
 
Q: Well, you didn't have a family doctor then?  
 
A: I did at one point, but he died, and then it was--you know, most 
of my troubles was arthritic or orthopedic, so I had a doctor that I 
dealt with on those issues.

A:  I believe I did.  
 
Q:  Okay. That was Bob's then girlfriend? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Was A.C down there on the morning of the 17th?

then. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And Paula Barbieri was there that morning?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: When had Paula Barbieri arrived at Kardashian's home?

Q:  Was that the day of the wake?  
 
A:  I don't know.  
 
Q:  Okay. But she had been down there for a couple of days?  
 
A: What do you mean?  
 
Q: She had been down at Kardashian's for the last two days before 
the 17th?   
 
A: Well, she came right after the kids left, and she was there until, 
you know, right until the 17th. So whatever that is. I don't know 
what that is  
 
Q:  Okay. Well, she spent the night before there, before the 17th?  
 
A:  She came--I know the day that the kids left, she came that day, 
and the 17th she left. I'm just not sure-I just can't recall which day

Q: Okay. Did she stay overnight there?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. More than one night?  
 
A: That's what I can't recall. Whatever day she got in, she stayed 
with me from that point on.  
 
Q: Now, you had indicated that on Mother's Day 1994, I believe 
you said you had a great day at the Browns'? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall who was there at the Browns' besides 
yourself and Nicole?  
 
A: No. Her family, the Brown family.  
 
Q: Okay. Was A.C there?  
 
A: I don't believe so.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you remember anybody else 
 
besides family who was there?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you remember if Betsy Rocket was there?  
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q: And I think you indicated that you had gone shopping to buy all

A: Yes.

Q:  Okay. Bunches of flowers?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And where had you bought those flowers?  
 
A:  Pardon me?  
 
Q:  Where did you buy those flowers? 
 
A:  On PCH.  
 
Q: Okay. Right across the way from the front entry to their 
residence?  
 
A: No.  I think it was closer to where I used to live.  
 
Q:  Okay.  It was a flower stand, wasn't it?  
 
A: No. It was a flower shop.   
 
Q: You got down there to the--Laguna early that Saturday 
morning, did you not, like 4:00 a.m.?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And was there some reason you had to be there Saturday 
morning? 
 
A: Yes. Q:  And what was that for?  
 
A: Sean was having his christening or first communion. I don't 
know. It was something like that.  
 
Q: And had someone invited you to that?  
 
A: Well, yeah. It was a family thing, and Sean was having his 
christening, and I came down. It was just something we always did 
when something was happening with the kids.  
 
Q: Okay. Did Nicole invite you to this?  
 
A: Yes.  And I believe the Brown family did, too.  We were--it was 
a family thing, Sean's christening, and I said, "I'll try to get down 
there; I don't know what time I'm gonna get off work," and I made 
it down there. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did Nicole ever indicate to you that she didn't want you 
down there during the day that day?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And you stayed at the condo you owned 
 
down there?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That Saturday night?  
 
A:  When I got in, yes, I got in bed.  
 
Q: Is that a one-bedroom or two-bedroom condo?  
 
A: Two-bedroom. 
 
Q: Okay. And you never verbally confronted Nicole after she 
refused to go out to dinner with you that night, that Saturday night, 
did you? 
 
A: We went out to dinner that Saturday night.  
 
Q: Did she ever initially indicate to you she didn't want to go out 
with you that Saturday night?  
 
A:  As I already testified here, when we got to the door, she 
freaked out and said, "I can't do this." And I asked her, "What's 
going on with you?" And she couldn't answer that, and she -- after 
we talked a bit, she calmed down, and we took some pajamas over 
to the kids, and we went to dinner.  
 
Q: Brios, is that where you went?  
 
A: Where? 
 
Q:  Brios?  
 
A:  I don't know.  
 
Q:  You don't know the name of the  restaurant?  
 
A:  No . I had never eaten there before. 
 
Q:  Do you recall where the kids slept that night after you had been 
out to dinner?  
 
A:  I don't believe we picked them up that night. I'm not sure if we 
did or didn't. 
 
Q: Would it surprise you if you had picked them up that night?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Well, would it surprise you you had picked them up that night 
even after dropping off their pajamas that night?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  And it's your testimony that you had a normal Saturday 
evening dinner with Nicole?  
 
A:  Yeah, we had a nice dinner.  
 
Q:  When you came back from Puerto Rico, what was that, May 
1st or something? 
 
A: I don't know. Whatever time it was. It was a weekend. 
 
MR. KELLY: If I can just talk a minute here. 
 
Q: Do you recall how long you had been back from Puerto Rico 
prior to Christian's party?  
 
A: I may have gotten back that day. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Stop talking about me, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You guys talk about me all the time. 
Come on. Turnabout is fair play. 
 
MR. KELLY: In the alternative, if you are growing to talk, talk 
loudly enough so I can hear. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: They're making fun of me. That's all right. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I wouldn't make fun of you. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  So that was a Saturday you got back from Puerto Rico, the 
Saturday of Christian's party?  
 
A:  I believe so. I believe we went to the party that night.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you recall the following  weekend, that would have 
been the Mother's Day weekend?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: That was when you were down at the Browns'?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall where you were the weekend after that? 
And I am talking about Saturday 
 
-Sunday now?  
 
A: What do you mean, "weekend after that"? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Weekend after Mother's Day? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Weekend after Mother's Day, whether you were in town or not.  
 
A: I think I was in New York.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know what for?  
 
A: Hertz.  
 
Q: Okay. That was over the weekend?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And the weekend of--after that, which would have been May 
21-22, do you know whether you were in LA. or not for that 
weekend?  
 
A: Yes, for part of that weekend I was in LA. 
 
Q: Were you just getting back from somewhere that weekend?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: From where?  
 
A: Friday--Thursday I may have gone to Norfolk, Virginia.  
 
Q: And when did you get back?  
 
A: Saturday.  
 
Q: Okay.  Afternoon? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, you indicated that you had broken off with Nicole 
either Mother's Day or the day after?  
 
A: I believe it was officially the day  after, even though at dinner 
that night I told her I couldn't do it anymore, and she--she--you 
know, it wasn't a hassle. Maybe that's why we had a good 
 
 Mother's Day. And the day after Mother's Day we-  
 
Q: Before--this is at dinner at the  Browns' on Mother's Day that 
you told Nicole you couldn't do it anymore?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: This is the day after?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Saturday before Mother's Day?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And this is where you told her you thought it was a 
hassle and you didn't think you could do it anymore?  
 
A: Exactly.  But I think it was official two nights later.  
 
Q:  But when you told her this Saturday, it was nonetheless a civil 
conversation? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Pleasant conversation?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  In fact you said you had an enjoyable dinner?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. And you don't remember whether you picked the kids up 
or not? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: All right. And how did you make it official two days later?  
 
A:  We just was talking about everything and the kids, and I recall 
we both agreed that maybe we got together too soon, you know, 
and it was a conversation about unlike the first split-up, "Let's 
make sure that we stay very active together with the kids." 
We got very affectionate with each other, and we would kinda 
tease, because we said, "Well, we should break up three times a 
week and we'd have a great relationship," because we got sorta 
romantic that night.  You know, it was emotional; it was romantic-  
 
Q: That was Monday night?  
 
A: Monday night, yes.  
 
Q: And where was that at? Bundy? 
 
A: Bundy, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And were you over there for dinner?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And the kids were with you, too?  
 
A: I believe so, yes.  
 
Q: And you put them to bed?  
 
A: I think I may have left and come back, but I'm not a hundred 
percent sure of that.  
 
Q:  Going back to Rockingham? 
 
A:  I believe so, because--I believe, because I was--yes, I believe 
so. 
 
Q: Was that prearranged when you left that you were going to be 
coming back? 
 
A:  Well, I said I had to go do something. "I'll be back," because 
we wanted to talk about some things.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, after this Monday night interlude and conversation, 
do you recall when you next saw Nicole? 
 
A: Not exactly, but a few times that week.  
 
Q: And that was before you left town that weekend?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall where you saw Nicole?  
 
A: I think I had dinner there one night, and I think they were at my 
house one day, one day after school.  
 
Q: And the kids were with Nicole that weekend you were gone?  
 
A: What weekend? 
 
Q: The 15th.  
 
A: Certainly Friday night. I just can't recall Saturday and Sunday 
night. I just don't recall Saturday and Sunday night, because I 
know I had the kids all day Sunday, and Sunday night I believe 
they spent the night with me, so--so... Do you know about what 
date Nicole got sick with double pneumonia?  A: You know what? 
I'm a week ahead. Let me go back a week. I'm a week ahead. I'm a 
week ahead of the game right now. Tell me what week-what you're 
asking about.  
 
Q: Would it help your recollection,  Mr. Simpson, to look at your 
calendar a little bit?  
 
A: Cathy's calendar, yeah. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: This is Exhibit 8-A. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: You want to just take a minute and- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Not that we haven't been through this. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
(Whereupon, a photograph was taken.) 
 
MR. LEONARD: The flash didn't go off. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's pretty funny, Bob. 
 
MR. LEONARD: This guy, he's whacked out. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He missed his calling. 
 
MR. KELLY: Absolutely lost it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I'll give you a copy. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I get an assist. Absolutely no- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Was that your idea? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, no, but I -Never mind. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You definitely get an assist. He got your 
picture, he says. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anyway...Off the record for a second? 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR. KELLY: Let's break for a minute. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going off the record now, and 
the time is approximately 2:00 o'clock. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back 
 
now, and the time is approximately 2:11. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Now, Mr. Simpson, you have had the opportunity to look over 
your calendar for May of 1994?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And I believe you indicated that- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Cathy Randa's calendar, actually, but- 
 
MR. KELLY: Cathy Randa's. Okay. 
 
Q:  Looking over that, that basically  represents your calendar for 
the month of 1994 as you recall it?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And after looking at it, are you clear now that it was May 14th 
and 15th you were in New York?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall whether that was Sydney's first communion 
that weekend also? 
 
A: It was. 
 
Q: Okay. Were you there for that? 
 
A: I couldn't get out of my -- I couldn't get out of my commitment. 
 
Q:  Okay. But you had been at Sean's the weekend before. Is that 
correct?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q:  And you had indicated that after the Monday night, May 9th, 
when you had been with Nicole, you had dinner with her another 
night that week also?  
 
A: And I see here we did a few other things together that week, 
too, but Monday night, I believe so. Monday afternoon, Monday 
night. 
 
Q:  Well, what else did you do that week?  
 
A:  We went to a talent show for Sydney together.  
 
Q: What night was that?  
 
A: That would have been a day that was called for. That would 
have been that day.  
 
Q: The 9th?  
 
A: That would have been the 11th.  
 
Q: Okay. And what else that week?  
 
A: As I said, I had dinner at her house one night that week.  
 
Q: In addition to the 9th?  
 
A: Pardon me?  
 
Q: In addition to your dinner there on the 9th, you were there 
another night that week?  
 
A: Yeah, I believe so. 
 
Q:  Do you know what night that was?  
 
A: I don't know.  I know that night-that week we--one day they 
were at my house and one night I was at their house.  
 
Q: While--you were there Monday night, the day after Mother's 
Day, for sure. Is that correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q;  And I think you said were you there another night also  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What--do you know what night that was? 
 
A: No. I just know I had dinner there early one night, and one night 
they were at my house. 
 
Q: So three nights that week you had dinner together with Nicole 
and the kids? 
 
A:  It could have been. I can't recall if they ate at my house, but 
two or three nights that week we--two or three days that week we 
definitely saw one another, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And were those pleasant get-togethers with you and 
Nicole?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. No problems? 
 
A: No problems.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, after reviewing Cathy Randa's 
 
journal and seeing that you were in New York on the 15th, does 
that refresh your recollection at all as to when Nicole got sick?  
 
A: When I came back from New York, she was going to the 
doctor, and I talked to her from New York and I told her, "Boy, 
you sound bad," and she  said yeah, she may have caught a cold, 
and then when I came back, she was in real bad shape and she was 
going to the doctor.  
 
Q: She sounded like she had a cold before you left for New York 
and-  
 
A: No, no. While I was in New York and I talked to her, and she 
sounded like she really had a bad cold, and at the time--I don't 
know--it just  sounded bad. I was teasing her and saying, "You 
must be partying too much," because she sounded real raspy.  And 
then when I came back, she told me she was sick and was going to 
the doctor.  
 
Q: And you got back the night of the 15th from New York?  
 
A: I may have came back on the 16th. 
 
Q: And you said you nursed Nicole while she was sick. 
 
A:  Yes, while I was in town that week I-- every morning I would 
bring her--I would pick up her 
 
scones and stuff. Even if I played golf, I'd do it right after. I'd call 
her and see how she was doing.  
 
Q: I'm sorry. Picked up her?  
 
A:  Scones and coffee that she liked.  I brought her some flowers 
and I brought her some soup a couple times that week, and a 
couple of nights that week or at least one night that week she had a 
real bad cough, and I ended up going to the market to get her some 
cough syrup. 
 
Q:  All right.  So you were over there every morning of that week, 
Monday through Friday?  
 
A:  Monday I couldn't have been there, so I  wasn't there Monday.  
Tuesday afternoon I think I brought her soup. Wednesday morning 
I definitely  brought her coffee.  May have brought some flowers, 
too, on Wednesday. And that afternoon I took care of the kids and 
everything, I believe, with dinner and whatever she needed.  
Thursday I think again--I know I ended up Thursday night getting 
her a cake and, you know, gifts from the kids, and the four of us 
had a little birthday thing at her house.  
 
Q: This was on her birthday, the 19th? A:  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Was anybody there besides her and the kids?   
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have dinner together?  
 
A:  I think I bought dinner. I'm not sure. I believe her mother may 
have been there during the day that day.  
 
Q: Okay.  Wasn't her mother there several days that week, if you 
recall?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Just one day?  
 
A: I was there Wednesday and her mother wasn't there. I was there 
Tuesday and her mother wasn't there. I think on her birthday Judy 
came, and then I don't know what Judy might have done after that. 
Judy wasn't around that night at all.  
 
Q:  The night of her birthday?  
 
A:  Yes. And she wasn't there Wednesday when I was there, and 
she wasn't there Tuesday when I was there. 
 
Q: How long were you there Tuesday?  
 
A: I don't know. She was really sick. I just went by. 
 
Q:  More than an hour?  
 
A:  I don't know.  I don't recall. 
 
Q:  You weren't there all day. A:  No. It was in the afternoon. 
 
Q:  Okay. You weren't there all day Wednesday, were you?  
 
A:  No.  It was in the afternoon. 
 
Q:  You weren't there all day Thursday?  
 
A: All day?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A:  No. No. 
 
Q:  You weren't there all day Thursday? 
 
A: You just asked that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: You did. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: And what about Friday?  
 
A: Friday, no.  
 
Q: Okay. And that week, and I am talking about the 16th up 
through the 19th of her birthday, did you see Cici there at her 
house at all?  
 
A: Not at all.  
 
Q: Was Elvia there?  
 
A: She might have been. I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't recall seeing her there at all that week?  
 
A: No. She might have been because she worked during the week, 
but I probably just didn't pay any attention. And normally by the 
time I got there she was out of the way, because we'd eat and then 
we'd go upstairs, and then I guess she would clean up the kitchen.  
But I may have seen her, but I don't recall. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did she have a room she stayed in there?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And that was back off the kitchen? 
 
A:  No. It was downstairs.  
 
Q: At the garage level?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And did Elvia work for anybody besides Nicole during 
that period of time?  
 
A: I have no idea.  
 
Q: Do you know whether Elvia worked for the Fishmans?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  No, she didn't? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see Faye during that week when you were 
over at the house?  
 
A: Not at all.  
 
Q: Did you ever see Cora that week? 
 
A: I don't believe so. I never saw anybody at her house.  
 
Q: Okay. Didn't see her sisters?  
 
A: Definitely not. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, that weekend after her birthday, May 21st-22nd--  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: --were you in town that weekend?  
 
A: Part of it.  
 
Q: When you say, "Part of it," what do you mean?  
 
A:  I came back Saturday night. 
 
Q:  From? 
 
A:  Norfolk, Virginia.  
 
Q: Okay.  Did the kids stay over Saturday night?  
 
A: I don't believe so.  
 
Q:  Did you see them Sunday?  
 
A:  Yes, they were with me all day. 
 
Q:  At Rockingham?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And was Paula there that day?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  It was just you, Sydney and Justin? 
 
A:  And 300 other people, 3- to 400 other people. 
 
Q: And what was that for?  
 
A:  Justin's preschool--I give a picnic every year for the preschool 
to help raise money for 
the school.  
 
Q: Okay. Is that a catered affair?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Was Nicole there that day?  
 
A: She came for a while, yes.  
 
Q: Was she still sick then?  
 
A: She was getting over sickness, and she was--you know, I think 
it was her first time out since she got sick.  
 
Q: And was there a time that you and Nicole were alone during 
that day?  
 
A:  A couple of times. Well, yes, a couple of times. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Could you tell me when the first time was? 
 
A: The first time was when she went upstairs and got in my bed.  
 
Q: Okay. She wasn't feeling well? 
 
A: She got a little tired.  
 
Q: How long had she been there for?  
 
A: I don't know. It was during the course of the day, and she had 
been there a few hours, I guess. I can't recall exactly how long she 
had been  there. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, who made the arrangements for this event at 
your house that day?  
 
A: In the past Nicole would have. In this trip I think they had a 
committee at the school that did.  
 
Q: That was the first time?  
 
A: Pardon me?  
 
Q: This was the first time a committee did it?  
 
A: Well, I think there was a committee in the past. Nicole just 
didn't like working with people, so even though it was a 
committee, she would  do most of it. The year before I don't think 
Nicole was involved at all. The year we were apart she wasn't 
involved at all.  She just attended it.  And this year I don't think she 
was really involved either. I think it was a committee that did it.  
 
Q: Okay. What time did that start, that event?  
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Well, was it an afternoon thing?  
 
A: No. It started in--you know, the  people were all there that was 
working that was there in the morning, the caterers, the people with 
the games and things, and I gather people started coming around 
11:00 or 12:00.   
 
Q: Do you remember what time Nicole got there?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you remember approximately what time it was that she went 
up to your room? 
 
A: It was in the afternoon. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you she was going up there?  
 
A: She was actually laying on me on the couch. I was watching the 
basketball game with some people, and she said she was feeling 
cold, and she went upstairs and got in my bed.  
 
Q: And who were you watching the game with?  
 
A: Just fathers were coming in and out. You know, every year this 
event always happens in the middle of the championship series, 
and I-  
 
Q: Is that what this was? Was this Houston-Knicks at this time?  
 
A: Yes. Yes.  And I always turn my TV on and leave the doors 
open and let the fathers know, if they're into basketball, they can 
walk--they can go in and watch. 
 
Yeah, may have been semis, but it was the NBA, I know that, and 
they were coming in.  Various people were coming in and out 
watching the game.  
 
Q:  And after she indicated she was going upstairs, had you had 
any conversations with her before this, private conversations, that 
day? 
 
A:  I don't know about private.  We laid in the grass and talked, and 
a couple people joined us from time to time. Then I went in and 
watched the game, and at one point she came in.  
 
Q: Okay. How long was she downstairs before she headed up?  
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. I don't  know what time she got 
there, so it's hard for me to answer that.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you go upstairs and talk to her at all when she was 
up in your room? 
 
A:  At one point I went up to see how she was doing.  
 
Q: Did you talk at all, or did you just check on her?  
 
A: You know, "How you doing?" I was always like saying, you 
know, "Nicole, you got to really watch what you're doing," you 
know. You know, I mean just--yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did--there came a time that day when she gave a bracelet 
back to you?  
 
A: I believe that night. 
 
Q:  Okay. Was that at your place?   
 
A:  Her place. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall what time she had left your place on 
Rockingham?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Approximately?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you recall what time this event ended?  
 
A: 4:30, 5:00, something like that. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you stay when they cleaned up afterwards? 
 
A: I don't think I stayed around when they cleaned up. I may have 
taken the kids somewhere while  they were doing that.  
 
Q: Okay. And did there come a time you took the kids back to 
Nicole's, then?  
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Could you approximate what time that was you took the kids 
back to Bundy? 
 
A: I don't--I don't know.  You know, I don't have a clear--clear--
clear picture of exactly what happened late in the afternoon that 
day.  
 
Q: By the way, do you recall which car you drove over to Bundy 
that night?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. You have no recollection what time 
 
you got over to Bundy-  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:--that evening? Do you know if it was after dark or not?  
 
A:  I know I was there when it was dark because at some point the 
kids were asleep.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Well, you didn't have dinner over there, did you?  
 
A:  No. I think I took the kids to dinner. 
 
Q: And then when they--you took them home, you went in with 
them? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Did Nicole know you were coming in at that time? 
 
A: She knew I was bringing the kids, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Would you generally when you would drop them off at 
the end of a weekend come in with them? 
 
A: Not in the year that we were not  together. At least at one point, 
latter part of that time.  
 
Q: We're talking '92? 
 
A: Yeah, the latter part--more the early of '93, I wouldn't.  Latter 
part of '92, early '93, I wouldn't.  All the other time we were 
together, yes, 
 
of course I would, even if I wasn't staying, and at this point in time 
right up until approximately a little after this time, I would, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  So when you got there that night, what happened?  
 
A:  I think we went in, and, you know, she was feeling tired-  
 
Q:  By the way, did you come to the front or back?  
 
A:  I don't remember.  And we put the kids to sleep.  I think I fell 
asleep in Jason--Justin's bed.  
 
Q: You did.  
 
A: I believe I did for a little bit.  
 
Q: With Justin?  
 
A: I--normally I start reading him a story or something; I have a 
history of falling asleep before he does.  But at one point I woke 
up, and I went in and Nicole was watching TV. Q: Okay. And what 
happened then? A: We just started talking about things and--  
 
Q: This is in her bedroom? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you have no idea what time it 
 
was? 
 
A:  I can guess 9:30, 10:00 o'clock.  It's just a guess. 
 
Q: Could you give me the substance of the conversation?  
 
A: Her health, my TV--  
 
Q: Was your TV in her bedroom.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: In what context did your TV come up?  
 
A: She was saying how she got used to having the TV in the 
bedroom. She was asking me some--at one point if I wanted the 
TV, because she finally got  to the point where she was--she liked 
the TV in the bedroom. She never did in all the years I knew her  
before then.  
 
Q: Had she ever offered your TV back to you before that night in 
all the years you knew her?  
 
A: She never had my TV before that in all the years I knew her.  
 
Q: Well, when did she get it?  
 
A: I brought it a few months previous to this.  
 
Q: Okay. She had never offered it back to you before that night, 
had she? 
 
A: There was no reason to. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't know that she offered it back yet. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. She was just saying she was used to having 
the TV in her room, and I was telling her, "Well"--I actually think I 
told her I would trade TVs with her because I liked the headphone 
aspect of this TV. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: That she had? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  Okay.  What else did you talk about?  
 
A: She talked about this bracelet, that I didn't really buy it for her.  
I told her--I didn't say anything. I had no comment. And then she 
said, "You really didn't buy it for me," and I had no  comment. And 
she didn't feel right having it, and I took it, I accepted it, and then 
we--I think I said something about the earrings. We talked about a 
lot of just menial stuff, I guess, you know, people, what was going 
on- 
 
Q:  Well, how did you work up to the bracelet aspect of the 
conversation? 
 
A:  I don't know.  She said something about the bracelet, that "You 
didn't really buy me that bracelet, did you?" Because even the day I 
gave it to 
 
her she was surprised.  
 
Q: Was it a tennis bracelet?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Could you describe it to me?  
 
A: I think it was sapphires and diamonds. It was kind of an antique, 
sort of an art deco piece. And she did not --she didn't think I 
bought it for her, and she couldn't understand why I had bought it 
for her, and I told her, "The kids bought it for you." 
 
And she says, "You didn't really buy me this," and I didn't say 
anything, and so she gave it back to me, and I was sorta glad to get 
it back.  
 
Q: Who did you buy that bracelet for?  
 
A: Paula.  
 
Q: When did you buy it?  
 
A: I think on the 19th. 
 
Q:  When you spoke to the police on the 13th, who did you tell 
them you had bought the bracelet for?  
 
A:  I said I had given Nicole a bracelet, and she had given it back. 
They had asked me about the bracelet as if it was something, and I 
just said, "Hey  it was a bracelet I had given her, and she gave it 
back to me."  
 
Q: Well, you sort of elaborated, when you were talking to Lange 
and Vannatter, about how you had 
 
 bought that for Nicole and were in a tight spot because of that, 
because you had taken it back and given it to Paula, didn't you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't- 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  Okay. And that actually wasn't true, then, when 
you told Lange and Vannatter that you had bought it for Nicole, 
was it? 
 
A: That's correct.  
 
Q: Okay. When did you give that bracelet to Paula, by the way?  
 
A: Probably the next day.  
 
Q: Are you certain about that, or you just think it was?  
 
A: Well, the next time I saw her I gave it to her, which would have 
probably been the next--I don't think I saw her on the 22nd. She 
might have been out of town. I'm not sure. But within the next day 
or two I did see her, and I gave it to her.  
 
Q:  Okay. And had Nicole ever given you any jewelry back before 
she gave you back this bracelet?  
 
A:  I hadn't bought her jewelry in a while, so I would say no.  
 
Q:  Ever?   
 
A:  There was no need to. We were always together whenever I 
gave her jewelry before.  
 
Q:  Okay. And the earrings, you had bought her a pair of earrings 
years earlier originally, hadn't you?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And the set that you asked back for were a replacement 
pair?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when had you given her that  replacement pair?  
 
A: It wasn't that I gave it to her. I- when we had got back together, 
at one point she told me she had lost these other earrings, which I 
knew  were her favorite earrings, earrings I had designed and made 
for her... 
 
What was the question? I'm sorry. 
 
(Pending question read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I hadn't. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Q: Who did?  
 
A: The jeweler.  
 
Q: Do you know how long ago that had been? 
 
A:  Not too--not too much sooner than this time, I would imagine, 
because I think the first time 
 
he--Not too much sooner than this time.  
 
Q: Like within the last couple weeks?  
 
A: It could have been. I'm not sure. I  just wasn't around, so I'm not 
sure. 
 
Q:  Okay. And where did you buy this  cigarette lighter you gave 
Nicole for her birthday?  
 
A:  Cartier.  
 
Q:  Okay. And she kept that?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  You didn't generally like Nicole smoking, did you?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  In fact you had a no smoking sign in your bathroom at 
Rockingham?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Her bathroom? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Now, I think you said those earrings-- you just stated that they 
were her favorite design?  
 
A: I had designed them for her once before, she really loved them.  
 
Q: Okay. And you had given them to her in what year? Do you 
know?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. They meant a lot to her?   
 
A: The first pair, yes.  
 
Q: And these were identical to those?  
 
A: Well, I tried to get them designed to be right, and they were 
very close. 
 
Q: Okay. Of all the jewelry Nicole had, these were her most 
favorite item? 
 
A: I can't say that because there's some jewelry that I know she 
loved that she never wore because they were too expensive, but she 
really liked these earrings.  
 
Q: They meant a lot to her.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And you asked her for those  earrings back that night.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And was that the first time you had ever asked Nicole 
back for jewelry?  
 
A: I really didn't ask for -- I'm wrong. Let me amend this. I didn't 
ask for the earrings back, no. That's wrong. I did not ask for the 
earrings back.  
 
Q: Well, what happened?  
 
A: She gave them to me.  
 
Q: Just out of the blue, or was there any discussion about it, or 
what?   
 
A: No. She owed me some money, and she didn't have the money, 
and she gave me the earrings.  
 
Q: Did she--did you ask her for the money?  
 
A: Yes. I said--yes, I did. I asked her  for a check, and she said she 
had spent it or something. 
 
Q:  So in the context of a conver-- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: I know we have. 
 
 MR. KELLY: Excuse me? 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: We've been all through this. 
 
 MR. KELLY: I don't think we have, Mr. Baker. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Yes, we have. 
 
 MR. ROBERT BAKER: That why he whispered in your ear. 
That's why Petrocelli whispered in your ear, because we've been all 
the way through this, that I he asked her for the check 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The money or the check--I m sorry.  The 
money or the earrings. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, I know he didn't say that "Give me 
the replacement check."  We've been all through this. Come on, 
guys, it's Day nine. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Your money or your life. That's an old Jack 
Benny joke. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not funny here. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's no funny here. 
 
MR. KELLY: It's not.  
 
Q: And how long was the total conversation up in her bedroom 
before you left with the earrings as opposed to the money?  
 
A: I'm sorry. Say that again.  
 
Q: Well, how long were you in her bedroom talking to her before 
you left? 
 
A:  For a while, because I laid on the bed with her and watched 
something that she was watching the end of, and I'd say after I got 
out of Justin's room and went to her room, about an hour. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you left there, you had the earrings and the 
bracelet?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you consider that sort of a final break-off 
between you and Nicole?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Did there ever before June 12th, 1994 come a time that you 
considered it a final break-off between you and Nicole?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And what date was that? 
 
A:  The day after Mother's Day.  
 
Q:  Okay.  That was that dinner over at Nicole's house? 
 
A:  Yes.  It was--it may have been Mother's Day night, but I 
believe it was the day after Mother's Day, and we--and it was then 
that I- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you what you did. He just 
said when was it. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Just in my mind-- 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm here to listen, Mr. Baker, if he wants to- 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, in my mind it was over then, and I'm sure 
in hers, too. We--you know, we went elsewhere. We went in 
different directions at that point, but we were still friends. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Okay.  So you didn't see this May 22nd date as a significant 
date at all?  
 
A:  No.  I thought it was a nice night. We were very pleasant with 
one another, just like we had  been for the previous, you know, l0 
days-  
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A:--or so.  
 
Q: Do you recall when you were talking to the police on June 13th, 
1994 they asked you when you had broken up with Nicole?  
 
A:  No, I don't recall that at all. 
 
Q: Do you recall at all when you were 
 
talking to the police on the 13th telling them how long or what 
time previously you had broken up with  Nicole again?  
 
A: I may have told them a month before. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: If you don't recall, just tell him you don't 
recall, OJ. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I don't recall. 
 
MR. KELLY:  Do we have Exhibit 101 the police statement? 
 
Q:  Page 3, starting line 19. This is you speaking: 
 
"About us trying to get back  together. And, uh, we gave it a shot, 
and we gave it a shot the better part of a year." 
 
Response: "Mmnh-mmnh."  And your response again: "And, uh, I 
think we both knew it wasn't working, and probably three weeks 
ago or so we said it just wasn't working." Do you remember giving 
that answer to the  police that day?  
 
A:  I don't remember, but that's obviously what I said. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And I would ask you to turn to page 27--actually 26, at 
the bottom, line 25 this is you speaking now: 
 
"    for about a year. And in the last six months we've had-- it 
hadn't been working, so we tried various things-  Police response: 
"Mmnh- mmnh." 
 
 You:  " to--to see if we can make it work. We started trying to date 
and it wasn't working. And, uh --and, uh, so, you know, then we 
just said to hell with it, you know." 
 
 Police: "And that was about three weeks ago?" 
 
 You: "Yeah, about three weeks ago. It was like it just stopped 
happening." Do you remember giving that response-  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: - in answer to the police questions?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And do you recall now that you, when 
 
putting a breakup of you and Nicole in a time frame, you put it 
three weeks prior to June 13th, 1994?  
 
A: Yes. I mean that was an estimate, but I think I was a little more 
definitive at other times with them, telling them right when I got 
back from San Juan it was virtuallv over and we split up.  So it was 
a guess at the time, you know. I didn't have a calendar in front of 
me.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Prior to August 1989 there was a full antenuptial 
agreement in place between you and Nicole, was there not?  
 
A: I'm sorry. Say that again?  
 
Q: In August 1989 when Nicole signed off on that one-page letter 
saying that if you ever physically assaulted her or something, it 
would void the antenuptial agreement, do you recall that?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Prior to her signing that and giving it to you, you had an 
antenuptial agreement in place, did you not?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  And was it your understanding that after your divorce 
became final in 1992, your antenuptial agreement with Nicole was 
inapplicable  anymore? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, if you have an opinion. That calls 
for a legal conclusion. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't understand. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Well, after you were divorced, and antenuptial agreement meant 
nothing. Correct?  
 
A: Yes. I wasn't married to anyone, so yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall the weekend Of May 28th, 29th, where you 
were? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Why don't you look at the calendar, OJ. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  I am sorry.  Just backing up again, Mr. Simpson, the day after 
May 22nd when you had been over at Bundy and took--or got the 
bracelet back and  the earrings back-  
 
A:  May 22nd? That may have been that night.  It may have been 
May 22nd.  I'm not a hundred percent sure of that. It may have 
been May 22nd that that happened.  
 
Q: That you were over at Bundy?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you recall going out to dinner with Nicole at all 
shortly after that?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any meetings with Nicole after that regarding the 
children?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Do you recall the next time you saw Nicole after that night, 
May 22nd?  
 
A:  I know I saw her possibly a few times, but I can't--you know.  I 
know it wasn't for any length of time. I was all that week busy--No.  
The answer is no. 
 
MR. KELLY:  I've got to take a break for a few minutes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: No, let's stay on.  We are going to finish 
today, aren't we? 
 
MR. KELLY:  I don't know, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Well, we are going to finish today.  He is 
not coming back for any more liability testimony. I want 
everybody in this room to fully understand that.  It is not going it 
happen. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Baker, that's unacceptable. I am not limiting 
myself- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's too bad. 
 
MR. KELLY:--to one day of questioning because you want me to 
limit myself- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: That's too bad. It isn't going to happen 
without a court order. Nine days is adequate, and it is not going to 
happen, so keep it in  mind and take whatever breaks you want. 
 
MR. KELLY:  Okay.  Well, let's not take a break.  Let's go. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let s go. 
 
MR. KELLY:  Actually, no I've got to take one break. We'll take 
the break. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:43. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: we are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:57.

her?  
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q:  Could you tell me- 
 
A:  It may have been at my house.  
 
Q:  But you're not certain?  
 
A:  I'm not certain. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you know how long you saw her for? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any conversation with her? 
 
A: I can't recall.

you saw her or spoke to her?

Saturday-Sunday? 
 
A: Yes.

"weekend"? You mean counting Monday? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Well, Saturday-Sunday, first of all were you around then?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Where were you? 
 
A:  Palm Springs.  
 
Q:  And who were you there with?  
 
A:  For part of a day, Paula Barbieri.  
 
Q:  Okay. Was that Saturday?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And who were you there Sunday with, if anybody?  
 
A:  Just friends. 
 
Q:  Do you remember who you were there with? 
 
A:  I was with numerous people:  Jackie Cooper; I believe Allen 
Austin. Those are the guys I played golf with.  
 
Q:  Did you play Saturday and Sunday?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you play Monday, too?  
 
A: I believe so.  
 
Q: And were the kids with you at all that weekend?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you get back to L.A. Monday night?  
 
A: Sometime Monday, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Now, after getting back from Palm Springs that Monday, 
could you tell me if there was another time that you saw Nicole 
between that time and June 12th, 1994?  
 
A: Yes. I saw her one night when I came to pick up the kids. I saw 
her running one day- 
 
Q:  What night was that--  
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: - if you can remember, when you came to pick up the kids?  
 
A: It probably would have been a Friday, because that's when I 
would get the kids. 
 
Q:  Okay. Would that be the following Friday after that Memorial 
Day?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  And as you look at the schedule there now or journal of Cathy 
Randa's, could you tell me what the date would have been on that 
Friday?  
 
A:  I believe it would have been Friday, the 3rd.  
 
Q: Okay. And I think you indicated also that Paula was only there 
for part of Saturday in Palm Springs?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Was there anything in particular that caused her to leave there?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What was that?  
 
A: Me getting up playing golf. 
 
Q: Okay. And she got mad about that?  
 
A: Evidently.  
 
Q: And she left you.  
 
A: Well, she left Palm Springs.  
 
Q: She left Palm Springs.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Was there any mention of Nicole between you and Paula 
that Saturday before she left?   
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. Nicole had nothing to do with Paula leaving that 
weekend? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, looking at the following Friday, past Memorial 
Day, what date was that again? 
 
A: I believe the 3rd of June. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And between that Monday, having gotten back from 
Palm Springs, and that Friday, June 3rd, did you speak to Nicole at 
all that week?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  She didn't call you on the phone?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  You didn't call her on the phone?  
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  No conversation with her.  
 
A:  None. 
 
Q:  Okay. But you showed up Friday night at Bundy to pick up the 
kids? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall what time you showed up? 
 
A: About 8:20.  
 
Q: Okay. Did she know you were corning for the kids?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And how was that?  
 
A:  Cathy told her.  
 
Q: Okay. And you knew that Cathy spoke to her that week?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Cathy call Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that was at your instruction? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And when you arrived that Friday evening, you 
indicated that there might have been some family there at the 
house? 
 
A: There was a family walking in the house. 
 
Q:  Okay. In front of you or behind you? 
 
A:  Just--you know, my car wasn't facing her house or driving from 
her house. They were walking to the house. 
 
Q: As you were leaving.  
 
A: No. As I arrived.  
 
Q: Okay. And did you arrive at the front of the house?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And was that in the Bentley? 
 
A: May have been. I'm not a hundred percent sure. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you park out on Bundy in front of the house?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Is parking allowed there on Bundy?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Not anymore. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: When you arrived there at about 8:20 that Friday night, did you 
have any conversation with Nicole?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Could you relate to me the substance of that conversation?  
 
A: Her words were, she didn't know it was late that I was coming, 
and she had called some friends for Sydney, and I said, "Cathy told 
you I was  coming before 8:30," and it was only 8:20. 
 
And she said, ''You should have come earlier." 
 
And I told her, "Don't get bitchy," and she went back in the house. 
 
She said, "I'll bring them tomorrow," I believe, and went back in 
the house.  
 
Q: And that was, as far as you can recall, the extent of your 
conversation with her?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Was she angry at that time?  
 
A: She didn't seem to be.  
 
Q: Why did you tell her not to get bitchy?  
 
A: Because that's what she was-you know, this whole fact of me 
not coming at 8:30, she knew I was coming, yet she still arranged 
for someone else to be at the house for Sydney as an excuse for the 
kids not--  
 
Q: So you're referring to the arrangement  she had made as being 
bitchy? 
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: Not her attitude.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Were you angry with her for not letting the kids come?  
 
A: Probably, yes. Yes, probably.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you see anybody that night after you left there, by 
the way? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: And Nicole did drop Sydney and Justin off the next morning?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she drop them off herself? 
 
A: I don't know. I wasn't there. 
 
Q:  Playing golf? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Was Gigi there? 
 
A:  I don't remember.  
 
Q:  Okay. Nicole had told you that night that she'd drop them off 
first thing in the morning, didn't she?  
 
A: She didn't say "first thing in the morning."  She said, "I'll drop 
them off tomorrow "morning." 
 
Q: Okay. And she did drop them off in the morning.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you had no reason to be angry about that because 
you were playing golf. Correct?  
 
A:  Well, I wouldn't have played golf if my kids were there, but I 
played golf. So I wasn't angry when I got home. I wasn't angry 
after I drove off a  few blocks, you know. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And were Sydney and Justin there alone with Gigi when 
you got back from golf? 
 
A:  I don't think Gigi was there.  When I got there, they were with 
Paula. Paul had taken Justin to--they were there with Paula. Paula 
and I think 
 
Kato was there and Kato's kid was there, and Arnelle may have 
been around. 
 
Q: Did Gigi work Saturdays?  
 
A: No  
 
Q: Okay.  And Sydney and Justin stayed with you--Let me ask 
you:  On the 4th, do you recall going over to Bundy at all?  
 
A: No. I may have. I think I did at one  point, but I'm not a hundred 
percent sure. 
 
Q:  Do you know what you-might have gone over there for?  
 
A:  Something to do with Justin and Justin's Nintendos and things.  
 
Q:  Okay. Was that the time you walked in and up to Justin's room 
with him? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And Nicole was in her bedroom. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did you come in the front door or back door? 
 
A:  I believe it was the back door. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did you go up through the kitchen to the front 
staircase? 
 
A:  That's the only way to go up. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And how long were you up there 
 
with Justin before you came back down? 
 
A: Two, three minutes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you do while Justin was in talking to 
Nicole at that time?  
 
A: Looked at the back of his machine, looked to see what he had, 
looked to see how it was hooked up.  
 
Q: Okay. And did he leave with you then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, after the 4th--that was a Saturday?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  On the 5th did you have any conversations during the 
day with Nicole?  
 
A: There was a message for me, I believe.  
 
Q: Do you recall--From Nicole? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: He didn't ask you about messages, OJ. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I didn't have a conversation with her, no. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what the substance of the message was 
from Nicole?  
 
A: Something about the dogs. Could have been Monday. I'm not a 
hundred percent sure. Could have been Monday. But it was 
something about the dogs  one of those two days.  
 
Q: Can you be more specific what it was about the dogs? 
 
A: They were fighting. One of them had to be taken back to my 
house.  
 
Q: Was that Kato and Chachi?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you took Sydney and Justin back the night of the 
5th, Sunday night. Is that correct?  
 
A:  I'm not sure. 
 
Q:  Do you know when or what day you took Sydney and Justin 
back? 
 
A:  No. It could have been Monday. I may have taken them to 
school Monday. I'm not sure. 
 
Q:  W ell, after the 4th, do you know when the next time you were 
back over at Bundy was? 
 
A:  I know I was there Sunday.  It could have been Monday, but 
I'm pretty sure it was Sunday. 
 
Q:  It was the 5th?  
 
A:  I'm pretty sure it was. 
 
Q:  Well, was that the day you went over there and Faye was there? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And was that the day Kato got out and you had to catch 
him? 
 
A:  Yes.  That was either Sunday or Monday. 
 
Q:  And you eventually caught Kato?  
 
A:  Yes. Well, she did and then kinda ran him to me. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you speak to Nicole at all that day? 
 
A:  I don't think so.  I may have made a crack about Faye, but we 
didn't have a conversation, no. 
 
Q:  You made a crack about Faye to Nicole?  
 
A:  I may have, but-  
 
Q:  Or a crack to-  
 
A:  To Nicole about Faye.  I just saw Nicole; she came to the front 
of the house at one point, but I don't recall if we had an interchange 
or not. 
 
Q:  Okay. And after the 5th do you recall seeing or speaking to 
Nicole again before the recital on June 12th? 
 
A: I was just saying if the dog incident was the 5th, no.  
 
Q: Okay. So the last time you remember either seeing or speaking 
to Nicole prior to June 12th, 1994 at the recital was this Sunday, 
June 5th? 
 
A:  No.  I talked to her during the week at one point when I was in 
Connecticut. I think we had a short conversation, but it was just to 
get to Justin or something. We may have had a short conversation 
then. 
 
Q:  I assume this would have been a call initiated by you? 
 
A: Yes, it started by me and then they called me. 
 
Q: Who is "they?" 
 
A: Nicole may have put the call in for Justin. 
 
Q:  And what was that regarding?  
 
A: Justin. Evidently, Justin, they had something at his school that I 
was-didn't know about or hadn't paid attention to or something, and 
I wanted to congratulate him. 
 
Q: Okay. Was Justin upset that you weren't there for it?  
 
A:  He was asking me where was I. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Was Nicole upset with you for not being there? 
 
A: She didn't indicate that to me, no. 
 
Q:  Did you even speak to her at all? 
 
A:  I think the first time I called, I spoke to her, yes, and then they 
called me back, and I think they just put Justin on the phone. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall the substance of the conversation when 
you spoke to her?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And what was that?  
 
A: "I want to speak to Justin.  
 
Q: And what did she say?  
 
A: I think she was involved in something.  
 
Q: Just handed the phone to Justin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did she say?  
 
A: Where was I. They needed to call me back. 
 
Q: Any particular tone to her voice?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And how long after that did she call you back? 
 
A:  I don't recall.  
 
Q:  Within an hour? 
 
A:  Probably. 
 
Q:  And when you say they called you back-- 
 
A:  Justin called me back. 
 
Q:  Okay. You didn't speak to Nicole again? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And do you recall what day that was on? Or can you tell by 
looking at Miss Randa's calendar? 
 
A: I would say it was Wednesday night. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: 8th. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Prior to that, during that week, which would have been 6, 7, 8, 
9, 10, did you have any argument with Nicole about Faye? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you have any argument on the 5th with Nicole about Faye?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  To the best of your recollection you might have made a crack 
about Faye to Nicole on the 5th?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  After you spoke to Nicole and-on the 8th, could you tell me 
when you next spoke to her? 
 
A: On the 12th. 
 
Q: And what time was that? 
 
A: I got to go back to something. 
 
Q:  Okay.  
 
A:  I think Nicole asked me on the 8th would I be back in town for 
the weekend. 
 
Q:  You think or did she? 
 
A:  I'm sure she did. 
 
Q:  Okay. And what did you tell her?  
 
A:  I had planned to be, yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. On the 6th, that was the day that you sent the IRS letter 
to Nicole, is it not?  
 
A:  I wouldn't have been aware of it, but evidently that's the day it 
got there, yes. 
 
Q:  When you say you weren't "aware of it," what do you mean by 
that? 
 
A: I had told Cathy to write something along those lines, and I had 
met with Skip about it previous to this. 
 
Q:  Well, do you know how long previous to that you had met Skip 
about it? 
 
A:  I know it was right after she had called and yelled at me. 
 
Q: And what date was that?  
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  What did she yell at you about?  
 
A:  About Faye.  
 
Q:  Do you have any idea what that date was?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  By looking at Cathy's calendar there, does it jog your memory 
at all? Was it was a weekend?  
 
A:  No. It was during the week.  
 
Q:  Okay. Was it after Palm Springs? 
 
A: It was before Palm Springs.  
 
Q: The week before?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  Was it a night or day when she called you?  
 
A: Night. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Are you now trying to turn this into a 
sauna? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It is hot.  Held hostage.  Why don't you lower 
it. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Held hostage in a sauna. 
 
MR. BREWER: I would say today's one-liner is, "Kelly turns up 
the heat." 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER:  Do you want to just read it from page 
855?  You can just read it. 
 
MR. KELLY: Read what? I'm checking back to my last question, 
Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Your last question was a series of 
questions that was asked on January 24, 1996. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  After June 8th, I think you just indicated before that the next 
time you spoke to Nicole was June 12th? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to Sydney or Justin between June 8th and June 
12th?  
 
A: I don't believe so. I may have speaken to--spoken to them on the 
11th, but I'm not sure. 
 
Q:  Okay. When did you speak to her on the 12th?  
 
A:  I was in my car coming back from golf. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you made that call? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was the substance of that conversation? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: How long was that conversation? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Was it a short conversation? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Was it a pleasant conversation? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY 
Q:  When you got to the recital on June 12th, did you already have 
a ticket in hand for that?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay.  How did you get your ticket to get into the recital?  
 
A: As I said before when Mr. Petrocelli-  
 
MR. LEONARD: -celli. 
 
THE WITNESS:---celli 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Oh, the meltdown look from Daniel. 
 
THE WITNESS: My son grabbed me, brought me over to Nicole, 
and I asked Nicole for the ticket. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No respect. 
 
BY MR. ROBERT BAKER: 
Q: Did you speak to Nicole at all during the recital?  
 
A:  Other than asking for the ticket, no. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall there being a break during the recital?  
 
A: Possibly.  
 
Q: Okay. And you didn't speak to Nicole at that time, did you?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: And you had indicated earlier to Mr. Petrocelli that- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't take the easy ones; he won't be 
whispering in your ear anymore. 
 
MR. KELLY: Little levity to the table here.  
 
Q: When you sat down at the recital, you indicated that the kids 
were between you and Nicole?  
 
A:  Well, they were moving around a lot. 
 
Q:  Okay. Could--  
 
A:  Actually Justin was in my lap most of the time instead of his 
seat, and then they were--you know, the boys, they were running 
around.  
 
Q:  Could you tell me how many seats were between you and 
Nicole?  
 
A:  Two. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Here, you can read it from page 861, 
January 24th, 1996. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Did you ever move your seat from where you were with 
Nicole?  
 
A:  These are not movable seats.  It's like going to a theater. You 
can't move them.  
 
Q:  Did you ever go sit somewhere else after a while? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: You stayed in that same seat the entire recital?   
 
A:  I went and got my--I stood for a while at the entry when I came 
back from getting flowers.  
 
Q:  Did you ever sit down somewhere else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  "Now" you gave Sydney flowers at the recital. Correct?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q: Was that in the school? 
 
A: Outside.  
 
Q: Okay. And you had your picture taken with Sydney.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Was that in the school?  
 
A: Outside.  
 
Q: And how much time would you say you spent with Sydney at 
the recital? 
 
A: Well, they were back and forth from the seats, so whatever time 
they were with us at the seats and--you know, so whatever time 
that was.  
 
Q: I think you indicated the recital ended about 6:30, quarter of 
7:00?  
 
A: That's a total guess, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And you were there on time?  
 
A: I mean-  
 
Q: Start of it?   
 
A: I was there five or seven minutes after 5:00, you know, 10 
minutes after 5:00 maybe. 
 
Q: And for that whole approximately hour and a half you never 
spoke to Nicole?  
 
A: No, other than, as I told you before, we kinda looked at each 
other when Sydney was dancing and, you know, acknowledged 
that she was beautiful to  one another. 
 
Q:  That was acknowledged with a look back and forth?  
 
A:  Yeah, we both -- I kinda mouthed she was beautiful, and 
Nicole was, you know, smiling, and you  know, "She's gorgeous" 
or something.  I don't know, it was just--acknowledged that our 
daughter was beautiful. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Other than that, no conversation at the recital?  
 
A:  Correct. 
 
Q:  Any conversation outside the school after the recital with 
Nicole?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And when you made the call that evening about 8:45 to 
Sydney, Nicole didn't say a word to you?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. And in fact I think- 
 
A: Not that I know of. She may have said, "I'll get her," you know, 
something mundane, but there was no conversation.  
 
Q: But you just asked if Sydney was asleep yet or not?  
 
A: Yes. "Is Sidney still up," I might have said, or, "Is Sydney 
asleep," or, "Is she still up," or something. 
 
Q:  Okay.  I think you also indicated, by the quick response you 
got by Sydney picking up the phone, you got the impression that 
Nicole was in Sydney's bedroom with her? 
 
A:  Or vice versa.  Maybe Sydney was in bed with Nicole, which is 
quite normal. 
 
Q:  Going to June 13th, did you speak to Sydney or Justin at all 
that day? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q:  Did you see Sydney or Justin at all that day? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Other than any attorneys, on the 13th did you have any 
discussions with anybody about where you were, what you were 
doing on the night of June 12th? 
 
A:  Not that I recall.  
 
Q:  Did you have any discussion with anybody on the 13th other 
than attorneys regarding your possible involvement in Ron or 
Nicole's deaths? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Other than the police.  
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: Whatever their questions were.  
 
Q: Okay. But you didn't discuss the night of June 12th with 
anybody again? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  On the 13th did you ever leave your house again that day or 
that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  On June 14th did you continue to watch the coverage regarding 
the deaths of Nicole and Ron? 
 
A: I may have. You know, in the morning I may have, but I'm not 
sure. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you recall any evidence or anything that was 
discussed on the 14th that you saw on TV?  
 
A:  As I told you before, there was a lot of things being said that- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: There is no evidence. Wait a minute. 
There is no evidence that's discussed. There's evidence only 
admitted to a trial. 
 
Q:  You know, this has been gone over.  This is now at least the 
fifth time, and I am not going to put up with it anymore.  I think 
this is harassing, I think it's abusive to Mr. Simpson, I think it's an 
outrage, and it isn't going to go on. So you can ask a couple more 
questions, but then I am going to  terminate the deposition. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q:  Mr. Simpson, on the 14th would it be fair to say that there was 
the large group of the media outside your residence at Rockingham 
in the morning? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Were you able to leave your residence at Rockingham on the 
14th without being detected by anybody at that residence? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Kardashian pick you up around the corner when you 
left there? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And on the 16th after the funeral of Nicole when you 
were back at the Browns', do you recall switching your clothes 
with A.C. Cowlings?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You didn't?   
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  you didn't switch any sort of outer garment either--with A.C for 
purposes of leaving the Browns'?  
 
A: Maybe a coat.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And did you have any discussion with A.C about him 
leaving in the limousine you had arrived in?

recall.

were or what you were doing the night of the 12th ?  
 
A: Not that I recall.  
 
Q: Do you recall attending the wake that night? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall any conversations you had with Cora 
Fishman at the wake?  
 
A: I recall she was crying and I was hugging her at one point.  
 
Q:  Do you recall any conversation?  
 
A:  No. She was, you know, despondent, and so was I. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall any conversation you might have had with 
Betsy Rocket?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall any conversation you might have had with 
Deanne LeBron? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you recall any conversation you had with Judy Brown that 
night at the wake?  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Could you tell me what she said to you and what you 
said to her? 
 
A: I believe she said, "You didn't do this," and I said, "No. Judy. I 
loved Nicole," and then we hugged, and I don't know if I went to 
her house. We  may have had a conversation at her house about the 
kids and stuff.  
 
Q: And what day was that?  
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you recall being at the Browns' on the 15th after the wake? 
 
A: I don't recall. I know one of the days I was there, and I just don't 
recall which day it was.  
 
Q: The 16th, do you recall going to the cemetery after the funeral 
mass for Nicole?  
 
A: I recall getting there, yes.  
 
Q: Do you recall going to Browns' house after that funeral service?  
 
A: Not really.  
 
Q: And as of the night of the 16th after the funeral, I believe you 
indicated--or even the morning of the 17th, indicated up to that 
point you  never thought you'd be arrested for these murders. Is 
that correct? 
 
A:  I don't think that was on my mind, no.   
 
Q:  Okay. At any time between the 13th and 17th?  
 
A:  I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you recall having any  conversation with Lou and 
Juditha Brown on the evening of the 16th after the funeral?  
 
A: I recall having a conversation with  them. I just don't know what 
day it was.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall where this  conversation took place?  
 
A: I believe it was in their bedroom.  
 
Q: And do you recall who was there  between--besides yourself 
and Lou and Judy, if anybody? 
 
A:  I know at one point Arnelle. 
 
Q:  Okay. And could you tell me the substance of this 
conversation?  
 
A:  I told them I was thinking about moving down to Laguna so 
that the kids and us all could be close. 
 
Q: Okay. In fact you had called Lou and Judy back into the 
bedroom to talk to you, had you not?  
 
A: I don't recall that, no.  
 
Q: Okay.  And did you say anything to them 
 
other than you might be moving down to Laguna?  
 
A: Other than--That was the substance of what I talked to them 
about, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you talk at all about how Sydney and Justin were 
going to be raised?  
 
A: I talked to them about moving to Laguna because I wanted them 
to be a part of Sydney and Justin's life, so Nicole's family could be 
a part of their life, so I told them I thought I was going to move 
down to Laguna.  
 
Q: Okay. And did the subject of Arnelle playing a role in this move 
or this bringing up of Sydney and Justin come into the 
conversation at all?  
 
A: It may have, but Arnelle--it may have.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall at any time either at the wake or funeral 
saying to Betsy Rocket, just spontaneously saying to Betsy Rocket, 
"I loved her too  much"?  
 
A: To Betsy?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: Not in particular, no.  
 
Q: Do you recall saying spontaneously to Deanne LeBron, "I loved 
her too much"?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Do you recall saying to Judy Brown in 
 
response to her question to you about whether you did this, "I 
loved her too much "?  
 
A: Not too much, no. That I loved her and I didn't do it. I loved 
her. 
 
Q: Do you recall saying to Cora Fishman, "I loved her too much"?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall saying to Faye Resnick, "I loved her too much"?  
 
A: I don't recall seeing Faye, but no. 
 
Q: Do you recall saying that to anybody either at the wake or the 
funeral, just, "I loved her too much"?  
 
A:  I know that was a general attitude I had, but I don't recall 
saying that to anybody, that "I loved her so much" or "I loved 
Nicole." That's why I was feeling the pain I was feeling.  
 
Q: The October 25th, 1993 incident at Gretna Green. did you 
actually kick that door?  
 
A: I think as she closed it, I kicked it, yes. 
 
Q: And as of June 1994, did you know what Elvia's schedule was?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  As of June 1994, what was Gigi's 
 
schedule? 
 
A:  She worked during the week and was off on weekends. 
 
Q:  Okay.  She would return Monday morning? 
 
A:  I don't know. I'm not sure.  I think sometimes she may have 
come back Sunday night. I'm not sure, though. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you would normally park your Bronco on Ashford, 
I believe you indicated.  
 
A:  Yeah. I mean I parked it on both streets, but Ashford would be 
normally the street I parked it on. 
 
Q:  Okay. And I think you also indicated that you would normally 
drive the Bronco? 
 
A: Well, I drove it a lot when I could, but, you know, I drove both 
cars probably equally as much.  
 
Q: Okay. Mother's Day weekend when you drove down to Laguna, 
which car did you drive?  
 
A: I'm pretty sure it would have been the Bentley.  
 
Q:  On the June 11th night when you went to the formal affair with 
Paula, which car did you drive?  
 
A: I'm sure it was the Bentley.  
 
Q: On June 12th when you went to the 
 
recital, which car did you drive?  
 
A:  I believe it was the Bentley.  
 
Q:  On June 12th when you went to the McDonald's with Kato, 
which car did you drive?

opened?

BY MR. KELLY: 
Q:  Mr. Simpson, at your Rockingham estate prior to January 1992, 
could you tell me as part of the alarm system there was a button to 
summon Westec Security directly? 
 
A:  Yes.  There was a code also.  
 
Q:  Okay. So it was just--it wasn't a verbal command to have a 
Westec Security person come?  
 
A:  You didn't need to, no.  
 
Q:  It was like a panic button you could hit?  
 
A:  Yes, and a code -- a different code number you can hit that's 
sort of like a silent alarm.  
 
Q: Okay. Other than the incident of 1984-85 where the windshield 
was cracked with a bat, do you recall any other time a Westec 
Security person showing up at your place at Rockingham? 
 
A: Well, my alarm went off a lot, and so they'd show up for 
whatever reason, or call, and if no one was home, I guess they'd 
show up.   
 
Q: Do you know any time they showed up as a result of Nicole 
hitting that button?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay. In the week of January 13th, 1994, January 13th being 
that Monday, can you think of any incident or event that caused 
you any scratches,  abrasions or injuries on your left hand?  
 
A: I have- 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: January- 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: I'm sorry.  June.  June. I misspoke.  The week of June 13th, 
1994. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: This has all been gone over as well. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. You mean after I got the bandage 
on my hand? 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: You are not talking about the cut back in 
Chicago? 
 
MR. KELLY: Right.  
 
Q:  Other than that, was there any other incident with your left 
hand that caused any- 
 
A:  I don't know.  I was carrying a lot of stuff.  It was awkward to 
carry it. And then my son was doing his rassling. I rassled with 
him, and, you know, we kind of roughhoused a little bit at 
Kardashian's.  
 
Q:  Well, do you recall any injuries to your left hand?  
 
A:  Pardon me?  I know I was bleeding at one point and had--and 
with blood on my bandage. I had to redo it, redress it, I guess. 
 
Other than the bandage on the middle knuckle of the middle finger 
of your left hand, do you recall any other injury or anything to your 
left hand from rassling with your son?  
 
A: Other than that there was blood there and I had to--on the 
outside and I had to rebandage it, other than that, no.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever discuss with Nicole about building a home 
in-a house in Cabo? 
 
A: I was doing that before Nicole and I got back together. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you actually have architectural plans drawn up for 
that?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. On Saturday before Nicole and Ron's deaths, which 
would have been June 11th, did you call someone named Jasmine 
Guy?  
 
A: I may have, yes.  
 
Q: And who is Jasmine Guy? 
 
A: An actress. 
 
Q: And what was the purpose of you calling her?  
 
A: I had met her previous to this. We  talked on the phone from 
time to time.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know if you called her more than once?  
 
A: I think in New York--I may have called her when I was in New 
York. One of the trips I was in New York, I may have called her.  
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether that was Saturday or Sunday? 
 
A:  When I was in New York, this was weeks previous to this.  
 
Q:  Well, I am asking you on Saturday,  June 11th, or Sunday, June 
12th, did you call her?  
 
A: I don't know. I may have, but I don't know.  
 
Q: Okay. Was there ever a time in June 1994 where Nicole left 
things outside her front or back door at Bundy so you didn't have 
to go inside the house to pick something up?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Was there ever a time in May l 994 that she did that? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: April?  
 
A: Not that I recall, no.  
 
Q: Did that ever happen at any time on Monday?  
 
A: Not that I recall, no.  
 
Q: Did it ever happen at Gretna Green?  
 
A: Not that I recall, no. 
 
Q:  Okay. You never called the police or Westec as a result of any 
time Nicole struck you, did you?  
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And the '89 agreement that you and Nicole signed in 
reference to your antenuptial, that wasn't reciprocal, was it?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did Nicole ever bruise, cut or injure you in any way? 
 
A: I don't recall.  
 
Q:  And at one point you mentioned that Nicole started showing up 
at your country club. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q: And that was in, what, March of 1993? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Did that happen on more than one occasion?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And was that -- that was just down on the range. Right?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And that's separate from the course? 
 
A:  Yes. It's right--the course goes around the range, and once I 
was-once it happened--maybe once or twice it happened when I 
was up in the bar.  
 
Q:  Okay. Total of how many times did it happen?  
 
A:  In the beginning, two or three times, and then she started taking 
golf lessons with her girlfriends, so quite often.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And prior to that I think you had indicated in the late 
'80s and early '90s golf was an issue because you liked playing it 
so much. Correct?  
 
A:  I don't know if it was an issue, but I played golf a lot, yes, and 
sometimes it bugged her a little bit.  
 
Q:  Okay. Was there ever a time that any of your neighbors had to-
-any of your neighbors at Rockingham had to have--file a police 
report because 
 
of Nicole showing up there at night?  
 
A:  I don't know that she ever showed up at any neighbor's house at 
night.  
 
Q:  No.  From her showing up at Rockingham or being in the 
neighborhood at night.  
 
A: I don't think it's against the law for her to be in the 
neighborhood at night.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you know if any neighbor ever called the police 
from her showing up at your residence and being in your 
neighborhood at Rockingham late at night?  
 
A:  As I said, I certainly don't know of it. I don't know why they 
would.  
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know if anybody ever called the police on you 
for being over at Gretna Green at night?  
 
A: I know one neighbor called and said they didn't know who they 
saw on the sidewalk, and they called the police. They testified in 
the trial.  
 
Q: Okay. But that never happened with anybody calling the police 
about Nicole being over around your place?  
 
A:  I wouldn't know.  I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did Nicole ever kick in your door at Rockingham? 
 
A:  Oh, she's kicked a door or two in her day, yes.  
 
Q:  Okay. Did it ever cause you to call 911? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q:  Okay. Did you ever have to go to the hospital because of any 
encounter with Nicole?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: As far as you know, did she ever look in your window at 
Rockingham late at night?  
 
A: It would be tough outside the wall to look in my window, but I 
know she was at my gate a few times and went home. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Nothing further. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Same stipulation that we've had with the 
other witnesses? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Now, one other question: Do we want to 
take a day before we start?  Are you leaving town? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Before we start-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, the problem is we have a 11:00 o'clock 
hearing on Thursday; we have a 3:00 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, 
so it would be easier to knock it off- 
 
MR. KELLY: Tomorrow would be better to do it in the morning. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--if we can finish it before noon. 
 
MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Let's go off.  Are we off? Let's go off. 
 
MR. ROBERT BAKER: Let's go off, Rod. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:59. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now. The 
time is approximately 4:00 o'clock. This concludes the deposition 
of Orenthal James Simpson, Volume IX.  The number of 
videotapes used was three. We are going off the record, and the 
time is approximately 4:00 o 'clock. 
 
(ENDING TIME: 4:00 P.M.) 
 
I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE 
FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT.  SUBSCRIBED AT 
CALIFORNIA. THIS DAY OF . 19_  ORENTHAL JAMES 
SIMPSON

Q. You can make any changes you like, but you can be assured we will comment on
those
changes to embarrass you and discredit you.

Do you understand that?

A. Yes.

Q. Where do you presently live?

MR. KELLY: We will provide that in writing just like we have done with every
other
witness.
MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Why don't you write it down.

A. (Indicating.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have the next exhibit in order for the defense?

(A discussion is held off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Is this a home or condominium?

A. This is a townhome.

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are you instructing her not to answer that?

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: On what grounds?

MR. KELLY: Totally irrelevant.

You know what she does for a living. That's all you need to know right now.
Where she
has lectured, what she lectured on has absolutely nothing to do with whether
your
client is liable for these murders or not.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Really, really. Maybe you better learn a little California
law
instead of New York law. 

MR. KELLY: Baker California law or regular California law?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You are going to be back here on all of these depos.

MR. KELLY: Great. Always a pleasure to see you, Mr. Baker.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: This is an outrage.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

You're not going to go through every lecture she has ever given.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I certainly am.

If she has made comments on these cases, it is certainly relevant.

MR. KELLY: Commenting on her sister is not commenting on this case. Her sister
was
here long before this case was here.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: It relates to her sister.

MR. KELLY: It relates to her -- I understand that.

You asked if it had anything to do with Mr. Simpson. If you want to ask if it
had
anything to do with this case, ask her that.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: We don't need your advice on how to ask questions. We will
ask the
questions we want.

MR. KELLY: She will not answer what I tell her not to.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did it talk about the civil case at all?

A. No.

Q. Did it talk about the criminal case?

A. No.

Q. Did it talk about your prior relationship with Nicole Simpson?

A. Not really.

Q. What did it relate to?

A. Domestic violence.

Q. With Nicole Simpson?

A. Not personally, no.

Q. How was Nicole Simpson discussed?

A. How wonderful of a mother she was, what a great human being she was.

That she would do anything for anybody, that she was a -- Her kids were her
life. How
her kids meant everything to her.

Q. And -- 

A. And that she's gone, and that's it.

Q. What do you mean by "That's it"?

A. That's all I said about her.

Q. Where did this lecture take place?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: 

Q. Was it tape-recorded?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

40
percent relating to revenues?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Who is Jeff Noebel?

A. Jeff Noebel? A man who lives in Texas.

Q. Have you ever worked with him?

A. Yes. He was related to the foundation.

Q. What did he do with the foundation?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Was he head of the foundation? 

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Well, just a minute. Are all of your objections on relevance
grounds?

MR. KELLY: Yes.

She is not answering any questions about the foundation or her employment.

If you want to get to something that has anything to do with the facts and
circumstances of these murders, the events leading up to them, I will let her
answer
it, or her relationship with your client.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I bet the shortest book I ever read was "John Quinlan Kelly
on
Evidence."

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: It goes directly to evidence, bias.

If she earns income as a result of these crimes, we ought to know about it.

Q. Do you get a salary from the foundation?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Was Jeff Noebel in any way related to the foundation?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Does the foundation provide grants?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Does it provide donations?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: What are you trying to hide, Mr. Kelly?

MR. KELLY: I am not trying to hide.

I am trying to get a deposition that might be the least bit relevant.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I am trying to get the court, and we are going to go over to
the
court this morning.

Go ahead.

MR. KELLY: Why don't we, before he goes ahead, see if you get the court first,
and we
can cut this short.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Have you ever read the bylaws of the foundation?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Do you understand Brown family members receive a salary from the foundation?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What was your blood alcohol level in 1992 when you were arrested for driving
under
the influence?

MR. KELLY: If you know.

Actually don't answer it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Goes to her credibility.

Q. Were you found guilty of that crime?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. what was the last question?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: "Were you found guilty of that crime?"

Q. Was it over 5 years ago?

A. Uh-huh. Yeah.

Q. Over 8 years ago?

A. It was before I had my son.

Q. Before?

A. Before 1986.

Q. So from 1986 to 1994, you never saw O.J. hit Nicole; true?

A. Saw it? Physically? 

Q. Saw it. 

A. No. 

Q. Where were you when this incident occurred, what part of the room -- part of
the
house? I apologize. 

MR. KELLY: We are talking about after La Cantina? 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Right.

THE WITNESS: Where were we?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yes.

THE WITNESS: We were at his bar.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. In the living room?

A. I guess it's in the dining room.

Q. Tell me --

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Family room?

THE WITNESS: Family room.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Family room?

Tell me how you recall this incident occurring.

A. We were sitting at the bar --

MR. KELLY: Excuse me. Just coughing.

THE WITNESS: We were sitting at the bar, and I had told O.J. that he took
Nicole for
granted. 

And after that, he said, "What? Me?" 

And I said, "Yeah." I said, "She does everything for you. You take her for
granted."

MR. KELLY: Phil, hold on one second, please.

(Interruption in the proceedings.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Okay.

Q. You can continue.

A. I'm sorry?

Q. You can continue.

A. So I told her -- told him that he was taking Nicole for granted.

Nicole agreed with me. And he got very upset about that and he started
screaming and
yelling, and everybody started screaming.

And then he proceeded to walk up the stairs, throw pictures down the -- down
the
staircase, went in and got Nicole's clothes and started throwing them down onto
Nicole
and down into the foyer.

And then said, "Get out of my house."

She said, "This is my house, too. I am not leaving."

And he said, "Yes, you are." He threw her up against the door, picked her up,
threw
her up against the door, threw her out of the house.

Picked me up -- picked Ed [Name Deleted] up first, tossed him out of the house,
and
then threw me out of the house, too.

Q. Where were you sitting at the bar?

A. Where was I sitting at the bar?

Q. Yes.

Were you at one of the stools?

MR. KELLY: If you were sitting.

THE WITNESS: Right in front of the bar (indicating).

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Were you sitting at one of the stools?

A. I was -- I was either sitting or standing next to a stool.

Q. Where was Ed [Name Deleted]? Was he in the room?

A. We were all four in the room.

Q. Was he to the left or to the right of you?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Where was O.J.?

A. Behind the bar.

Q. Was he standing or sitting?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Did you have any drinks at the bar in O.J.'s house after you had returned
from La
Cantina?

A. Probably.

Q. How many?

A. I don't recall.

Q. What were you drinking that night?

A. Margaritas.

Q. Did you have a Margarita at Rockingham?

A. I -- I don't think we made Margaritas. I don't remember.

Q. What did you have to drink? You have no idea?

A. I don't remember what we drank there.

Q. You don't remember how many drinks you had?

A. At --

Q. At Rockingham after you returned from La Cantina.

A. No.

Q. Were you drunk when this incident occurred?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: On what basis is that one?

MR. KELLY: She is not capable of concluding her own state of mind whether she
is drunk
or not.

If you want to ask her all night long how many drinks she had over what period
of time
or whatever, you are more than welcome to, or ask her in her opinion was she --

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: On that night she was not capable of remembering what her
state of
mind is? Is that your objection?

MR. KELLY: I didn't say that.

I said if you want to ask her in her opinion if she was --

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. In your opinion, were you drunk that night?

A. No.

Q. How many drinks does it usually take for you to get drunk, in your opinion?

A. Well, I don't drink anymore. 

Q. That's not the question. 

A. So -- It varied. 

Q. From? 

A. It could take anywhere from, I don't know, 1 to 10.

Q. So anywhere from 1 to 10 drinks could get you drunk?

A. Not sloppily drunk, no.

Q. But drunk, in your opinion?

A. Probably over 5.

Q. And is it your recollection that you had about 4 drinks at La Cantina?

A. Around that.

Q. And you may have had 1 or 2 drinks at Rockingham following your return from
La
Cantina?

A. Probably.

Q. It is your opinion you don't know whether you were drunk or not on the night
--

A. I was not drunk.

Q. Was Ed [Name Deleted] drunk?

A. I don't know. 

Q. Was Nicole drunk?

A. I don't know.

Q. Was O.J. drunk?

A. I don't know.

Q. What business of yours was it to tell O.J. how he was treating Nicole?

A. Well, what business was it?

Q. Yes.

A. I felt like he should treat her a little nicer. I felt like he should be a
little
bit more respectful to her.

And I think as a sister, I had a right to say it.

Q. Did you always tell O.J. your thoughts about the way he was treating Nicole?

A. Pretty much.

Q. How many times?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Over 10?

A. Probably.

Q. Over 20?

A. I don't know.

Q. When was the last time you talked to O.J. was treating Nicole?

A. Probably the morning that we found out she was murdered when I was on the
phone
with him.

Q. Okay.

What did you say to him?

A. I said, "You are a murderer. You killed her. You always said you would."

MR. KELLY: (Indicating.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What time of day did you say this? Is this when the police called at 6:15?

MR. KELLY: Compound question.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. When did you say this to the police, when they called in the morning?

A. I told the police this, also.

Q. Right.

When did you --

I'm wrong. You are right, John.

When did you talk to O.J. on June 13th?

A. At about 7:15 in the morning when he called our house.

Q. Had you talked to the police previous to that?

A. Yes. 

Q. What time?

A. At about 6:15, 6:30.

Q. Is that when they first called to tell your family Nicole had been murdered?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you answer the phone when they called?

A. No.

Q. Who answered the phone?

A. My mother.

Q. What do you recall saying to the police on that first phone call?

A. "He killed her. He always said he would kill her" --

Q. Uh-huh.

A. -- "and he did."

Q. That was the first phone cal1 you -- that the police made to your family's
residence on that day; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you take the phone away from your mother?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's the first thing you said to the police?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you say anything else in that phone call?

A. "He killed her. He killed her. He always said he was going to kill her. He
finally
did it."

And that was all I said.

Q. Did O.J. Simpson ever tell you he was going to kill her.

A. I had heard him say if he ever -- 

Q. That's not the question. 

A. Sorry.

MR. KELLY: Listen to the question. Just answer the question.

Just one second.

(witness and counsel confer off the record.)

MR. KELLY: Can we have the last question read back.

(The record is read by the reporter.)

THE WITNESS: No.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. So were you ever in a room where he uttered that?

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Were you ever in a room where he uttered that?

A. To Nicole? 

Q. You were in the same room? 

A. No.

Q. So you never heard him say that; true?

A. Not him.

Q. So when you told the police he always said he would kill her, you had no
independent knowledge that he said this; correct? 

A. He never told me.

Q. So the answer is "true"; is that correct?

A. Nicole told me.

MR. KELLY: Well, wait.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. How many times did she tell you?

MR. KELLY: We have a "true" and "that's correct."

Do we have an answer to that?

(The record is read by the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: I am going to object to the form of the question in terms of
independent
knowledge. She stated that she hadn't heard him say that directly to her. That
doesn't
mean she didn't have other independent knowledge other than his statements
directly to
her.

Do you want to rephrase it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What time of night did this incident with Ed [Name Deleted], Nicole and you
occur?

A. Around midnight.

Q. What time did you go to dinner?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Before you went to La Cantina, did you have any drinks over at Rockingham?

A. Not that I remember, no.

Q. Did you go to Rockingham before you went to La Cantina?

A. Yes.

Q. How long were you there?

A. Oh, I don't remember. Not too long.

Q. "Not too long" meaning how long?

MR. KELLY: Do you want to rephrase that, please.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. 15 minutes? a half hour?

What do you mean by that?

A. I don't remember.

Q. How did you get to the Rockingham estate?

MR. KELLY: That night?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: The night of the La Cantina incident.

THE WITNESS: Ed.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Ed picked you up?

A. I was with Ed.

Q. Did you have any drinks at all prior to going to dinner at La Cantina, if
you
recall?

A. No.

Q. You are sure?

A. Not that I recall.

Q. Now, what did Ed say that night?

MR. KELLY: At any time?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. When you confronted O.J.

A. It was a conversation between me and O.J.

Q. What were you talking about before you made this statement to O.J.?

A. Just about their relationship?

Q. Yes.

You were talking about the relationship?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. Who brought --

MR. KELLY: You have to answer "yes" or "no" on the record.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Who commenced the issue of talking about the relationship?

A. I don't know. It just happened.

Q. Was O.J. making drinks when you discussed this?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Were there any housekeepers in the home that night?

A. That I don't know.

Q. Was there a nanny in the home that night?

A. That I don't know.

Q. Anyone else in the home that you know of other than Ed, Nicole, you and O.J?

A. That's all I remember.

Q. Tell me exactly what you recall saying to O.J. when he was standing behind
the bar.

A. I told him that he took Nicole for granted.

Q. What was his response?

A. He goes, "What? Me? I don't take" -- "I'm not taking her for granted."

Q. And then --

A. The conversation just went after that.

Q. What do you recall next? Who spoke next?

A. Well, I don't know who spoke next.

It was like, "Yeah, yeah," he took her for granted.

"He's taking me for granted."

Nicole would repeat -- say words as well.

Q. Nicole repeated it?

A. Oh, yeah.

Q. Did Ed say anything?

A. I don't remember if he did.

Q. When is the last time you talked to Ed [Name Deleted]?

A. Oh, probably after the murder.

Q. When after the murder?

A. I don't remember when.

Q. Was it a week after the murder, a month after the murder?

A. No. It was awhile after the murder. 

Q. Was it during the trial? 

A. Probably.

Q. Did you talk about this incident with him?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever talk to Ed about this incident after it occurred?

MR. KELLY: Ed [Name Deleted]?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yes.

THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You have no recollection of ever talking with him about this incident
following
that evening?

A. I -- I don't recall.

Q. Do you know if he filed a police report? 

MR. KELLY: Regarding this incident? 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yes. 

THE WITNESS: If who did? 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Ed [Name Deleted]. 

THE WITNESS: I don't know. 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did Nicole throw any pictures that night?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever stay at Ed [Name Deleted]'s condominium?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: Can I get some water?

MR. KELLY: Yes.

(Interruption in proceedings.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. So following this argument at the bar, who left the bar area first?

A. Oh, I don't know. I think everybody just sort of stood up.

Q. And walked where?

A. O.J. started pushing her out of the house, wanting her to get out.

Q. In the bar area?

A. Yeah.

Q. How did O.J. approach Nicole?

A. How did he approach her?

Where was she standing when he pushed her trying to throw her out?

Q. We were in the foyer at that point, kitchen. Were you in the kitchen or
entryway?

A. The entrance to the kitchen and foyer area.

Q. By the door to the kitchen?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. Is that a "yes"?

A. Yes. I'm sorry.

Q. So who left the bar area first?

A. Oh, I don't recall who left first.

Q. So the next recollection you have after this argument at the bar area is
O.J.
trying to throw Nicole out of the foyer area?

A. No.

Q. What happened next?

A. Next recollection I have is O.J. walking up the stairs, or running up the
stairs,
and he was throwing down pictures on the wall and throwing downstairs -- from
the top
of the staircase down into the foyer and on top of Nicole and saying, ''Get out
of my
house." She said, "This is my house, too."

Q. I think you misspoke, "throwing downstairs"?

Q. Did Nicole climb the stairs?

A. No.

Q. Did Ed climb the stairs?

A. I don't think so.

Q. Did Ed try to protect Nicole in any way?

crying
at that point.

yes.

Q. When he was throwing pictures, did any of them hit you?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. 3 inches by 3 inches?

A. Your guess is as good as mine.

Q. You just made --

A. Right.

Q. -- a showing of a circle.

MR. KELLY: Say about a 3-by-3.

THE WITNESS: I'll take your word for it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. And where else did you see bruises on Nicole?

A. On her face.

Q. Where on her face did you see these bruises after the '89 incident?

A. On her forehead.

Q. Where on her forehead did you see these bruises after the incident?

A. On her forehead here (indicating). It was all swollen.

Q. Her entire forehead was swollen?

A. Well, her whole face was swollen and scratched.

Q. How big was the bruise on her forehead that you saw after the '89 incident?

A. (Indicating.)

Probably about like this way (indicating).

Q. About 2 inches by 4 inches?

A. (Indicating.) However big this is.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: John, your measurements?

THE WITNESS: How big is this (indicating), having a whole side of her face.

MR. KELLY: Why don't we say 2 by 2 -- 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 or 2 by 2.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Where did you see these bruises? Where were you located when you saw these?

MR. KELLY: Where was she physically when she observed them on Nicole?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Yes, yes.

THE WITNESS: I remember when I took the pictures of Nicole, I was upstairs in
the
Rockingham bathroom.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You took pictures of Nicole to demonstrate the bruises she received after
the '89
incident?

A. Right.

Q. How many pictures did you take?

A. 2 Polaroids.

Q. You were standing in -- You took these pictures in which bathroom in the
Rockingham
estate?

A. Nicole's bathroom.

Q. Is that in one of the upstairs bedrooms?

A. In that master suite.

Q. Why did you take these pictures?

A. She asked me to.

Q. Whose Polaroid did you use?

A. Nicole's.

Q. She handed you the Polaroid?

A. She handed me the camera and said, "Will you take these pictures for me."

Q. Did she tell you why she wanted these pictures taken?

A. She wanted to have a record.

Q. She told you she wanted to have a record of the physical violence that O.J.
had --

A. Not in so many words.

MR. KELLY: Well, why don't you finish your question first, Mr. Baker.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What did she tell you exactly? Why did she want to keep a record?

A. She didn't give me a why. She just told me she wanted to have the pictures.

Q. And did you ask her why?

A. No. She just wanted to have them.

Q. At that point did you believe that the reason she wanted the pictures was
because
she wanted to document O.J. hitting her?

A. I don't know what her reason behind it was.

Q. Did you ever think about it?

A. Did I?

Q. Yes.

A. Well, I'm sure that's what it was.

Q. And you knew that in 1989 when you took those pictures of her in the
Rockingham
bathroom, did you not?

A. I didn't know that, no, because she didn't tell me that.

She just wanted to keep a record. That is all she said.

MR. KELLY: Phil, let her finish.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Well, did you ask her when she gave you this camera to take the pictures of
her how
she received the bruises?

A. She told me how she received the bruises, yes.

Q. What did she tell you?

A. She told me O.J. had hit her, O.J. had pulled her hair.

That O.J. had chased her through the yard at Rockingham, O.J. had chased her
through
the house at Rockingham.

Q. Anything else?

A. That she tried to get away. 

Q. Anything else? 

A. That she called 911. 

Q. Anything else?

A. And she wanted these pictures for a record.

Q. Did she tell you anything else about the night of New Year's Eve 1988?

A. She told me the reason, why they got into the fight.

Q. What did she tell you was the reason they got into a fight on New Year's Eve
1988?

A. Because she had found out that O.J. had given another girl a pair of
earrings that
looked just like hers.

Q. Who was this other girl?

A. I don't know.

Q. Did you ever ask Nicole when you were in the Rockingham estate taking these
pictures who the other girl was that O.J. had given the earrings to that caused
the
1-1-89 fight?

A. No.

Q. So she told you when you were taking these pictures at Rockingham that the
incident
was caused because O.J. had given earrings to another woman?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she tell you that she incited the argument, that she caused it by
confronting
O.J. about these earnings on 1-1-89?

A. I don't think that confronting somebody about earrings deserves a beating.

MR. KELLY: Well, just answer the question.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. That's not my question. Did she tell you that, ma'am?

A. No.

Q. What else did she tell you about what was the incident? 

MR. KELLY: If anything.

THE WITNESS: She didn't tell me anything.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Well, did you ask her what started this incident?

A. I just told you, the earrings.

Q. And is that all she said about what caused the incident?

A. That is all she said.

Q. Did she say O.J. had been drinking the night of 1-1-89?

A. She didn't say anything.

Q. Did she tell you she had been drinking --

A. She didn't say --

Q. -- on the night of 1-1-89?

A. She didn't say.

MR. BAKER: 12-31-88.

MR. PETROCELLI: 12-31-88 I assume you mean. Just say "New Year's Eve."

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Okay.

Q. So she told you a couple days after this incident, the 1989 incident, that
O.J. had
hit her, pulled her hair, chased her through the yard, through the house of
Rockingham.

And that she had tried to leave and tried to call 911; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And so you knew that O.J. was physically assaulting Nicole as of 1989; true?

MR. KELLY: And this was -- Had assaulted her on New Year's Day?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You had been informed by Nicole as early as 1989 that O.J. had physically
assaulted
her; true?

A. That '89 incident, true.

Q. When you granted an interview with the New York Times in the summer of 1994,
you
told the New York Times Nicole was not a battered woman; true?

A. True.

(A discussion is held off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did Nicole tell you she was falling-down drunk on New Year's Eve 1988?

A. No.

Q. Did she tell you anything about the New Year's Eve 1988 incident when you
took
those pictures?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever ask her -- Did you ask Nicole when you took these Polaroid
photos a
couple days after the '88 incident whether she was drunk that night?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Referring to this as the '89 incident?

THE WITNESS: I thought it was the New Year's Eve incident.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: All of the above.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you ask her, just to make the record clear, when you were in Rockingham
in 1989
whether she was drunk on the New Year's Eve incident?

A. No.

Q. Did she tell you of any other incidents of physical violence at the hands of
O.J.
prior to her death in 1994?

A. Not that I recall, no.

Q. Did you ever see Nicole drunk prior to her death in 1994?

A. In her whole lifetime?

Q. In the last 5 years of her life, last 6 years of her life.

A. Really drunk, no.

Q. When you say "really drunk," what do you mean?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Is really drunk to you falling-down drunk?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Is that what you meant? I've got to figure out what you mean.

MR. KELLY: I am trying to figure out what you meant with the question first,
and then
we will try to figure out what she meant with the answer.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Over .08 blood alcohol.

MR. KELLY: I don't think she ever took her sister's blood level, Bob, quite
frankly.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What did you mean by the term "really drunk"?

A. What do you mean by the term "really drunk"?

Q. You said it. I didn't.

A. Being really drunk means like being sloppily drunk, slurring words, like
that, to
me.

Q. So --

A. I have not seen Nicole like that.

Q. In the last 6 years of her life, you never saw her sloppily drunk?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever go out with Nicole socially in 1994?

A. I'm sure we did, but I don't recall.

Q. Did you ever go out with Nicole and Faye Resnick in 1994?

A. No.

Q. Have you ever seen Nicole use any drugs whatsoever?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Why not?

KELLY: Because your client didn't answer it deposition so we are not going to
have my
client answer it either.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Totally different standard to that.

PETROCELLI: And he actually did answer over his lawyers' objections.

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: What basis? So we know.

MR. KELLY: Absolutely no relevance.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: No relevance to that?

MR. KELLY: No, no. None whatsoever.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: Okay. What law school did you go to, Mr. Kelly?

MR. KELLY: Bob, we don't need your caustic comments, please.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I don't care what you need. Just trying to get a foundation
for my
motion.

MR. KELLY: Go down to court and get your motion going on your perfect record
down
there.

MR. PETROCELLI: Actually Phil's perfect record.

THE WITNESS: Poor Judy. Stop.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I take credit for batting below the Mendoza line.

Q. Did you ever see Nicole take any drugs in 1994?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you ever see Faye Resnick take any drugs?

(Witness and counsel confer off the record.)

MR. KELLY: Ask the question again.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Let the record reflect that John has privately talked to
Denise and
received the answer he wanted. So now he'll let me --

MR. KELLY: Would you like me to speak to you privately, Phil?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: I would rather you didn't.

MR. KELLY: I have no intention to.

more than 10 times?

A. I'm sure.

Q. Have you ever gone out with Ron Shipp alone?

Q. Do you agree -- You have no thoughts about her accusation she was involved

following June
of 1994?

MR. ROBERT BAKER: June 12th?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: June 12th, 1994.

sorry
that this had happened.

Nicole's
best friend?

objections.

Since you won't stipulate, he'll see us tomorrow morning at 11:30.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Who would you describe as her best friends prior to her death in June 1994?

THE WITNESS: Can I ask you a question?

(Witness and counsel confer off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You can answer.

MR. KELLY: Sorry, Judy. Can you read the question back again, and answer.

Q. You are upset with Cora Fischman, are you not?

A. I don't have any feelings.

Q. You have no feelings at all whatsoever toward Cora Fischman presently?

A. No.

Q. You are not upset that she believes O.J. is innocent of the crimes committed
June
12, 1994?

A. I don't recall.

Q. In the last year of her life, do you have any recollection -- last year of
her
life, do you have any recollection of going out socially with Nicole?

MR. KELLY: Well, Phil, are you including family events?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: No.

MR. KELLY: You are not including family events?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: No.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. How many times would you estimate that you went jogging with Nicole between
1992
and 1994?

A. Just a couple of times. 2, 3.

Q. Is a couple -- Okay.

Isn't it true you more or less only saw Nicole during family functions between
1992
and 1994?

A. No.

Q. How many times other than family functions had you seen Nicole between 1992
and
1994?

A. I don't know how many times, but I spent the night at her house.

Q. Were you friendly with O.J. Simpson in May of 1994?

A. I don't know. I don't -- It wasn't like I called him up to say, "Hello," no.

Q. Well, you've told us about this 1982 or the La Cantina restaurant where O.J.
Simpson threw Nicole out of the house; correct?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you told us about how you -- you took Polaroids of Nicole in 1989
following the
New Year's Eve incident in which she had bruises on her arm and forehead; true?

A. True.

Q. And she told you in May of 1994 that O.J. Simpson had offered her $5,000 to
have
sex with her and that veins were popping out of his neck; true?

A. True.

Q. When you heard that Nicole was killed on June 12th, 1994, you immediately
thought
O.J. Simpson was responsible for the crimes; true?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And 2 days before, 3 days before, a week before, you hated O.J. Simpson,
didn't
you?

A. I didn't talk to O.J. Simpson.

Q. Did you hate O.J. Simpson a week before June 12th, 1994?

A. I didn't think about him.

Q. You thought he was an awful person in early June of 1994, didn't you?

A. I thought he was an awful person ever since I met him.

Q. You thought he was an awful person since you knew him in 1977; correct?

A. The way he treated Nicole, yes.

Q. You always just couldn't stand the way he treated your sister from 1977
through
1994; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And so you would never kiss or hug O.J. Simpson on June 12, 1994, would you?

A. I did say "good-bye" to him, yes.

Q. Did you kiss him?

A. On the cheek.

Q. Did you kiss him on the cheek -- Did you hug him at the recital, June 12th,
1994?

A. I think I did.

Q. What did you say to him when you kissed him?

A. "Good-bye."

Q. Anything else?

A. Not that I recall.

Q. Did you talk to him at all --

MR. KELLY: Phil, you've got to slow down a little bit. Okay.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Was that kiss and hug you gave O.J. Simpson on June 12, 1994, a signal of
your
disdain for O.J. Simpson?

A. It was something that I have done over the years, to say "hello" and to say
"good-bye." 

Q. Was it a sign by you that you could not stand O.J. Simpson on June 12th,
1994? 

A. No. It was a sign of good-bye. 

Q. Have you ever traveled to Europe? 

A. Have I? Yes. 

Q. Did you ever travel to Europe with a person named Tony or Anthony?

A. Tony or Anthony? Who?

never
mentioned it?

A. No. 

Q. When you went on PrimeTime Live with Diane Sawyer on December 1st, 1994, you
never
mentioned it? 

A. I don't think so.

Q. Isn't it true you concocted this story with your -- Isn't it true that you
concocted this story with your family because you are in a custody dispute with
O.J.
Simpson?

A. No.

Q. Isn't it true that you concocted this story with your family so that they
can
continue to receive subsidies on behalf of O.J. Simpson?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: On behalf of O.J. Simpson?

MR. PETROCELLI: From.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: By.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: A stipend from O.J. to everyone.

MR. KELLY: I believe that is child support, not a stipend.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

[page 174 is missing]


Q. About the $5,000 incident?

MR. KELLY: Asked and answered.

But answer it again.

THE WITNESS: I don't think so.

(A discussion is held off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

days --

MR. KELLY: Don't answer it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: You are instructing her not to answer that question?

MR. KELLY: Yes, I am.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Are you planning on walking down and giving press conference to the cameras

A. Yes.

Q. You had a fight with her that day, didn't you?

MR. KELLY: Phil, you've got to let her finish answering before you go to the

question.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I thought she said, "Yes."

MR. KELLY: But you were into your next question.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You had a fight with her that day, didn't you in May -- Mother's Day 1994,
you and
Nicole?

[p. 177 missing]

housekeeper?

A. She didn't tell me.

Q. Did you ever date Jeff Noebel?

A. No.

Q. You never had any sort of physical relationship with Jeff Noebel whatsoever?

MR. KELLY: Don't answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Tell me as best as you can your recollection of June 12th, 1994.

MR. KELLY: Starting at what time, when she got up or at the recital or
whatever?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Starting when you got up through the recital.

MR. KELLY: You know what, why don't you ask her specific questions about that
day.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are you objecting to it?

MR. KELLY: I am just asking you as a courtesy to reask the question in the
proper
format.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. When did you leave for the recital on June 12th, 1994?

A. Let's see.

The recital was about 5:00, 4:30 -- Probably about 3:00 or so maybe.

Q. Did you have tickets to the recital?

A. Nicole had the tickets there, yeah.

Q. How did you get to the recital?

A. We drove.

Q. Did you drive or your mother drive, or how did you get there?

A. Who drove? I drove up with my parents, my father.

Q. Was Tanya or Dominique with you when you traveled to the recital?

A. Dominique.

Q. She was in the car? 

A. Yes.

Q. What time -- Did you go straight to the recital, or did you go to Nicole's
house?

A. Gosh, I don't remember offhand. I think to the recital.

Q. Tell me everything you remember occurring after you arrived at the recital
with
Lou, Judithia and Dominique.

A. We all sat down, got our seats, watched the show.

I remember the kids running around playing. 

I remember O.J. walking in, them giving him the ticket.

I remember him coming back in and talking to my mom and dad, who were seated
right in
front of me.

I remember him then sitting behind me.

I remember him telling me how he flew in for the recital and how he was leaving
that
night to go to Chicago.

Then he moved from behind me to closer to the back of the door (indicating),
and he
was sitting in a chair by himself.

And every time I would look around looking for the kids, because they were
running in
and out of the recital hall, I was looking over, and I would see him out of the
corner
of my eye staring at Nicole (indicating).

Q. Anything else you remember from that night at the recital -- from the
recital?

A. At the recital?

Q. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Well, Phil, why don't you at this point, rather than have such a
lengthy
narrative, ask specific questions to ask about that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. After you saw --

MR. KELLY: Theoretically she could explain or detail every act she saw, the 33
acts at
the recital, and everything else.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. After you saw O.J. staring at Nicole, what do you recall next occurring?

A. Nothing.

I was just watching the recital, looking back for the kids to see if they
showed up,
because they were running in and out of the auditorium.

Q. What time did you leave the recital?

A. I think it was probably a couple hours later, hour and half later. I am not
sure
how long it went. 7:00 maybe.

Q. Do you recall seeing O.J. after you left the recital?

A. Uh-huh. Yes.

Q. Where did you see him?

A. Out in front of the auditorium.

Q. What do you recall happening between you -- What did you see O.J. Simpson
doing
after you left the recital?

A. Walking -- We were all walking to the cars, to the parking lot.

Q. Did you talk to him?

A. I don't remember anything specific.

Q. All you remember as you sit here today is leaving the recital and walking
towards
the cars and leaving?

A. Yeah, and saying, "Good-bye."

Q. To whom?

A. To him and to -- to Cora's husband.

Q. What is Cora's husband's name?

MR. KELLY: If you know.

THE WITNESS: I just spaced. Ron Fischman.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you say "good-bye" to anyone else?

A. I don't think so. I think just the two of them.

Q. How did you get your ticket to the recital?

A. Nicole had it.

Q. Where did she give it to you?

A. I don't think she ever gave it to me.

Q. Is there anything other than what you've already told me about seeing O.J.
at the
recital and seeing him after the recital that you remember about O.J. Simpson
--

MR. KELLY: Well --

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. -- on the day of the recital?

MR. KELLY: Phil, she can't be expected to remember every instant she observed
him or
talked to him or remember something about him.

I would ask you to ask something a little more specific about at what point in
time at
the recital or something.

It's like asking her to come in here and say, "Tell me about your life," and
ask her
if there is anything else she remembers about it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you have any conversations with O.J. Simpson on the night of the
recital?

A. Yeah. He told me he was going to Chicago.

Q. Is that the only conversation you had with him?

A. Yeah, the only one I remember.

Q. Tell me as best as you can recall the exact conversation you had with O.J.
Simpson
at the recital. 

A. He said that he came here for the recital and that he was taking the red-eye
out of
Chicago that night.

Q. Anything else said between you two?

A. Huh-uh. 

Q. Did you respond to him at all?

A. No. I don't think so. 

Q. When you were seated at the recital in comparison to Nicole, Judithia, the
Fischmans and your father?

A. My mother and father were in front of me. I was, I think, in the third row
possibly.

And then Nicole was behind me (indicating), not straight behind me, but in
towards the
middle more.

Q. Who were you sitting next to?

A. I had an open seat next to me. I was right on the aisle.

Q. Were there; any of your acquaintances in the aisle that you were seated in?

A. Well, I had the seat for Sean, but he was up and running around.

Q. And your parents were sitting in front of you?

A. Yes.

Q. Where was Dominique sitting?

A. Back by Nicole.

Q. Was she sitting to the left or the right of Nicole facing the stage?

A. I'm not really sure, but I -- possibly the right.

I don't really remember right now.

Q. When did you first see -- At what time of the recital did you first see O.J.
enter?

A. It was after the recital had started.

Q. How long into the recital did O.J. enter?

A. I don't know.

Q. Was the recital going on when O.J. walked in?

A. Yeah.

Q. What did O.J. do first, to the best of your knowledge, after he walked into
the
recital?

A. He got a ticket.

Q. Who did he get the ticket from?

MR. KELLY: Asked and answered.

But answer it once more.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I don't think she answered this.

MR. KELLY: Yes, she has, Phil.

THE WITNESS: Nicole had his ticket. I think she handed it to Dominique to hand
to him.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you see Nicole hand the ticket to Dominique?

A. I don't know, but I saw Mini -- well, Dominique, Mini -- reach up and hand
him the
ticket, as far as I remember.

Q. Did you see Nicole hand the ticket to Dominique?

A. No.

Q. But you saw Dominique hand the ticket to O.J.

A. Yes. 

Q. Dominique was sitting behind you? 

A. Yeah, over to the left of me (indicating). 

Q. Behind you and to your left? 

A. Yes. 

Q. How many seats over?

A. About 3 or 4 maybe.

Q. And Nicole was sitting where in relation to Dominique?

A. Next to her.

Q. To the right of Dominique or the left of Dominique?

A. You see -- I think probably to the left of Dominique.

Q. Where was O.J. standing when Dominique handed him the ticket?

A. In the aisle.

There was a center walkway to go down the aisle to the stage.

Q. Was that the aisle that you were sitting on?

A. No.

Q. Was the aisle to the right or the left of where you were sitting?

A. It was to the left.

Q. Was Nicole sitting on a seat bordering the aisle?

A. No. I think she was in further, in towards the middle.

Q. Did Dominique turn to the right to hand the ticket to O.J. or turn to her
left to
hand the ticket to O.J.?

MR. KELLY: Go ahead, if you can.

THE WITNESS: I'm not really sure.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did she have to reach over Nicole to hand O.J. the ticket, or did she give
the
ticket in the other direction to O.J.? (Indicating.)

A. See, that's what I don't remember.

Q. What was O.J. wearing that night?

A. He had black on.

Q. What was he wearing that was black?

A. A sweater, pants.

Q. What color shirt?

A. That I don't remember.

Q. After O.J. Simpson got the ticket, what did he if you know?

A. I don't know what he did after that.

Q. When was the next time you saw O.J. Simpson after you saw Dominique hand him
the
ticket?

A. In front of my parents.

Q. How long after Dominique handed O.J. the ticket was he in front of your
parents?

A. Just a couple of minutes.

Q. Did he walk straight from receiving the ticket from Dominique over to where
your
parents were?

A. No. Because you had to walk around from the outside behind us.

Q. Did he say "hi" to you before he said "hi" to your parents?

A. No.

Q. Where was he standing when he said "hello" to your parents?

A. Right in front of them.

Q. Were there seats in front of where your parents were seated --

A. Yes.

Q. -- sitting?

A. Yes.

Q. When O.J. said "hello" to them --

A. Were there seats in front of my parents?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. Was anyone sitting in those seats when O.J. said "hello" to your parents?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Was O.J. standing in the aisle when he talked to Judy and Lou, or was he
standing
directly in front of one of them?

A. In the aisle.

Q. Were you close enough to hear the conversation?

A. No. I didn't pay attention. 

Q. How long; did he talk to Lou and Judy? 

A. I don't know.

Q. Do you recall any portions of the conversation he had with Lou and Judy?

A. None.

Q. Did he give Lou -- greet Lou and Judy in any way?

A. I don't know.

Q. What did you see O.J. do next after talking with Lou and Judy?

A. Then he sat down behind me.

Q. Did he say "hi" to you?

MR. KELLY: Well, the last 2 times I've said it's been asked and answered. Now
she is
not going to answer it.

You've already asked her this 3 times about what Simpson said to her. She has
gone
over it word for word.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: If you would listen to the question, did he say "hi" to her.

MR. KELLY: Could you read -- She has told you every syllable she recalls him
saying to
her when he came over to her.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Are you instructing her not to answer on asked and answered?

You are breaking new law here.

MR. KELLY: You are breaking new something with these questions.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: It hasn't gone on 9 days, has it?

MR. KELLY: I don't know. It may.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. After he said "hello" to Lou and Judy, did he next say "hello" to you?

A. No.

Q. What did you see O.J. do after he said "hello" to Lou and Judy?

A. Sat there and talked with them for a while.

Q. How long did he talk to them?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. Over 5 minutes?

A. I don't know.

Q. Over 10 minutes?

A. I can't tell. I don't know. I really don't. I don't know how long he was
there.

Q. Subsequently he sat down behind you?

A. Uh-huh. Yes.

Q. Where did he sit behind you, directly --

A. Right behind me.

Q. -- behind you?

Q. How long, if you know, did he sit directly behind you?

A. Long enough to tell me that he was there for Sydney's recital and that he
was
taking the red-eye out to Chicago and that --

Q. Did you turn around to speak with him?

A. That's all he said to me.

Q. Did you physically turn around to speak with him when he was sitting behind
you?

A. I turned my head around, yes (indicating).

A. I don't think so.

Q. Over 20 minutes?

A. I don't know.

(A discussion is held off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Was O.J. seated in that seat the entire time after he sat down?

A. No. 

Q. How soon after he sat down did he move?

A. I don't know how long after, but he did move.

Q. Did you see him get up from that seat?

A. No.

Q. Did you hear him talking to anyone when he was sitting behind you?

MR. KELLY: Wait, wait. Can we go back to the last question.

(The record is read by the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Which seat were you referring to when you asked, "Did you see him
get up?"

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: The seat directly behind her. She understood.

MR. KELLY: You read her mind.

THE WITNESS: Did I see him get up?

MR. KELLY: Actually get up and move.

THE WITNESS: No.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did you hear any conversation between him and any person when he was sitting
behind
you?

A. No.

Q. Did you see him greet Nicole?

A. No.

Q. Did you see him greet Sydney or Justin?

A. Yeah, I think so.

Q. Where did you see him greet Sydney or Justin?

A. In the auditorium.

Q. When did this occur?

A. In the -- In the interim of all the conversations and such.

Q. Was it during intermission that you saw O.J. greet -- Was it Sydney or
Justin?

A. You know what, I don't remember. I think it was all the kids.

Q. When did you see O.J. greet the kids, during or after the recital or what
time?

A. No. It was before, after we had had our conversation, I think Justin was
with him.

Q. Give me your best estimate as to how long after O.J. sat in the seat behind
you
that you saw him greet the kids.

A. If I remember right -- I don't want to guess.

MR. KELLY: Don't.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. I just want your best estimate.

recital?

MR. KELLY: Has she seen them since then or while they were being taken that
day?

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: Photographs being taken.

That was your recommendation?

A. I didn't say Jenner.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: She didn't say a conversation of O.J.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What did you want the tape recording to be of?

A. The threats that were made to her and how scared she was and how -- just
everything
that she had told me about her being so scared.

Q. Which Chris did you mean?

A. Chris Jenner.

Q. And you wanted to tape-record threats that O.J. was making to Nicole?

A. I told Nicole that that is what she should do.

Q. She was calling and -- She was confiding her concerns about O.J. to you;
correct?

A. Say that again. Sorry.

Q. She was confiding her concerns about O.J. to you in early June and late May
1994;
correct?

A. What conversation are we on now? I am lost.

Q. Any conversation.

A. Say it again.

Q. She was confiding with you her -- She was confiding with you her concerns
about
O.J. Simpson in late May and early June of 1994; correct?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. And your recommendation was to try to tape-record some of these threats that
O.J.
Simpson was making to her; correct?

A. Correct --

Q. And --

A. -- so that she would have it on tape.

MR. KELLY: Go ahead. Keep answering.

THE WITNESS: So she would have it on tape. If she was so scared for her life,
she
would have it on tape she was telling somebody.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Did she ever make these tapes, as far as you know?

A. I don't know.

Q. Why didn't you try to help her make these tape recordings?

A. Because I wasn't living up in Los Angeles.

Q. You stayed with Nicole 5 to 10 times at the Bundy condominium.

Why didn't you say, "I'll try to help you make these tape recordings"?

MR. PETROCELLI: Half a dozen she said.

THE WITNESS: Because I wasn't up there a week before she was murdered.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You had no plans of going up there after she told you about these -- how
O.J. was
going to throw her out of the house, did you?

A. No.

She said she was going to get in touch with Chris.

Q. My question was, she told you that O.J. was threatening to throw her out of
the
house; correct?

A. Right.

Q. And you had no plans of going up to see your sister after she told you this;
correct?

A. I -- I don't think so.

Q. In fact your recommendation was to have Chris Jenner try to deal with it;
correct?

A. Not to deal with it, to get a tape recording of telling a friend.

Q. Let me get this straight.

In May of 1994, she tells you about this purported offer to have sex with her;
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And then you have a conversation with her in which she tells you that she --
O.J.
Simpson has stolen her keys, May 1994; correct?

A. I don't know if it was May.

MR. KELLY: She didn't say May. She said a week before her death.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Late May or early June 1994, Nicole tells you that O.J. Simpson has now
stolen her
keys; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And then you get a phone call from her, and she says O.J. Simpson is trying
to
throw her out of the house; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you hug and kiss O.J. at the recital on June 12th, 1994, don't you?

A. I didn't hug and kiss O.J. Simpson.

Q. Well, you certainly gave him a kiss, didn't you, on June 12?

A. I gave him a kiss on the cheek to say, "Good-bye."

Q. Did you tell the police about this conversation you have with Nicole where
she says
to you that O.J. is trying to throw her out of the house?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Well, you certainly answered all the questions the police asked of you
truthfully
and honestly.

MR. KELLY: I believe she indicated she never talked to the police.

THE WITNESS: I talked to Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. You certainly answered their questions honestly; correct?

A. Yes.

Q.  Did you mention this purported phone call about how O.J. -- Nicole --
Nicole tells
you -- is threatened by O.J. to throw her out of the house?

A. Yes.

Q. You did tell Marcia and Bill Hodgman about that phone call?

A. I'm pretty sure, yes.

Q. Pretty sure or do you know for a fact?

A. I think I told them.

Q. Did you tell them that one week prior to her death, Nicole told you that
O.J. had
stolen her keys?

A. I think so.

Q. Did you tell Marcia and Bill that you recommended to Nicole that she do a
tape
recording with Chris Jenner of the threats that O.J. Simpson was making?

A. Either Chris Jenner or a friend of hers.

Q. Did you tell Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman of your recommendation?

A. I think so.

(A discussion is held off the record.)

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. When Nicole told you that O.J. was threatening to throw her out of the
house, you
understood that to mean that he was going to report her to the IRS, did you
not?

MR. KELLY: Asked and answered. Asked and answered.

Do you want to answer it for the last time about the IRS?

THE WITNESS: She told me that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Well, when she told you O.J. Simpson was threatening to throw her out of the
house,
she didn't mean physically; correct?

A. She said through the IRS, he was going to get her thrown out of the house.

Q. For financial reasons; correct?

A. I -- For whatever the reason is.

prior to
this purported phone call?

MR. KELLY: Which purported phone call?

THE WITNESS: The phone call when Nicole relates to Denise that O.J. has stolen
Nicole's key.

MR. KELLY: Whether he stole one in addition to the one he had?

You can answer that if you --

THE WITNESS: I don't think he had a key.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What knowledge do you have whatsoever that O.J. Simpson did not have a key
to
Nicole Brown's condominium prior to May 25th, 1994?

A. They were divorced. He doesn't need a key.

Q. That's the only basis for your knowledge that O.J. did not have Nicole's key
prior
to May of 1994?

MR. KELLY: You are mischaracterizing her previous --

MR. ROBERT BAKER: But she can answer it "no."

MR. KELLY: She said she did not know if he had a key.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: That is not what she said.

Quit coaching the witness and let her answer.

MR. KELLY: I am trying to prevent repetition.

Why don't we read the question back.

(The record is read by the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Will you rephrase the question, please.

MR. ROBERT BAKER: You can answer that.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. Can you answer that?

MR. KELLY: It's repetitive, confusing, vague, and I don't think she knows --
mischaracterizing her own testimony. 

MR. PHILLIP BAKER: I am not characterizing her testimony. I am just asking her
a
question.

MR. KELLY: Could you rephrase it.

MR. PHILLIP BAKER:

Q. What information do you have --

(A discussion is held off the record.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Good morning. Here begins videotape number 1 in the
deposition of Robert G. Kardashian in the consolidated cases of
Fredric Goldman, Sharon Rufo and Louis Brown vs. Orenthal James
Simpson in the Superior Court, State of California, County of Los
Angeles, the lead case number of which is SC031947.

Today's date is Friday, May 3rd, 1996.The time is approximately 9:35.
This deposition is being taken at 11377 West Olympic Boulevard in Los
Angeles, California, and was made at the request of the plaintiff of
the Law Offices of Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp.

The videographer is Rod Rigole, employed by Coleman, Haas Martin &
Schwab of Los Angeles, California.

Would could counsel please identify yourselves and state who you
represent.

MR. KELLY: Yes. John Kelly for the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.

MS. ROIT: Natasha Roit for the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.

MR. PETROCELLI: Daniel Petrocelli for Plaintiff Fredric Goldman.

MR. BREWER: Michael Brewer for Plaintiff Sharon Rufo.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Steve Van Sicklen for Mr. Simpson.

MS. MOLINARO: Yvette Molinaro for Plaintiff Fredric Goldman.

MS. LEVINE: Janet Levine for the witness Mr. Kardashian.

MR. PETROCELLI: Before we begin, I want to make a statement for the
record. I had subpoenaed this deposition some time ago, and at the
request of Mr. Baker's office it had been put off to accommodate the
schedule of Robert Baker, so he could personally be at the deposition.

He is not at the deposition. Mr. Van Sicklen is here. In light of the
likely number of objections that will be made here and the need to go
to court and the delay that that will entail, I would like to put my
objection on the record to this needless delay of several weeks to
accommodate Mr. Baker when in fact he is not even here.

MR. BREWER: We join in the objection.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Amen.

MR. KELLY: I guess I do, too.

MS. LEVINE: Before we begin, I have a statement on behalf of Mr.
Kardashian. As all counsel know, I believe  I haven't spoken with Mr.
Brewer, I believe. I've spoken with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Petrocelli as
well as Mr. Van Sicklen  Mr. Kardashian as a lawyer is obligated to
assert privilege on behalf of his then client, O.J. Simpson, with
regard to any communications, actions or otherwise that are
communicative that took place during the course of his representation
of Mr. Simpson or while he was acting as perceived by Mr. Simpson as a
lawyer.

He will answer any questions that he can answer, but it is not up to
him to waive he privilege. He is obligated, as we all know, to assert
the privilege on behalf of his client, and he intends to do that
whenever is appropriate.

MR. KELLY: All done?

MS. LEVINE: (Nods head.)

MR. KELLY: Great.

ROBERT G. KARDASHIAN, having been first duly sworn, was examined and
testified as follows:

EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Good morning, Mr. Kardashian.

A: Good morning, Mr. Kelly.

Q: You obviously know my name. You know I represent the Estate of
Nicole Brown Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. If there are any questions I ask you that you don't you
understand, just let me know and I will try to rephrase them or make
them intelligible for you. Okay?

A: Thank you.

Q: And also if there is any time after I have asked a question or for
some other reason you feel you want to speak to your attorney, just
let us know and we will take a break and go off the record and
certainly accommodate you with that also.

A: Thank you.

Q: And you understand you are under oath right now?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Have you ever given a deposition before?

A: Yes, I have.

Q: On more than one occasion?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Could you tell me when you gave that one deposition?

A: In my divorce.

Q: Okay. And was that '89 or '90?

A: Around there.

Q: Okay. Other than that deposition, have you given any other sworn
testimony in any case?

A: In the Simpson case, yes.

Q: And was that at the Grand Jury proceeding?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Did you have the opportunity at any time to review your Grand
Jury testimony subsequent to giving it?

A: Yes, I did. I did review it whenever it was taken.

Q: And after reviewing it, were you comfortable with the fact that you
had answered the questions as fully and accurately as possible at that
time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That will call for him to acknowledge
information that may or may not have been privileged in there, and I
am going to instruct him not to answer on the grounds that that
deposition  if he answers, that statement, that Grand Jury statement,
could be considered to include privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, have you ever taken someone else's deposition?

A: No, I have not.

Q: Okay. You realize the implications of your sworn testimony here
today, though?

A: Yes.

Q: And that it can be used at a future date at trial for impeachment
purposes?

A: Yes.

Q: Before coming in here today for your deposition, did you review any
documents in preparation for this deposition?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you review any trial transcripts from the Simpson criminal
trial?

A: No

Q: Did you review any of the other deposition testimony taken in the
civil case prior to today?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you review any videotapes whatsoever prior to your deposition
today?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: What videotapes did you have occasion to review?

A: I reviewed a few of my interviews that I gave to the media.

Q: Okay. Was one of those interviews an interview with Kristen
Jeanette Meyer 

A: No.

Q:  of Court TV?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall giving an interview with her?

A: Yes.

Q: But that was not one that you reviewed?

A: That's correct.

Q: Was one of the ones you reviewed an interview with Larry King?

A: Yes.

Q: Other than the Larry King videotape, could you tell me what other
videotapes you reviewed?

A: Yes. I reviewed the videotape of "Dateline NBC," a videotape of I
believe it was "48 Hours," and I think that's it. Oh, I'm sorry. I
also reviewed a videotape of some  I don't know what show it was 
about me carrying this bag.

Q: Do you recall in what month and year you gave the "Dateline"
interview that you reviewed?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: October of '95.

Q: And with regard to the "48 Hours" interview, do you recall what
month and year you gave that interview?

A: That was the same day.

Q: And with regard to the videotape of you carrying the bag, do you
know what show that was?

A: No, that I don't.

Q: Was that a verbal  was that a national interview also regarding
that show?

A: No, it was not an interview. It was just  it was one of the
tabloid shows.

Q: And do you  In the "Larry King Live" interview that was early
October l995 also, was it not?

A: I believe so. It was around that time, yes.

Q: Prior to giving your "Dateline" interview, did you have any
discussions with Mr. Simpson regarding the interview you were going to
give?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. It may call for privileged information, and I
need to think about it for a minute, think where it leads.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Well, I think that any discussions  let's just
establish foundation first that Mr. Kardashian was Mr. Simpson's  one
of Mr. Simpson's lawyers. I think we need to do that.

MR. KELLY: Okay. I will come back to it then. You people can think
about it in the meantime.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, could you tell me the last time you spoke to Mr.
Simpson?

A: Yes. It was either Monday or Tuesday of this week.

Q: And could you tell me the substance of that discussion?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

MR. KELLY: Miss Levine, is it your position that Mr. Kardashian is 
as of this date still represents Mr. Simpson?

MS. LEVINE: It's my position that sometimes when you're a lawyer for
somebody that relationship doesn't end, and while you might not be
representing them in connection with let's say this particular
proceeding, because Mr. Kardashian does not represent Mr. Simpson in
this civil case that's ongoing, he has a relationship with him such
that their communications can be, depending on what the communication
is, privileged.

For example, if he called up and he said, "What's the weather
outside," that wouldn't be privileged, but if he called and talked
about the course and scope of their representation, that could be
privileged.

And because the questioning is so broad and because the relationship
between Mr. Kardashian and Mr. Simpson, which hasn't been gone into,
was so deep and intense in terms of the representation, it can't be
narrowed down into we're just talking about a patent, and that's the
only part of the relationship. This is a very broad relationship.
That's the problem.

MR. KELLY: Well, is it your position then that this particular
conversation was a privileged conversation, or is it your position
that any conversation Mr. Kardashian has ever had with Mr. Simpson is
privileged?

MS. LEVINE: No, I don't think any conversation he's ever had with him
is privileged. I think, from what I understand, this particular
conversation was privileged.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, subsequent to October 3rd, 1995 have you had any
conversations with Mr. Simpson that did not relate to the to your
legal representation of Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me when that first conversation was subsequent to
October 3rd, 1995?

A: No, I couldn't be specific.

Q: Could you tell me how many times you've spoken to him in a capacity
other than as an attorney to Mr. Simpson since that time?

A: No. I'd just be guessing. If you want me to guess, I could give you
an estimate.

Q: I would like you to give me your best guess.

A: Maybe l0.

Q: And it's your testimony then, other than those conversations, all
others were in your capacity as an attorney for Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Prior to the conversation you had this past I think you said
Monday or Tuesday?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me when you had spoken to Mr. Simpson prior to then?

A: Probably 30 days prior.

Q: And did you call Mr. Simpson, or did he call you?

A: I called him.

Q: And could you relate to me the substance of that conversation?

MS. LEVINE: Can we have a minute, please?

MR. KELLY: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 9:46.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 9:48.

MR. KELLY: Let's read the last question back first. Okay?

MS. LEVINE: Sure.

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q: And could you relate to me the substance of that conversation?")

MS. LEVINE: The conversation they had includes privileged information.
If you want the non-privileged information and if Mr. Simpson's lawyer
has no objection, then we can parse it out for you.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Why don't we parse it out and then see if we get an
objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Simpson's lawyer doesn't have any business making
 or taking a position with regard to non-privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: No. But with regard to privileged information and with
regard to whether it s a complete  covered within the privileged.
it's my understanding that Mr. Simpson is the holder of the privilege.

And so it's my instruction to Mr. Kardashian that if his  Mr.
Simpson's lawyer believes there is a privileged communication and that
he shouldn't answer it, Mr. Kardashian is best off not answering it,
and if you all have some dispute about that, we await whatever
resolution there is. But it's not Mr. Kardashian's decision that's
important here.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: And we are raking the position that there was an
attorney-client relationship and may be and there are privileged items
and information that exist, and I do not want Mr. Kardashian
testifying about those things, but I don't have any problem with your
asking questions relating to factual issues and things like that that
occurred surrounding the events of this case.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you answer the question, please?

A: Yes, sir. The non-privileged material we discussed was I asked him
about his children, how they were doing, and it was basically children
oriented questions.

Q: And it's your position that or her that the part of the
conversation regarding children, it was a privileged conversation?

A: Yes.

Q: So it's your testimony that the last two conversations you've had
with Mr. Simpson that you've testified to, other than this little
thing about the children, have been privileged communications?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Mr. Kardashian, do you recall giving a statement June 17th,
1994 to the police?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And you indicated that you testified before the Grand Jury
previously.

A: Yes.

Q: And you gave an interview to "Larry King Live."

A: Yes.

Q: And you were interviewed for "Dateline."

A: Yes.

Q: And you were interviewed for "48 Hours."

A: Yes.

Q: Do you know whether you gave any other interviews, other than the
ones I've just mentioned?

A: I gave an interview to Barbara Walters.

Q: Was that for "20/20"?

A: Yes. No, it was not. It was for  I gave all these interviews all
at the same day. It was the day of the verdict.

Q: The day of or the day after?

A: I believe the day of. And so whether it was for "20/20" or
"Dateline," I don't know if that's what they called the shows, but it
was  those are the people I gave the interviews to.

Q: Prior to all of these interviews that I just mentioned, had you
discussed the fact that you were giving these interviews, with Mr.
Simpson?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Prior to giving any of these interviews, did you obtain any sort of
release or waiver from Mr. Simpson prior to giving these interviews?

MS. LEVINE: Can we have a minute?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: There is no waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

MR. KELLY: There is by the client, and if the client gave him a waiver
release, then that certainly is applicable here.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Well, whether he gave him a release for certain
interviews, that may be one thing you are going to have to establish
foundationally, but as of this moment in time there is no waiver of
the attorney-client privilege.

MR. KELLY: What more can I do than lay a foundation than asking
whether he gave it and asking whether his client gave him a waiver in
terms of giving it?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: The problem with asking what his client did or didn't
do may involve or invoke privileged communications.

MR. KELLY: I haven't asked for the substance of any of these things. I
am asking if he received something to that effect that enabled him to
speak, and it requires a simple yes or no. I'm not asking for any of
the substance of it.

Could you read the question back again, please, David.

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q: Prior to giving any of these interviews, did you obtain any sort
of release or waiver from Mr. Simpson prior to giving these
interviews?")

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. After any of these interviews that we've been discussing
here, did Mr. Simpson or anybody representing Mr. Simpson notify you
that you were not authorized to give any further interviews? Just yes
or no.

A: No.

Q: And in all those interviews that we mentioned, including the ones
to the police, were you as honest and accurate as you could have
possibly been at the time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That will call for the  for privileged
information. I will instruct him not to answer.

MR. KELLY: Why is that? I am just asking on his own opinion. It has
nothing to do with any communication.

MS. LEVINE: Because what he would do if he answered that, if he said
yes, he would be saying that all those things are true or they aren't
true, and he would be reasserting the truth of them and thereby
incorporating into this deposition information that may or may not be
privileged in those statements.

MR. KELLY: So after reviewing the interviews, he is not prepared to
testify that all the previous interviews he has given relating to his
client are truthful or not?

MS. LEVINE: It has nothing to do with whether he is prepared to do it.
It has to do with whether or not the information that he would be
giving is privileged or not. It's not Mr. Kardashian's choice. It's a
matter that he is obligated as counsel, as a lawyer, as somebody who
has taken the oath as a lawyer, to assert privilege in a deposition
testimony if his answering the question could reveal communications
between him and his client, however broadly communications are
interpreted under California law.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to argue on the record, but I just don't
want my acquiescence to be deemed  or my silence to be deemed an
acquiescence in your position. I don't believe your position has any
merit at all. I think that your view of the attorney-client privilege
is all wrong. It's not supported by California law.

This was a question that simply asked whether statements that this
witness has given to third parties, including the world, are true and
accurate or whether he lied deliberately or whether he knows that the
information is false. That can't conceivably be privileged 

MS. LEVINE: You know 

MR. PETROCELLI:  and if it were privileged, it's been waived.

MS. LEVINE: I don't want to argue either.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to either, but I just want you to know 

MS. LEVINE: But you've begun the argument, and I can't sit here
quietly and let it go and be thought of acquiescing in your
interpretation of the attorney  client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's fine.

MS. LEVINE: And so I am not acquiescing in that. The attorney-client
privilege in California requires one to keep clients' confidences
inviolate. It cannot be waived by Mr. Kardashian or any actions that
Mr. Kardashian takes.

Mr. Kardashian could stand at the top the highest building and shout
whatever secrets he has from any client. They are not waived by doing
that. He is obligated as a lawyer here to assert the privilege.

If you have a problem with that assertion, then I am sure we will deal
with it at a later time. I don't think we need to get excited about
it. I just think we need to go through it and make the record.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your position is untenable, but we will fight that out
later on.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: In preparation of your sworn testimony today, Mr. Kardashian, have
you spoken to Robert Baker at any time?

A: No.

Q: Other than in preparation today, have you had any conversations at
all with Robert Baker?

A: Yes.

Q: And could you tell me the last time you spoke to Robert Baker?

A: Perhaps a month, month and a half ago.

Q: Okay. And other than that conversation a month or a month and a
half ago, had you ever spoken to Mr. Baker on any other occasion?

A: Yes. Perhaps when he first got into the case.

Q: Okay. And do you recall what month and year that was?

A: No. No.

Q: Had you ever met Robert Baker prior to his getting into the case?

A: No.

Q: And when you say "getting into the case," we are referring to the
civil case here?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Could you tell me what your discussion was with Robert Baker the
first time you spoke to him?

MS. LEVINE: If I could have a moment. I don't know the answer to that
question, and it's possible that it could call for privileged
information, so I need to go off the record and talk to Mr. Kardashian
for a moment.

MR. KELLY: Why don't you when you are off the record discuss both of
the conversations that he had with Mr. Baker, and then we will...

MS. LEVINE: That makes sense. I will do that.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 9:58.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:02.

MR. KELLY: Can we ever the last question back, David?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. Could you tell me what your discussion was with Robert Baker the
first time you spoke to him?")

MS. LEVINE: I would object on the grounds of attorney-client and
attorney work product privilege. Instruct him not to answer.

MR. KELLY: Okay. By the way, Miss Levine, other than  I think it's
clear we have agreed to disagree 

MS. LEVINE: Yes.

MR. KELLY:  every time you assert the privilege, so my silence after
you assert it is not an acceptance of it.

It's just that we will deal with it another time and place. Okay?

MS. LEVINE: So you save me from Mr. Petrocelli's wrath?

MR. KELLY: I cannot.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, you had indicated that you had a conversation with
Mr. Baker approximately one month ago?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you relate to me the substance of that conversation?

A: Yes, I can. Mr. Baker appointed an attorney to  or suggested an
attorney to represent me in this proceeding.

Q: Was that Marshall Morgan?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you obviously didn't accept that offer?

A: That's correct. I had  Miss Levine represented me  or has been
aware of this case and has helped me throughout, so I wanted Miss
Levine with me.

Q: Did you have any discussions whatsoever with Marshall Morgan?

A: Yes, I did. I met Mr. Morgan for lunch.

Q: And was that the only time you spoke to him?

A: I spoke to him on the telephone another time.

Q: Did you have any other conversations with Mr. Baker after that?

A: I believe I spoke to him once more when I told him that  again
that I was going to use Miss Levine.

Q: Okay. Did you speak to  It was your understanding that Mr. Morgan
was  at least shared offices with Mr. Baker?

A: I really didn't know the arrangement. All I know is he was in that
building, but I had never been to the building, so I don't know.

Q: Did you know that they shared the same office space on the same
floor of that building?

A: No, I do not.

Q: I'm sorry?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Okay. Did you speak to Phillip Baker at all at any time prior to
your testimony here today?

A: One time I did, I believe. Or maybe twice.

Q: Okay. When was the last time you spoke to Phillip Baker?

A: Oh, I'd say it's been two or three months ago.

MR. KELLY: Do you want to 

MS. LEVINE: No. Takes a long time to go off the record here.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Well, you know, if you stopped asserting the
privilege, we wouldn't have to stop at all, Miss Levine, and then we
could work right through this.

MS. LEVINE: Well, that's right. That would always be very easy if we
had no rules of law, but we try and keep with them.

MR. KELLY: We could be very casual and get through this.

MS. LEVINE: Okay. Go ahead.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Do you recall the last time you spoke to Phillip Baker?

A: No. As I said, it's approximately three months ago.

Q: And could you tell me the substance of the conversation you had
with Phillip Baker approximately three months ago?

A: I believe it was about Mr. Morgan getting 

Q: Same thing about 

A: About my testimony, yes.

Q: And  I'm sorry  what did you say about the testimony?

A: Just about  that my deposition, and so Mr. Baker had indicated
that Mr. Morgan would  I should meet with him.

Q: Did you have any discussions in terms of financial arrangements
when you spoke to Phillip Baker regarding Mr. Morgan?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. When you spoke to Mr. Robert Baker, did you ever have any
discussions with him regarding financial arrangements with Mr. Morgan?

A: I did not.

Q: Prior to the conversation you had with Phillip Baker three months
ago, could you relate to me the substance of the conversation before
that time you had with him?

A: That's privileged.

MS. LEVINE: Objection grounds of privilege.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Do you know who Dan Leonard is?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you had any conversations with him prior to today?

A: It was just one meeting, I think, when I met Mr. Leonard at one
time, but it's been months.

Q: Okay. Where is this meeting  where was this meeting held you're
referring to?

A: This was at Mr. Simpson's.

Q: At the Rockingham 

A: Yes.

Q:  home? And could you tell me who was there other than Dan Leonard,
if you recall? I assume Mr. Simpson was there, by the way.

A: Mr. Simpson was there. I don't know if you were there (Indicating).

MR. VAN SICKLEN: (Shakes head.)

MS. LEVINE: Pointing to Mr. Van Sicklen.

MR. KELLY: And let the record reflect he is shaking his head in a
negative manner.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: I don't think I was there.

MR. KELLY: We will ask you that.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Okay.

THE WITNESS: I don't know. I believe Mr. Baker was there, Mr.  I'm
not sure if Mr. Bob Baker or Phil Baker was there.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Other than yourself, Simpson, Leonard and at least one of the
Bakers?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me if anybody else was there at that meeting?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Could you please tell me the substance of that meeting that you
had?

MS. LEVINE: Object on privilege grounds.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me how long that meeting was?

MS. LEVINE: Object on privilege grounds.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Was that the only time that you had seen or met Dan Leonard prior
to today?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you know Bob Blasier?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Could you tell me the last time you spoke to him?

A: To the best of my recollection, perhaps three months ago.

Q: And do you recall, first of all, where you were when you spoke to
Mr. Blasier?

A: It would have been at the Simpson residence.

Q: Was anybody present there at the Simpson residence other than
yourself and Mr. Blasier?

A: I'm sure there were. I just don't know who. There's always people
around there, so I just don't know the individuals.

Q: Was Mr. Simpson there at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you relate to me the substance of the conversation you had
with Mr. Blasier?

MS. LEVINE: Objection on privilege grounds.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Was Mr. Simpson present when you had the conversation with Mr.
Blasier?

A: No, he was not.

Q: Did you  First of all, it's your claim that you provided legal
services for Mr. Simpson relative to the criminal charges against him
in 1994. Is that correct?

A: I have represented Mr. Simpson since 1970.

Q: I am sorry. I was coughing. Since?

A: Since 1970 I've represented Mr. Simpson.

Q: Have you ever had any written retainer agreement with Mr. Simpson?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls  I believe retainer agreements
under the state code may be privileged. I have to look that up.

MR. KELLY: I am not asking him for the substance of any retainer
agreement. I am asking him simply whether he had one, yes or no.

MS. LEVINE: He can answer it yes or no. No substance.

THE WITNESS: No. No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: So from 1970, as you sit here today, you never had a written
retainer agreement with Mr. Simpson.

A: That's correct.

Q: Could you tell me if any time between 1970 and today you have ever
submitted an invoice to Mr. Simpson for legal services provided?

A: To the best of my recollection, per  services provided?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

MR. KELLY: Once again, Miss Levine, I am just asking for a yes or no
answer. I am not asking for any of the contents involved in any
invoice. I am just asking whether he has ever submitted one.

MS. LEVINE: Ever?

MR. KELLY: Ever.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me the last time you submitted one to him?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That will call for privileged information, the
more detail you get into.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me whether you ever submitted an invoice for
professional services rendered in relation to his criminal trial in
1994-1995?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

MR. PETROCELLI: I believe these objections are meritless, Miss Levine.
We have the right to probe foundationally whether there is a bona fide
attorney-client relationship. His saying so doesn't make it so. It has
to have all of the features of a real, genuine attorney-client
relationship such as Mr. Kelly is inquiring: Whether there is a
retainer agreement, whether there is any invoice, whether there is any
payment. This is the information that minimally we are entitled to
know so that we can go to the court and argue there was no real
attorney-client relationship.

MS. LEVINE: Mr. Petrocelli, as I understand the attorney-client
relationship, and I may not be as versed in it as you are, I'm sure,
it has to do with whether the client believes that the lawyer is
acting as a lawyer. That's what the state code says. That's what the
Evidence Code says. It has to do with the client's perception. It has
nothing to do with the existence of retainer agreements. I know you
are shaking your head.

And in fact, as I understand the code, if somebody comes to visit with
a lawyer, whether or not they eventually hire that lawyer, those
communications in the first visit alone are privileged communications.

So if you have a problem believing that he is acting as a lawyer or
not, then perhaps you should have been asking these questions to Mr.
Simpson, because it's his perception that's important, but 

MR. PETROCELLI: We did, and Mr. Simpson said Mr. Kardashian did not
represent him for many, many years.

MS. LEVINE: Well 

MR. PETROCELLI: So his testimony is contrary to Mr. Simpson's.

MS. LEVINE: But if you're questioning whether he has acted as a lawyer
in this case, I think that it's quite clear he has acted as a lawyer
for Mr. Simpson in connection with the criminal case. I don't think
there was any question about that whatsoever.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's what Mr. Kelly is trying to find out.

MR. KELLY: There is no way, Miss Levine, to even find Mr. Simpson's
perception, whether he perceived Mr. Kardashian as his attorney,
without establishing at least a rudimentary foundation with regard to
even if Mr. Simpson received an invoice from Mr. Kardashian. That
might lend to his belief as to whether Mr. Kardashian was acting as
his attorney or not.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I personally, from what I understand of
lawyer-client relationships, don't think invoices are significant.

MR. KELLY: I am not  don't get me wrong. I am not saying that that's
a binding issue here, but I think at one time we might be before the
court, and they are going to look at the totality of circumstances,
and certainly if there was ever a retainer agreement or not, whether
there had ever been invoices issued or not, whether there had ever
been payment issued or not and whether there had been any sort of
indication of legal services provided to Mr. Simpson would directly
bear on whether Mr. Simpson viewed Mr. Kardashian as truly an attorney
or just a confidant on a personal level, and we at least have the
right to ask these questions and establish that foundation for what
may come down the road.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I strongly disagree with you 

MR. KELLY: Not unexpectedly.

MS. LEVINE:  but if the question is only did he issue an invoice in
relationship to the criminal case, I will allow him to answer that
particular question, without getting into the specifics of the
invoice.

MR. KELLY: That's all I had asked from the start.

MS. LEVINE: Okay. Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Could you tell me how many?

A: No, but I was  it was every  it would be monthly, every month,
for maybe a year, maybe  I can't tell you how long.

Q: Prior to June of 1994, could you tell me just the month and year
you had last issued an invoice to Mr. Simpson for legal services
provided?

A: No, I couldn't.

Q: Could you tell me if at any time prior to June 1994 you had ever
issued an invoice to Mr. Simpson for legal services provided?

A: I'm sure I did. but I can't recall. It would have been prior to
1985, I would imagine.

Q: Okay. Mr. Kardashian, did you ever become aware of a New Year's
Day, 1989 incident involving Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson?

MS. LEVINE: And if I might have a moment, I am going to try and  I
want to let you know, he is going to testify to this, extracting what
he learned in the course of his representation of Mr. Simpson
beginning in June of '94. So what he learned before that from what he
learned after that. I think that makes sense in terms of privilege.

MR. KELLY: He is going to do that himself during his testimony?

MS. LEVINE: In his mind. So he is going to tell you what he knew about
that prior to June of '94.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

MS. LEVINE: Okay?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Why don't you tell me what you knew prior to June of 1994 of that
incident.

A: The only thing I knew was when I read about it in the newspaper.

Q: Okay. Did you know that subsequent to that New Year's Day, '89,
that Mr. Simpson had been charged with spousal battery?

A: I really wasn't around him very much at that time, so whatever
knowledge I gained, it was either from television or from the
newspaper.

Q: My question to you is: Either watching the TV or reading the
newspapers, did you become aware of the fact prior to June of 1994
that Mr. Simpson had been charged with spousal abuse?

A: I'm sorry. Yes, I did.

Q: Okay. And in reading the newspapers and/or watching TV prior to
June 1994, did you become aware that Mr. Simpson had pleaded no
contest to spousal abuse?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Did you ever provide any legal services to Mr. Simpson
relative to that incident at all?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. Did you in any way assist Mr. Simpson in securing legal
counsel relative to that incident of New Year's Day, 1989?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. Do you know who Mr. Simpson's legal counsel was with regard
to that New Year's Day incident, 1989?

A: Yes, I do.

Q: And who was that?

A: Howard Weitzman.

Q: And how long had you known Howard Weitzman for prior to that?

A: 45 years.

Q: Long time.

A: I'm an old man.

Q: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Prior to what?

MR. KELLY: Prior to 

THE WITNESS: Oh, prior to that? 40 years. Sorry.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: You're making yourself too old now.

A: Too old.

Q: And by the way, Howard Weitzman, was he present at Rockingham when
you had arrived there on June 13th, 1994?

A: No, he was not.

Q: Did he arrive there after you had arrived at Rockingham on June 12,
1994?

A: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: Excuse me. June 12, 1994?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: June 13th. I'm sorry.

A: Yes.

Q: And in fact...okay. The record is clear. Who is Cathy Randa?

A: O.J. Simpson's assistant.

Q: And how long have you known her for?

A: I've known Cathy probably 20 years, maybe a little more.

Q: And when did you  or under what circumstances did you first become
acquainted with Cathy Randa?

A: Cathy used to be my legal assistant.

Q: And how long was she your legal assistant for?

A: I can't tell you for sure, but it was probably two or three years,
something like that. And I could be off. I really don't  don't know.

Q: And do you know what  first of all, just generally, what were Miss
Randa's duties and responsibilities when she was working with you?

A: She was a legal secretary for me.

Q: And do you know what she is doing now, Cathy Randa?

A: As far as I know, she's still Mr. Simpson's assistant.

Q: Do you know how she came to be Mr. Simpson's assistant?

A: Yes.

Q: And how was that?

A: I used  Mr. Simpson used to have office space in my law offices,
and it  I can't remember if I volunteered  Cathy used to do some
work for Mr. Simpson while she was doing work for me, and I can't
remember if I volunteered her services to him or whether he asked me
if he could have her full time, whatever, but it just evolved where
she became his assistant, and I hired another one.

Q: Do you know how long she has worked for Mr. Simpson?

A: No, but I would estimate it to be about 15 to 17 years, I would
imagine.

Q: Do you know generally what her duties and responsibilities are in
with working for Mr. Simpson?

A: I know she is his  his assistant that  and does administrative
things for him, reservations and whatever. I don't know all that she
does.

Q: Have you ever done any scheduling with Mr. Simpson through Cathy
Randa?

MS. LEVINE: Do you understand?

THE WITNESS: I really don't understand that. I'm sorry.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. So you're taking me at my word to rephrase a question?

A: Please.

Q: Is it your understanding that Cathy Randa handles most of Mr.
Simpson's scheduling 

Q: And is it your understanding that she handles a lot of his personal
administrative-type matters also?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And is it your understanding that she attends to a number of his
daily needs, such as scheduling children's events and things like that
and keeping him up-to-date on those things?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And is it your understanding that she also schedules appearances
and outings and things like that for Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And would it be fair to say that she's very well acquainted with at
least most of Mr. Simpson's business associates?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And would it be fair to say that she is also at least somewhat
acquainted with Mr.  most of Mr. Simpson's social acquaintances also?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. When was the last time you spoke to Cathy Randa?

A: Maybe a couple months ago.

Q: Do you recall the substance of that conversation?

A: No. It was  it was just general: What are you doing and that type
of thing.

Q: Do you know Wayne Hughes?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: How long have you known Mr. Hughes for?

A: I've known Mr. Hughes maybe 15, 20 years, something like that.

Q: And did you originally meet his acquaintance as a result of some
USC- type connection?

A: Through Mr. Simpson is how I met Mr. Hughes.

Q: And have you retained a relationship with Mr. Hughes through all
these years?

A: No, I do not have a relationship with Mr. Hughes.

Q: Could you tell me the last time you spoke to Mr. Hughes?

A: Yes. The last time I spoke to Mr. Hughes was at the  when I gave
my Grand Jury testimony.

Q: Okay. Was he present there that day also?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Do you recall what you spoke to him about that day?

A: Yes.

Q: And could you relate that conversation to me?

A: Yes. I don't know if it's  well, I was upset at his
misrepresentation in his transcript to the Grand Jury, in his
statements to the Grand Jury that dealt with me.

Q: Had you had the opportunity to read Mr. Hughes' Grand Jury
testimony at that time, obviously?

A: Yes.

Q: And could you relate to me what part of Mr. Hughes' Grand Jury
testimony you felt was inaccurate as it related to you?

MS. LEVINE: If I might have a moment. Can we go off the record for a
minute?

MR. KELLY: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:25.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:29.

MR. KELLY: Could we try that again?

(Pending question read as follows:

Q: And could you relate to me what part of Mr. Hughes' Grand Jury
testimony you felt was inaccurate as it related to you?")

THE WITNESS: Let me correct what I just said. It wasn't Mr. Hughes'
Grand Jury testimony. I had not seen that, and I don't know if he
testified in front of the Grand Jury. It was a statement he gave to
the police that Miss Levine showed me and that I took offense to when
Mr. Hughes in that statement was, and I can't remember the substance
of it, but it was basically 

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you speak up a little, Mr. Kardashian? It's hard to hear.

A: Sure. It was basically that I wasn't worth what they were paying
me; that they were paying me $3,000 a day for legal services and I
wasn't worth that, and he communicated that to the District Attorney's
Office, and I was upset that he would make that type of a statement.

Q: Could you tell me what you said to Mr. Hughes relative to that
statement?

A: Well, it was basically, "Why would you make that type of a
statement? You know that's not true, and why would you make that kind
of a statement?"

Q: What part of it wasn't true: That you weren't worth the $3,000 a
day?

A: That I was  no, I knew I was worth  that he would represent that
I was so cheap.

MS. LEVINE: That was a joke.

THE WITNESS: No. That he would quote numbers and represent things that
just were not true as far as what I was getting paid. Mr. Hughes had
no idea.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Prior to that conversation with Mr. Hughes, could you tell me
when you had last spoken to him.

A: No. I don't really speak that much to Mr. Hughes.

Q: Did you speak to him at any time between June 13, 1994 and the
conversation you had this day outside the Grand Jury room?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recall, first of all, where you had this conversation?

A: Yes.

Q: Where was it?

A: In Mr. Shapiro's office.

Q: Could you tell me what day that was on?

A: No, I could not.

Q: Could you tell me who was present there besides yourself and Mr.
Hughes?

MS. LEVINE: This I believe could call for privileged information, not
necessarily who was present  We are talking about a conversation with
Mr. Shapiro's office?

MR. KELLY: I haven't gotten to the conversation yet. I've just been
asking some other questions.

MS. LEVINE: Okay.

MR. KELLY: I suspect I will be getting to that, though.

THE WITNESS: Sure. There were several people, and I'm trying to think
who was all there: There was Mr. Allen Austin, there was Hoss, and I
don't know his last name.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: H  o  s  s, like 

MR. PETROCELLI: Hoskins?

THE WITNESS: Hoskins? Okay. There was Joe Kolkowitz, there was Marcus
Allen, and I can't remember if his wife was with him or not.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Kathy?

A: Katherine. Yeah, I don't know if she was there. She could have
been. There was Skip Taft; there was Vince Evans; there were other
defense counsel there, and I can't recall who all was there, and
that's all I can recall at this time.

Q: Do you recall what day this meeting was on?

A: No, I don't know.

Q: Could you tell me what month it was?

A: No. I could guess, but I don't  I really don't know the month. It
would have either been June or July of '94.

Q: Was it prior to the preliminary hearing on this matter?

A: I believe so. No. Excuse me. The prelim  no. It was pretty fast. I
don't know the dates. I'm sorry. I really don't know if it was prior
to or subsequent to the prelim.

Q: By the way, did you sit at counsel table during the preliminary
hearing?

A: No. My  it was my choice not to. Mr. Shapiro asked me to, but I
declined.

Q: Do you recall who was sitting at counsel table with Mr. Shapiro
during the preliminary hearing?

A: I believe it was Mr. Uelman and Miss Kaplan and sometimes Miss
Filipi.

Q: Did you attend the preliminary hearing?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: The entire preliminary hearing?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Could you tell me why you chose not to sit at counsel table?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: You know, I don't think  it may have to do with
strategy and, if so, it's part of the attorney-client relationship, so
I am going to object to the question and assert the privilege on
behalf of Mr. Simpson.

MS. LEVINE: I am going to join in that objection. It's either
completely irrelevant or it has to do with the strategy, and it's work
product.

MR. KELLY: Well, if we are here to  one of the main issues is whether
he was providing legal services to Mr. Simpson, and there was a
decision made by him not to sit at counsel table at the first legal
proceeding involving Mr. Simpson on this case. I think we are entitled
to know 

MS. LEVINE: You know 

MR. KELLY:  what was the root of that decision and whether Mr.
Simpson had anything to do with that decision.

MS. LEVINE: You know, if you want to challenge whether he was counsel
for Mr. Simpson, that's fine but, as we all know, there are lawyers
that don't sit at the counsel table. I am sure Mr. Petrocelli has more
lawyers on this case than just him, and they are not all here; I am
sure that Mr. Van Sicklen has the same thing, and the decision 

MR. KELLY: So what?

MS. LEVINE:  that goes into doing that is not something that is able
to be gone into by adversaries or anybody else. That's the lawyers'
thought process. That's what's going on in their mind.

If you don't think there was an attorney-client relationship, then
let's go to court and deal with it, but it's not for me to establish
for you; it's not something for you to decide. That's something that's
decided by judges in camera. The communications between Mr. Simpson
and Mr. Kardashian and their thought processes is not something you
are allowed to delve into, with all due respect.

MR. KELLY: I think we are allowed to delve into it to try to establish
the foundation or lack of foundation.

Q: Let me try this question now: Did Mr. Simpson play any role in the
decision of you not to sit at counsel table during the preliminary
hearing?

MS. LEVINE: Object and assert the privilege. Attorney-client and
attorney work product.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Who is Skip Taft?

A: Mr. Taft is Mr. Simpson's business attorney.

Q: Okay. And how long have you known Mr. Taft for?

A: I would say approximately 20 years, maybe a little more.

Q: Okay. Do you have a social relationship with Mr. Taft?

A: No.

Q: Do you have a business relationship with Mr. Taft?

A: No.

Q: Do you know him in any capacity other than the business attorney
for Mr. Simpson?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Okay. Could you tell me the last time you spoke to Mr. Taft?

A: Approximately one week ago.

Q: And could you relate to me the substance of that conversation?

MS. LEVINE: I'd object and assert the privilege.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Prior to that conversation approximately a week ago, could you tell
me when you had spoken to him, if at all, prior to a week ago?

A: It would have probably been about 30 days prior to that.

Q: And could you tell me the substance of that conversation?

MS. LEVINE: I'd again object and assert the privilege.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Prior to that conversation approximately 30 days ago, do you recall
when you spoke to him, if at all, prior to that also?

A: Probably a week prior to that.

Q: Okay. Could you tell me the substance of that conversation?

MS. LEVINE: And I would again object and assert the privilege.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Is it your position, Miss Levine, that any
conversations Mr. Kardashian has had with Mr. Taft, that he will be
asserting the privilege?

MS. LEVINE: I think so. Since he knows him only as O.J. Simpson's
business lawyer and has no other relationship with him, it seems clear
that that's the only relationship  the only thing they would be
discussing.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Could you tell me approximately how many times you have
spoken to Mr. Taft since October 3rd 1994?

A: Quite a bit.

MR. PETROCELLI: '95.

MR. KELLY: '95.

THE WITNESS: Quite a bit. I  maybe 25 times.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And prior to  Strike that. Between June 13th, 1994 and October
3rd, 1995, could you tell me approximately how many times you had
spoken to Mr. Taft?

A: I could not, no.

Q: Numerous?

A: Numerous, yes.

Q: Prior to June 13th, 1994,could you approximate for me how often you
would ever speak to Mr. Taft?

A: Maybe three or four times a year.

Q: And that's since the time you first met him?

A: Oh, there would be periods where I may speak to him more
frequently, but I would say over the last  I'm just going back maybe
five, seven years, you know, four or five times a year.

Q: Did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Taft where there were
any people other than attorneys present?

MS. LEVINE: And excluding Mr. Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Yeah, excluding Mr. Simpson.

THE WITNESS: I'm sure. I'm sure I have.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you recall  Let me just have one minute.

(Pause in the deposition.)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, going back to the meeting you had mentioned earlier
in Mr. Shapiro's office?

A: Yes.

Q: Was  did you indicate that Skip Taft was present there at that
time?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: Okay. Could you relate to me the substance of that particular
meeting?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls for privileged information.

MR. KELLY: Is it your position, Miss Levine, that even conversations
Mr. Kardashian had with other attorneys with non-attorneys present is
privileged?

MS. LEVINE: Not always, but it's my understanding that was in Mr.
Shapiro's office, and I believe that it calls  that there were things
going on related  there related to the representation of Mr. Simpson.
Information was being gathered and things like that.

MR. KELLY: That's your understanding?

MS. LEVINE: That's my understanding.

MR. KELLY: Is that based on a conversation with your client?

MS. LEVINE: I don't have to tell you where I have my understanding.
That's my understanding.

MR. KELLY: Okay. And you refuse to answer anything regarding the
substance of those conversations with non-attorneys present also?

MS. LEVINE: Yes, at that particular conversation at that particular
time, yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me specifically  First of all, did you speak to
Marcus Allen at all that particular day at Mr. Shapiro's office?

MS. LEVINE: Can I have a moment, please?

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:42.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:44.

MR. KELLY: Could we have the last question read back, David?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q: Could you tell me specifically  First of all, did you speak to
Marcus Allen at all that particular day at Mr. Shapiro's office?")

MS. LEVINE: I am going to assert the privilege, attorney work product
privilege, to that conversation.

MR. KELLY: Would you be asserting that same privilege if I ask him
about any conversations with any lay people in the office that day?

MS. LEVINE: In that  in Mr. Shapiro's office in the course of that
meeting, yes.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, could you tell me the last time you spoke to Marcus
Allen?

A: Yes.

Q: And when was the last time you spoke to him?

A: It would have been that meeting, whenever it was, in June or July
of 1994.

Q: Prior to that meeting, could you tell me when you had spoke to him
previously at all?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: June 13th, 1994.

Q: And did you call him, or did he call you?

MS. LEVINE: Assumes facts not in evidence.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Assuming it was  First of all, under what circumstances did you
speak to Mr. Allen?

A: He called Mr. Simpson's office, and I answered the phone.

Q: Do you recall what time of day that was?

A: Approximately 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon.

Q: And could you relate the substance of that conversation to me?

A: It was one of Mr. Allen was in the  in some golf tournament in the
Bahamas or Grand Caymens or somewhere out of the country, and he
called to express his concern about what happened and to inquire as to
what was going on.

Q: And could you tell me what you said to him?

A: I knew nothing at that moment, and I just said how sad I was about
the loss of Nicole, and it was really just commiserating over the
death of Nicole.

Q: When you say you knew  I'm sorry. Did you say you knew nothing at
that time?

A: That's correct.

Q: You had been over to Rockingham the morning of June 13th, had you
not?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Had you spoken to any police officers there?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Had you been there when Cathy Randa arrived there with Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Had you been there when Skip Taft arrived with Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see Mr. Simpson at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see any little cards in the driveway marking evidence when
you had been there at that time?

A: No, sir.

Q: Do you recall any of the conversations you had with the police
officers at that time?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Do you recall who, if anybody, you spoke to at that time?

A: No.

Q: Could you describe the person to me?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did that person look like?

A: It was a tall African-American policeman about 6 foot 6, about 220.
He was guarding the Rockingham gate.

Q: And as approached the Rockingham gate, it's your testimony you saw
no evidence markers in the driveway at that time?

A: I don't recall seeing anything like that.

Q: Could you tell me what you said to this officer as you approached
him?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And what was that?

A: I said, "I have Mr. Simpson's luggage, and you should take it in."
And he said, "No, you can't come in. " And I said  That's funny?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yeah, I don't think it's very professional.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not laughing at you, Mr. Kardashian.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am laughing at something Mr. Brewer and I are
reading, and I apologize for the distraction.

THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing to do with your testimony.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

And he refused to let me in, and I said, "But it's his luggage. What
should I do with it?" He says, "You can't come in."

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, you had  how long had you been at Rockingham prior
to Mr. Simpson's arrival?

A: I believe about 15 minutes.

Q: That's all?

A: I believe so. Let me say this, though 

Q: Well, what I am  okay Say what you want to say.

A: All I'm going to say is that whole day, as you can imagine, the
whole week was very sketchy in my mind. I could have been there a half
hour; I don't know, but my recollection is it was only about 15, 20
minutes.

Q: Okay. Excuse me. Other than this one conversation you had with
Marcus Allen on the 13th, do you recall any other conversations you
had with him between June 13th and the day you saw him in Mr.
Shapiro's office?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Subsequent to that meeting in Mr. Shapiro's office, do you recall
any other conversations you had with Marcus Allen after that time?

A: I don't believe I've spoken to him since that meeting.

Q: Do you know who Larry Schiller is?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And who is that?

A: He's a journalist. He's a journalist and a director and a writer,
as far as I know.

Q: And how long have you known him for?

A: I've known Mr. Schiller about 10 years  plus, right in there
somewhere.

Q: And you know his wife also  or I should say his ex-wife?

A: Yes.

Q: Stephanie?

A: Yes.

Q: Were they married when you first met them?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: When was the last time you spoke to Lawrence Schiller?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. It's irrelevant. It's got nothing to do with
this case, unless you can tie it into something having to do with
this. He talked to Mr. Schiller about something down the line 

MR. KELLY: First of all, Miss Levine, I don't think it's appropriate
for you to be objecting on grounds of relevancy. It's one thing for
you to instruct your client not to answer a particular question and
assert a different  a particular privilege, but I don't think the
relevancy objection has any place here right now.

We are involved in the discovery process, and this is someone who he
has had dealings with and conversations with, and it certainly has
nothing to do with his role as an attorney, and I think we are
certainly allowed to probe this area.

MS. LEVINE: But he has some interests that are private as well, as I
am sure you understand. Some things  just because he may have been
involved as a lawyer for somebody doesn't mean his whole life,
anything that may have happened at some point before or after this, is
something you can probe into.

If you want to ask him about his relationship with Mr. Schiller and
Mr. Simpson, that's fine, but I want to make sure that we are not
going  I mean, you are asking about whether he ever met Mr.
Schiller's wife 10 years earlier. I am not sure what that has to do
with anything.

MR. KELLY: They are more foundational. I want to find out first when
he met him, and then we will get a little more specific and see where
we're going with it.

MS. I EVINE: Okay. I would appreciate it if you would keep it at the
case at issue, though.

MR. KELLY: Sure.

THE WITNESS: Let's step outside, please.

MR.VAN SICKLEN: Let's take a short break.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:51.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:59.

MR. KELLY: Could you read the last question back, Dave?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. When was the last time you spoke to Lawrence Schiller?")

MS. LEVINE: You know, his relationship with Mr. Schiller is
multi-fold. If you want to ask something specifically related to this
litigation, we have no objection to that, but his relationship with
Mr. Schiller is personal and business and attorney-client, and that
broad a question, asking him about things that may have happened that
have nothing to do with this, I can't permit him to answer.

MR. KELLY: Can he answer the question, the last time he spoke to Mr.
Schiller?

MS. LEVINE: He can answer the last time he spoke to Mr. Schiller, but
he will not answer the substance of the question.

THE WITNESS: Yesterday.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Have you ever had any conversations with Mr. Schiller regarding
your writing a book?

A: I have had conversations, yes.

Q: Could you tell me the last time you spoke to Mr. Schiller about
writing a book?

MS. LEVINE: You know, that's private. That's got nothing to do with
whether or not he has percipient information that you want in this
case.

If you want to ask him what he did, what he saw that's not privileged,
that's fine, but anything that has to do with things that may be
happening now, I don't think you have any interest or business getting
into, and he has a California constitutional privacy right.

MR. KELLY: I understand he has a constitutional privacy right. I
understand he has all kinds of rights. The question is whether any of
those rights are applicable when particular questions are asked, and
if this gentleman is here testifying under oath and at the same time
contemplating some sort of a commercial enterprise relative to his
knowledge or involvement with the subject matter of this case, we are
certainly entitled to probe that because one could certainly influence
the other.

I don't think we'd have a great deal of difficulty indicating that
some sort of prejudice or bias might be gleaned from financial gain in
some sort of contemplated contract at this point.

MR.VAN SICKLEN: Well, we will stipulate to that, and why can't we ask
about those things?

MR. KELLY: You were the ones that first refused to answer about those
things with Mr. Simpson.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: And you gave us an absolute contrary argument to the
one you just made.

MR. KELLY: Today is a new day, Steve.

MS. LEVINE: You know, I always believed in the very old legal proverb
that's what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander 

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I 

MS. LEVINE:  but I'm not involved in any of your prior discussions; I
have nothing to do with them; we want nothing to do with them; we just
want to get done with this, but at some point people have their lives
that have private interests in them, and we are not going to answer
that question today.

MR. KELLY: Okay. And as I reiterated before, my not following up on
that is no acceptance of your position.

MS. LEVINE: Of course.

MR. KELLY: It's just that we will deal with it later.

MS. LEVINE: That's fine. It doesn't do us any good to argue. We can't
make the decisions, anyway. Right?

MR. KELLY: We can just give them food for thought.

MS. LEVINE: No one listens to us, anyway.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you graduate from USC, Mr. Kardashian?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And then you went to, I believe, the University of San Diego Law
School?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And after leaving the University of San Diego Law School, could you
tell me what type of work you did first?

A: I started practicing law, doing corporate, business and
entertainment law.

Q: And what type of entity were you involved in when you were
providing those services?

A: With a partnership.

Q: Okay. What was the name of that partnership?

A: I was not a partner in the beginning, but I joined a law firm
called Eamer & Bedrosian, E-a-m-e-r. Bedrosian, B-e-d-r-o-s-i-a-n.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am having trouble hearing you, sir.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'll speak up. Eamer, E-a-m-e-r.

MR. PETROCELLI: E-a-m-e-r.

THE WITNESS: Right.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: What's Mr. Eamer's first name, by the way?

A: Richard. Richard Eamer and John Bedrosian.

Q: And did there come a time that you became a named partner with
those two gentlemen?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: How long had you been there for until becoming that?

A: I don't know. To the best of my recollection, maybe two years,
maybe three years.

Q: And after those two or three years. how many years were you
associated with them in a partnership relationship?

A: Oh, I would  to the best of my knowledge, probably another five
years maybe.

Q: And during  So it's a total of, say, seven or eight years?

A: Seven or eight years, yes.

Q: And while you were practicing law with those individuals, was your
main concentration corporate and entertainment law?

A: Yes, mostly  mostly the corporate side, yes.

Q: In those seven or eight years did you ever represent any individual
on a criminal matter?

A: Yes. I believe I represented, and I can't recall even recall their
names, but several people on some criminal matters, yes.

Q: Do you recall just the general nature of the criminal charges?

A: It would have been drunk driving cases, I believe.

Q: Okay. Other than I think out here they're DUI cases  is that what
they're called?

A: Yes.

Q: Other than DUI cases, did you handle any other matters of a
criminal nature while you were practicing law 

A: No, I did not.

Q:  in that period?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Could we have the approximate years?

A: I couldn't tell you.

MS. LEVINE: The years of the DUIs or the years he was with the firm?

MR. BREWER: The firm.

MR. KELLY: The years he was with the firm.

THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. It would have been from 1970 to '77, '78,
'79, right in there.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And did there come a time that you left this relationship with
these other attorneys?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And it was '78 or '79?

A: Yes.

Q: And what was the reason for leaving the situation you were in?

A: I had started several businesses, and I left to pursue those
businesses.

Q: And could you tell me what those businesses were?

A: Sure. In 1973 I started a company called Radio & Records.

Q: Is that a publication?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And you were the founder of that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you have any partners in that business?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: And was one of them your brother?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And you had one other partner also?

A: Yes. sir.

Q: And who was that?

A: His name is Robert Wilson.

Q: Could you tell me what other business interests you had going at
that time?

A: Yes. I started a  we opened a JAG store. JAG was a clothing
company, J-A-G.

Q: When you say "we," who are you speaking of?

MS. LEVINE: I am going to intervene for one minute. I am going to let
him answer, but to the extent that you are going to go through all of
his history from 1970 to 1994, because that's what it looks like,
that's fine. I think he has a privacy objection. I have no  but
without waiving that, if you want to ask the questions 

MR. KELLY: I am keeping them fairly general right now and 

MS. LEVINE: Basically, I clearly think that you can delve into his
legal practice without going into the clients, but besides that,
without waiving any objection, if it's not considered any waiver, you
can go ahead and ask them.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Well, all I'll be doing is asking in general terms
basically what he has been doing up to June 1994 without  and I am
not going to be looking for great detail on the various undertakings.

Q: I am sorry. Did you finish speaking about 

MS. LEVINE: JAG.

MR. KELLY: JAG. Okay.

Q: Who were your partners in that undertaking?

A: An individual named Joe Leach and O.J. Simpson.

Q: Simpson was one of your 

A: Yes.

Q:  partners?

A: Yes.

Q: Was he an investor?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Was he an active participant in the undertaking?

A: Not in the day-to-day, but he would be active when he was in town
as far as doing some publicity, doing some marketing assistance, that
type of thing.

Q: Any other enterprises 

A: Yes.

Q:  prior to, say, 1980?

A: Sure. Prior to 1980?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah, there was a company called Joy, Joy, which was a yogurt
company which we started.

Q: Once again, when you say "we," who are we speaking of? Was your
brother involved in that?

A: No. I think it was Mr. Leach again, and I can't recall if Mr.
Simpson was in that. I believe he was, but I can't  yeah, I think he
was. I think it was the three of us.

Q: Okay. Anything else prior to, say, '80?

A: Yeah, I'm sure there were, but I can't remember them.

Q: Were you a principal of National Medical Enterprises?

A: No, I was not.

Q: Were you a stockholder?

A: At one point, yes.

Q: And there came a time you sold your interest in that company?

A: Yes.

Q: Was that before it went public?

A: No. My interest in National Medical was just as a shareholder on
the open market. We were their corporate counsel, and we  my partners
founded National Medical Enterprises.

Q: Subsequent to, say, 19-  Oh, when you say your "partners" in
National Medical, are you talking about your law partners?

A: I'm sorry. My law partners, Dick Eamer and John Bedrosian, were the
founders of National Medical Enterprises, along with Leonard Cohen.

Q: And, say, going into the early '80s, what type of work were you
doing at that time?

A: I was under  I was under an employment agreement with Radio &
Records, so I was now employed at R & R, and we started getting into 

Q: I'm sorry. With your employment contract, was that a result of your
selling Radio & Records?

A: Yes, sir. I sold that in 1979.

Q: And as part of that sellout, you were signed up to a multi-year
what? A consulting contract?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. All right. I am sorry to interrupt. What else?

A: Somewhere in the early '80s I started a company called Concert
Cinema, and my partners were Mr. Wilson and Mr. Simpson.

Q: Okay. Is that a predecessor to Movie Tunes?

A: No, it is not.

Q: Okay. Going back to  what is it called? Cinema?

A: Concert Cinema.

Q: Concert Cinema.

A: Subsequent to Concert Cinema, what did I do. I believe after that I
went to MCA.

Q: And there was MCA Radio Network?

A: That's when I started MCA Radio Network, that's correct.

Q: Were you president of that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: How long were you there for?

A: Three years.

Q: What year would that have been then that you left as president of
MCA Radio Network?

A: It was either '89 or '90.

Q: Between 1980 and 1990, had you provided any legal services for any
client?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And more than one client?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: More than three clients?

A: Yes, but not too many more.

Q: Maybe five?

A: Maybe five.

Q: Could you tell me who those  just in general terms, who the
clients were, and I am not I going into the 

MS. LEVINE: Not their names? If you want to ask if one of them was
Simpson or someone related to this case, that's fine, but I hate to
bring people into this case that may have had nothing whatsoever to do
with it.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Let me 

Q: Being cognizant of that, were any of these corporate clients?

A: Yes.

Q: Was more than one of them a corporate client?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Out of the five or six clients, how many of those were
corporate clients?

A: Maybe three or four, right in there.

Q: Okay. And could you tell me how many individual clients you
maintained through that time period?

A: Perhaps the same number: About three or four.

Q: Was one of those Mr. Simpson?

A: No.

Q: So between 1980 and 1990 you provided no legal representation 

A: No, that's not correct. I'm sorry. There was legal representation
of Mr. Simpson I would say for the early '80s, but the  after perhaps
'85 or '86 I don't believe there was.

Q: Okay. After 1985 or '86, could you tell me the next time you
provided legal representation to Mr. Simpson?

A: I just need a clarification as to what's legal representation. Is
it advice? Is it appearing on a matter? Is it  you just have to
clarify that for me.

Q: Well, first of all, I will try to be specific: Between 1985 and
June 12th, 1994, did you make any appearances in court for Mr.
Simpson?

A: No, I never did.

Q: Between 1985 and 19-  June 1994, did you ever file any legal
papers for Mr. Simpson?

A: No, sir.

Q: Between 1985 and 1994 did you ever submit any written legal
memorandum to Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes, I believe so. I don't know the dates, but I believe I did.

Q: Do you know what year that would have been in?

A: No. Again, it probably would have been the mid '80s.

Q: What I am talking about is beyond the mid '80s.

A: I'm sorry.

Q: The last time you did something.

A: I'm sorry. I don't believe so.

Q: So between the mid '80s and June 1994, you did not submit any legal
memorandum to Mr. Simpson?

A: Correct.

Q: In that time  same time period, between the mid 1980s and June
1994, did you prepare any contracts for Mr. Simpson for any reason?

A: I could have during that period. I don't recall, but I could have.

Q: Okay. Other than what you might have, would it have been more than
once?

A: If at all, it would have been two or three times.

Q: And would you be able to recall the general nature of those
contracts you may have prepared?

A: Sure. It would have been relating to the companies that we were
involved in at that time.

Q: So would it be fair to say that it was sort of a mixture of
business and legal-type work you did with Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: When did you first meet Mr. Simpson?

A: 1970.

Q: Okay. And under what circumstances?

A: I met him on a tennis court.

Q: And was that at your house?

A: No, sir. It was at a friend of mine's  friend of all of ours,
basically.

Q: And who was that friend?

A: His name was Harry Rothschild.

Q: After that first meeting of Mr. Simpson, did you develop a
relationship with him?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: You became close friends to him?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you see him and socialize with him in addition to providing
 or having business interests with him in from the early '70s onward?

A: Yes.

Q: And would it be fair to say that you to know his personality fairly
well?

A: I would say very well.

Q: Would it be fair to say that you got to know his character very
well

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Would you be able to, as you sit here today  Actually, strike
that. Would you be able to describe Mr. Simpson's basic personality as
you knew it prior to June of 1994?

MS. LEVINE: In lay terms?

MR. KELLY: Yeah, lay terms, just very general.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Would your please do that for me?

A: Very personable and very outgoing. I think that's the best I can
describe it.

Q: And as of June 1994, would you be able to describe his basic
character as you knew it, in general terms?

MS. LEVINE: From whenever he met him to June of '94?

MR. KELLY: To June of 1994.

THE WITNESS: Yes. His character in which way?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Integrity.

A: Again, I'm looking  I'm separating, one business and one  because
we did business together and then we would socialize together.

Q: Okay. Well, I'm not asking you to separate the two, but if you want
to, go ahead and tell me the two.

A: Okay. His integrity in business was above reproach, in business.

Q: Okay.

A: It was excellent.

Q: Okay.

A: On a social basis, his integrity as far as  we went through
periods when he was single. You have a different standard, I guess,
than when you're married. And so his single standard was one of being
single, is the best I could put it, and while he was married, his
integrity was not as I would have it. I would put it that way.

Q: And just speaking very generally again, first of all, you met
Nicole Brown Simpson in '79 or '80?

A: I don't know the date. When he met her, I met her that same day..

Q: And you knew he had a long-term relationship with her up to the
point they got married, did you not?

A: Yes.

Q: And would it be fair to describe Mr. Simpson as a womanizer during
that time period he had the long-term relationship with Nicole prior
to their marriage?

MS. LEVINE: A womanizer as my feminist friends would describe it as or
a womanizer as is traditionally thought of on the golf course? What do
you  someone that was going out with other women 

MR. KELLY: I was trying to be a little bit polite here 

MS. LEVINE: Okay.

MR. KELLY:  but I will go into detail and find out exactly what Mr.
Kardashian considered a womanizer.

MS. LEVINE: That's kind of an odd term in the terms of what one would
think of. I would think of it maybe differently than you would.

MR. KELLY: I don't know. We have had several witnesses in here who
have described Mr. Simpson as a "womanizer." So it's a usual term in
here, but we will go into detail.

MS. LEVINE: Go ahead. If it's a term

MR. PETROCELLI: No one has accused Mr. Simpson of being politically
correct.

THE WITNESS: Repeat the question, please.

MR. KELLY: Could we do that, Dave?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. And would it be fair to describe Mr. Simpson as a womanizer during
that time period he had the long-term relationship with Nicole prior
to their marriage?")

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me in your words what you would consider a
womanizer?

A: Just dating several women, you know, or just dating around I guess
is the best way I could put it.

Q: Okay. Would you consider that sleeping around with other women?

A: Yes.

Q: And was it your understanding that he was doing that at the same
time he had this relationship with Nicole?

A: Yes.

Q: And was it your understanding that Nicole did not know about it?

A: That I don't know. I can't answer that.

Q: Well, were you ever aware of any attempts of Mr. Simpson to sleep
with women that  where efforts were made to keep it from Nicole?

A: I was not  well, no. Let me just answer that and say no.

Q: Excuse me.

(Pause in the deposition.)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you share  did Mr. Simpson live with you at some point prior
to his getting married to Nicole?

A: Yes, he did.

Q: And that was when you had a house on Deep Canyon?

A: Yes.

Q: How long did he share that house with you for?

A: I think six months.

Q: That's all?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And could you tell me who, if anybody, he was dating at that
time other than Nicole?

A: He was not dating Nicole at that time.

Q: Okay. Could you tell me what year that was?

A: No, I cannot. It would have been  I mean, to the best of my
recollection it would have been 1973 or '4 or  '5 maybe. Right in
there.

Q: And using this  having the same 

A: Actually  I'm sorry  I think it was even prior to that. I think
it was maybe '72.

Q: And you, as I understand it, were fairly friendly still with Mr.
Simpson after he and Nicole got married in 1985. Is that correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And could you, if you are able to, describe his character as you
knew it subsequent to his marriage in 1985?

A: Yes. I really did not see him too much during that period. We were
couples, and so whenever I would see Mr. Simpson, it would be on a
couple relationship. He and I didn't  no longer hung out together as
guys, single guys basically. So whenever would see Mr. Simpson, it
would be in a social setting.

Q: You spent time with Mr. Simpson and Nicole from the time you met
them till the time they got married, though, did you not?

A: Yes.

Q: Would it be fair to say that you spent a substantial amount of time
with the two of them prior to their marriage?

A: What year did they get married?

Q: '85.

A: '85. No, that's not correct. I can explain.

Q: Sure.

A: Mr. Simpson and I had the type of relationship that I would see him
 maybe we'd go out three or four flights in one week, and then I
wouldn't see him for six or eight months, and then we'd pick up where
we left off and go out again with our wives every night for three,
four nights, and then I wouldn't see him again for six months. So our
relationship was lim- 

Q: I am sorry. If I can just interrupt. First of all, when did you get
married for the first time?

A: I've only been married once. It was 1978.

Q: And that was to Kris?

A: Yes.

Q: And the period that Simpson was dating Nicole between the time you
he met her and the time they got married, you were basically married
to Kris?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. So I just wanted to correct that. So the time you would spend
with him was as couples most of the time?

A: It was almost always as couples. We did not spend time alone. I
mean, I'm sure we'd go to lunch or something, but we really  during
the marriage period it was rare that O.J. and I would do something
alone.

Q: What about the period prior to the marriage, from like late '70s to
1985?

A: No. I got married in '78.

Q: I'm sorry. I just want to clarify it. Prior to Simpson and Nicole's
marriage in '85.

A: We did not spend much time with them other than as couples.

Q: So between '78 when you married and '85, most of the time with you
and Simpson was spent as couples?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you had plenty of opportunities to observe Mr. Simpson with
Nicole. Is that correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And prior to Nicole's and Simpson's marriage in 1985 and all those
times you'd spend with him, did you ever, first of all, see them have
arguments?

A: I saw them have one argument in the whole time I've ever known
them.

Q: Right up 

A: Right up till today  or till 

Q: Till June of 1994?

A: That's correct.

Q: When was that one argument?

A: I don't know the year. I believe the year would have been 1989 or
maybe '88, right in there.

Q: Okay. And where were you when you observed this argument?

A: I was in a limousine in New York.

Q: And who else was present there?

A: Kris, my ex-wife, O.J., Nicole and the limo driver.

Q: Do you recall the name of the limousine service?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Had you made arrangements for the limousine or had Mr. Simpson?

A: Mr. Simpson did.

Q: Do you recall, had you been to an event that night?

A: No. We were just going somewhere. I can't even recall where. We
were going to dinner or going to  I don't know where. We  Kris and I
had just come to spend a few days with O.J. and Nicole in New York.

Q: Were you staying at Simpson's condominium?

A: Yes.

Q:  in New York?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recall what time of year it was?

A: I think it was in the winter.

Q: Okay. And you can't remember where you were going?

A: No. No, I cannot.

Q: Do you 

A: I just  I believe we were just going to dinner somewhere.

Q: Can you tell me what happened or what you observed?

A: All I could recall, and I don't know how it even transpired, I
don't know how it got on any subject, but all I remember is Nicole
yelling at O.J. and just telling the limo driver to stop the car, and
she got out.

Q: How long did this  Did Simpson respond to her at all?

A: He just looked at Kris and I and said, "See what she does? See?"
And she got  she left  I mean, when she got out of the car, he just
said, "See what she does?"

Q: And what did you understand that to mean?

A: That, you know, she just would fly off the handle at certain times
or get upset at him for no provocation, because there wasn't really
anything they were arguing about.

Q: Had Mr. Simpson ever spoken to you before that moment about Nicole
flying off the handle or arguing with him for no reason?

A: Yes.

Q: What had he told you?

A: Just basically that she gets upset at him, and she just will  she
was very volatile sometimes in her mood swings.

Q: Did she  did he tell you why she would get upset with him, ever?

A: No, he would not. And really we didn't  I mean, this is the first
instance I ever saw  we really didn't talk about 

Q: You said it was the only instance.

A: It was the only one. We never talked about this because we weren't
with them that much, Kris and I.

Q: I know, but you had just related to me several times he had
expressed this to you.

A: He had told me that Nicole gets upset sometimes and will just go
off on him for no reason.

Q: For no reason.

A: Yes.

Q: And was this the only time you saw her do it?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: But you had spent a fair amount of time with she and Simpson before
this, hadn't you?

A: Yes, I had.

Q: Okay. Been out to dinner many times?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. You had gone on vacations with them?

A: Correct.

Q: Gone to Mexico?

A: Correct.

Q: Gone to Aspen?

A: Right.

Q: Had parties with them in the past together?

A: Yes.

Q: And you had never seen this happen before with Nicole?

A: I had never seen either one of them be abusive to the other.

Q: Okay. Did you consider this abusive that night?

A: Well, it was just  it was just  I found it not so much abusive. I
found it out of character, out of the ordinary.

Q: For either one of them?

A: For either one of them.

Q: Okay. Mr. Kardashian, have you ever  did it ever come to your
attention that in 1979 

First of all, were you aware of the fact that Mr. Simpson owned a
condominium in San Francisco?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Was it ever brought to your attention that at one point Mr. Simpson
had thrown all of Nicole's clothes out a window of the condominium in
1979?

MS. LEVINE: Aside from what he may have learned after June 13th?

MR. KELLY: Well, even after that. At any time.

MS. LEVINE: Well, if he learned it in the course of the representation
of Mr. Simpson, I don't think that that's something he should be
testifying about.

So if we break it down, I will let him answer it, and then if you want
him to answer the second half of the question, then we will make the
objection and you will have your record. But if you want to ask it
broadly, he can't answer it. If you want to ask the first part 

MR. KELLY: I am sorry. What was your suggestion as to the first part?

MS. LEVINE: Did he ever know of that prior to June 13, 1994.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Did you?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever learn of that subsequent to June 13, 1994 that 

MS. LEVINE: I 

MR. KELLY: Let me finish the question first.

MS. LEVINE: I apologize.

Q:  that Mr. Simpson had thrown out  Nicole's clothes out the window
of the San Francisco condominium at one point in time?

A: No

Q: You have never heard that as you sit here today?

A: This is the first I've heard of it.

Q: If you were to hear that Mr. Simpson had thrown all of Nicole's
clothes out a third-floor window of his condominium in 1979, would
that seem out of character to you for Mr. Simpson?

A: Very much so.

Q: Very much so?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Prior to June 13th, 1994 had you ever heard that Mr. Simpson
had physically picked up Nicole and thrown her out the front door of
Rockingham during the course of an argument?

A: No, I've never heard that.

Q: Have you ever heard that as you sit here today?

A: No, I have never heard that.

Q: If you were to hear that, would that sound out of character for Mr.
Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Prior to June 13,1994 had you ever heard that during the
course of an argument with Nicole, that Mr. Simpson had shattered the
windshield of the car she was sitting in during the course of an
argument?

A: I had not heard that prior to that date.

Q: Have you heard that subsequent to that date?

MS. LEVINE: We will assert a privilege. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Would an incident like that be out of character for Mr. Simpson in
your opinion?

MS. LEVINE: I am going to instruct him not to answer that part as
well.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Prior to June 13, 1994 had you ever heard during the course of that
New Year's Day incident of 199-  1989  I'm sorry  that Mr. Simpson
had pulled Nicole's hair and hit her?

MS. LEVINE: Can I have that reread? I missed the middle of it. I
apologize.

MR. KELLY: Okay. David, could you read it back, please.

(Pending question read.)

MR. VAN SICKLEN: That's all one and the same incident? Is that what
you're asking him about?

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: All I know is what I read in the newspaper and heard on
television, and I can't recall whether they used those words or what
they said. I just knew there was an altercation.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Did you know it as a physical altercation?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you know it at least that it was in essence that Mr.
Simpson had been charged with spousal battery and Nicole was a victim
of that spousal battery?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And did that appear to be out of character for Mr. Simpson as you
knew it?

A: As I knew it, yes.

Q: And prior to June 13, 1994 were you aware of an incident where the
police had been called to Gretna Green in October of 1993 as a result
of a 911 call Nicole had made?

A: I was unaware of that.

Q: You were 

A: I was unaware of that.

Q: Okay. Subsequent to June 13, 1994 did you become...

A: I'm sorry.

Q: Okay. Subsequent to June 13, 1994 did you become aware of that tape
from somewhere other than conversations with Mr. Simpson?

MS. LEVINE: Or things he learned in the course of work product?

MR. KELLY: Or even in the course of work product.

MS. LEVINE: Did he learn it in the course, or did he learn it aside
from that, like reading it in the paper? I am trying to 

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you hear the tape in open court that was televised around the
world, that 911 tape 

A: Yes.

Q:  from October of 1993?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you hear Mr. Simpson's voice on that tape?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you recognize it?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you hear him screaming?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you hear Nicole make the call?

A: I heard Nicole's voice.

Q: You heard her voice also.

A: Yes.

Q: Mr. Simpson as you heard him, did he sound out of character to you
on that tape?

A: Yes.

Q: Totally out of character?

A: Yes.

Q: Had you ever heard him use that tone of voice before?

A: Never.

Q: Had you ever heard him use that language before?

A: No.

Q: Had you ever heard Nicole appear to be in that state of mind as she
appeared on that tape at that time?

A: No.

MR. KELLY: We are going to take a break for a minute. He has to switch
paper.

MS. LEVINE: Lunch or for a few minutes?

MR. KELLY: Just to switch things. Yeah, we will do  why don't we do
five minutes and break for lunch at 12:30?

MS. LEVINE: That's fine.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. l. The time is
approximately 11:38, and we are off the record.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is approximately
ll:51 .This is the beginning of tape No. 2.

MR. KELLY: I think we had a question hanging, didn't we?

MS. LEVINE: I don't think so.

(Record read as follows:

"Q. Had you ever heard Nicole appear to be in that state of mind as
she appeared on that tape at that time?

"A. No. ")

MR. KELLY:

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Going back to that tape for a second, did Nicole sound frightened
to you?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. As you sit here today, do you have any common business
interests with Mr. Simpson?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Today?

MR. KELLY: Today.

THE WITNESS: No. No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: No?

A: No.

Q: When did you first meet Nicole?

A: The day O.J. met her, and I don't know the date.

Q: Were you with him when he met her?

A: No, I was not.

Q: Do you know where he met her?

A: Yes.

Q: Where was that?

A: The Daisy restaurant in Beverly Hills.

Q: And where did you then meet her?

A: In my law offices.

Q: She came up there with him?

A: Yes.

Q: And it was your understanding that was the first time they had met?

A: Yes.

Q: What time was that they came up there?

A: Oh, approximately 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon.

Q: And would you describe her basic personality to me as you got to
know it over the years, in general terms?

A: Sure. She was  she was kind. She was sweet. I mean, I loved
Nicole. Nicole was a fun person.

Q: Okay. She a good wife to Mr. Simpson?

A: Oh, she was a good wife and an excellent mother.

Q: And would you consider  was she outgoing?

A: No, she wasn't. She was standoffish. I think it was because she was
shy that she was  she wasn't real outgoing until she got to know you.

Q: Okay. Now, I just mentioned in passing earlier  or I had asked you
in passing earlier that you had taken trips, you and your wife Kris,
with the Simpsons on occasions?

A: Yes, we did.

Q: And was there a time that you and your then wife took a trip with
the Simpsons and some other people to Acapulco?

A: Yes.

Q: And do you know what year that was in?

A: I do not.

Q: If I suggested 1989 to you, would that 

A: If you say it, it's probably around that time.

Q: Okay. And would you be able to put it in the context of that New
Year's Day, 1989 incident?

A: I don't understand your question. I'm sorry.

Q: Do you recall it  do you recall going on that trip within a few
months after the New Year's Day, 1989 incident?

A: No, I don't relate it to that. All I know is it was either their
anniversary or Nicole's birthday, one of the  I thought it was one of
the two dates we were celebrating.

Q: Okay. Could it have been Nicole's 30th birthday?

A: That I don't know. Could have been. I just don't know.

Q: Do you know whether that trip had any significance in terms of the
relationship between Nicole and O.J.?

A: No. I really never got into that very much.

Q: You have no idea what the state of their relationship was at the
time this trip was taken?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Could you tell me who originally suggested taking the trip?

A: No, I could not.

Q: Could you tell me who planned the trip?

A: I don't know. It could have been O.J. I think O.J. did.

Q: And would it be fair to say that it was at his suggestion also?

A: I think so, yes.

Q: And you don't remember whether it was relative to that New Year's
Day, '89 incident?

A: No, but it had to be  I mean, if it was '89, then it had to be
that summer, because I knew it as hot down there.

Q: But you have no idea what the state of Nicole and O.J.'s
relationship was 

A: No.

Q:  at that time?

A: No.

Q: Going to June 13, 1994  Actually, strike that.

When was the first time after June 12, 1994 that you spoke to Mr.
Simpson?

A: June 13,1994.

Q: Okay. And do you recall what time you spoke to him?

A: Approximately 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon.

Q: And where were you when you spoke to him?

A: In his offices.

Q: On San Vicente there?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you speak to him in person?

A: Yes.

Q: And who else was there when you initially spoke to Mr. Simpson that
day?

A: Mr. Weitzman, Mr. Taft. And Ms. Randa was in another room, I
believe. I think she  she could have been in and out; I don't recall,
but she was around there also.

Q: Okay. And could you tell me the substance of that conversation?

MS. LEVINE: If I could have a moment. I don't know if this is a
conversation upon which there is a claim of privilege or not.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Well, if Mr. Weitzman was around, it sounds like
there probably would be.

MS. LEVINE: It's 

MR. KELLY: I don't agree with you, so...

MR. VAN SICKLEN: We have established foundationally that Howard
Weitzman was representing O.J. as of that time, haven't we?

MR. KELLY: Yes, but it's my understanding also that if you have a
conversation between attorney and client and there are other
individuals present there other than the attorney and the client,
there is a waiver of that privilege, and they can discuss the content
or the substance of that conversation.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: That's 

MS. LEVINE: If there are non-persons [sic] that are part of the
relationship. You can have a conversation with your secretary present
if they are there for furtherance of the relationship, or other
lawyers or things like that.

If you want to 

MR. KELLY: But I understand Mr. Kardashian himself by being present
there at that time and he was not acting in an attorney capacity, he
himself as a layperson would in and of itself constitute that
situation where you have non-attorneys there who are not acting in the
capacity of providing legal services. He wasn't Mr. Weitzman's
paralegal or secretary or any part of his staff at that point.

MS. LEVINE: No. It depends a lot on what Mr. Simpson's perception was
when he goes in. Let's say he perceives Mr.  we don't need to go into
this  Kardashian as a lawyer at that point and everyone else does,
and he makes a statement.

I think it's probably best if I either  we either go off the record
for a minute; I discuss this with Mr. Kardashian, or if you want to go
forward and take this up after lunch, if you want to go back to it. I
don't know how you want to do it.

MR. KELLY: Why don't you discuss it now with your client.

MS. LEVINE: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 11:59.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 12:01.

MS. LEVINE: You want the question reread?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. KELLY: Not yet.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, you had just stepped out of the room for a couple
moments?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you converse with anybody other than Miss Levine while you were
outside the room at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me who else you conversed with?

A: Mr. Van  What is it?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Van Sicklen.

THE WITNESS: Van Sicklen.

MS. LEVINE: Who I was introduced to as Mr. Simpson's lawyer, so 

MR. KELLY: I understand that. He wasn't introduced as Mr. Kardashian's
lawyer, was he?

MS. LEVINE: No. No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you have tell me what, if anything, you discussed with the
gentleman who is Mr. Simpson's attorney just now?

A: Yes. We discussed what transpired, in trying to answer your
question.

Q: Could you tell me specifically what that conversation was?

MS. LEVINE: You know, I asked Mr. Van Sicklen to come out because I
wanted his assistance in determining whether what he thought that Mr.
Simpson's perception was as to this conversation because I thought
that was an important part in determining whether or not there was a
privilege.

It is Mr. Simpson's privilege, and it's for Mr. Simpson and his
counsel to determine how it's to be asserted. If you don't want me to
ask Mr. Van Sicklen his position on these things, then please tell me
right now on the record that you don't want me to ask that.

Otherwise, I think that it's incumbent on me, if I have a question on
something, to try and get information from wherever I can to make the
assertions in the most reasonable way possible. And so I was the one
that asked him to come out, and I asked him to do that to facilitate
my relationship with Mr. Kardashian.

MR. KELLY: I understand that, but I am not asking about any
conversations you had with 

MS. LEVINE: Well 

MR. KELLY:  Mr. Van Sicklen. I am asking about any conversations Mr.
Kardashian had with Mr. Van Sicklen, which is 

MS. LEVINE: No, I know you are asking that, but I used him for part of
my relationship with Mr. Kardashian. That's part of mine and Mr.
Kardashian's privilege, and I needed that to further my relationship
with Mr. Kardashian.

To the extent that lawyers discuss things, whether or not their client
is present, that doesn't mean that it can be gone into by anybody else
that's present.

I needed to ask him a question. I asked him to come out there so that
I could ask him something about his perception of something. If you
have a problem with that, that's fine. I am not going to permit Mr.
Kardashian to answer any questions on that.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Could we go back to the question that was 

Once again, the same caveat I would throw in there: By moving along, I
am not agreeing with your position.

MS. LEVINE: That's fine. I don't expect you to agree with my position.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

To the last question there was prior to them taking the break and
conferring out in the hallway.

MS. LEVINE: If I might for a second 

MR. KELLY: Sure.

MS. LEVINE:  I don't know if you are making the faces for my benefit,
for Mr. Kardashian's benefit 

MR. PETROCELLI: There is to point  there is no reason for you to make
these comments, Miss Levine.

MS. LEVINE: About the faces?

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not making any faces. I am shaking my head.

MS. LEVINE: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: I wasn't distracting you. I wasn't distracting your
client.

MS. LEVINE: It was 

MR. PETROCELLI: In fact your objections are meritless, and when it's
my turn to examine I will expose how meritless they are, and if  you
know, there is no reason for you to provoke a problem here at the
deposition. Take your position 

MS. LEVINE: I am not trying to provoke a problem 

MR. PETROCELLI:  and we will get on with it. Okay?

MS. LEVINE:  but if you are shaking your head, it was something that
brought something up, obviously, with me. It was bothering me.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I'm sorry that it's bothering you, but I think
you haven't done a fair and reasonable job of studying this matter.
You've taken  you've asserted the attorney-client privilege with
respect to matters that have been fully testified to at length about
by other witnesses 

MS. LEVINE: You know 

MR. PETROCELLI:  in the presence of the holder of the privilege, Mr.
Simpson, and his counsel, absolutely frivolous assertion of
privileges, a complete effort to cover up and block information 

MS. LEVINE: You know, if you are saying this for the benefit of
television, you can go outside and say it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. You started it.

 and when it's my turn to examine we will get to that matter, and
then I will shake my head to your heart's content.

MS. LEVINE: Well, my heart isn't content, but, you know, what's gone
on with other witnesses is one thing. I am trying to represent Mr.
Kardashian, and I understand the privilege in one way. If you
understand it 

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not your privilege, and it's not his privilege.

MS. LEVINE: That's right. So 

MR. PETROCELLI: And Mr. Van Sicklen has not asserted it, and you have
no right to assert it.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes, I have.

MS. LEVINE: He is obligated under the state Bar code to assert it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Not in the presence of the holder of the privilege,
and he has not asserted the privilege with respect to certain
conversations on behalf of his client that you have, and we will get
to that.

MS. LEVINE: Very well. File your motion. Do you want to read 

MR. PETROCELLI: No. We are going to get to it today.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I don't think you're the person that can decide
whether there is a privilege there or not.

MR. PETROCELLI: We'll see.

MS. LEVINE: Unless you are going to like put up your dukes and fight
about it. I mean, generally, I don't see any robes on you.

MR. KELLY: Now might be a good time to stop for lunch.

MS. LEVINE: You think?

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

MS. LEVINE: You don't want to go back to your question 

MR. PETROCELLI: I think you should finish  you were in the middle of
a question.

MR. KELLY: Why don't we finish that one.

(Record read as follows:

"Q. And who else was there when you initially spoke to Mr. Simpson
that day?

"A. Mr. Weitzman, Mr. Taft. And Ms. Randa was in another room, I
believe. I think she  she could have been in and out; I don't recall,
but she was around there also.

Q. Okay. And could you tell me the substance of that conversation?")

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Attorney-client and attorney work product
privilege.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Going back to  let me ask you: When was the first time you heard
of Nicole's murder?

A: Approximately 10:00 or 11:00 o'clock on the 13th.

Q: Okay. And could you tell me how you heard it?

A: Yes. I received a telephone call from a friend of mine. She told
me.

Q: And was that friend's name 

A: Shelli Azoff.

Q: And did she indicate to you how she had heard of Nicole's murder?

A: Yes, she did. She heard it from her hairdresser.

Q: Is that Alex?

A: Alex Roldan.

Q: And could you tell me exactly what Shelli said to you when she
called you?

A: Yes. She said, "Robert, I just heard that Nicole was shot and
killed."

Q: Did she indicate  okay. Go on. Anything else she said?

A: No. You know, other than, you know, "What do you know about it," or
whatever.

Q: Okay. And where were you when you received this call?

A: I was in my office.

Q: Where was that office located?

A: In my  in my home.

Q: Okay. Do you have any office other than a home office?

A: No. I work out of my home.

Q: And what is the address of that home? And if you want to write it
down, that's fine, too.

A: You've got it in your reports, but I will write it down for you.

MS. LEVINE: I think it's on the subpoena.

MR. KELLY: I am sorry?

MS. LEVINE: I think it's on the subpoena as well.

MR. KELLY: That's okay.

(Witness complies.)

MR. KELLY: Could we mark this as an exhibit? That's what we've been
doing.

Q: Do you care if this address is on the record or not, Mr.
Kardashian?

A: I'd rather it not be, just because I have children that live with
me and for my 

Q: That's fine. Could we just mark this as an exhibit?

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 180 was marked for identification by the reporter
and was retained by counsel.)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Was anybody with you at the time you received that phone call from
Shelli, Mr. Kardashian?

A: No, sir.

Q: Okay. As a result of that phone call, did you make any phone calls?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Did you make them from your home office?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: And could you tell me who you called?

A: Yes. I called the Simpson residence to find out if this were
correct.

Q: Okay. And did anybody answer the phone at the Simpson residence?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Could you tell me who answered the phone?

A: I  it was a voice I didn't recognize, and I believe he said it was
Detective Fuhrman, but I can't  I can't be certain about that, but it
was not Mr. Simpson.

Q: Well, during the course of the criminal trial in '94 and '95, you
heard days of Detective Fuhrman's voice, did you not?

A: Yes, but I didn't know it at the time I called.

Q: Now as you sit here today, could you tell me who answered the phone


A: No, I couldn't.

Q:  at the Simpson residence?

A: No, I could not.

Q: Do you recognize that voice as having been Detective Fuhrman's
voice, now that you have heard his voice so often?

A: No. I just was  didn't focus in on the voice at all.

Q: Did the voice identify itself or himself?

A: I believe he identified himself as Detective Fuhrman, LAPD 

Q: Okay.

A:  but I just cannot be sure if I made that up as a result of what
went on in the criminal trial or whether that in fact happened, so I
don't want to 

Q: Could you give me your best guess as to who answered the phone at
the Simpson 

A: I believe it was  I'm sorry.

Q: Yes. Could you give me your best guess as to who answered the phone
at the Simpson residence when you made that initial call that morning?

A: My best guess is it was Detective Fuhrman.

Q: And could you tell me what, if anything, was the substance of that
conversation with Detective Fuhrman?

A: Yes.

Q: Please tell me.

A: I asked, "Is Mr. Simpson home?" And the  Detective Fuhrman said,
"Who's calling?" I identified myself 

Q: How did you identify yourself?

A: I believe I said, "It's Robert Kardashian. I am a friend and
attorney." And he said 

Q: Do you  I am sorry to interrupt. Do you specifically recall
identifying yourself as a friend and attorney"?

A: Yes, because I felt I would get more information.

Q: Okay.

A: So I do recall doing that.

Q: Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.

A: I asked him  I said, "I just heard Nicole was shot and killed."
And he said, "She was killed. " And I said, "You mean she wasn't
shot?" And he said, "No. She was killed." And I said, "Well, can you
give me any more information?" And he said, "No. Thank you," and he
hung up.

Q: No further conversation?

A: End of call.

Q: No indication where Mr. Simpson was?

A: I did not ask. I figured he was there, but they just didn't let me
talk to him.

Q: Okay. Did you make any other phone calls from that home office
after that one call to the Simpson residence?

A: Yes.

Q: And who was the next phone call to?

A: I called Shelli Azoff back. and I said, "Nicole was"  "Yes, she's
been killed, but I don't know how." And I think I may have said, "I'm
going go over there."

Q: What was your relationship with Shelli Azoff?

A: She's just a friend of Kris and I, her and her husband.

Q: Generally close friend?

A: Yeah. Yes, I would say. We socialize with them, we've been on trips
with them, that type of thing.

Q: Okay. After you had called Shelli, did you make any other calls
from the home office?

A: No. I believe I told Denice, my fiance 

Q: That's Halicki?

A: Denice Halicki.  that Nicole was killed 

Q: Did Denice know Nicole?

A: Yes. And I said, "I'm going to go over there."

Q: Okay. Could you tell me the first phone call you made?

A: I called Kris, my next wife.

Q: Okay. And could you relate the substance of that conversation to
me?

A: I don't remember much of it other than to say  to advise her what
had happened to Nicole.

Q: What did you tell her happened to Nicole?

A: I think I said, "Did you hear Nicole was killed?"

And she said, "Yes. Judy Brown just"  "I've been on the phone to
Judy, and I was supposed to have lunch with Nicole today. I was going
to meet her at 11:00 o'clock today."

Q: Okay. Did she  okay. Keep going.

A: And other than that, I said, "Well, I'm on my way over there now.
I'm going to go see  go over and see O.J."

Q: You had known Nicole for a number of years, had you not, sir?

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, you had indicated that when you first arrived at
Rockingham  This is late morning on June 13,1994?

A: Yes.

Q:  that you saw several police cars parked on Rockingham.

A: I believe so.

Q: Okay. Where did you park at that time?

A: I parked on Ashford.

Q: Did you see any other cars on Ashford at that time?

A: I  I can't recall. I'm sure there were some, but I can't recall.

Q: Do you recall who, if anybody, you saw on the Ashford side of the
Rockingham residence at that time when you parked?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall if anybody was there?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Do you know if there were any police officers around the Ashford
gate?

A: I do not.

Q: What did you do next after you parked your car on Ashford?

A: I walked up to the police officer that was standing at the
Rockingham gate, and I asked  I identified myself and asked if I
could come in, and he said no.

Q: So you had walked down Ashford and around the corner onto
Rockingham?

A: Yes.

Q: And do you recall seeing anybody other than that one police officer
at that time who you spoke to?

A: Yes. There was a female officer standing there also 

Q: In uniform?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: And I don't know  I didn't know anybody, so I don't know who else
was there.

Q: Were there any members of the media in the Rockingham gate area at
that time?

A: Yes, there were.

Q: Did any of them ask you any questions?

A: No, they did not.

Q: Did you ask any of them any questions?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall seeing any cameras there at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: After this brief discussion with this one police officer, could you
tell me what you did next?

A: I stood to the side of the gate 

Q: The Rockingham gate?

A: Yes, to the south side, I guess it would be.

Q: Would that be the side with the key to the gate opener on it? Do
you know?

A: Yes, that side, yes.

Q: Okay.

A: And I stood there for approximately, I thought, about 10 or 15
minutes.

Q: Why were you just standing there?

A: I  and I don't know how I learned this, but I had learned that Mr.
Simpson was out of town and he was on his way back, so I stood there,
figuring that I could be of some assistance in some way.

Q: Okay. You can't recall at all who had told you he was on his way
back?

A: No, because I  there was nobody there that I knew. It could have
been, you know, somebody from the press or just hearing it. I really
don't know how I learned it.

Q: As you waited to the side of the Rockingham gate, did anybody show
up there prior to Simpson who you knew or recognized?

A: No, I don't believe so.

Q: Okay. What happened next in terms of activity after you had been
standing by the Rockingham gate? What happened at some point?

A: Mr. Taft, Mr. Simpson and Miss Randa pulled up in the car.

Q: Do you recall which gate they pulled up to?

A: Yes. The Rockingham gate.

Q: Okay. And whose car were they in at that point?

A: I believe Mr. Taft's.

Q: And where was Mr. Simpson seated within the car? Front or back
seat?

A: Front.

Q: And Cathy Randa was in the back?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And what type of car was that?

A: At that time, I don't know. I've subsequently learned what type of
car Mr. Taft has. Whether that was the car he had at the time, I don't
know.

Q: Okay. So you don't know what he had there at the time.

A: No. I didn't pay any attention.

Q: And you haven't subsequently learned exactly what car he had at
that time that he pulled up?

A: No. I know what he has now, and it could be the same car. I just
didn't pay any attention.

Q: What kind of car does he have now?

A: He has a Cadillac Seville, I believe, or El Dorado.

Q: What color car is that?

A: Dark. I don't know if it's green or black, but it's a dark color.

Q: After they pulled up to the Rockingham gate, did he point the car
into the gate?

A: No, he did not. He pulled up to the curb just past the gate, just
past the driveway.

Q: Do you recall seeing the white Bronco out there in the vicinity of
the Rockingham gate while you were waiting there?

A: No, it was not there.

Q: You did not see the white Bronco at all that morning when you
arrived there?

A: No. I don't recall seeing it. The only reason I stated that I
didn't think it was there is because subsequently I've seen pictures
as to where it was parked, and Mr. Taft parked right in the spot where
the Bronco was previously, so I would imagine it was not there at that
time.

Q: You never saw it towed away?

A: No, I did not.

Q: What happened after Mr. Taft pulled into that spot just past the
Rockingham entrance?

A: Mr. Simpson got out of the car and walked directly in the driveway.

Q: Was the gate open or closed prior to his arrival?

A: Open.

Q: Was it open the entire time you were waiting there outside it?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you see  Well, did he come over to you?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Did you go over to him?

A: I did not.

Q: Did you make any indication to him you wanted to speak to him?

A: I did not.

Q: Did he look in your direction?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Were you able to hear what, if anything, he said to those police
officers at the gate there?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Do you know whether or not he did say anything to them?

A: No I do not.

Q: Do you know whether they said anything to him?

A: No.

Q: Were you watching Mr. Simpson as he approached the officers?

A: Yes, I was.

Q: And you don't recall if there was any conversation between them?

A: No, I didn't hear any. When Mr. Simpson got out and started walking
towards the gate, I just started walking towards the car because I saw
Cathy getting out.

Q: Hadn't you been waiting there to see Mr. Simpson 

A: Yes.

Q:  prior to his arrival?

A: Yes.

Q: But when he arrived there, you made no attempt to speak to him?

A: No. It was a matter of 30 seconds. He just walked straight in, just
walked right by, wasn't looking at anything other than straight ahead
and just walked right in.

Q: Did he walk right by the police officers at the gate?

A: That I don't know.

Q: Did you 

A: I think subsequently I've seen video that showed that he walked 
just walked right on in.

Q: And what did you do after he walked in, if anything?

A: Cathy was getting out of the car, and she was carrying a bag, one
of his luggage bags, and I went and I held it for her.

Q: She was in the back seat at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: And to the best of your recollection, was that garment bag in the
back seat with her?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did you see any other luggage at that time?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you ever see the trunk opened?

MS. LEVINE: Ever in that period of time or 

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: During that period of time that day, did you ever see anybody open
Mr. Taft's trunk?

A: I don't  no, I don't believe so.

Q: Did you ever see any other luggage in the back seat?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see any other luggage anywhere in the car?

A: No. I didn't walk up and look inside the car. I believe she was
exiting the car as I walked up.

Q: And she had something in her hand?

A: Yes.

Q: As she was exiting the car?

A: I think so.

Q: Was she even out of the car yet?

A: I thought she was, yes.

Q: Okay. Did you see her reach back in for the bag?

A: I don't know. I would imagine so. I don't believe she would get out
with the bag, so I'm sure she would have, but I can't recall that.

Q: But other than that one bag you saw her with, you have no
recollection of any other luggage at that time of that day?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. And what, if anything, did Miss Randa do after she got out of
the car with this bag?

A: I  she stood there, and I said, "Let me hold the bag for you" 

Q: Okay.

A:  and then 

Q: Did she say anything?

A: She probably  I don't know. I mean, I'm sure she would have said 
I'd just be guessing. She probably would have said, "Oh, Robert, how
horrible," or something to that effect.

Q: And you don't recall 

A: No.

Q:  any other conversation?

A: No.

Q: Have you seen any videotapes of yourself with Cathy Randa at this
moment we're speaking of?

A: No, I don't think I've seen any videotape of this moment.

Q: And to the best of your recollection, that's the only conversation
you recall 

A: That's correct.

Q:  having with her at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Was that car door ever closed again that Cathy Randa had gotten out
of?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you ever look in the car after she had gotten out of it?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever ask her if she had any other luggage with her?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever ask her if there was anything else in terms of luggage
you could help her with?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see Skip Taft with any luggage?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you ever learn how many bags Mr. Simpson had brought back
from Chicago with him?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information, work product.
Calls for privileged or work product information.

If you want to ask him if he knew at that point on that day, I would
have no objection to that question.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: As you took that one garment bag from Cathy Randa at that time of
that day, do you know if Mr. Simpson had any other luggage with him at
that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he?

A: Yes.

Q: And where was that luggage?

A: He had  when he exited the car, he had a black duffle bag over his
shoulder.

Q: Okay. Did he walk in with that black duffel bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Other than that black duffel bag and the garment bag that you took,
did you see any other luggage that day?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you ever at any time in the future see any other luggage Mr.
Simpson had with him that day?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information or attorney
work product information, but with the caveat that there is an
incident that you and I spoke about that I told you that I have no
objection to him testifying to on that ground having to do with the
golf bag that occurs later 

MR. KELLY: Well, Miss Levine, I know what we spoke about, but I'm of
the opinion and firm opinion that none of his observations or actions
are privileged.

MS. LEVINE: None of 

MR. KELLY: At this point. I am asking about those observations.
Anything he observed in terms of luggage couldn't possibly fall under
the guise or claim of privilege at this point.

MS. LEVINE: Perhaps I misunderstood your question. I thought, did he
know at any point 

MR. KELLY: Okay, I will change the word "know" to "observe."

MS. LEVINE: If you are asking him what he observed that day or at the
incident we were alluding to at this other subsequent day, that's
fine, but I interpreted the question differently.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: At that time, other than the black shoulder bag Mr. Simpson walked
in with and the garment bag that you had taken from Cathy Randa, did
you observe any other luggage at that time?

A: No.

Q: Any time subsequent to that did you observe any other luggage that
had come back from Chicago with Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: And was that the golf bag?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Prior to discussing the golf bag, was there any other luggage,
other than that black duffel bag, garment bag and golf bag, that you
ever observed on June 13 or thereafter that was luggage that had come
back from Chicago with Mr. Simpson?

A: You are going to have to repeat that. Prior to  I'm sorry. Was
that prior to?

Q: Was there any other luggage, other than the black duffel bag, the
golf bag and the garment bag you took on the 13th from Cathy Randa,
any other luggage you ever observed that came back from Chicago with
Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: And what was that?

A: This was a  well, I'm assuming it came back from Chicago. I don't
 I wasn't there at the time. I don't know. But there was a silk hang
bag with O.J.'s initials on it, and there was a small, little bag,
maybe  maybe a foot, two feet, a smaller bag.

Q: When you say a foot to two feet, is that length you're talking
about?

A: Length, yes.

Q: And what about height on that bag?

A: I would say about a foot high.

Q: Would you be able to describe what type of bag that was?

A: No. No, I really  I can't.

MR. BREWER: Mr. Kardashian, can you keep your voice up, please?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Could you tell me what color that bag was?

A: It was either a black or dark blue bag.

Q: Do you recall what type of handles the bag had?

A: Yes. I thought it had just two loop handles. I don't know how to
describe it, but two handles on it.

Q: Okay. Do you recall seeing any emblems or writing or anything of
the sort on that particular bag?

A: I think there was an emblem, but I can't recall. I think there may
have been.

Q: Was it like a brown

A: It would have been June 14 or later.

Q: Did you ever see anybody in possession of that bag?

A: No. No.

Q: Where did you observe the bag in your house?

A: In my daughter's bedroom.

Q: How had the bag gotten up to your daughter's bedroom?

A: I  that I don't know. Either my housekeeper took it up  probably
my housekeeper took it up, but I don't know how it got there.

Q: Do you know where it was before it was in your daughter's bedroom?

A: I believe it would have been in my automobile.

Q: Do you know how it would have gotten in your automobile?

A: Either  I didn't put it there, so I don't know. Mr. Simpson had to
put it there, and I don't recall if that was part of the golf bag or
not.

Q: Let me ask you: You observed Mr. Simpson when he picked up the
golfbag at the airport, did you not?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: When you  Strike that. I'll go back to that.

Let's first go back to when you took the garment bag from Cathy Randa.
What, if anything, did you do with that bag next?

A: I walked up to the police officer and attempted to give it to him,
and he refused 

Q: How did you attempt to give it to him?

A: I walked up to him and I said, "I have Mr. Simpson's luggage."

And he said, "I'm sorry. You can't come in."

Q: Did you  When you say you "attempted to give it to him, " did you
say, "Here, take it"?

A: No, I did not. I 

Q: Did you extend it to him?

A: No, I did not.

Q: In what manner did you offer to give it to him?

A: Cathy and I were standing on the side of the Rockingham gate, and I
 it was sitting on the ground, and I walked over to the police
officer 

Q: How did it come to be sitting on the ground?

A: I just set it down because I was hugging Cathy, and we were very
upset, and so we were standing there just hugging and crying and
whatever.

Q: Any conversation?

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: Can you tell me the substance of the conversation then?

A: Basically, "I can't believe this has happened. Poor Nicole." Just
commiserating about what had happened, and not  and again, we didn't
know what had happened other than she was killed.

Q: Do you recall what Cathy said to you?

A: She was just crying and saying the same thing basically.

Q: And what happened next?

A: Then  and during this time the bag was sitting at our feet. I
walked over to the police officer, and I said, "Mr. Simpson's bag is
sitting here. You should take it. It's his luggage."

And he says, "You can't bring it in." I said, "But it's his luggage.
You should take it."

And he said, "No, you can't come in."

Q: Well, did you find his answer unresponsive to what you were saying?

A: I was surprised that he wouldn't want the luggage.

Q: Well, did you ever carry it over to him?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you ever tell him you were going to leave it anywhere there?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever ask him to go get Mr. Simpson to come get his luggage?

A: No. Mr. Simpson was handcuffed at this time.

Q: Okay. Did you see him handcuffed, by the way?

MS. LEVINE: The act of being handcuffed or in the handcuffs?

MR. KELLY: The act of being handcuffed.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: How long after you arrived there did you see him in handcuffs?

A: After he arrived there?

Q: How long after he arrived there did you observe him in handcuffs?

A: I don't know. I thought it was pretty quick. I mean, I thought it
was maybe a matter of five or ten minutes, but I can't be sure.

Q: Did you see the handcuffs placed on him?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Were you surprised to see him in handcuffs?

A: Yes.

Q: Where in the yard was he when you saw him in the handcuffs?

A: He was in the front by the doll house.

Q: And that's in the circular area 

A: Yes.

Q:  of the front yard?

Let me finish the question before you answer, Mr. Kardashian. And did
you speak to anybody at that time when you saw him in handcuffs?

A: No.

Q: Did you approach any officer concerning Mr. Simpson when you saw
him in handcuffs?

A: No.

Q: When you had called earlier, you had identified yourself as a
friend and attorney for Mr. Simpson, had you not?

arrived home to see if he needed any help, were you not?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you saw him in handcuffs, you made no efforts to lend
assistance in any way at that time?

A: No. Mr. Weitzman was there at that time, and I knew that he would
be taken care of.

Q: When did Mr. Weitzman arrive?

A: I can't recall if he arrived before Mr. Simpson got home or after.
I think it was after Mr. Simpson got there, but I can't be sure.

subsequent to.

Q: Did you have any conversation with him when he pulled up?

Q: Do you recall how he entered the premises?

A: I believe through the Rockingham gate.

Q: The gate you were waiting by right there?

A: Yes.

Q: And you had no discussions with him?

A: I don't recall having any. I could have, but I just don't recall.

Q: And what happened next?

A: The best of my recollection 

Q: By the way  I'm sorry. Sorry to interrupt you  where was Skip
Taft at this time that Mr. Simpson was in handcuffs?

A: I never saw him again.

Q: Did he ever get out of the car?

A: I believe he got out of the car and walked in, in  on the
property.

Q: Was that prior to you taking the bag from Cathy?

A: No. I would have taken the bag, and then I would have  since Skip
was on the driver's side, by the time he walked in I would have
already had the bag in my hand.

Is that your best recollection as to what Mr. Taft did at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you see him with Mr. Simpson when he had handcuffs on at
any time?

A: I don't recall seeing Skip again until  until later.

A: No.

if he was handcuffed by then or not.

Q: Okay.

A: But that's the only tape I've seen.

Q: What happened next after you saw the handcuffs on Simpson?

A: To the best of my knowledge, he then  they  he walked out of his
property, and they put him in a police car.

Q: Did he still have handcuffs on when he got in the police car?

A: No. They were removed by then.

Q: Who did he walk out of the premises with?

A: Again, this recollection is via videotape, what I've seen
subsequently. I don't recall other than what I've recollected in  by
watching videotape.

Q: Well 

A: So as far as that goes, I saw him with Mr. Weitzman and Detective
Vannatter.

Q: Just the three of them?

A: Yes.

Q: And where  do you recall where you were standing when they came
out of Rockingham at this time?

A: Yes. Yes.

Q: Where were you standing?

A: I was standing in the same position I had been: At the southern
most part of the gate.

Q: Same general area you remained in?

A: Yes. I stayed there the entire time.

Q: Did you say anything to Mr. Simpson as he was leaving the premises?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did he say anything to you?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any discussion with Vannatter?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any discussion with Weitzman?

A: No. Excuse me. Yes, I did.

Q: Would you relate to me what the substance of that conversation was?

A: He said, "We're going down to Parker Center," and he said, "we
should be a few hours."

And I said, "Okay. I'll go to O.J.'s office with Cathy."

Q: And did you remain there while they got in the car?

A: I remained at the position I was standing in, yes.

Q: Were you still in that position when the car with Mr. Simpson in it
left?

A: Yeah, I believe so, yes.

Q: And then what did you do?

A: And then after the car pulled away, everyone started to disperse,
so I picked up the bag and I went to my car with Cathy.

Q: Was there anybody else that arrived during that period of time that
you spoke to prior to picking up the bag and walking away, other than
the people we've mentioned already?

A: I don't believe so. No, I don't believe I spoke with anybody other
than Cathy.

Q: Where did you put that bag in your car?

A: In my trunk.

Q: Did you piece anything else in your trunk other than that one
garment bag?

A: No.

Q: What did you do then after you had that bag in the trunk?

A: I drove Cathy to the office, to O.J.'s office, and we went up to
the office.

Q: Where was the bag at the time you went up to the office?

A: In my trunk.

Q: Okay. Was that car locked?

A: I gave it to the valet.

Q: And how long did you remain in your office for?

MS. LEVINE: Excuse me. That misstates the testimony. You said "your
office."

MR. KELLY: Oh.

Q: How long did you remain in Mr. Simpson's office for?

A: Till about 6:00 o'clock that evening.

Q: What time was it that you arrived there?

A: I would imagine, I don't know for sure, but probably 12:00, 1:00
o'clock, 2:00 o'clock, right in there.

Q: Who, if anybody else, came up to the office during that period of
time you were there?

A: I don't think anybody other than Cathy and I. There were people in
Skip's  no. Just Skip's secretaries, but I don't recall anybody else
going in there.

Q: Did you make any phone calls while you were there?

A: I was basically  To answer your question, yes.

Q: Okay.

A: Yeah.

Q: Could you tell me approximately how many phone calls you made?

A: Four or five.

Q: Do you recall who those phone calls were made to?

A: I do not. I'm sure I would have called Denice. I would have called
my brother, I'm sure. Beyond that, I don't recall.

Q: Do you recall anything of the substance of your conversation with
Denice?

A: No, I do not. It would have been about that I'm at the office and
I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna just be there and help out.

Q: Do you remember having any conversations with anybody regarding Mr.
Simpson being put in handcuffs while you were there at the office?

MS. LEVINE: That day?

MR. KELLY: That day.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall that.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you open any files while you were in Mr. Simpson's office?

A: No.

Q: Did you look at anything on his  or read anything that was on his
desk when you were in Mr. Simpson's office?

A: No. I don't believe there was anything on his desk that day.

Q: Did you look in any of his drawers?

A: No.

Q: Did you look in any file cabinets?

A: No.

Q: Did you remove anything from Mr. Simpson's office 

A: No.

Q:  that day?

A: No.

Q: What did you do from midday till 6:00 p.m. that night in Mr.
Simpson's office other than make four or five phone calls?

A: I was answering the phone mostly. There was a lot of telephone
calls coming in from his friends, and I was answering those phone
calls.

Q: Were you answering the calls that initially rang on the phone line,
or was Cathy?

A: We both were.

Q: Could you tell me who, if anybody, you specifically remember
calling that day who you spoke to?

A: Sure. I remember Marcus Allen calling several times, as I had told
you previously.

Q: Sorry. You didn't tell me several times he had called previously.

A: Oh, I think he called two times or maybe even three.

Q: Do you recall  You related the substance of one conversation you
had with Marcus Allen to me. Do you remember the reason he had called
two or three times?

A: I think that the second time he asked "Well, do you know anything
yet" or "What's going on," that type of inquiry.

Q: And what about the third time he called?

A: I think it would have been the same thing. If he did call three. It
could have been two. It could have been three.

Q: Does Mr. Simpson have a TV in his office?

A: Yes.

Q: Does that have cable?

A: I believe so.

Q: Did you have it on while you were in his office?

A: Yes.

Q: You were watching the news reports the entire time?

A: Yes.

Q: What did you tell Marcus Allen you had learned when he called the
second time?

A: That I don't recall. I don't think I learned anything at that
point.

Q: Did you tell him you had seen Simpson in handcuffs at his own
residence?

A: That I don't recall. I do know I said he's down at  I would  I
can't recall what I said, but I'm sure I would have said he's down at
Parker Center.

Q: Did you say why he was down at Parker Center?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall any reaction to Marcus Allen  of Marcus Allen to
that?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any substantive conversation with Marcus Allen
regarding Mr. Simpson's possible involvement in Nicole's death?

A: No. I think that was the only time I spoke with him on the
telephone, was that first day.

Q: There was no discussion of Mr. Simpson possibly being involved in
any way in Nicole's death?

A: I don't believe I ever had that conversation.

Q: And you had already seen Mr. Simpson in handcuffs at his residence?

A: Yes.

Q: And you knew he had gone down to Parker Center?

A: Yes.

Q: And you knew he was with Howard Weitzman, who you knew was a
criminal lawyer, was he not?

A: Yes.

Q: And Mr. Weitzman had represented Mr. Simpson in '89 when he had
pled guilty to spousal battery, had he not?

A: Incorrect.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: He did not plead guilty.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: He pleaded no contest to spousal battery in 1989?

A: Correct.

Q: Who else did you speak to besides Marcus Allen?

A: That's the only one that comes to mind. There were a hundred calls
or more that day. That's the only one that comes to mind. Oh, excuse
me. I think I spoke to Reggie McKenzie from Seattle.

Q: Do you recall the substance of that conversation?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Do you recall having any discussions with anybody between midday
and 6:00 p.m. in Mr. Simpson's office regarding his possible
involvement in Nicole's death?

A: No.

Q: Not once?

A: No. I'd have to look at phone records or something. I don't really
recall who called.

Q: Did that ever cross your mind, Mr. Kardashian, that Mr. Simpson 
did that ever cross your mind between midday and 6:00 p.m. that day,
that Mr. Simpson was in any way involved in Nicole's death?

A: No, it did not.

Q: Did anybody ever  When did you leave Mr. Simpson's office?

A: About 6:00 or 6:30.

Q: Prior to your leaving there, did you hear or see any news reports
about blood found in Mr. Simpson's driveway?

A: I really don't know. I don't know what was on that day. Everything
was such a blur. I can't say if I learned of blood in the driveway
that day or a subsequent day.

Q: What was the purpose of you having the TV on in Mr. Simpson's
office all day?

A: To find out what happened to Nicole.

Q: And were you paying attention?

A: Somewhat. I was on the phones, but we  you know, we'd be watching
for whatever we could find out. We didn't know what had happened at
that time.

Q: And you have no recollection of any news reports about blood found
in the driveway that day?

MS. LEVINE: I don't think that was his testimony. It was that he
couldn't recall if he learned it that day, not that he had no
recollection of such a news report.

MR. KELLY: What I am asking him, does he have any recollection of
seeing any news reports that day in that time period of blood found in
Mr. Simpson's driveway.

THE WITNESS: No, I don't.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you have any recollection of any news reports that day between
12:00 and 6:00 p.m. of a bloody glove found behind Mr. Simpson's
guesthouse?

A: I recall hearing that. I don't know if it was that day or not, but
I recall hearing about it.

Q: Okay. Do you recall hearing anything on the news reports between
midday and 6:00 p.m. that day of Mr. Simpson's Bronco being towed away
as evidence?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. What do you recall hearing about that?

A: I just remember seeing the shot of them hoisting his Bronco and
towing it away.

Q: Okay. And they had denied you entry to the premises when you
arrived there that day also 

A: Yes.

Q:  did they not?

A: Yes.

Q: And it's still your testimony that as of 6:00 p.m. that day, you
had never considered Mr. Simpson being involved in any way in Nicole's
death?

A: That's correct.

Q: What, if anything, did you do come approximately 6:00 p.m. that
day, June 13th?

A: I drove Mr. Simpson back to his residence.

Q: When did Mr. Simpson arrive at the office?

A: I believe it was about 4:30 or 5:00.

Q: Who did he arrive with?

A: Mr. Weitzman and Mr. Taft.

Q: Did they  had they made any calls to you at the office prior to
their arrival there?

A: I can't be sure. I think they could have called and said, "We're on
our way back," but I don't know for sure.

Q: Were you surprised when Mr. Simpson showed up at the office?

A: No. We were expecting him to come back.

Q: And what, if anything, did you say to Mr. Simpson at that time when
he arrived at the office?

A: I can't recall. Just  we were just watching the news, trying to
find out what happened. I  you know, I'm sure I would have given him
some type of support, but I can't recall what I had said at that time.

Q: Do you have any recollection of why Mr. Simpson might have needed
some support at that time?

A: Oh, he was  yeah. He was in shock. He was distraught. He wasn't 
I could see by his demeanor that he wasn't the type of person that I
knew before.

Q: That you knew before.

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see him cry at all?

MS. LEVINE: Then?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: At that time.

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did he talk about Nicole at all during that time period?

MS. LEVINE: If we could have a moment. There is something that came up
before lunch. I want to make sure who was present, where we're talking
about. If we could go off the record for a minute.

MR. KELLY: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:11.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:14.

MS. LEVINE: Do you want to read back the question?

MR. KELLY: Yes, please.

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. Okay. Did he talk about Nicole at all during that time period?")

THE WITNESS: Yes, he did.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you recall what he said, if anything?

A: Basically, "I can't believe she's gone. Poor Nicole," a couple
statements like that.

Q: To the best of your knowledge, did he call the Browns at any time
while he was there at the office?

A: I don't know.

Q: Do you know whether he called any of Nicole's friends while he was
there at the office?

A: I don't know.

Q: And you don't recall seeing him cry at all during that time at the
office?

A: No.

Q: But he was watching TV?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recall any comments he made as he was watching TV during
that time period?

A: Other than what I said, he would repeat that several times.

Q: Regarding 

A: Nicole.

Q:  Nicole?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he comment as to any of the telecasts being shown on TV?

A: I'm sorry. In what way?

Q: Well, after  say as he would see news report or hear a reporter
comment, did he make any comment about what had just been on the air?

A: I don't recall that.

Q: Do you recall Mr. Simpson saying something to the effect, "I can't
believe they're trying to pin this s--- on me"?

A: I don't recall that, no.

Q: Do you recall him saying anything in words to that effect?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Did he indicate to you at any time that he was viewed as a suspect
by the LAPD for these homicides?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. I think that may call for a privileged
communication at that time.

MR. KELLY: Is it your position that the first time at the office this
 we've already discussed this, as to some of the things Mr. Simpson
said at this point.

MS. LEVINE: That's right, and I believe the conversation breaks down,
and there may have been a point, from what I understand from Mr. Van
Sicklen, and this needs to be ironed out, where this conversation
between  talked about before lunch, Mr. Weitzman is there and Mr.
Taft, where there is some discussions that occur.

I don's think this conversation that we have just talked about Nicole
is privileged, but when you talk about a conversation such as you were
just alluding to it may have come into some privileged information on
communications between Mr.: Simpson and his lawyers that were present.

MR. KELLY: Well, the only way I can imagine we iron that out is to
have the question answered first.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: But the question was, did you ever find out that he
thought he was a suspect.

MR. KELLY: No. Did Mr. Simpson himself indicate to Mr. Kardashian
whether he was viewed as a suspect by the LAPD at that time.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: That day in the office?

MR. KELLY: That day, that time, in the office.

MS. LEVINE: Is that okay.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Sure.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: He never indicated that to you?

A: He never said that to me, no.

Q: Did he indicate to you that he had answered questions posed to him
by the LAPD down at Parker Center?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Well 

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: At that time did he indicate to you?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Without waiving any privilege go ahead.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did he indicate the substance of the questions put to him?

A: No.

Q: Did he indicate the substance of the  of any statements he made to
them?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall any other conversations you had with Mr. Simpson that
day at that time in his office?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Did you see Mr. Simpson make any phone calls?

A: I don't recall. He could have. I just don't recall.

Q: Do you have any recollection of overhearing him talking on the
telephone at all?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Do you recall hearing any conversations between he and Mr.
Weitzman?

MS. LEVINE: That day in that place?

MR. KELLY: All these questions are directed towards that day and that
time.

MS. LEVINE: In the office.

THE WITNESS: You know, he could have. I just don't know. Everybody was
talking, so I don't know  you know, what was going on really.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And you were there with him from approximately 4:30 to 6:00 p.m.?

A: Yes.

Q: And everybody was talking?

A: Or watching television.

Q: And in this whole hour and a half period of time the only thing you
can remember Mr. Simpson saying is, "Poor Nicole, I can't believe
she's gone"?

A: Right.

Q: Can't remember anything else?

A: I'm sure he said a lot more, but I, you know, I don't know. I was
in and out, talking to Cathy, talking to Howard, talking to Skip. We
were watching television.

Q: You had seen Mr. Simpson in handcuffs that day.

A: Yes.

Q: You had seen his Bronco get towed away.

A: Yes.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: We have already established this.

MR. KELLY: I know we have.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Well let's save it for somebody that gets a vote.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: What happened next at 6:00 o'clock?

A: I took him home.

Q: Mr. Simpson.

A: Yes.

Q: In your  in the same car that you had arrived in, you took home?

A: Yes.

Q: You went to Rockingham?

A: Yes.

Q: Who else left with you?

MS. LEVINE: In his car?

MR. KELLY: In his car.

THE WITNESS: It was just Mr. Simpson and myself.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you have any conversation between your office and Rockingham?

A: I'm sure we did. I can't recall what he said, but it was  it was 
I mean, it was just emotions, but I really don't know what we talked
about.

Q: What type of emotions?

A: Just, again, he  Mr. Simpson reiterates things over and over, and
he would talk about Nicole: "I can't believe she's dead."

Q: So it's your testimony all you recall him talking about this entire
day is Nicole.

A: Yeah. I don't know what else he would have talked about. He just 
a lot of the time, believe it or not, was silent. I was only five
minutes from his office to his home.

Q: And with your car, was there a valet person who brought your car up
to you when it was time to go?

A: You know, there usually is. Sometimes we would go get it, but I
believe in this instance the valet brought it up. I can't be sure.

Q: Did you open the trunk when your car was brought up that day?

A: No.

Q: Had you opened your trunk when you first arrived at your office
that day?

A: I'm sorry. In the morning?

Q: No. After you had left Rockingham and went there at midday.

MS. LEVINE: At Mr. Simpson's office?

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: What did you do when you arrived back at Simpson's that evening at
approximately 6:00 p.m.

A: I pulled the car in the driveway and 

Q: Which gate did you pull in?

A: In the Rockingham. And we walked in, and Detective Lange was still
there, and I believe some other LAPD who I don't know were there.

Q: Were there many media people around the house when you arrived
there at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: In general terms, a large number of them?

A: I would say so, yes.

Q: Satellite trucks?

A: I don't  I don't recall if they he was up there. They could have
been.

Q: And  I'm sorry. You pulled the car in the Rockingham gate?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did you do after you stopped the car?

A: We got off and went in the front door.

Q: Did you remove anything from the car when you arrived there?

A: No.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson take anything with him when he left the office that
day?

A: To my recollection, no.

Q: No briefcase?

A: No, I don't believe he had 

Q: No large envelope?

A: I don't think so, no.

Q: Who was at Rockingham when you arrived back there at that time?

A: Well, Detective Lange 

Q: Did you have any conversation with Detective Lange?

MS. LEVINE: At that time?

MR. KELLY: At that time.

THE WITNESS: I don't think I did. No, I don't believe so.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you form an impression as to why he was there at that point?

A: Well, we knew they were searching the house.

Q: Did you know  okay. Did you know that they were executing a search
warrant that day?

A: Yes.

Q: At what time did you find that out?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you know that at any point of time when you were in Mr.
Simpson's office during that afternoon?

A: I'm sure I learned it from the news, watching it on television.

Q: And there was no time during that day while you were in his office
that you considered Mr. Simpson a suspect in the death of Nicole?

A: No.

Q: What did you see Detective Lange doing when you arrive back at
Rockingham?

A: I believe he was up in Mr. Simpson's bedroom, if I'm not mistaken,
and we walked upstairs and he was up there.

Q: Do you recall walking into Mr. Simpson's bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you look around up there?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you make  do you have any independent recollection of what you
observed that day in his bedroom?

A: I remember there was a  I don't know if it was at  I don't know
if it was that day or not. I was going to say I think his black duffel
bag was on the floor in his bedroom, but I could be wrong, but I think
I saw it there that day.

Q: Is that the one he carried in over his shoulder?

A: Yes.

Q: He has a white rug in his room, does he not?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recall seeing any socks on that rug when you walked in there
at that time?

A: No. No.

Q: Was anybody in that bedroom other than you when you walked in there
at that time?

A: I believe there were a few police officers in the bedroom.

Q: Do you know what, if anything, they were doing at that time?

A: When I walked in, everybody was pretty much standing around, I
believe. Just standing. When we walked in, they were standing there.

Q: You didn't see them dusting for fingerprints?

A: At this time, no. I think they were pretty much finished with
everything they were doing.

Q: Was there any conversation in the master bedroom when you walked in
there?

A: Yes.

Q: What, if anything, went on?

A: Well, Mr. Taft and Mr. Weitzman also arrived, and I don't know if
it was right before us or right after us, but they were in the bedroom
also.

And Detective Lange asked Mr. Simpson to show him the shoes he wore
the night before, and Mr. Simpson went in his closet and he pulled out
a pair of shoes and said, "These were the shoes I wore."

And Detective Lange said, "Do you mind if I take these with me" 
actually, Detective Lange looked at the soles, and he made some
comment, "They look pretty clean," or something to that effect, and
then he said, "Do you mind if I take these with me?"

Q: Do you recall specifically what Detective Lange said to Mr. Simpson
about shoes?

A: Just "Show me the shoes you wore last night."

Q: Did he specify at what time the previous night he wanted the shoes
Mr. Simpson had been wearing?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Did he say, "I want the shoes you wore to the recital"?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Do you recall him saying, "Can I see the shoes you were wearing
when you were out chipping golf balls in your front yard?"

A: No, he did not say that.

Q: Did he say, "Could I see the shoes that you wore when you got in
the car to the airport?"

A: No. I think it was pretty general, "May I see the shoes you were
wearing last night?"

Q: Could you describe the shoes you saw Mr. Simpson come out of the
closets with?

A: Yes. They were white Reebok tennis shoes.

Q: What, if anything  Did Mr. Simpson say anything when he handed him
the shoes?

A: I  all I recall is, "Here they are" or "These are the shoes I
wore," or something to that effect.

Q: What, if anything, happened next up there?

A: I think Detective Lange said, "We're done" or... I think he said
'That's it. We'll be out of here in a minute or two," something to
that effect.

Q: Have you ever seen a search warrant?

MS. LEVINE: Except for 

MR. KELLY: Just in general.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: A search warrant.

MR. KELLY: A search warrant.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you see one that day?

A: No.

Q: Are you familiar with the procedure involved upon completion of the
execution of a search warrant?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see any sort of receipt presented to Mr. Simpson or
Mr. Weitzman or Mr. Taft that night upon the conclusion of that
search?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson sign any papers that night?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Weitzman sign any papers that night?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Taft sign any papers that night?

A: No.

Q: Did you see any of the police officers at Rockingham take anything
out of that house other than that pair of shoes?

MS. LEVINE: That night?

MR. KELLY: That night.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you recall Detective Lange asking for the clothes Mr. Simpson
had worn the night before?

A: You know what? I do recall something, but I don't know if I'm
recalling it at that time or whether I learned of it subsequently.

Q: What do you recall, regardless of the time period?

A: If it was at that time, I recall that there was a conversation
about, "What clothes did you wear last night?"

And Mr. Simpson said, "They're in the bathroom lying by the hamper."

Q: Hadn't Mr. Simpson flown to Chicago the night before?

A: Yeah.

Q: And when Mr. Simpson was staying up in that master bedroom at that
time, was he still wearing what he had arrived home from Chicago in?

A: The night of the 13th when I took him back?

Q: Yeah.

A: Yes. Yes.

Q: And as far as you knew, none of his luggage had been unpacked yet,
had it?

A: That's correct.

Q: What was your understanding of what time the night before Mr.
Simpson had worn those clothes that were thrown in the bathroom?

MS. LEVINE: His understanding at that time?

MR. KELLY: Yeah, if he had one.

THE WITNESS: I just  my understanding was, "What clothes did you wear
last night," and that was it, and he had the clothes sitting there in
his bathroom.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: So it was your understanding Mr. Simpson was indicating a pair of
clothes that were not in the luggage that came back from Chicago.

A: That's correct.

Q: And they were not any of clothes that he had on at that time.

A: That's correct.

Q: So would it be fair to say he was indicating some clothes that had
never gone to Chicago?

A: Correct.

Q: And did you see what, if anything, the police did when he indicated
that those were the clothes he had been wearing?

A: I don't believe they did anything. They could have looked at them.
I'm not sure. I know they never took them with them to my knowledge.

Q: Do you recall anybody even walking over to those clothes?

A: No, I don't recall.

Q: Do you recall anybody picking up any of that clothing?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Could you describe the clothing you observed?

A: I thought it was some type of dark pants, and that's all I saw. I
don't know if there was a shirt there or not. I wasn't real close to
them, but I just recall they were some type of dark pant.

Q: And that was in the bathroom?

A: Yes.

Q: Does Mr. Simpson have a Jacuzzi in his bathroom?

A: I think he does. He's got a big tub. I don't know if it's Jacuzzi
or not.

Q: Do you recall where those clothes were relative to the tub?

A: Yes. They were  as you  they were in the corner right across from
the shower. They were on the  I don't know how you describe it. As
you 

Q: As you stand  Strike that. As you stand in the doorway from the
bedroom facing into the bathroom 

A: Yes.

Q:  where would they have been located?

A: Straight ahead and on your left.

Q: Straight ahead and to the left of a particular fixture?

A: Well, straight all the way in to the wall pretty much and on the
left, and I don't know if there's a hamper there or the bathtub. I
know the bathtub's there, and I think they were just laying next to
the bathtub; or it could have been, if there's a hamper right on it,
just right in that area.

Q: Have you seen Chris Darden's book since it came out?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you looked through the photos through that?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever seen a photograph anywhere depicting those clothes as
you described them: To the left of the tub as you look in the bathroom
that night?

MS. LEVINE: If I could have a moment, I think that calls for
information  if you are asking him if he has seen it  problematic 

MR. KELLY: Other than through the course of his own work product.

MS. LEVINE: In the course of representing Mr. Simpson in his 

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

MS. LEVINE: Okay.

THE WITNESS: Sorry. You are going to have to repeat it.

MR. KELLY: If I could remember it, I'd repeat it.

MS. LEVINE: Have it reread.

MR. KELLY: Yes, please.

Actually, could we take a break for a minute? I just want to 

MS. LEVINE: Yeah.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:32.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:51.

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. Have you ever seen a photograph anywhere depicting those clothes
as you described them: To the left of the tub as you look in the
bathroom that night?")

MS. LEVINE: And then we said besides what he learned in his attorney 
client/work product 

MR. KELLY: You can withdraw that part of it if you want.

MS. LEVINE: No, I'm not going to. I'll leave that in.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE WITNESS: Have I ever seen it other than what I learned?

MS. LEVINE: Yes.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: By the way, when you arrived at Rockingham that night from the San
Vicente offices, did you bring that garment bag into the house?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did it remain in your trunk?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you have any discussion with Mr. Simpson concerning that
garment bag when you arrived at Rockingham?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any discussion with Mr. Simpson at any time that day
regarding that garment bag?

A: No, I did not.

Q: After you had heard this discussion regarding the clothes Mr.
Simpson had worn that night, what, if anything, happened next?

A: I believe Detective Lange left and if I'm not 

Q: Did you see Detective Lange walking out with those shoes that he
received from Mr. Simpson?

A: No, I don't know if I saw it as a result of television or if I saw
it at the time. I can't recall.

Q: And it's in  your best recollection is this was approximately 6:00
p.m. 

A: Yes.

Q:  that evening?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see anybody carry anything out of the house other than
those shoes?

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: Did you see any blood on the foyer floor when you entered the
house?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you see any evidence cards on the foyer floor when you entered
the house?

A: I don't recall ever seeing any of those.

Q: You know what I am referring to, though?

A: Yes. I've seen them in pictures subsequent, but I don't think at
that time there were any there.

Q: So to the best of your recollection, even when you arrived at
Rockingham at around midday that day, those evidence cards were not in
the driveway or anywhere to be seen?

A: To the best of my recollection, that's correct.

Q: What happened after Lange left and the other officers?

A: I believe we then went down into the  his television room or
living room  it's not a living room. It's a den, television den  and
there were a few other people there, and we turned on the television
to watch the news.

Q: Did Skip Taft remain in the house when you went back down to that
room?

A: I'm almost sure he did. I believe so.

Q: What about Howard Weitzman?

A: I think Howard left.

Q: Who do you recall being in that room downstairs other than Skip
Taft and yourself?

A: Cathy Randa, Kato, I think Joe Stellini, I think Neal Sloan, and I
don't recall who else. There wasn't too many. Four or five people.

Q: Do you recall any other Simpson family members being there at that
time?

A: At that time... Boy, I don't think they were there at that time.
They could have been. I don't think they were, though.

Q: Do you remember seeing Arnelle there at that time?

A: I don't know. She  I'm sure she was. I don't know. I don't recall
seeing her.

Q: Okay. Do you recall seeing Jason at that time?

A: No.

Q: Do you know Shirley Simpson?

A: Now, yes, I do now.

Q: Do you recall her being there at that time that night?

A: No, not at that time.

Q: What  how long did you remain in that room downstairs?

A: Till about 9:30.

Q: Did anybody else arrive there during that period of time than the
people you first mentioned?

A: Well, I think perhaps the family came later, but again this
knowledge is  I don't think I recalled it at the time. I think it's
just what I've learned since that time.

Q: Did you ever recall  I'm sorry. Strike that.

Do you recall that night at any time observing a cut on Mr. Simpson's
left middle finger?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me the first time your attention was drawn to that
cut on his left middle finger?

A: I don't know if I saw the cut that night or if I first saw it at
his office that afternoon.

Q: Okay. What do you recall seeing with regard to that cut on his left
middle finger?

A: I just recall seeing his knuckle being swollen and this cut down
the middle of his knuckle basically.

Q: Was it notably swollen relative to his other fingers when you
observed it?

A: Yes.

Q: And was the cut clearly visible?

A: Yes.

Q: And in layman's terms, did it appear to be a substantial cut to
you?

A: Yes.

Q: Was it bleeding when you observed it?

A: No.

Q: Did you observe any sort of dressing or wrapping on it at that
time?

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson go to clean that cut that afternoon?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see him go to clean it that night?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see him put any sort of wrapping or dressing on it
that afternoon or that night?

A: No.

Q: Do you remember any conversation you had with Mr. Simpson while
sitting down in his TV room that evening?

A: No. There was just people around, just really everybody was kind of
in shock and just sad and, you know, just commenting about, "How could
this happen?" That type of conversation was what was going on at that
time.

Q: What were they referring to, as you understood it, as to "How could
this happen?"

A: How could Nicole be murdered.

Q: Any discussion regarding Mr. Simpson being handcuffed that day?

A: No. Not that I recall, no.

Q: Any discussion about Mr. Simpson going down to Parker Center that
day?

A: No, he did not talk about it to my knowledge sitting around the
house at that time.

Q: Any discussion about Mr. Simpson's Bronco being towed?

A: No.

Q: Any discussion regarding a glove found behind his guesthouse?

A: I don't recall. There could have been on that, but I don't recall
that.

Q: By the way, didn't there come a time in the early evening on June
13 that you walked around behind the guesthouse?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall anybody walking behind Mr. Simpson's guesthouse on
the evening of June 13, 1994?

A: Not  no, I don't.

Q: Do you recall any conversation you had between 6:00 and 9:30 that
evening with Mr. Simpson in his TV room downstairs?

A: No. As I say, since I had kinda been with him, even though I wasn't
with him, but at the office, these other friends came by and they were
sitting talking, and I was just sitting there basically.

Q: As of, say, 9:00 o'clock that night, you knew the police had
completed executing the search warrant at the house, had you not?

A: Yes, I knew that.

Q: And you still knew they had towed the Bronco?

A: Yes.

Q: You noticed him handcuffed earlier?

A: Yes.

Q: Taken him down to Parker Center?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you have any indication  or in your mind at that time was
Mr. Simpson a suspect in the death of Nicole Simpson?

A: No.

Q: Did you hear  By the way, where was Mr. Simpson sitting in the TV
room that evening?

A: I believe he was sitting on the  either on the couch facing his
television sets, or there's two chairs facing south; he would have
been in the chair closest to the couch.

Q: Is that a recliner, by the way?

A: No.

Q: No? Is there a ottoman that goes with that chair?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall, was Kato in that TV room when you went down there
after the master bedroom that evening?

A: Kato was there sometime. I don't know if he was there when we
walked downstairs. In fact, I'm pretty sure he wasn't because I had
never met Kato before, and the first time I met him was in that room,
and he just kind of stood off to the corner. So I would imagine he
came in while we were sitting there.

Q: Do you recall any conversation between Mr. Simpson and Kato when he
came into the room that evening?

A: No. I was introduced to Kato, and that was  I mean, that was
basically it. I just kinda just walked away and hung out with some of
the other people. So I don't recall anything, no.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson leave the room at any time during that
period that evening in the TV room?

A: I don't recall. He could have. He was pretty weary. He could have.
He could have gone upstairs and come back. I don't recall. But I do
know he left at about 9:30 and went upstairs.

Q: Do you recall any time prior to that when he was at out of the room
at the same time as Kato Kaelin?

A: No. I wasn't really paying much attention to Kato. I didn't really
know who he was.

Q: Did you hear any conversation between 6:00 and 9:30 that evening in
Simpson's TV room as to where he had been the previous evening before
going to Chicago?

A: I heard, and I don't know from whom, some  something about the
recital. I knew nothing about any of this, and I heard them discussing
the recital.

Q: Other than that, any other conversation?

A: No.

Q: You can't recall any of the other conversation you heard for the
three and a half hours that night?

A: I really don't know what I heard. I was very upset and distraught.
I don't  I really don't know what we talked about.

Q: Did you recall any comments made by Mr. Simpson while he was
watching the news?

A: Yeah. I remember him saying again, "How did this happen," and some
reference to Nicole, about "poor Nicole" or something to that effect.

Q: That's the only thing you remember?

A: I really don't remember much.

Q: You don't remember any comments about his car being towed?

A: No. I don't remember anything about his car at all.

Q: Or premises being searched?

A: He talked about the search, just, you know, that they were there
and they're  they searched his house or something, but he didn't go
into any specific about what did they take or any of that.

Q: Mr. Kardashian, did it ever enter your mind at any time during that
evening that Mr. Simpson was being considered even as implicated in
Miss Simpson's murder the night before?

A: No.

Q: Never crossed your mind?

A: It did not.

Q: Okay. What happened at 9:30 that night, if anything, at Rockingham?

A: He said he was tired and wanted to go to bed.

Q: By the way, was Ron Shipp there at all this evening?

MS. LEVINE: That evening?

MR. KELLY: That evening.

THE WITNESS: My recollection is  I don't  I never remembered him
being there, but then I learned later, obviously, from his testimony
that he was there, but I don't really recall Ron Shipp being there.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: At all.

A: No. No.

Q: You indicated earlier that you  there was a very noticeable
swollen knuckle and cut on Mr. Simpson's left middle finger?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever ask him how it happened?

MS. LEVINE: At that evening?

MR. KELLY: That evening.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe I did.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. At what time did you ask him that?

A: Oh, I don't know.

Q: What 

A: Again, I don't recall if it was in his office or at his home, so I
don't know what time that transpired.

Q: Did he bring up the subject of his finger, or did you?

A: I think I did.

Q: What time did you find out, if ever, that day how Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ron Goldman had been killed?

A: We didn't know who Ron Goldman was that first day, I don't believe.

Q: Okay. I didn't ask you that. I said, did there come a point in time
that day you found out how Nicole Brown Simpson and one other person
had been killed the night before?

A: I don't know if it was that day or the next day. I just don't know.

Q: Well, you heard  you had been told that morning Nicole had been
shot, had you not?

A: Yes.

Q: Is it your testimony that there was no time later that day, after
watching TV all afternoon in Mr. Simpson's office and all night in his
TV room in his house, that you never learned that they had died as a
result of knife wounds?

A: I don't know if it was that day. Obviously I learned about it, but
I don't know if it was that day or the next day.

Q: What did Mr. Simpson tell you about the cut on his finger?

A: He said he cut his finger in Chicago.

Q: That's all he said?

A: With a piece of glass.

Q: Did he say how it happened with a piece of glass?

A: No.

Q: Did you ask him how it came to be cut by a piece of glass?

A: I could have. I don't remember if I did or not. I could have. And I
remember he  and again, I don't know if it was at this time or what
I've learned since. That's the problem. I can't  I can't separate
when I learned some of these things, so I don't know if I should say
or not.

Q: You should say anything you can think of saying, Mr. Kardashian.

MS. LEVINE: Without violating Mr. Simpson's privilege.

MR. KELLY: It's all right with me if he violates it.

Q: Did he make any motion with his hand when he was telling you what
happened to it?

A: I don't  I don't recall.

Q: Did he hold it out to you while he was explaining what happened to
it?

A: No, I don't think so.

Q: You said you were surprised when the handcuffs were put on Mr.
Simpson that day at Rockingham?

A: Yes.

Q: Why were you surprised?

A: It  at that point it never entered my mind that he would be a
suspect, that he would be considered in any wrongdoing.

Q: Did it ever enter your mind?

MS. LEVINE: Ever in the history of mankind or ever on that day?

MR. KELLY: Ever in the history of Mr. Kardashian on June 13th or
thereafter.

MS. LEVINE: Well, thereafter, I mean obviously something happened, so
it's clear he's a suspect: He's arrested.

MR. KELLY: According to everybody in the world, he didn't even become
a suspect after he was arrested, according to Mr. Kardashian.

MS. LEVINE: I don't think he was arrested on the 13th.

MR. KELLY: Well, Mr. Kardashian observed handcuffs being put on him,
and it still didn't occur to Mr. Kardashian 

MR.VAN SICKLEN: Why don't we ask him the question rather than just
argue with each other.

MS. LEVINE: Obviously it occurs to him at some point: When he's been
charged with a crime. So if you are asking about the 13th, he already
answered that he didn't think of him as a suspect.

MR. KELLY: You know, Miss Levine, I think a lot of things would have
been obvious, but they apparently weren't obvious to Mr. Kardashian,
and I am just trying to get answers here, so we will keep going

MS. LEVINE: He's answered that question.

MR. KELLY: Excuse me?

MS. LEVINE: He answered that question about the 13th. If you are
asking him at any time after that, he was arrested at a point after
that so...

BY MR. KELLY: Q: How about prior to him being arrested, did it ever
enter your mind that Mr. Simpson was a suspect?

MS. LEVINE: I will object that it calls for privileged information.

MR. KELLY: Are you putting 

Q: Is there any time prior to midday June 14 that in your mind Mr.
Simpson was a suspect in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron
Goldman?

A: Yes.

Q: And at what point was that?

A: When we  I guess Tuesday.

Q: At what point?

A: Tuesday morning sometime, Tuesday before noon.

Q: Okay. And was this at some sort of meeting?

A: Yes.

Q: And who was present at that meeting?

A: Mr. Taft, Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Simpson and myself.

Q: And could you tell me the substance of that  those conversations?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Prior to that meeting Tuesday  Could you tell me what time that
was Tuesday morning that those individuals met?

A: I believe it was 11:00, 12:00 o'clock, something like that.

Q: And how did you get to that meeting?

A: I drove my car.

Q: Where did you drive your car from?

A: Mr. Simpson's.

Q: Prior to that, what time did you leave Rockingham on that Monday
night, the 13th?

A: 9:30.

Q: Did anybody leave with you?

A: I think most of the  of his friends that were there left at that
time, if I'm not mistaken.

Q: Was that after he went upstairs to his room?

A: Yes. I walked upstairs with him, and then I went home.

Q: And you never saw Ron Shipp at the house that night?

A: I'm  you know, from what I've learned since, he was there, but I
just don't remember.

Q: And do you recall observing Mr. Simpson's left middle finger that
evening at all at Rockingham?

A: No. I didn't focus on it, no.

Q: And the only conversation you recall about that finger that day was
when he told you he had cut it?

A: Yes.

Q: And you said that was a result of a question you posed to him?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And why did you ask him what happened to his finger?

A: Well, it was obvious something had happened to his finger, so I
asked him what happened.

Q: Why was it obvious?

A: Because it was swollen, and, you know, if you've seen the picture,
it just didn't look like  I mean, obviously it looked like something
happened to his finger, so I asked him what happened.

Q: And did you actually make any effort to look at it more closely
than make a casual observation of it?

A: No.

Q: Did you observe any other cuts on any other fingers of that left
hand?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Any abrasions?

A: No.

Q: Was Mr. Simpson in any way, in your layman's observations, treating
that hand or finger gingerly with his actions that day?

A: I don't  I don't think so. There was nothing that he did. I don't
believe so.

Q: Did you ever see that cut bleed at all?

A: No, I don't think so.

MR. KELLY: Now, if i can just take a minute.

(Pause in the deposition.)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did  You were present in court when Mr. Cochran gave his opening
statement, weren't you, at the criminal trial?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Do you recall Mr. Cochran saying that Mr. Simpson had cut his hand
prior to leaving for Chicago that evening?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls for work product, things he did 
what's in the record is in the record.

MR. KELLY: Work product, the opening statement that was televised
worldwide?

MS. LEVINE: It may be in the open record, but this is something Mr.
Kardashian did in his activities as a lawyer on behalf of Mr. Simpson.
He was present in court. You are not asking him that to ask him what
Mr. Cochran said. You know what Mr. Cochran said.

MR. KELLY: I certainly do.

MS. LEVINE: You are asking him to go into some other area.

MR. KELLY: I am just asking him for his own reaction, not based on,
you know, any work product. He has already testified as to a
conversation he had with Mr. Simpson and Mr. Simpson's explanation of
the cut.

MS. LEVINE: But his reaction to what happens in court as a lawyer for
Mr. Simpson is completely protected by work product.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Were you surprised at all at the time Mr. Simpson told you how he
cut his finger, as to his explanation?

A: No, I was not.

Q: Did you believe his explanation?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you find it plausible, his explanation?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you find his explanation consistent with the magnitude of the
swelling and cut on the middle finger of that left hand?

A: I really didn't analyze anything other than I always believed what
he said. I just believed him.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever indicate that he had obtained or suffered any
cut prior or in addition to that cut he received in Chicago, as he
told you?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: At any time prior to the morning of June 14, 1994, did Mr. Simpson
indicate to you at any time he had received any cut on his hand prior
to leaving for Chicago the night of June 12, 1994?

A: On any time prior to June 14th?

Q: Yeah.

A: No.

Q: When you went home  First of all, on your way home from Rockingham
the night of June 13. Did you  I just want to break for one minute.

(Pause in the deposition.)

MS. LEVINE: Are we off?

MR. KELLY: Did you just pick up what I...

Can we go off for a minute?

MR. PETROCELLI: I heard what you said, and that's fine.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

MR.VAN SICKLEN: Are you going off the record?

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

MR. KELLY: No, we're not going off the record.

Sorry. Can I hear the last question?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q: When you went home  First of all, on your way home from
Rockingham the night of June 13, did you...")

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you use your car phone on the way home, if you recall?

A: If anything, to call Denice, if I did, and tell her I was on my way
home.

Q: Denice Halicki?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. When you arrived home, was Denice there?

A: Yes.

Q: Was anyone else there?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Prior to leaving the Rockingham residence, did you take
anything out of your car?

A: No.

Q: Was the garment bag still in the trunk of your car from when you
had first put it there the midday of June 13?

A: Yes.

Q: What, if anything, did you do with it at that time?

A: Nothing.

Q: What did you do when you got home?

A: I went in the house and talked to Denice a little while and went to
bed.

Q: Could you tell me what, if anything, you spoke to Denice about?

A: Oh, I don't recall, but it would have been about, you know, the
day's events.

Q: She knew you were with  at Simpson's house and his office  and/or
his office all day, did she not?

A: Well, I don't know if she knew where I was. She knew I was going to
his house during the day, and I could have called her from the office.
I think I said I did, I'm sure, from his office, so she had a general
idea where I was.

Q: Well, did she know you were also at Rockingham that evening?

A: I would have told her that when I got home. Whether she knew
previous and I had told her, I don't  I don't know.

Q: Did she indicate to you she had been watching the news that day?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you  I assume you had some discussion about the day's events
when you got home?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you have any discussions about Nicole at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you tell me the general substance of those conversations you
had about Nicole?

A: The general substance would have been what a tragedy and how
horrible and just how we felt about Nicole.

Q: By the way, at that time had you heard of the name  had you heard
the name Ron Goldman yet?

A: No.

Q: When you arrived home and spoke to Denice, did you have any
discussions regarding Mr. Simpson?

A: Oh, I'm sure we did.

Q: Could you tell me in general what the substance of those
conversations regarding Mr. Simpson was?

A: It would have been his  how shocked he seemed, how depressed he
seemed and his general mental state.

Q: Any discussion about him possibly being a suspect in the murder of
Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Were you and Denice the only two people in the world that night who
didn't suspect Mr. Simpson had anything to do with Nicole and Ron
Goldman's murders?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That's silly.

MR. KELLY: Well, his testimony is silly.

MS. LEVINE: That's an absurd question. How would he know what everyone
else in the world thought?

MR. PETROCELLI: What's your objection?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: The question is argumentative.

MS. LEVINE: Assumes facts not in evidence, no foundation, calls for
speculation.

MR. PETROCELLI: And he can answer subject to those objections?

MS. LEVINE: I don't think he  anybody could answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's 

MR. VAN SICKLEN: That's an argumentative question.

MR. PETROCELLI: But a very good question.

MS. LEVINE: You know 

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Save it, Dan, for somebody that counts.

MR. KELLY: Are you instructing him not to answer that question?

MS. LEVINE: I am instructing him not to answer that question.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Do you recall what time  Did you call anybody, make any phone
calls, after you got home that night?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Do you recall receiving any phone calls that night?

A: That I don't recall either.

Q: Do you recall what time you went to bed that night, approximately?

A: No. I would imagine 10:00, 10:30, right in there.

Q: Do you recall approximately when you got up the next day?

A: Well, I usually get up about 6:00 or 7:00, so I'm sure it would be
about that time.

Q: At that time did you get any papers delivered to your home?

A: My newspaper, yes.

Q: L.A. Times?

A: Yes.

Q: Any other papers?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall reading the paper that morning?

A: I don't recall, but I read it every morning generally, so I'm sure
I did.

Q: Okay. Do you recall flipping on the news that morning also?

A: I'm sure I did.

Q: Do you recall reading anything about Nicole's murder and/or Mr.
Simpson in the papers that morning?

A: I'm sure I did, but I don't know what it said.

Q: Do you have any recollection of reading anything in the L.A. Times
the next morning indicating that Mr. Simpson was a suspect in Nicole's
murder?

A: I don't recall. If it was in there, I would have read it.

MR. KELLY: Can you read the last question back, question please,
David.

(Question read.)

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you recall watching any news shows that morning indicating in
any way that Mr. Simpson was a suspect in Nicole's murder?

A: Yeah, I watched the news shows. I don't know if they said that or
not. That's where I'm having a problem. I mean, if the news said it,
then I saw it.

Q: When do you recall them saying it?

A: No, I don't recall if they said it or not.

Q: In your own mind the next morning at any time prior to leaving your
house, did you suspect Mr. Simpson in any way being involved in the
murder of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A: I started to suspect that he was going to be a suspect at that
time, Tuesday morning.

Q: And what was the basis for that suspicion?

A: I started thinking about some of the phone calls that were received
at Rockingham, about 

Q: Which phone calls were those?

A: From Roger King saying, "You need to get Mr. Shapiro," and I
started to 

Q: By the way, did you know Mr. Shapiro then?

A: No.

Q: Did Simpson know Mr. Shapiro?

A: I don't know.

Q: Was it your impression that Shapiro had asked King to call Mr.
Simpson?

A: No.

Q: Do you know how it came about that Mr. King called?

A: All I know is what I heard.

Q: What did you hear?

A: That Mr. Shapiro was at the House of Blues and he received a phone
call from Mr. King saying that he has to represent Mr. Simpson and
that Mr. King would pay for it.

Q: And when did you hear this?

A: I don't know. Sometime subsequent, from Mr. Shapiro.

Q: But I'm saying: As of the morning of June 14, what had you
overheard the night before regarding Mr. Shapiro and Mr. King?

A: I  Mr. King had called Mr. Simpson's residence five or six times,
and Cathy Randa took the calls, and she kept telling us the substance,
and she never put the call  Mr. Simpson never spoke to him.

Q: What was the substance she kept telling you?

A: "You have to get Robert Shapiro. Here's his number. Call Robert
Shapiro. You need Robert Shapiro."

Q: For what?

A: To represent you in this case.

Q: What case?

A: In a potential murder case, I guess. He just kept saying, "You got
Howard Weitzman. You've gotta get Robert Shapiro."

Q: So as of the evening now of June 13, it was your understanding Mr.
King was calling saying Mr. Shapiro was necessary to represent Mr.
Simpson?

A: Correct.

Q: And can you think of any reason Mr. Simpson needed representation
other than the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and one other person as
of the night of June 13 

A: No.

Q:  1994?

A: No.

Q: So going back now and looking over your testimony, Mr. Kardashian,
would it be fair to say that as of the evening of June 13, 1994,you
considered Mr. Simpson a possible suspect in the murder of Nicole
Brown Simpson?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Did he consider that he was going to be considered a
suspect?

MR. KELLY: No. I am asking him, in his mind did he consider Mr.
Simpson a suspect in those murders.

MS. LEVINE: Do you understand the question?

THE WITNESS: Well, in my mind I did not at that time. I did not.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you think anybody else considered Mr. Simpson a suspect at that
time, the evening of June 13, 1994?

A: Oh, sure. Sure.

Q: Who  What was your  Who did you think suspected him in your mind?

A: Well, obviously the police did; they handcuffed him. But I didn't
in my mind think that Mr. Simpson was a suspect at that time.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson say anything to you to indicate that he himself
thought he was a suspect at that time?

A: No.

Q: Nothing.

A: Nothing.

Q: He didn't indicate any concern in terms of being ever implicated in
the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and one other?

A: No.

Q: Other than the phone calls from Mr. King regarding Mr. Shapiro,
what else had happened the night before that indicated that Mr.
Simpson may be a suspect in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and
someone else?

A: Nothing other than, again, the  and I think maybe it was Tuesday
morning  the news, just repetition on the news, and it seemed to have
escalated from the day before. And I can't tell you what information I
learned from the news, but it seemed to, you know, like a snowball,
starting to escalate, and at that point I started to realize that
perhaps 

Q: As of Tuesday morning, were you aware of the fact that they had
found size 12 bloody footprints at Bundy the night before?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you realize that someone had left drops of blood leading back
on the pathway onto Bundy on June 13, 1994?

MS. LEVINE: Did he realize that 

MR. KELLY: They had been found on June 13.

MS. LEVINE: Did he realize that on June 14 in the morning?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: On June 14 in the morning  First of all, all these questions will
relate to the morning of June 14, okay, prior to leaving the house?

A: Okay.

Q: Had you heard that they had found size 12 bloody footprints leading
away from the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and a young man when they
were found?

MS. LEVINE: Prior to the time he met with Mr. Shapiro and Mr. 

MR. KELLY: Correct. Correct.

MS. LEVINE: That's fine.

MR. KELLY: You know, why don't we stop here, then, before starting
this series of questions. Is there 

Q: Why don't you answer the question first.

A: No.

Q: Had you  Let me just keep going for a second.

Had you heard on the morning of June 14 that there had been drops of
blood found to the left of footprints leading from the murder scene at
875 Bundy?

A: I can't recall if it was that day. I learned it sometime, but I
don't know if it was that morning or not.

Q: Okay. When you heard that there were drops of blood leading from
the murder scene at 875 Bundy, did it ever enter your mind or did you
ever associate that with the cut on Mr. Simpson's middle finger on or
before the morning of June 13, 1994?

MR.VAN SICKLEN: You haven't established that he knew it.

THE WITNESS: I don't think I knew it. I just don't think I knew it at
that time.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Well, before you indicated you were not sure.

A: I'm not sure. I just don't think I knew 

Q: I am asking you now if there ever came a time by the morning of
June 14 you ever made that association?

A: No, I don't believe so.

Q: By the morning of June 14, had you ever given any thoughts of
associating the cut on Mr. Simpson's left middle finger to that murder
scene at 875 South Bundy?

A: No, I don't think so, not on that morning.

Q: As of the morning of June 14, had you heard that they had found a
bloody glove behind the guesthouse at Mr. Simpson's house?

A: I think I heard that before the 14th.

MR. PETROCELLI: You have to change tape.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 2. The time is
approximately 3:27, and we are off the record.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is approximately
3:37. This is the beginning of tape No. 3.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, what, if anything, did you do Tuesday morning, June
14, after you had breakfast and read the papers and watched a little
bit of the news?

Did you make any phone calls that morning?

A: I'm sure I did make some business phone calls. I can't  I don't
recall, other than I neglected my business the day before, so I'm sure
I made some New York business calls.

Q: Did you call Mr. Simpson at all that morning?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson call you at all that morning?

A: No.

Q: Prior to you leaving Rockingham the night before, had you made any
arrangements to pick him up the following day?

A: I don't believe so. I may have said, "I'll see you tomorrow," or
something, but I don't think we had any formal arrangements.

Q: As of Tuesday morning June 14th, was that Louis Vuitton garment bag
still in the trunk of your car?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: You had not taken it out when you got home the night before?

A: No, I did not.

Q: And you had not taken it out the next morning?

A: That's correct.

still in there?

A: Well, I took a different car to the Simpson residence Tuesday
morning.

Q: Prior to leaving Tuesday morning for the Simpson residence, had you
checked the trunk at all either that morning or the previous evening
to see if that garment bag was still in there?

A: No. I totally forgot it was there.

Q: What car was that you had that the garment bag was in?

A: My Mercedes-Benz.

A: I trade off, but basically that's the one I use a lot.

Q: Is that a leased car?

A: No.

Q: Owned?

A: Yes.

Q: Is it owned in a business name or you personally?

A: Personally.

Q: What car did you take to Rockingham Tuesday morning?

A: The Rolls-Royce.

Q: Is there a car phone in that car?

A: No, there is not.

Q: Did you have a cellular phone with you?

A: I  that's why I'm hesitating. I can't recall if I did or not in
the Rolls.

Q: You did own a cellular phone at that time, didn't you?

A: Yes. I can't recall if I brought it with me.

Q: Is there any particular reason you had not taken the garment bag
into Rockingham when you arrived there the night before in your car?

A: I just totally forgot about it.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson totally forget about it?

A: We never discussed it.

Q: He never asked for it?

A: No.

Q: What time did you leave your residence for the Simpson residence
Tuesday morning?

A: I think it was about 10:00 o'clock.

Q: Okay. And you had not spoken to Mr. Simpson prior to that time?

A: That's correct.

Q: He never called you?

A: No.

Q: You never called him?

A: No.

Q: You never stopped to call him on the way up?

A: No.

Q: You never had any way of calling him from the car as you headed up
there?

A: If I had my car phone, I could have, but I just didn't call.

Q: How far a drive is it from your residence to the Rockingham
residence?

A: About 10 minutes.

Q: And did you go to the Rockingham residence that morning?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: Did you go to  did you park your car anywhere there?

A: Yes. I parked my car  I always come up Ashford, and I pulled my
car in the Ashford gate into his driveway.

Q: And what, if anything, did you do when you arrived there?

A: I  well, if I may back up 

Q: Yes, please do back up. Go ahead.

A: The  when I pulled the Rolls Royce out of my garage, I realized
that the garment bag was not with me, so either I or Denice opened the
trunk to the Mercedes; we took the garment bag out and put it in the
Rolls Royce.

Q: You don't remember who specifically did that?

A: No.

Q: Was Denice with you when you were driving up to Rockingham?

A: No, she was not.

Q: Had she walked you to the car as you were leaving that morning?

A: Yes.

Q: Were there any other bags in your trunk when you opened it to
remove the garment bag?

A: No. In fact, I believe I put the garment bag in the back seat and
not in the trunk of the Rolls-Royce.

Q: Was there any time that you opened that garment bag from the time
you took it from Cathy Randa to the time you put it in the back seat
of your Rolls Royce?

A: I'm sorry. I never opened the garment bag.

Q: I am asking you if you did or not.

A. Oh, no, I never did.

Q: Okay. Ever?

A. Ever.

Q: You were telling me what happened once you had arrived at
Rockingham.

A: When I arrived at Rockingham, I got out of the Rolls; I took the
garment bag inside and went up. He was in his bedroom. Went upstairs
in his bedroom.

Q: And you carried the garment bag out of the Rolls up to his bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Was anybody else up in his bedroom?

A: Yeah. I believe Shirley and Benny were up there, and I 

Q: Who let you in the house?

A: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

Q: Do you recall, did you let yourself in?

A: I could have. A lot of times he leaves the doors open, so I could
have just walked in or  I really don't recall.

Q: Was he still asleep when you went up to his bedroom?

A: No.

Q: Was he still in bed?

A: I believe he was lying in bed, but he was definitely not asleep. I
can't recall. I think he was lying in bed.

Q: Did he have the TV on?

A: I don't know. I would imagine so, but I don't know.

Q: Do you recall the news being on when you walked into his bedroom?

A: I really don't know.

Q: What  for what purpose did you go to Rockingham that morning?

A: I went really to help him out or just to do whatever, you know, he
wanted to do that day. I was really there just to support him.

Q: Okay. He didn't ask you to come up there.

A: No, he did not.

Q: He didn't ask you to bring the garment bag back.

A: No.

Q: You didn't go up there just to take the garment bag there.

A: No.

Q: What did you do with the garment bag after you took it up into his
bedroom?

A: I brought it to him in his bedroom and I set it on the floor, and
then I said, "You know, you can't stay here. There's all this press
outside. You  this is a zoo around here. You can't get any privacy.
Why don't you come and stay at my house for a couple days, and then
you could come back. It will all blow over by then, and you could
return."

Q: What did he say?

A: He said, "That's a good idea."

Q: Was there a lot of media outside both 

A: Yeah.

Q:  the Rockingham gates at that point?

A: At that point there was a lot of satellite trucks and cameras, and
there was  there was a lot then.

Q: And what happened next?

A: He said, Well, I'll put a few things in my bag, and we'll go.

Q: Did you still see that  or did you see that black duffle bag in
the morning at any time?

A: I think so. I think it was still on the floor as you walk into his
bedroom.

Q: And what  did you see what he put some clothes into?

A: I... I did not. I was talking to Benny or Shirley, or somebody was
in the bedroom; I think it was Benny, and 

Q: Do you recall what you were talking to him about?

A: I remember talking to Benny about the sink, underneath the sink in
his bathroom, how the pipe was taken off by the police.

Q: Did you have any understanding as to why that pipe had been taken
off?

MS. LEVINE: At that time?

MR. KELLY: At that time.

THE WITNESS: Yeah. We knew they had searched the house, and we figured
they were looking for evidence.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Do you know what type of evidence they might have been looking for
at that time when you knew that pipe had been removed out of the sink?

A: I'm sure they were  I mean, I didn't know for sure. I knew what I
would think, but I didn't know what they 

Q: That's what I am asking you: What you thought at that time they
were looking for.

A: I would I think they were looking for either hair evidence or blood
evidence.

Q: Okay. And at that time did you in any way associate the cut on Mr.
Simpson's middle finger with the search for any blood evidence?

A: I  I  I didn't really think about that, but I just knew that 
figured that if they're going to take the drain out or the pipe,
they're gonna  that's what they'd be looking for.

Q: The next morning did you look in the bathroom where they had
removed the pipe?

MS. LEVINE: The next morning or that morning?

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: The next morning, did you actually observe the pipe they had
removed?

A: Yes.

Q: When you went into that bathroom. do you recall seeing that dark
outfit the bathroom still?

MR.VAN SICKLEN: I think he said dark trousers.

MR. KELLY: Dark trousers.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall. I don't recall.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did Benny indicate to you why he thought they had remove the pipe
from the sink?

A: No.

Q: What happened next?

A: O.J. asked if Benny could fix it, because I recall he turned on the
sink to either wash up or shave or whatever and water was dripping on
the floor. So we opened the cabinets, and we saw the pipe was there.
It wasn't taken away. It was there, But it wasn't reconnected. So
that's when Benny and I went in there, and O.J. went somewhere else to
wash up, I guess, and he just asked if Benny could fix it.

Q: How long was Mr. Simpson gone before he came back in the room?

A: Well, he was doing  I mean, he went to wash up; he went to put a
few things in his bag, so we were  like if you've seen his bedroom,
we were all kind of mingled around from one bathroom to the other. The
time that I didn't see him maybe was five, ten minutes, something like
that.

Q: Was it your understanding the time you didn't see him he had
showered and changed and come back in?

A: No, he had not showered at this time. He was just washing up, and
then I believe at that time he had also put some underwear or whatever
he put in his bag to take to my house.

Q: What bag did he pack to take to your house?

A: The  I don't know if he packed the Louis Vuitton bag. I  it was
there, and I think he put some things in there, and the black duffel
bag. Those were the two.

Q: The same two bags?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever see him open that Louis Vuitton bag?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you ever see him touch that bag?

A: Yes.

Q: In that room?

A: Yes.

Q: In what manner did he touch it?

A: Well, he picked it up, and what he did  I mean, I just assumed he
was gonna take whatever was in it out age and put in other stuff or
just put stuff in. I never saw what he did with it. He just picked it
up.

Q: Well, did you remain  Did he pick  You had put it on the floor of
the master bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: And were you in the master bedroom when he picked it up?

A: No. I was in the bathroom looking towards the bedroom, and I saw
him pick it up, and then Benny said something, and I turned back to
Benny.

Q: Was it your understanding that Mr. Simpson had left the master
bedroom with that bag?

A: No. No. If anything, he would have gone in his closet or just left
it there. I don't know what he did with it.

Q: You don't know whether he did anything with it other than 

A: No. He could have done nothing with it. I don't know. Could have
just moved it.

Q: Okay. Did  You've seen the videos of that bag when you took it
from Cathy Randa that day. Correct.

A: Yes.

Q: Would it be fair to say that it was packed and bulging that day?

A: It was  it looked to be about the same. Yes, there was obviously
things in it. I carried it to the car, so I know it was  there was
stuff in it.

Q: Okay. Did it have the same feel to it or same  Strike that. The
next time you saw it after Mr. Simpson had picked it up, did it have
the same general appearance?

A: Yes.

Q: Same bulk?

A: Yes.

Q: And you have no idea whether he had even removed anything from it
or not at that time?

A: No, I do not.

Q: And that's the bag  that bag went back to your place at Rockingham
that day.

A: No. It went back to my place, yes.

Q: I'm sorry. Okay.

A: Yes.

Q: And what bags did Mr. Simpson walk out of his bedroom with that
morning of June 14?

A: He walked out with the black duffel bag.

Q: Is that the only bag he was carrying?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever see him open that bag?

A: It was open on the floor.

Q: Did you see him put anything in it?

A: Boy, I don't know. Not that I can recall, no. I'm sure he did, but
I don't specifically remember.

Q: Was it open when you walked in there that morning?

A: Yes.

Q: Were any other bags removed from his bedroom that morning?

A: No.

Q: What about the Louis Vuitton bag?

A: I mean, the Louis Vuitton bag and the duffel bag, those two.

Q: Okay. Who carried the Louis Vuitton bag out?

A: I did.

Q: What happened after you walked out of the bedroom? Where did you
go?

A: I put the Louis Vuitton bag in my car.

Q: What part of your car?

A: I can't remember if it was in the back seat or the trunk. I don't
know for sure. I don't know. Probably the trunk, but I can't recall.

Q: And what about the black duffel bag?

A: He had that with him.

Q: Did he place that in your car?

A: Not at that time. He went out a different way because the media was
there, and so he went out a back way.

Q: With the duffel bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he give you any bags other than the Louis Vuitton bag to put in
your car?

A: No.

Q: Did you see anybody in the house after you had exited the master
bedroom and gone downstairs?

A: Oh, I could have seen Shirley and Benny whoever was there, but I
just walked outside and put the bag in my car and pulled out the
driveway.

Q: Were you able to observe members of the media from the front door
area of Mr. Simpson's house at that time?

A: Yeah, you  there was a wall, but you could see their heads or you
could see the trucks and the dishes and all that stuff, yes.

Q: And could you tell me the specific conversation you had with Mr.
Simpson prior to leaving his house that morning?

A: Yes. I said, "Why don't you meet me. Go through Eric Watts' house,"
who was the back neighbor, "and meet me on the street. The press
doesn't know who I am, and this way they won't follow me. And once
leave and, you know, they wouldn't follow me, and I'll pick you up on
the corner and we'll go to your office."

Q: That was your suggestion.

A: Yes.

Q: And what did he say?

A: "Fine."

Q: Had you ever gone through Simpson's and Watts' property that way
before?

A: Yes.

Q: On more than one occasion?

A: Maybe once or twice.

Q: Do you remember why you would have occasion to enter or exit the
premises that way?

A: It was  I didn't  I never entered or exited that way. I went 
would go through to go to the Watts' house and then come back, but I
never would park in front of the Watts' house and come back and forth
that way. It was just a known thorough fare basically for O.J. and his
friends to go to Eric back and forth that way.

Q: And would it be fair to say that it was, in general terms, a
relative mob scene out from of Rockingham at that time?

A: No question. Yes.

Q: And Mr. Simpson was able to avoid all detection from that mob of
media out there by taking that back exit through Watts?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you pick him up in front of Watts' house then?

A: Yes.

Q: And is that on Bristol?

A: On Bristol, yes.

Q: And what, if anything, did he say, to you when he got in the car?

A: We were just smiling that no media followed us and just that it was
 you know, we were able to pull this off without any media seeing us.

Q: Did he seem satisfied with himself in being able to do that?

A: I guess.

Q: And what, if anything  Did you have any further conversation in
the car at that time?

A: No. It was just, "Let's go to the office."

Q: Okay. And did you?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you meet anybody there?

A: Mr. Taft.

Q: And did you have any conversation with him at that time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. With whom?

MR. KELLY: Mr. Taft.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And what was the substance of that conversation?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: I am going to leave it up to the witness. If he feels
that it involved something of a legal nature, then I think he should
invoke the privilege.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Taft wasn't your attorney, were you  was he?

A: Was Mr. Taft my attorney?

Q: Your attorney.

A: No.

Q: Were you an attorney for Mr. Taft?

A: No.

Q: Had you been retained by Mr. Simpson for any reason at this point?

A: No.

Q: Could you tell me what the substance of the conversation you had
with Mr. Taft at that time at the office was?

A: Sure.

Q: Okay.

A: Let's call Robert Shapiro.

Q: Short conversation?

A: Pretty much. I mean, that was the essence of it. All I know is we
picked up the phone and called Shapiro.

Q: Did you have any other conversation with Simpson on the way to the
office at that time?

A: No.

Q: None.

A: Well, we could have  I'm sure we would have discussed, since it
was calling Shapiro when we get to the office, we'll call Shapiro.

Q: And that was it.

A: Yeah.

Q: And did you call him when you got to the office?

A: Yes.

Q: Did Mr. Shapiro come right over?

A: Yes.

Q: Within how many minutes?

A: 15 to 30 minutes.

Q: Did you have any conversation with Mr. Shapiro when he first
arrived?

MS. LEVINE: Can I have a minute? Can we go off the record?

MR. KELLY: Sure.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 3:58.

(Discussion held between the Witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 4:01.

MS. LEVINE: Can you reread the question?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Shapiro when he first
arrived?")

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And what was the substance of that conversation?

A: It was just an introductory. I had never met him before. It was
just introducing myself to him, and Taft had never met him either, and
I think Simpson had met him once or twice somewhere else. I really
don't know.

Q: And did  was there a meeting subsequent to that initial
introduction?

A: Yes, there was.

Q: And were you present during that?

A: No.

Q: At the time of the introduction, did you then leave?

A: I left the meeting.

Q: Did you leave Mr. Simpson's office?

A: No. The meeting was in Mr. Taft's office. They have adjoining
doors, and I went into Mr. Simpson's office, and I made my business
calls at his desk.

Q: And who remained in the office besides Simpson and Shapiro?

A: Mr. Taft.

Q: And you weren't present for any of those discussions?

A: That's correct.

Q: And when they were done meeting, did you have any further
conversations , with Mr. Shapiro?

A: Yes.

Q: And what was the substance of that conversation?

A: Mr.: Shapiro said to me,  I need your involvement. I need your
help. You know a lot of things that would take me a lot of time to get
up to speed on, and I need you to reactivate your license and help me
with this case.

Q: When had you told him that you did not have an active license?

A: In the  I think when I met him. I just said, "I'm one of the
attorneys" or an attorney. However, I'm inactive. I'm doing my own
businesses right now. And that's when he learned of it, because he
didn't know who I was.

Q: Did  I realize that. Did  was Mr. Simpson present with you when
you had this conversation with Mr. Shapiro afterwards about
reactivating your license?

A: I don't know. I believe it was just Bob and I. I think Skip and
O.J. were in Skip's office, if I'm not mistaken, but I can't be sure.

Q: How long were they in there, by the way?

MS. LEVINE: "They" being the three as opposed to the two?

MR. KELLY: Shapiro, Taft and Simpson.

THE WITNESS: I would say about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And what happened next after you had this conversation with Shapiro
about reactivating your license?

A: Mr. Shapiro left, and we had telephoned A.C.  I believe O.J. did.
I don't think I did. I think he did 

Q: Could you speak up a little, Mr. Kardashian? It's hard it to hear
you.

A: I'm sorry. Mr. Simpson telephoned Mr. Cowlings and  'cause Mr.
Cowlings was to bring his children to my house, and he asked Mr.
Cowlings, you know, when would he be up to my house, and Mr. Cowlings
had indicated he hadn't left yet, but he would be there in about an
hour, hour and a half, something to that effect.

Q: Okay. And after that phone call was made, what happened, after
that?

A: Mr. Simpson  either he or Mr. Taft called Hertz to find out about
his golf clubs. I believe Mr. Simpson did, and got the individual,
whose name I don't know, on the phone and asked him about here his
golf clubs were.

Q: Did you see Mr. Simpson writing things down as he made that phone
call?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Do you recall anything else Mr. Simpson said while he was on the
phone?

A: No. No.

Q: Did he make any other phone calls after that?

MS. LEVINE: In that time period?

MR. KELLY: In that time period.

THE WITNESS: I don't think so.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: What happened next?

A: O.J. asked me if I would drive him to the airport to get his golf
clubs and 

Q: And what did you say?

A: And I said "Sure." He said, you know  so we drove to 

Q: Okay. Okay. Anything else before you left the office?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Did you say anything to Skip Taft when you were leaving?

A: I'm sure  I don't recall, but I would imagine we told Skip where
we were going, and then we would be at my house after that.

Q: Where did you tell Skip Taft you were going?

A: To the airport to get O.J.'s golf clubs.

Q: Did you hear Simpson say anything to Taft?

A: I  again, I'm sure Simpson is the one who said it to him and not
me, I would imagine, but I don't know for sure.

Q: Did Skip Taft display any reaction to the statement that you were
going to the airport to get the golf clubs?

A: Not that I recall, no.

Q: Okay. What happened next?

A: We went to American Airlines. I think it was American 

Q: You drove the Rolls-Royce?

A: Yes, drove the Rolls-Royce.

Q: You and Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Any conversation with Mr. Simpson on the way to the airport?

MS. LEVINE: Object. He can answer if there was a conversation, but at
this point he has been asked to be part of the representation team,
and the contents of conversation I think is privileged at this point.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why? Why is it privileged?

MS. LEVINE: Under an attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: Doesn't it depend on what they're talking about?

MS. LEVINE: Sure, it does depend on what they're talking about. If
they're talking about the weather, obviously it's not privileged,
but...

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Mr. Kardashian 

Same caveat: That I'm not pursuing that does not mean that I agree
with your position.

MS. LEVINE: Sure.

MR. KELLY: Okay, we'll take it up later.

MS. LEVINE: That's fine.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you have any conversation on the way to the airport?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you refute to me any of the substance of that conversation
you had on the way to the airport?

A: I really don't remember much of the conversation.

Q: Do you recall any part of the conversation being about Mr. Simpson
playing golf?

A: No.

Q: Do you remember any part of the conversation being why Mr. Simpson
needed his golf clubs?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall any part of the conversation being that Mr. Simpson
had golf plans the next few days?

A: No.

Q: Any  do you recall any part of the conversation being about
Nicole?

MS. LEVINE: About the call?

MR. KELLY: No. Nicole.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Nicole.

MS. LEVINE: I'm sorry.

THE WITNESS: I just don't remember. I could answer it. I don't recall.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: No recollection as to the substance of the conversation?

A: I don't know what we talked about.

Q: How long of a drive is it from Rockingham to the airport?

A: Well, we were at Skip's office.

Q: Yeah.

A: So 

Q: How long a drive was it that morning when you went to the airport?

A: About 20 minutes.

Q: And you have no recollection of any of the conversation?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Could you describe Mr. Simpson's general demeanor during that drive
to the airport?

A: He was very  I just took it that he was pretty much in shock the
whole week. He wasn't the way he was previously.

Q: I am asking: Specifically on that drive to the airport, could you
describe his demeanor to me?

A: He was pensive. It was quiet. Which is unlike him.

Q: Do you recall him even speaking at all on the way 

A: I 

Q: Let me finish the question.

A: I'm sorry.

Q: Do you recall Mr. Simpson even speaking at all from the time you
left the office till the time you arrived at the airport?

A: I don't know.

Q: And did you go to arrivals or departures of American Airlines?

A: Down below. I can't recall if it  it would be arrivals, I believe,
is down below.

Q: What, if anything, happened next?

A: We got out of the car 

Q: Both of you?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you park curbside?

A: Yes.

Q: In the no parking zone?

A: Yes. And we went to the baggage  there's a baggage claim window
for luggage that's been left there. I don't know what it's called. And
we went to that window and asked 

Q: You say "we." Did you or did Mr. Simpson?

A: I believe  I believe he did. I believe he did.

Q: Have you ever had a car towed before, Mr. Kardashian?

A: Yes.

Q: Ever have it towed at the airport?

A: No.

Q: Where did you have it towed from?

A: It's been years. On the street. I was parked illegally.

Q: Okay. Did you have any concern about parking curbside at American
Airlines that morning 

A: No.

Q:  in your Rolls?

A: There was nobody around that morning. No.

Q: Empty out there?

A: Very.

Q: What happened next after you went to the window?

A: He asked where his golf clubs were or where the luggage would be
from a certain flight number, and I remember the lady told us where it
was, which was  I don't recall, but it was the next carrousel over,
the next section over, something like that, then we turned and we
walked over there.

Q: And did you observe Mr. Simpson's golf clubs somewhere?

A: Yes.

Q: And where were they?

A: They were  actually, an attendant was there and, if I'm not
mistaken, he picked them up and Mr. Simpson then took them, and we put
them in the trunk of my Rolls Royce.

Q: Did the attendant just pick them up and hand them to Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Did the attendant carry them any distance at all, or did he just
turn around and hand them directly to Mr. Simpson?

A: My recollection is he just handed them to him.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson submit any claim check or sort of ticket to the
attendant before taking the clubs?

A: No.

Q: Could you describe what the golf bag looked like at that point?
Strike that question. You play golf, don't you?

A: Yes.

Q. Do you know what a travel bag is for a golf bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Was it in a travel bag for a golf bag at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recall what color that was?

A: Black.

Q: Do you recall any insignias or anything on it?

A: Yes.

Q: And what was that?

A: Swiss Army Knife. I believe it was red.

Q: And do you recall  do you know whether it had a shoulder strap on
that bag also?

A: I don't believe so. I think it had carrying straps, two hand straps
(Indicating).

Q: And is that how Mr. Simpson carried it out of the airport?

A: I don't know if he did it that way or just (Indicating) bear-hugged
it and carried it. I can't recall.

Q: Where did he place it in your car?

A: In my trunk.

Q: And what happened next?

A: We drove to my house.

Q: Directly?

A: Directly, yes.

Q: Had you done any other driving with Mr. Simpson that morning other
than from Rockingham to the San Vicente office and then San Vicente to
the airport?

A: I don't believe so. No, I don't think so.

Q: Any discussion of going anywhere other than to the office and then
to the airport?

A: I don't think so. I think he just said, "Let's go get my golf
clubs."

Q: And after he put them in the trunk, did you have any conversation
with Mr. Simpson heading to your residence?

MR. VAN SICKEN: Non-privileged.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Non-privileged. Or privileged.

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Non-privileged.

THE. WITNESS: I don't recall.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: You don't recall any conversation whatsoever?

A: I'm sure there was conversation, but I don't know what it was
about.

Q: Okay. And what happened after you arrived at your residence?

MS. LEVINE: Can we have a minute?

MR. KELLY: Yeah. Then can we just go till like a quarter of 5:00? I
just want to finish this last stuff, and then we'll 

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 4:14.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 4:16.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Just to be clear, Mr. Kardashian, I had asked you about any
conversation between you and Mr. Simpson after leaving the airport,
going back to your residence. Do you recall having any conversation
whatsoever?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Any conversation.

A: Right. I'm sure we conversed, but I don't recall the subject matter
at all.

do then?

children.

Q: When you first arrived there, were any bags taken out of the car?

A: Yes. Yes, they were.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson take any bags out of the car?

A: I don't know. He could have carried the black duffel bag, but I
don't know.

Q: Do you  did you remove any bags from the car?

A: I don't  I don't recall.

Q: When was the next time after arriving at your residence that you
saw that Louis Vuitton bag that you had put in the trunk of your car?

staying in.

a couch that's in that room.

Q: Was it open when you observed it?

A: Yes.

Q: And when was the next time you saw the black duffel bag?

A: I saw that in that room also. Probably that night.

Q: He had carried that bag up there, that you observed?

A: I don't  I really don't know if he did.

Q: And you indicated that you saw a black silk garment bag in that
room also?

A: That was not that day. That was another day.

Q: After this?

A: Yes.

Q: You never saw that bag at all on the 14th, the black silk garment
bag?

A: That's correct.

Q: And what about the little bag, one or two feet by one or two feet
with the loop handles, did you see that bag at all on the 14th?

A: I don't recall seeing that on the 14th. I could have, but I don't
recall seeing it.

you pulled into your residence on June 14?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: I saw it every day.

Q: Well did you remove it 

A: I saw it the next day.

Q: Did you take it out of your trunk that day when you arrived there?

A: Either I  I think I did. Either I did or my housekeeper did, one
of the two.

Q: And do you know where that golf bag was placed?

A: Yes. It was placed in my garage.

Q: Do you recall placing it in there yourself?

A: I don't recall, but my pattern is I would have probably placed it
there myself.

Q: Did you leave it in that travel bag it was in?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever open that travel bag?

A: That day?

Q: First of all, that day.

A: No.

Q: Did you open it in any of the days following that?

A: Yes.

Q: What day?

A: Oh, I don't know. It would have been maybe a week  after he was
arrested. I don't know when, but after his arrest.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson touch that golf bag after you arrived
at your residence that day?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: I don't know. It was either  I think it was Wednesday evening.

Q: What, if anything, did you observe him do with the golf bag?

A: I saw him take a golf club out.

Q: Was the travel bag still on the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: You saw him open the travel bag 

A: Yes.

Q:  correct? Did you see him lift the golf bag out of the travel bag?

A: No.

Q: Just peeled the travel bag down?

A: Yes.

Q: And removed one club.

A: Yes.

Q: Do you know which club he removed?

bag in the garage?

A: He said, ''I'm gonna go for a walk."

Q: And did he ask you to go with him?

A: No.

Q: Did he ask you to follow him to the garage?

A: No.

Q: Was there any reason you were walking with him to the garage?

A: Yes.

Q: What was that?

A: I said, "I'm not leaving you alone. I'm going with you."

Q: Had you not left him alone at all for those last days at your
house?

A: He was not alone other than when he was in his bed.

Q: Why was that?

A: I  He seemed very depressed, very  he wasn't like the man knew.

Q: Did he talk about Nicole at all?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That can call for privileged informational this
point.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you see him cry at all at anytime after he had arrived at your
residence the morning of the 14th?

MS. LEVINE: Till?

MR. KELLY: Till 

MS. LEVINE: Let's say Friday?

MR. KELLY: Say Friday.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: And when was that?

A: I believe it was Friday.

Q: And where was he when you saw him cry?

MS. LEVINE: The further we get into it, the more we get into
privileged information, and so when we take these jumps, it's harder
for me to keep up with you.

MR. KELLY: We haven't taken any jump. I am asking about one
observation that has nothing to do with conversations or
communications. I am asking him where he was on Friday, the 17th, when
he saw him cry.

MS. LEVINE: Certainly, but you and I have all had clients at our
offices or otherwise that have cried in response to certain comments
and communications, and we need to make sure, because crying can be,
as you put it in context, it can be a communicative action, so we need
to make sure. And I know you're  I am cognizant of your time problem,
but I need to make sure what we're talking about before we get there.

MR. KELLY: I just asked where was 

MS. LEVINE: I know 

MR. KELLY:  Mr. Simpson when he observed him.

MS. LEVINE:  and that's what I need to find out. Excuse me for a
minute.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 4:25.

(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing
of the reporter.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 4:26.

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls for privileged information,
attorney-client and attorney work product.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q: Did  you had testified a little bit ago that you saw that Louis
Vuitton bag opened flat and unzipped on a couch in Mr. Simpson's
bedroom?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did there come a time again that you saw that bag?

A: Every time I'd go in his room, I would see it.

Q: After June 17th, 1994, did you see it any time after that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And where was it?

A: In the same spot.

Q: And where was that same spot?

A: On the couch in my daughter's bedroom.

Q: And how long did it remain there for?

A: Well, I kept expecting the police to come and take it, and they
never did. I left it there for about a month maybe.

Q: Did you ever call the police and tell them that it was there?

A: No. The police searched my house on the 17th. They saw it.

Q: Did they say anything to you about it?

A: No, sir.

Q: Why would you expect them to come back and get it?

A: He was arrested. I figured they'd want all of his clothes, all of
his golf clubs. I figured they'd want everything. They never came
again.

Q: Any particular reason you think they'd want his clothes?

A: I just figured if they're gonna arrest him, whatever he had, if he
left, that they would want to see them.

Q: And what happened with that bag after approximately a month or so?

A: Cathy Randa came and picked it up and took it back to Rockingham, I
guess.

Q: Were there any clothes sitting in it still when you saw it laying
on the couch for that month?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever look inside that bag?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever touch that bag?

A: No, I don't think I ever touched it.

Q: It was Cathy Randa who came, and did you see her pick it up?

A: No. I was in court. I just had told Cathy, you know, "His bag is
here. Nobody has come to claim it, so why don't you take it out of
here."

Q: And was that the last time  or at some point that you had seen it
on the couch in your daughter's room, was that the last time you saw
it?

A: Until I  until we brought it into court.

Q: Well, did you see it recovered at Mr. Simpson's house?

A: I was the one who recovered it with the referee.

Q: Did you know where to look for it?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Okay. Where did you locate it in Mr. Simpson's house?

A: In Mr. Simpson's closet.

Q: Was it hanging?

A: No.

Q: Was it folded?

A: Yes.

Q: Was it on a shelf?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you observe any other Louis Vuitton luggage on that shelf?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you observe other folded garment bags on that shelf?

A: Yes, I believe so.

Q: And how did you make a determination that the one you took out with
the special master was the one he had had when he came back from
Chicago on June 13?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Are you certain that the one you removed with the special master on
that time was the same one that he had returned from Chicago on June
13 with?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: With the golf bag, when was the next time you saw it  Strike that.

After Mr. Simpson went for a walk on the 15th with his golf club, did
you see him return the club to the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: By the way, who went for that walk besides you and Mr. Simpson?

A: Mr. Cowlings.

Q: Did you hear any conversation between Mr. Simpson and Mr. Cowlings
at that time?

A: No. I did not walk with them. I walked behind them.

Q: Without  were you able to hear any of the substance of their
conversation?

A: No. They were quite a ways in front of me.

Q: Was there any need for you to be there if he was with A.C. Cowlings
at that time?

A: No.

Q: But you chose to follow them.

A: I went for a walk. I ate dinner. I was full. I went for a walk.

Q: And time-wise, how long did the walk last for?

A: Maybe half hour, 20 minutes.

Q: And you observed Mr. Simpson put the club back in the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you observe him close the travel bag then after he put it back
in?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see him leave the garage then with you?

A: Yes, I think so.

Q: Was Mr. Cowlings there also when Mr. Simpson put the club away?

A: Yeah. Yes.

Q: Were you standing right there with the two of them when he put the
club away?

A: I believe so. I think we were standing right in that area.

Q: Do you recall any conversation that took place at that time?

A: No, I do not.

Q: When was the next time you saw that golf bag after that day?

A: The next day.

Q: Did you ever see anybody open that golf bag again?

A: No.

Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever removed anything from that
golf bag between  or at any time after you arrived at the residence
on June 14?

A: No.

Q: You don't know?

A: No, I don't know, no.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Just one second.

(Pause in the deposition.)

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: By the way, on June 17 do you recall reading a note at a press
conference?

A: Yes.

Q: Had you been instructed by anybody to read that note?

A: No  Mr. Shapiro.

Q: Mr. Shapiro told you to read that?

A: Yes.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever tell you to read that note?

A: No. Mr. Simpson  he just said, "You'll know when it read it."

Q: Did he hand that to you?

A: Yes.

Q: Could you please tell me when you opened that note?

A: When the police arrived at my home.

Q: And how did you decide when was the right time to read it?

A: Mr. Shapiro told me to read it.

MR. KELLY: All right, I have no further questions. Just one minute.

Q: Are you familiar  Well, you saw the Bruno Magli shoes in court,
did you not?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Do you know what Bruno Magli shoes are?

A: I've seen a picture, but I don't...

Q: Do you ever recall seeing Mr. Simpson wear that type of shoe prior
to June 12, 1994?

MR. VAN SICKLEN: Which type, John? We have established there were
several types.

BY MR. KELLY:

Q: Did you ever see him wearing any suede Bruno Magli  dark suede
Bruno Magli shoes prior to June 12, 1994?

A: I wouldn't have noticed.

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson wearing brown leather gloves prior to
June 12, 1994?

A: No. Maybe on television, but not when he was with me.

MR. KELLY: All right. I have no further questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: The deposition notice required this deposition to
continue from day to day, so I would like to continue on Monday, and I
am available to continue on Monday. I've been told by the witness and
his lawyer that they are not available Monday, so as an accommodation
I am prepared to continue this at the next earliest date. Which is
when?

THE WITNESS: 13th or 14th, so I'll go make the call now if you like.

MS. LEVINE: And Mr. 

I forget your name.

MR. BREWER: Brewer.

MS. LEVINE:  Brewer would prefer the 14th, which is better for me.

We are just going to make sure that's fine with Mr. Kardashian. If
that's better for you, that would be better all around.

Do we expect that it will conclude in one more day?

MR. PETROCELLI: I hope so, but I do not know.

So why don't we start 9:30 on May 14, then?

MS. LEVINE: Same place?

MR. PETROCELLI: Same place. Okay?

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

By Mr. Petrocelli:

Q: Good morning, Mr. Kardashian. You are still under oath from the
first session of your deposition. You understand that?

A: Yes, I do.

Q: Between that session and today's have you done anything to prepare
for today's session.

A: No, I have not.

Q: Have you read anything?

A: Yes. I read my transcript of the deposition.

Q: The first session, given on May 3?

A: Yes sir.

Q: Did you note anything that was inaccurate or incorrect?

A: There are a few minor inconsistencies, but I couldn't tell you what
they are right now. I'd have to go through it.

Q: Did you make any notes?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. Have you had any conversations with anyone regarding your
deposition other than Miss Levine?

A: No, I have not.

Q: Have you spoken to Mr. Simpson since the last session of your
deposition.

A: Yes, I did.

Q: On how many occasions?

A: I just believe one. He called last night.

Q: From London?

A: Yes sir.

Q: What was the discussion?

Mr. Baker: I'd object to that question on the grounds it calls for
attorney-client communications.

By Mr. Petrocelli:

Q: Can you answer that?

A: That I could answer. I was asleep and he woke me up, and he was
with a friend of ours from England and just said -- he wanted to say
hello, this friend , and he said, "Why are you asleep?"

And I said, "Well, it's" whatever time it was. I said, "whatever time
it was." I said, "I have my deposition tomorrow."

And he said, "Oh, well, then I better not talk to you."

And I said, "Yeah, you better not," and I hung up.

Q: What time was it L.A. time?

A: I'm not sure. I think it was 10:30 or about 11:00.

Q: Is that the only time --

A: Yes.

Q: -- you've spoken to Mr. Simpson since the first session of your
deposition?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. What is your current occupation? What is it that you do right
now?

A: I'm president of a company called Movie Tunes.

Q: And you've been -- you own that company?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: You own all the stock?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you've been running Movie Tunes since how long?

A: I believe 1992.

Q: How many employees do you have?

A: Well, it varies. I've got right now only-only two employees right
now.

Q: During the criminal trial, preliminary trial, the
actual-preliminary hearing, the trial itself, during all the time that
you were involved with Mr. Simpson's criminal matters, were you
tending, to your business?

MS. LEVINE: Involved in the sense that he was a lawyer? What do you
mean, ''involved"? It's a vague term.

BY MR. PETROCELL:

Q: Whatever you were doing, you were sitting at counsel's table,
acting, I suppose, as a lawyer and giving assistance to Mr. Simpson.

During all that period of time, who was running your business?

A: I was attempting to.

Q: Okay. Do you have an assistant?

A: Yes.

Q: And what is that person's name?

A: Michael Ameen was the assistant at the time.

Q: How do you spell his last name?

A: A-m-e-e-n.

Q: Okay. Is he still with you?

A: No, he is not.

Q: Okay. And when did he leave?

A: I would estimate maybe a year ago, six, eight months ago, something
like that.

Q: Was Mr. Ameen with you as of June l2, 1994?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And who-what other employees, were with you as of that time?

A: Nicole Pulvers.

Q: What was her position with your company?

A: She was an attorney and an administrative assistant. Barbara
Stockton was my assistant, and Michael Ameen. Those were the
individuals I had at that time.

Q: Michael was your -- what was his position?

A: Michael was my head of sales and marketing, basically.

Q: And where was your office as of that time?

A: Offices were in my home.

Q: They have been in your home since 1992?

A: Yes.

Q: To the present.

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. How is Movie Tunes spelled? Is Tunes T-o-o-n-s or T-u-n-s-

A: T-u-n-e-s-

Q: -e-s.

A: -two words.

Q: Has the business of Movie Tunes declined as a result of your
participation in the Simpson case?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for speculation, and I don't know how far
down a field you are going to go with this into his financial affairs
at the present time. I don't think that that's anything that's any of
your business.

If you want to ask him questions -- preliminary questions like you've
been asking, that's fine, but I don't want you to go deep a field.
It's not at issue in this case, and he has some privacy rights despite
the fact that he's a witness before you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay hear what you're saying.

Q: Can you answer the question?

A: Repeat that again, please.

MR. PETROCELLI: You want to repeat it again, David?

(Pending question read as follows: "Q. Has the business of Movie Tunes
declined as a result of your participation in the Simpson case?")

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Substantially?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Can you give me just a ballpark percentage as to how far your
business is off?

MS. LEVINE: Percentage without getting into numbers?

MR. BAKER: I am just going to object on relevancy grounds.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: I am not really interested in the numbers. I just want to know the
percentage of what do you think your business is off as a result of
your participation in Mr. Simpson's case.

A: Perhaps 40 to 50 percent.

Q: And was Movie Tunes your sole source of income prior to June 12,
1994?

Q: Your principal source of income?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Your only active source of income. Right?

MS. LEVINE: Objection, vague.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: In other words, you might have passive investments, but this is the
only business you were running. Is that true?

A: No.

Q: What other business were you running at the time as of June
12,1994?

A: A company called Hit Tunes.

Q: Hit Tunes? And you still-did you own Hit Tunes?

A: Yes.

Q: Hundred percent?

A: Yes.

Q: And you still own it?

A: Yes.

Q: And is it still operating?

A: Yes.

Q: Operates also out of your house?

A: Yes.

Q: Do the same people work for Hit Tunes who work for Movie Tunes?

A: Basically, yes.

Q: Do you have any different personnel?

A: Sometimes I do. Hit Tunes is a little bit different than Movie
Tunes.

Q: Explain the two companies very briefly.

A: Well, briefly, Hit Tunes was set up to sell CDs via CD vending
machines in movie theater lobbies.

Q: Hit Tunes?

A: Yes. And as a result, I had different people who would stock and
rack those machines and watch over that. Whereas Movie Tunes provides
actual music to the movie theaters itself.

Q: Was Movie Tunes a bigger company providing a larger source of
income to you than Hit Tunes?

A: Most definitely

Q: Okay. And has the business of Hit Tunes suffered as a result of
your participation in the Simpson case?

MS. LEVINE: Same objections.

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant and vague.

THE WITNESS: It's suffered. I don't know if it's a result of the case,
but it has suffered because of my time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is it off 40, 50 percent?

A: It's more difficult to- it's more than that, so it's more difficult
to characterize.

Q: Is the reason that your businesses- by "businesses," I mean Movie
Tunes and Hit Tunes- have suffered as a result of your participation
in the Simpson case attributable simply to your absence from the
business?

A: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: Object-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Has your business suffered in any way as a result of any
public stigma or rejection by the public associated with you and your
business?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for speculation. There is no way he could
know that.

MR. BAKER: And it's irrelevant.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

MS. LEVINE: If you can.

THE WITNESS: I really don't know. You know, I don't-no one's told me,
"We're not going to do business with you because of this," so I really
don't know for sure.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: So based on your knowledge and experience in your business, you
don't believe that that's happening.

MS. LEVINE.: Objection. Misstates the testimony and is argumentative.
He said he didn't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is that accurate?

MR. BAKER: And it's irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: No, I don't think-I don't think your statement is
accurate. I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You do not know--

A: No.

Q:-one way or the other?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Okay. Have you suffered any diminution in your standing or stature
in the social community as a result of your participation on the
Simpson defense team?

MR. BAKER: Speculative-

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Irrelevant, calls for speculation. and it
invades his privacy right.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You can answer.

MS. LEVINE: This is how he's being treated now by people out in the
world? What does that have to do with

MR. PETROCELLI: It's highly relevant to his motive and his bias and
his credibility in giving testimony as a material witness in this
case.

MS. LEVINE: I can't see how it's relevant at all to anything.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know what to tell you. I am just telling you
what the argument is.

MS. LEVINE: You know, if you want to sit here all day and ask him
questions like that, that's fine, and he can answer this one, but I am
not going to let us sit here all day and answer silly questions like
this.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Repeat it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, you can repeat the question, please.

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q. Okay. Have you suffered any diminution in your standing or stature
in the social community as a result of your participation on the
Simpson defense team?")

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. In what respect?

MR. BAKER: Same objection: Irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same objections.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't - I mean, I can't quantify it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: No. Describe to me what has happened as a result.

A: Just negative comments people make to me.

Q: Do you have more trouble getting reservations in your favorite
restaurants, things like that?

A: No. No, that's not a problem, because I've always been -- I've been
born and raised here, so I've always frequented the same
establishments I'm frequenting today, so -- and I've known these
people for years, so it isn't-that isn't a problem. It's just
sometimes how I'm treated by the man on the street that I don't know.

Q: Just members of the general public-

A: Correct.

Q:-making negative comments?

A: Correct.

Q: Is that what you meant?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Do you have any agreement to write a book?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. I am going to object to that as being
irrelevant and also invading his privacy rights. I think in the last
deposition the same question was asked, and I believe the same
objection was made. I don't have a copy of it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, this question wasn't asked, but the topic was
generally raised.

MS. LEVINE: Can I see - I don't have a copy. Can I-do you have an
unmarked copy? I don't want to look at your markings.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well-

MR. BAKER: I do. I don't have a word index, but-

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to have to spend a lot of time going back
over whatever another lawyer  in this case asked.

MS. LEVINE: I don't either. I just don't think that any financial
arrangements he may or may not have at this time are relevant. I am
not going to let him answer it. I think it goes into his privacy
rights that he still has.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, his privacy rights, if he has any in this kind
of matter, give way to the need to disclose information that is
relevant to his motivation, bias and credibility as a material
witness.

MR. BAKER: I don't

MS. LEVINE: Well, I guess that that's an arguable point that we may
have to argue some day, but we are not going to decide it right here,
I don't think.

Do you know what page it's on?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's on page 69, et seq.

MS. LEVINE: I instructed him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you have a current deal with anyone to write a book?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection and same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are you currently involved in writing a book?

MS LEVINE: Same objection and same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you provided any information to anyone else regarding a book
written by another person?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection and same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: What is the basis for that? That doesn't go to his
writing, a book. If he tells another person information that in any
way relates to this case, I am entitled to know that information.

MS LEVINE: If you want to go into things that he may have told someone
at some point, go into what he knows. Anything that he is doing right
now has nothing to do with his percipient witness knowledge, think you
have no business asking about. don't think the fact that you issue a
subpoena to him lays bare his entire personal life.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have the right to inquire what he is telling other
persons about this case, whether it's in the context of providing
information for a book or in some other context.

MS. LEVINE: Well-

MR. PETROCELLI: It could, number one, elicit direct admissions. Number
two, it could lead to other relevant and discoverable information.

MS. LEVINE: Well, certainly it couldn't be an admission since he is
not a party.

MR. PETROCELLI: Might be an authorized admission of O.J. Simpson if he
is his representative.

MS. LEVINE: And in any event, I am going to instruct him not to answer
that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. What if he told another person, "O.J.
Simpson told me X, Y and Z"?

MS. LEVINE: I think if he said that, he'd have a privilege issue, but
--

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I have a right to inquire whether he said those
things. You can't just cut me off at the pass. I mean, that's what
this deposition is all about. I am entitled to go beyond things he
actually witnessed at the time into his discussions since the time
that relate to this case.

MS. LEVINE: You are asking him about anything he may have had to do
with writing a book, and I am instructing him not to answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, we talked about his book, and you've instructed
him, and we will go to court on that. Now I am asking whether he has
ever provided any information to anyone else, not in connection with a
book for which he is being paid or that he is writing, but that
someone else may be writing. There is no invasion of his privacy
there.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I am going to object. Same objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: On what ground?

MS. LEVINE: Privacy grounds.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay

MR. BAKER: And could you invade the attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Have you had any discussions with Larry Schiller about the
preparation of a book by Mr. Schiller or by anyone else?

MR. BAKER: I think this was-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

MS. LEVINE: Same objection and same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When was the last time you spoke to Mr. Schiller?

MS. LEVINE: That may have been asked and answered.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You spoke to him the day before May 3, when asked last time. Now I
am asking as of today.

MS. LEVINE: Whether he has spoken with him between May 3 and today?

MR. PETROCELLI: I guess that would logically follow.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I may not be as smart as you to figure that out, so
I'm trying to make sure.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: I'm sorry. Did I speak to him?

Q: Yes. Since-the last time you testified that you spoke to Mr.
Schiller on May 2.

MR. BAKER: What page is that?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's on page 70, line 18.

Q: Did you speak to Mr. Schiller on May 3, the day of your deposition?

A: No, I don't believe so.

Q: And have you spoken to him since May 3?

A: Yes.

Q: Up to today, which is May 14th?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did-how many times have you spoken to one another?

A: Maybe two or three.

Q: Okay. And have you met with him in person?

A: No, I haven't.

Q: And these have all been telephone conversations?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And what's the substance of those conversations?

A: Well, I can recall I spoke with him this morning. He called me and
said, "Did you see the newspaper? It said there is a lien, or the IRS
has a lien. O.J., according to the paper, didn't pay his taxes."

I said, "No, I haven't seen the newspaper," and that was the
conversation.

Q: And did you have any other conversations with him-

A: No. That was today.

Q: -between May 3-

A: Oh, yeah, I did-

Q: -and today?

A: Yes. The substance of which-let me think what we would have
discussed. I can't recall in the last- other than this morning I
recall.

Q: Do you -- what is the nature of your current relationship with Mr.
Schiller?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That goes into his private relationships, and
it's not at issue here. I instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is he a friend of yours?

MR. BAKER: It's irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are you involved in any business dealings or deals with him?

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction. Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The conversations that you have had since the past session of your
deposition, have they been simply casual conversation, or have they
involved some other matter?

A: Well, I represent him as an attorney and give him advice as an
attorney on different matters.

Q: Okay Do you represent him in connection with any matter involving
O.J. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: That would go to Mr. Schiller's attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: And Mr. Kardashian does not have the right to waive that
privilege on behalf of Mr. Schiller.

MS. LEVINE: And I would object on the same basis and instruct Mr.
Kardashian not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When did you begin to legally represent Mr.-

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for-

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

Q: When did you begin to represent Mr. Schiller in any capacity as a
lawyer?

Q: MR. BAKER: Violates -

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for-

MR. BAKER: - Mr. Schiller's-

MS. LEVINE: -privileged information.

Instruct him not to answer

MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Were you representing Mr. Schiller any time prior to June 12,1994?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged information. I will
instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are all of the conversations that you've had with Mr. Schiller
since June 12,1994 part of your attorney client relationship with him?

MR. BAKER: I don't think Mr. Kardashian has the right to communicate
that information. It's Mr. Schiller's determination of whether such
consultations were attorney-client-based and-

MS. LEVINE: And also I came here for a deposition in relationship to
Mr.-to the O.J. Simpson case. I am not  MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not
responsible-

MS. LEVINE: Can I finish? I let you finish. I interrupted you once;
you called me on it; I let you finish.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Please finish.

MS. LEVINE: If you please let me finish, I think it will make things a
lot cleaner for the record. We were prepared to proceed on a
deposition in relationship to the case this was noticed on. I know
it's your position that anything that Mr. Kardashian knows or does may
be relevant. However, I have no idea what he is talking about in l
this area where he has represented somebody, and unless you want me to
go off the record right now for about four hours and discuss with him
his relationship with Mr. Schiller, I am not prepared to say whether
there is anything that he could talk about having represented him.

So I am going to instruct him not to answer any questions related to
his representation and relationship with Mr. Schiller, save those that
anybody could see are purely social, like, "Did you see the newspaper
today," and instruct him not to answer anything else.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not interested in those kinds of conversations. I
am only interested in conversations that could lead to or that contain
relevant information.

MS. LEVINE: Well, your definition and mine are different, and that's
part of the problem here, I believe.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, in any event, any court going to require the
witness to divulge when an attorney-client relationship began.

MS. LEVINE: Perhaps, but it would be in chambers. It wouldn't be to
you.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, that's not true.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I know you are really smart l and know exactly what
the court's going to do, but I can't rely on that in my representation
of this witness, and so I am going to have to rely on my limited, as
you've been kind to point out, my limited knowledge of the law, and if
I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I've been wrong before.

MR. PETROCELLI: And are you going to instruct him not to answer.

MS. LEVINE: Yes, I did.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.  Q: Are you engaged in the practice of the law
at the current time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Vague as to the term "practice of law."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

MS. LEVINE: If you understand the question.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I'm somewhat.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. You indicated to me that you run Movie Tunes and Hit Tunes.
Correct?

A: Correct.

Q Okay. You also have a law practice?

A: Very limited.

Q: Okay. And have you had a law practice continuously in the past 10
years?

A: No, I have not.

Q: Okay. Did there come a time when you ceased practicing law
altogether?

MR. BAKER: That's vague as to the term. He could be rendering legal
advice.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

MS. LEVINE: If you understand the question.

THE WITNESS: I never really ceased. I didn't go to court, I didn't do
a lot of the lawyerly things, but I did dispense advice.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you get paid for that advice?

A: I-yes, I have.

Q: Okay. And has that been the case in the past 10 years?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Every year you have received income from the practice of law?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That's irrelevant, has nothing to do-if you
want to ask him about 1994, that's one thing, but what he did in '93
or '92, unless it relates to people at issue in this case, is
completely irrelevant. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When was your Bar license-did it go into an inactive status?

A: Yes.

Q: When did that occur?

A: I don't know. I think it was around maybe '89 or '90. I'm not sure.

Q: Land it became-you activated it when? In July of 1994 or
thereabouts?

A: Yes. sir. Yes.

Q: And between 1990 or '89 and 1994, were you engaged in any way in
practicing law?

A: I was-

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant-

MS. LEVINE: Objection. It's irrelevant. It's vague as to "engaged" in
the practice of law. It's unanswerable as that. Do you mean, did he go
to court, do you mean, did he ever talk to anybody about the law, or
do you mean, did anyone come up and say, you know, "I know you're a
lawyer, Mr. Kardashian. What do you say about this?" What do you mean
by the question?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

MS. LEVINE: If you can.

THE WITNESS: Well, I did not go to court. did not write legal
documents, would give some advice as a business attorney that I had
engaged in I previously.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Between 1989 or 1989 when your license became inactive until July
of 1994, did you derive any I income from practicing law?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Irrelevant, and it invades his privacy rights.
I am going to instruct him not to answer.

BY Mr. PETROCELLI:

Q: From June 12.1994 until the present , have you derived any income
from practicing law?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And have you derived any income from any client other than
O.J Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And does that include Mr. Schiller?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Who paid him as an attorney is private and
privileged, and he can't answer that absent some court telling him to
answer that information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you derived any income since June 12, 1994 from representing
O.J. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: That's privileged

MS. LEVINE: Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay Have you received any-

Withdrawn.

Have you rendered any bills for legal services to or on behalf of O.J.
Simpson

MS. LEVINE: I believe that's been asked and answered.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:- since - excuse me. Let me start the question all over again.

Have you rendered any bills for legal services to or on behalf of O.J.
Simpson since June 12, 1994 to the present?

MR. BAKER: It's been asked and answered, and his financial arrangement
with O.J. Simpson falls under the guise of the attorney-client
privilege, which has not been waived.

MS. LEVINE: Instruct him not to answer based on that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you received any payment from Mr. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't see how I am supposed to test the
attorney-client privilege if I am not even permitted to ask these most
basic foundational questions. I really don't understand these
objections at all, and Mr. Simpson has produced information in the
financial part of this case dealing with his legal obligations and his
legal debts on top of the basic underlying issue of whether there
really is a bona fide attorney-client relationship.

MR. BAKER: You are not the judge, Dan.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, but I am entitled to present information to the
judge so that he can decide the issue.

MR. BAKER: You cannot invade the attorney-client privilege
attorney-client privilege --

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker-

MR. BAKER:-merely because you want to raise an issue before the court.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. I am not going to argue with you. You
happen not to know what you are talking about, so let's just continue
and take the record to the court.

MS. LEVINE: You know, but you can't say things l'1 like that and
except there to be no comments-

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not speaking to you right now. I am speaking to
Mr. Baker. He is able to defend himself very ably.

MS. LEVINE: But there is a record here that says that you believe X, Y
and Z with no comment from me, and I don't believe that the record
should go such that way. It's not up to you to decide whether there is
a privilege or not. That's up to a court sometime. It's not to Mr.
Kardashian to decide that either. He is obligated, just as you as a
lawyer would be obligated on behalf of one of your clients, to assert
the privilege. You then do not give your questioner all of the
information about the privilege so the questioner can decide it.
That's why there is in the wisdom of the law things called in camera
hearings where the other side doesn't appear and a person can go in
and tell the judge what's happening.

Now, it may be that I'm wrong, and I know you sincerely believe that
what-ever you say is right is right, but I have to make the record
that I believe that this is the case and Mr. Kardashian is obligated
to assert the privilege on behalf of his client.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: How many bills have you rendered to Mr. Simpson since June 12,1
994?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: have your bills been paid?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you have any kind of written agreement with Mr. Simpson-

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: - regarding legal representation?

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When did you first begin to represent O.J. Simpson in connection
with this-with the deaths of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Same objection. Mr. Kardashian's determination of when the
attorney-client relationship commenced is not at issue. It's when O.J.
Simpson believed it commenced and we don't waive the privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are you currently representing him?

MR. BAKER: Objection. That calls for attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you -- did there come a time when you stopped representing Mr.
Simpson following June 12, 1994, assuming you ever began to represent
him?

MR. BAKER: Same objection. Mr. Kardashian's determination is not
relevant. It's Mr. Simpson's determination.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Does Mr. Simpson owe you any money for legal fees?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. How much does he owe you?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: How much have your fees to Mr. Simpson been since-

MR. BAKER: Same-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-you initially became retained, whenever that may have been?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay How did you become retained -

MR. BAKER: Same-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-if you were retained, by Mr. Simpson to represent him?

MR. BAKER: Same objection. It's irrelevant pursuant to Evidence Code
Section 951. It's O.J. Simpson's determination that's relevant.

And another issue here that's very relevant to Miss Levine is these
depositions are released to the media. If you want to have an in
camera hearing, so be it, but there is no way that we are going to
waive the attorney-client privilege because you deem it proper, Dan.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you had any conversations that you believe are privileged with
O.J. Simpson since June 12, 1994

MR. BAKER: His belief on what is privileged is not relevant. It's the
client's belief. And I think that calls for attorney-client
communications, and I object.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: How often have you been in contact with Mr. Simpson since his
release from jail?

MR. BAKER: I think that's privileged information. I object on the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is it fair to say that you have spoken to him regularly since his
release from prison?

MR. BAKER: Vague as to the term "regularly," and invades the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you had more than 30 conversations with him since October
3,1995 when he was released?

MR. BAKER: It's no longer vague, but it still invades the
attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is it your understanding that all of your conversations with Mr.
Simpson since his release from prison were in the context of
representing him as a lawyer?

MR. BAKER: His understanding is irrelevant. Invades the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you socialized with Mr. Simpson since October 3,1995, since he
was released from prison?

MR. BAKER: That's vague as to the term "socialized," and if it can
possibly be distinguished between your relationship as an attorney for
Mr. Simpson. would object on the grounds it invades the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you gone out with Mr. Simpson on any social events since he
was released from prison on October 3,1995?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you visited him at his home since his release from prison on
October 3, 1995?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are you close friends with him?

MR. BAKER: Vague as to the term "friends" and "close," and if you can
distinguish your relationship  between the attorney-client capacity-I
would object on the attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: If I could have a moment. Can you read that all back to
me, please, starting from the question

(Record read.)

MR. BAKER: I am going to object. It's , impossible for him to
determine. I think it's Mr. Simpson's belief of that relationship
which is relevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You had no problem telling a national television audience that you
were close friends with Mr. Simpson. Is that true?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That's an argumentative question.

THE WITNESS: When?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When you were asked.

MS. LEVINE: Do you have a time?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You were asked by Larry King whether you and Mr. Simpson were close
friends, and you had no problem telling him that you were.

Do you recall that?

MR. BAKER: Just because he mentions the fact on a media show doesn't
mean that the attorney-client  privilege is forever waived. We are
objecting on the grounds it calls for privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You appeared on the Larry King show, did you not on October 6,1995,
that you were one of O. J. Simpson's best-friends? Was that true Yes
or no.

MR. BAKER: I object on the grounds that it calls attorney-client
privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: These objections are absurd, and they know they are,
but there is no point arguing with them.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: They wouldn't understand the argument, anyway.

MR. BAKER: Oh, boy, you have really reached the heights of your
judicial wisdom, Dan.

MS. LEVINE: You know, I do have to take umbrage with that. I know that
you are quite a bright lawyer; you've, I'm sure, gone to a very fine
law school-

MR. PETROCELLI: Miss Levine, can we stop right here? I've been polite
enough to listen to these absurd objections and not argue with you. I
don't want to hear your speeches It's really not-

MS. LEVINE: Well, you just said that we are stupid. basically, and I
think that's rude-

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not relevant to anything. What's rude is your
coming to this deposition totally unprepared, with no knowledge of the
applicable law and making frivolous objections, you and Mr. Baker.
That's what's irresponsible.

MS. LEVINE: Excuse me-

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you know the cost involved in having a videographer
here, having lawyers clear their schedules to be here, having your
client here. having you here? The cost is enormous, and I came here-

MS. LEVINE: You know --

MR. PETROCELLI:-and I am asking questions that are the most
fundamental rudimentary questions.

I haven't even asked him for a confidential communication. I am trying
to probe the nature and extent of his relationship. You're even
instructing him, Miss Levine, not to answer questions that he has
already answered in the first session of this deposition, including
questions like, "Were you close friends with C)J. Simpson," including
questions like, "When did your relationship begin," and he testified,
Sometime in the afternoon of June 14."

We need to go to court, and we need to have a complete and accurate
record. I am trying to do my best to delineate the parameters of his
relationship with Mr. Simpson so that I can find out what I am
entitled to know, and you've completely cut that off. And that's your
choice. Okay? It's a irresponsible one in my view, but that's your
choice.

MS. LEVINE: But-

MR. PETROCELLI: And I don't want to hear your speeches. I am going to
ask my questions-

MS. LEVINE: You just made your speech. I can make the same record you
can make

MR. PETROCELLI: You've made your record, and if you want to go back
and look at the record, I think you've talked about 90 percent of the
time, you and Mr. Baker.

MS. LEVINE: You keep telling me that I don't know anything, that I've
come here unprepared, that don't know what I'm talking about. I am
here because Mr. Kardashian, just like you, is obligated to assert his
attorney-client privilege, the attorney-client privilege of a client,
especially when the client's lawyer claims the privilege.

Now, if you want to say, "Gee, Miss Levine, I'm the smartest lawyer
here," I Mr. Petrocelli is the smartest lawyer and he can decide where
the privilege lies, that's not the way it works, though.

And so if he sits here and he makes a wrong decision, you don't
indemnify him; you don't change it. It's got to be a judge that makes
that decision. And just because you ,get up here and say that I'm
making frivolous objections or that I'm doing something that I'm not
supposed to do doesn't make it so.

If you're doing this so you have a transcript so you can walk outside
and tell some press reporter what happened, fine, go ahead and do it.
You can try this case in the press. That doesn't change the
attorney-client issue. If you want to do away with hundreds of years
of jurisprudence for your one case, I'm ashamed of you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Are you finished?

MS. LEVINE: I'm finished. Go ahead.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Thank you.

Q: Let me ask you some more questions about this Larry King interview
that you gave on October 6.

After this interview was given, did you receive any instruction from
Mr. Simpson in any way, without telling me what if was, regarding this
interview?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object. Any communication between O.J.
Simpson and Mr. Kardashian would fall under the guise of the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Let me read a few excerpts from this transcript while I have it in
front of me and then ask you some questions about that, Mr.
Kardashian.

You said the following to Mr. King on television:

"I have known the man," referring to Mr. Simpson, "for 25 years. He
has never lied to me. We have been in business deals together, we have
lost a lot of money together. And that's when you tell what a person
is like. He's never complained, he's never yelled at me, he's always
told me the truth. After these murders occurred and he was
incarcerated, I went down and I looked him in the face, and straighten
the eyes, and I said, 'Did you commit these horrible murders?' And he
started to weep and he said' 'I absolutely did not do these horrible
things."' Would you like to see where that appears in the transcript?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Okay. Do you recall saying that?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Was that statement time?

MR. BAKER: Don't-I object on the grounds it calls for attorney-client
privilege. Mr. Kardashian answered that question on Larry King; he may
not have been advised at that time that O.J. Simpson does not waive
the attorney-client privilege, and it is not being waived.

MS. LEVINE: Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When did that conversation occur, Mr. Kardashian?

MR. BAKER: I object on the grounds it calls for attorney-client
privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Which conversation? The one with Larry King or the one-

MR. PETR0CELLI: No.

Q: The conversation that you described on the Larry King show with
O.J. Simpson when you asked him if he committed these horrible
murders.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Where were you and Mr. Simpson when that conversation took
place?

MR. BAKER: I object on the grounds it calls for attorney-client
privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Who was present, if anyone -Well, withdrawn.

Was this a telephone conversation, or was this a face-to-face
conversation?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for privileged
information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was anyone else a participant to the conversation besides Mr.
Simpson and you?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for privileged
information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Was anyone else present?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Can you tell me what you said and what he 1 said in that
conversation?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MS. LEVINE: I would like to get some more coffee. Are you going to
look through that for a second?

MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. You can hear me. It's right over there.

MR. BAKER: I am going to take a quick break.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, that's fine. You want to go off the record
for a second?

MR. BAKER: Sure.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. While you take your break?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:24.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:31

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When was the last time prior to June 12, 1994 that you represented
O.J. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object. That calls for attorney-client
privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Mr. Simpson testified in his deposition that you did not represent
him during the '80s except perhaps in the late '70s or early '80s.

Q: Is that a true statement?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds-

MR. PETROCELLI: It's his testimony.

MR. BAKER:-of the attorney-client privilege.

Show me the testimony.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is that a true statement?

MS. LEVINE: Instruct him not to answer based on the objection by Mr.
Simpson's counsel.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Were you representing him in the year 1994 prior to June 12?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for
attorney-client privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you represent him at all in the year 1993?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for
attorney-client privileged information.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1992?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1991 ?

MR. BAKER: Well let's make that question compound, and I will have the
same objection.

MS. LEVINE: The same instruction. didn't get to finish my instruction
comment.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1990?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1989?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1988?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 1987?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

(Discussion held off the record.)

MR. BREWER: Why don't we just have a stipulation with the answer and
the instruction for-

MS. LEVINE: This series of questions?

MR. BAKER:-this entire time period, so we don't have to go through
this?

MS. LEVINE: Is that permissible, that if he makes the objection based
on attorney-client privilege, we will assume that I am instructing Mr.
Kardashian not to answer unless there is a comment otherwise from me?

MR. PETROCELLI: The question is when-if he represented him in a
particular year

MS. LEVINE: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: With respect to any year. Is that the objection?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. And is it your position I am not permitted to
know if or when he ever acted as a lawyer for-

MR. BAKER: Mr. Kardashian-

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

-for Mr. Kardashian?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: For Mr. Simpson? Excuse me.

MR. BAKER: Mr. Kardashian's impression is irrelevant. Mr. Simpson's
impression is the test , pursuant to 951.I and raising the
attorney-client privilege and not waiving it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Simpson has already testified about this.

MR. BAKER: We are not waiving the privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's your obligation to know that testimony.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, Mr. Petrocelli.

MR. PETROCELLI: And you obviously don't know it.

MR. BAKER: Oh, another snide one.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any conversation with O.J. Simpson before June 14 at
4:00) p.m. in the afternoon, 1994-

MR. BAKER: It's vague-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: -- regarding the question of whether or not he committed the
murders?

MS. LEVINE: Can I ask you a question? What day of the week is June 14?

MR. PETROCELLI: Tuesday. He previously testified that he had not acted
as Mr. Simpson's lawyer for a lengthy period of time up to I believe
the afternoon of June 14, which was a Tuesday.

MS. LEVINE: I think it was the morning, was the testimony.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What time?

A: I think it was around noon.

Q: Noon. Right in the middle. Around noon. Right?

Q: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: When Mr. Shapiro shows up, I think was the testimony.  BY
MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And that's when you were first retains to represent Mr. Simpson. Is
that true?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: In this matter?

THE WITNESS: In this matter, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: In this matter. In connection with the murders of Ron Goldman and
Nicole Brown. True?

A: Yes, true.

Q: Okay. Prior to that time, June 14, noon-

MS. LEVINE: -ish.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:- noonish, did you have any conversations with O.J. Simpson about
whether or not he committed the murders?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any conversations at all with him about his role or
responsibility in these murders?'

MS. LEVINE: At that- in that period of time between the time the
killings occurred and this noonish period?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. June 14th.

MS. LEVINE: Of June 14th.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did you have any conversations at all with him about his
whereabouts on the evening of June 12?

MR. BAKER: Between--

MR. PETROCELLI: All these questions are prior to the this noonish time
period on June 14, 1994.

THE witness: Let me think for a second. I could have. I can't recall,
but I could have.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What did he say?

MR. BAKER: Well, I am going to object. If he l can't recall if this
conversation occurred during this June 12th and noonish June 14th, and
it may have occurred during-following noonish June 1 4th, then would
object on the grounds it calls for attorney-client privileged
information, and only-

MR. PETROCELLI: That wasn't my question-

MR. BAKER: I'm not done, Dan.

-only if you are sure the conversation occurred prior to that time.

MS. LEVINE: Can you be sure?

THE WITNESS: No, I cannot be sure.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any conversations with Mr. Simpson prior to June 14
around noon regarding the cut on his finger?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Asked and answered. I believe we went through
that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Asked and answered doesn't forbid me from asking him
what-I am going to follow up in more detail. He answered yes to that
question before-

MS. LEVINE: Yes, and he described it.

MR. PETROCELLI:-and the answer was that Mr. Simpson said he cut his
finger in Chicago.

That was the extent of the testimony.

MS. LEVINE: Dan, can I have that in front of me while you ask that, if
you don't mind?

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know if I can readily put my finger on it. No
pun intended.

I can't, so let me just follow up.

Q: Did you ask Mr. Simpson how he cut his finger in Chicago?

MS. LEVINE: In that period of time between-

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MS. LEVINE:- whenever and noonish on June 14?

MR. PETROCELLI: Correct.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was anyone with you when you asked him this question?

A: No, I don't believe so.

Q: Okay. And what did he say?

A: He said he cut his finger in Chicago on some glass. He learned of
Nicole's death, and he broke a glass in the sink or in his bathroom in
Chicago, and it cut his finger.

Q: Where were you when he told this to you?

A: I don't know. I-I don't know.

Q: Prior to noon on June 14, where had you been with O.J. Simpson from
the moment that he came back from Chicago?

MS. LEVINE: Can you repeat that question?

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me withdraw that question.

Q: Let me ask you something else as a foundation. Had you had any
telephone conversations with O.J. Simpson when you understood that he
was calling from Chicago?

A: No.

MS. LEVINE: In that period of time?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, prior to June 14.

MS. LEVINE: Not ever.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Where he was calling from his hotel in Chicago.

A: No.

Q: Or from a cell phone out of town.

A: No.

Q: Or from the airplane.

A: No.

Q: Okay. So the first time you spoke to O.J. Simpson after the murders
on June 12 was when you saw him in person. Is that right?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And you saw him in person for the first time sometime in the
late morning on June 13, Monday. Is that right?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: But I did not speak to him at that time.

Q: The first time you actually spoke to him was when you saw him at
his office in Brentwood on the afternoon of June 13, where you had
gone with Cathy Randa. Is that true?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. And at any time from that moment when you first spoke to him
in the office at Brentwood 9l on the afternoon of June 13 until the
next day

MS. LEVINE: Noonish.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-- on June 14, did you have any telephone conversations with Mr.
Simpson?

A: No, I did not.

Q: On the afternoon of June 13, believe you testified that you were
there until around 6:00, 6:30?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And then you went over to Rockingham. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you drove Mr. Simpson over there. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And you were alone in the car during that ride. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: Were you alone at all during the time you were spending in the
office on that day, June 13?

MS. LEVINE: Alone with Mr. Simpson?

MR. PETROCELLI: Alone with Mr. Simpson.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And you drove directly from Brentwood- his Brentwood office to
Rockingham. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And that's a short drive. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you spend any time with him alone at Rockingham on the
evening of June 13?

A: I could have, but I don't think so. I think, to my best
recollection, I did not.

Q: You testified that you left the Rockingham house at around 9:30
p.m.-

A: Yes.

Q:-on the evening of Monday, June 13?

A: Yes.

Q: And then you went directly to your house that you shared with [Name
Deleted], your then fiancee. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And you didn't speak to Mr. Simpson that evening by phone.
Right?

A: No, I did not.

Q: The next time you saw Mr. Simpson was the following morning, June
14, when you rode to his house in your Rolls-Royce. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you arrived at his house about what time?

A: I thought it was about 10:00 o'clock in the morning.

Q: And you spent some time alone with him at the house?

A: I do not believe we were alone, no, I don't think so.

Q: Okay. And you left the house with him alone. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: At about what time?

A: To the best of my knowledge, perhaps 10:30, maybe 11:00, but I
don't think it was that late. I think about 10:30.

Q: And this is where he exited through his backyard, went through the
Von Watts property and you picked him up outside the Von Watts
property. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And then the two of you drove to Mr. Simpson's office in Brentwood.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Did you make that trip direct from Rockingham to Brentwood?

A: Yes.

Q: No stops in between?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And you were alone during that time. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And then at the Brentwood office, you arrived there around 10:30?

A: Approximately.

Q: 10:40, thereabouts?

A: Yes.

Q: And was anyone present there when you arrived with Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes. Mr. Taft, Mr. Taft's secretaries and other people in his law
offices.

Q: Okay. Did you spend any time alone with Mr. Simpson when you were
at the Brentwood office?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. And at some point you and he left the office to go pick up
the golf clubs. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you testified previously that after making that trip, you went
back to your house. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And you got there around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m., was your testimony.
Correct?

A: I think it was closer to 4:00, yes.

Q: 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon?

A: Yes.

Q: What time do you believe you left the office in Brentwood en route
to the airport?

A: I would imagine it would have been about 2:00 o'clock.

Q: And during the two hours you went from Brentwood to LAX directly,
no stops?

A: That's correct, no stops.

Q: Do you remember the route- were you driving?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And Mr. Simpson was in the front seat?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you remember the route you took leaving Mr. Simpson's Brentwood
office to get to LAX?

A: I-no, I don't. I would imagine I would have taken the freeway but I
don't recall.

Q: You don't recall the route you took?

A: No. As I say, I don't remember. I just would imagine I would have
taken the freeway.

Q: 405 south?

A: 405 south, but I honestly don't recall what I-how I got there.

Q: Okay. Do you know how long it took you to get to LAX from Mr.
Simpson's office?

A: No. No, I don't. It's usually about a half hour, I would imagine.
Q: And when you were at the airport, how long were you there before
you LEFT to go back to your place ?

A: Not long, maybe 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, maybe a half hour, but
I don't think- that would have been the max if I was there that long.

Q: You parked curbside. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you and Mr. Simpson excited the car and went inside the
terminal and spoke to a baggage person at American Airlines. Is that
right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And do you know if the person immediately recognized Mr. Simpson
and understood why he was there? Could you tell?

A: I believe she did.

Q It was a woman?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And do you remember her name?

A: Oh, no, I don't.

Q: And do you - could you describe what she looked like?

A: No.

Q: Did she testify at the criminal trial?

MR. BAKER: Only if you know.

THE WITNESS: I don't believe she did, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you know how long, it to her to get back Mr. Simpson's golf bag?

A: She didn't get it. She directed us over to a different area.

Q: The - where was this person working in the terminal?

First of all, was it the baggage floor?

A: It was downstairs-

Q: Yeah.

A: -where the carrousels are-

Q: Okay.

A: -and there's one area that is-I don't know what it said, if it was
"Baggage " or whatever it said, and we went up to the window or inside
an office perhaps. I can't recall. But when we went into this area, he
said, "My golf clubs are in on flight'" whatever "from Chicago.

And she said "Yes, they'd be over at" some other area, some other
carrousel. So she directed us over to that area' end we-

Q: In the same building?

A: In the same building.

Q: Okay. And did Mr. Simpson ask the woman for his golf clubs?

A: I believe so. I don't know if he said golf clubs or luggage, but I
would imagine he would have said golf clubs, but I can't honestly say.

Q: Do you remember from the woman's reaction whether she knew there
was luggage there awaiting Mr. Simpson?

A: No, I don't know.

Q: Okay. Then the two of you walked over from this woman to another
person?

A: Yes.

Q: In the same area. Right?

A: Basically. It was about maybe a hundred to 200 yards away.

Q: And who did you speak to there?

A: It was a gentleman that was a baggage handler in that area.

Q: Okay. And do you know his name?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Okay. And what did you say to-what did Mr. Simpson say to this
person?

A: I don't-I really don't know. I was a little bit behind him, and
he'd walked over there and I was just following, and I don't know if
there was any conversation. I believe the gentleman recognized him and
just went to the golf clubs, but I don't know what was said.

Q: You can't recall any discussion between Mr. Simpson and this
person?

A: No, I cannot.

Q: And the person then went where to retrieve the golf clubs, if you
know?

A: I don't know if it was a carrousel. It was back against a wall, and
there were several items there, and one of which were his golf clubs.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson have to point out which item was his?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Can you describe the item, the bag that was retrieved and handed to
Mr. Simpson?

A: Sure.

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Please do so.

A: It was a black Swiss Army Knife travel bag.

Q: Is that the first time you had seen it?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you remember - can you describe the Swiss Army logo in a little
more detail; for example, color and size?

A: It's been a while. All I could remember, it was I think red and
white. and it was maybe- maybe a foot.

Q: Now, you saw that bag often at your house after it was retrieved.
Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: So you have a memory of it based on seeing it more than once.
Right?

A: Oh, yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Did-was the bag handed to Mr. Simpson or to you?

A: No, I never touched the bag. I don't recall, and this was in my
last deposition, I'm not sure if Mr. Simpson picked it up or if the
gentleman picked it up and handed it to Mr. Simpson. I believe Mr.
Simpson-all I remember Mr. Simpson carried the bag to the car. This
gentleman did not.

Q: Okay. And then it was put in the trunk?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And the two of you got in the car and left. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And that whole thing took about 15, 20 minutes?

A: Yes, I think that's correct.

Q: Was there any delay in waiting to speak Coleman, to anybody to find
the luggage?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did anybody approach Mr. Simpson for an autograph?

A: No

Q: Did anybody in your presence approach him to talk to him?

A: No, The area was empty. There wasn't anyone around.

Q: Okay. And when the bag was put in the trunk, did Mr. Simpson handle
it all?

A: No, just put it in the trunk, and I-

Q: Are you sure of that?

A: Yeah

Q: He got right in the car with you?

A: Yes

Q: You open the trunk for him?

A: I think so.

Q: You opened the trunk for him?

A: I think so.

Q: And then at that point the two of you left LAX and went directly to
your house?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you have a car phone in that Rolls Royce?

A: The car phone is a portable one: it isn't a fixed on in the car so
I can't recall if I brought the phone that day or not.

Q: Do you know if there were any phone calls made during the trip to
LAX in the car?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Or to your house in the car?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Okay. Did you and Mr. Simpson have any conversation going to the
airport to get his golf bag?

A: No, we did not.

Q: Okay. Did you ask him why he was interested in going to the airport
to get his golf bag?

A: No, we did not.

Q: Okay. Did you ask him why he was interested in going to the airport
to get airport to get his golf bag?

Mr. BAKER: I'm going to object. This could call for attorney-client
privileged communications.

MS. LEVINE: Instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have a communication with him regarding the golf bag other
than what you have previously testified?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.  MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

the way back to your house?

Nicole as of that point in time-

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: - just prior to her death

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

Q: And did you know whether they were seeing one another?

A: No.

Q: Did you know whether Mr. Simpson was seeing anyone else?

A: Yes.

Q: And who was that?

A: Paula Barbieri.

Q: And did you know whether-

MS. LEVINE: This is, did he know this at that time-

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah

MS. LEVINE: -before that noonish -

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When had you last spoken to or seen Paula Barbieri prior to June
12, 1994?

A: Denice and I had dinner with O.J. and Paula maybe - it's a total
guess, but maybe a year prior. I don't know. It was quite some time
prior.

Q: Not in 1994?

A: No

Q: And that's the last time you saw or spoke to Paula?

MS. LEVINE: Up to that noonish time on the 14th?

MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And did you have any conversations with O.J. Simpson in the year
1994 about his relationship with Nicole?

MR. BAKER: Before noon on June 14?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

A: Two.

A: At a restaurant. It was a birthday party for me, and he and Nicole
were invited.

Q: Who else was invited?

A: My sister, my brother-

Q: Can you name these people in addition to describing their
relationship?

A: Do I have to name them? I don't want them to - I mean it's nothing
to hide, but can I name them off the record or- [Excerpt Deleted]

Q: This was February what?

A: End of February sometime.

Q: When is your birthday?

A: It wasn't on my birthday, and that's why I don't know the date. My
birthday is the 22nd, and it could- I don't know. It was-

Q: Where was it?

A: Papadakis restaurant.

Q: And-

A: There could have been someone else, but I-how many is that? I think
it was only like 10 or 12 people.

Q: Okay. And the next time you saw Mr. Simpson in 1994 prior to June
12?

A: I saw him again in either May or June.

Q: Before June 12. Right?

A: Before June 12.

Q: Where-

A: It was probably May.

Q: Where did you see him?

A: At the park.

Q: Which park?

A: I don't know the name of it. My son had a baseball game, so I went
to the park. It's in the Palisades some- where. I don't know the name
of the park. Could be Palisades Park. I don't know.

Q: Was it just a coincidence that you ran into him there?

A: Yes, I didn't know he was going to be there, and I was just there
with my son, and somebody commented, O.J. Simpson is here," and I
looked over and I saw him playing basketball with Sydney, and so I
went over and we talked. We sat on the grass and talked for a while.

Q: Was there anyone else with him other than Sydney?

A: No.

Q: Was this on a Saturday?

A: No. I think it was during the week. It was in an afternoon. I don't
know when the games were. It was-yeah, I think it was a Wednesday or
Thursday, something like that.

Q: Is that the last time you saw Mr. Simpson prior to June 12?

A: I didn't see trim June 12th. June 13th, yes.

Q: Yes.

A: Yeah.

Q: And is that the last time you spoke to him prior to June to him
prior to June 12, 1994 or June 13?

A: Yes.

Q: Now, at the birthday party in February, did you have any
conversation with Mr. Simpson about his relationship with Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And I take it that you and he discussed nothing private that
time. Right?

A: Nothing.

Q: And you didn't discuss anything private with Nicole either.
Correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: And did the two of them appear normal to you?

A: Very much so, yes.

Q: When before February 22 or thereabouts, whenever your 50th birthday
party was, had you last seen or spoken to Mr. Simpson?

A: I don't know. I'm sure it would have been at least six months or
more.

Q: Or more?

A: Yeah.

Q: Did there come a time after you had dinner with Denice, Mr. Simpson
and Paula that you learned that he was seeing Nicole again?

A: No. I just saw him at my party.

Q: And that was news to you, that he was back with her or dating her?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you invite him yourself?

A: No. It was a surprise.

Q: I see. Denice threw that party for you?

A: No. I believe my mother did.

Q: Okay. And your mom contacted Mr. Simpson?

A: Either my mom or my sister or my brother. Somebody in my family
would have.

Q: Okay. So when Nicole showed up at this party, that was the first
time you learned that he was seeing her again. Is that right?

A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Okay. And after the party did you call him on the phone to chat
about what was happening-

A: No.

Q:-in his life?

A: No.

Q: Okay. The next time you saw or spoke to him was in the park in May
or June-

A: No, I'm sorry, that's incorrect. I spoke to him one other time on
the telephone in- I don't know-maybe April or May before I saw him at
the park. So I did speak to him-

Q: Okay. Who called whom?

A: I-either he or Nicole called me.

Q: At home?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. When was that?

A: I don't know. I think it was-I don't know. April or May.

Q: And what was discussed?

A: It was a legal nature that Nicole had wanted advice on.

MS. LEVINE: Can we go off the record for a minute?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 11:01.

(Discussion held off the record.)

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 11:15.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: We were talking about your conversation with Nicole in or about
April or May of 1994, and you said that you spoke to her on the phone;
it had something to do with a legal matter. We are going to await to
hear from her estate's attorney on whether you can disclose that
conversation.

MR. BAKER: Just so the record is clear, I think that she actually has
to have, and I don't know if we have to make a big deal about this,
but the guardian himself, Lou Brown, would have to waive the
attorney-client privilege. That's my understanding of the law.

MR. PETROCELLI: I think his attorney can do so but that's going to be
between them to decide. I am not going to get in the middle of that.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

MS. LEVINE: But if Mr. Kelly calls, I would like to talk to him-

MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely.

MS. LEVINE:-about this and give him the nature of the communication
and let him make up his mind, and we will await guidance from him, but
I think that we do need his input and perhaps Mr. Brown's input-I'm
not sure-on this issue.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you speak to Mr. Simpson in this telephone conversation?

A: Yes. He placed the call.

Q: And what did you and he discuss?

A: He just-it was just social at first for a minute or two, and then
he said, "Nic has a question and she needs to ask you something, legal
question." And I said, "Okay," and that's when I talked to Nicole.

Q: Had you ever represented Nicole prior to this occasion?

MR. BAKER: Vague as to the term "represent."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Acted as her lawyer.

A: I don't think I-I don't believe so.

Q: Okay. And how long was your conversation with Nicole about this
legal matter?

A: Maybe-well, there were several but on this day maybe it was 20
minutes,15, 20 minutes.

MS. LEVINE: And I would feel more comfortable if we could try to get
to Mr. Kelley before going into it in more detail.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am just trying to find out if it's two seconds or
something more substantive than that.

Q: And you said you had other conversations regarding this matter?

A: With Nicole yes.

Q: How many?

A: Maybe-maybe one or two after that initial-

Q: All by phone?

A: Yes.

Q: So about three conversations?

A: Yes.

Q: And did anyone else participate?

A: No.

Q: So nothing of substance that you can remember with Simpson on this
telephone call. Right?

A: That's correct. It was just social opening.

Q: Do you know where they were when they called you?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Okay. And the next time you saw Mr. Simpson-or spoke to him, I
should say, was when you saw him playing basketball with Sydney?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And how long did you spend talking to him at that time?

A: Oh, I would guess perhaps a half hour.

Q: And relate that discussion to us.

A: It was a discussion-since we hadn't really seen each other for
quite some time-when we saw each other it was at my birthday party,
and that was-you know, we really didn't talk much at that party, so
this was a time when he just asked "How are things going? What are you
doing?" He was a help in my divorce with Chris, and so he just asked,
"How are you getting over it? How are you doing with Chris?" She was
on-yeah, at this time she was married, so she was on with her- yeah, I
think she was married. She was on with her new life. So it was just
basic discussion about how my new life was without Chris, because
that's how we related-

Q: When did you get divorced from Chris?

A: I think it was '90.

Q: 1990?

A: Yes.

Q: It was a considerably long time before this conversation. Right?

A: Yes. Yes.

Q: Okay. What did O.J. Simpson say, if anything, about his life?

A: Not a lot. He just said that he knows how I feel about, you know,
going through the trauma that I went through, and he did discuss
Nicole going out with, you know, with the girls on a-I guess pretty
much a club scene or whatever they were doing...

Q: One second.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Anything else? Sorry to cut you off.

A: It was just Nicole's-Nicole's lifestyle, what she was doing, and we
didn't get into specifics. I really don't get into-I just don't want
to know certain specifics of things. So when he and I would talk, it
would be pretty general about how Nicole was in the party scene. She
was hanging out with these girls, and they were going out once or
twice a week and that type of thing.

Q: Was this a conversation before or after Memorial Day in May of
1994?

A: I don't know.

Q: If you looked at-

A: I just don't know.

Q:- a calendar, would that help you?

A: No. If I saw-no, it wouldn't. If I sew my son's - no, wouldn't
help, and it may.

Q: Okay. Did - what did O.J. Simpson say about understanding the
trauma that you had gone through in  your separation and divorce?

A: Well, he knew... I'm only hesitating because I don't want to speak
ill of my ex-wife, so that's my hesitation, but he knew what I went
through of her-I don't know how I can say it.

You know what? Ask me again.

Q: What did you say? "Ask me"-

A: Ask me again. I got lost.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you please repeat the question?

(Pending question read as follows:

Q: Okay. Did- what did O.J. Simpson say about understanding the trauma
that you had gone through in your separation and divorce?")

THE WITNESS: It was basically saying, "I know you feel I know what
you've gone through, and we're going through-it was reminiscing of our
life together, basically.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was your sense of what he was saying on this that he had been going
through the same sort of thing?

A: Yes, I got that feeling.

Q: At that time?

A: Yes. Well, I don't know if it was at that time but it was-

Q: I don't mean exactly that moment, but around that time of his life?

A: Yeah, I feel-I think so. He was going through pretty much some of
the similar experiences that I had gone through.

Q: Okay. What did he say about his relationship with Nicole in terms
of where it stood?

A: I don't think he ever said. I know -I got the feeling that he was
with Paula, and I got that 1 feeling, I guess, because - I don't know.
I don't know why, but I just had the feeling that he was with Paula
and that getting over a relationship take time just like it did with
me, so he was experiencing I think some of the same things I had.

Q: Let me see if I can understand this a little better. When you saw
Mr. Simpson at your birthday party a few months before, he was there
with Nicole, not Paula. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And your understanding was-

A: Everything was fine.

Q: Then you received a couple of telephone-or you had a couple of
telephone conversations with Nicole in which O.J. introduced her to
you to talk on the phone about these matters-

A: Correct.

MS. LEVINE: Introduced them at the one- first call. I don't think
there is any testimony-

MR. PETROCELLI: That's what I meant.

Q: In terms of, you know, he set that call Up, and your understanding
was that they were, you know, getting along at that time. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And then you had this next conversation in the park in May or June
of 1994. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And at that point your understanding, based on talking to O.J.
Simpson, is that he and Nicole are no longer together. Correct?

A: I got that feeling, yes.

Q: And did you ask him, "Hey, you know, what happened? What's going
on? You guys were just great together at my party, and what happened?"

A: No. I-I'm the kind of guy that if you O.J. want to tell me you can
tell me, but I really don't want to delve into it, and he's an open
enough guy that he'll usually tell you, but I just didn't want to pry.

Q: He told you that Nicole was going out with girlfriends?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he express any feeling of dissatisfaction to you about that?

A: Yes.

Q: What did he say in that regard?

A: Well, just that she's going out once or twice a week with-or, you
know, with this little circle of friends, and he wasn't real pleased
with that.

Q: Did he describe who those friends were?

A: I'm sure he did. I-and again I'm having trouble because I don't
know if I learned it later or at this time, but, I mean, it was kind
of-

MS. LEVINE: Based on that, unless you can separate it, if it's
something you may have learned-

THE WITNESS: I can't separate it.

MS. LEVINE:-afterwards-

THE WITNESS: I can't.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Prior to Nicole's murder, had you ever heard of Faye Resnick?

A: Yes.

Q: Had you met her?

A: Yes.

Q: Had you met her with O.J. Simpson?

A: No. I met her with my ex-wife.

Q: And was Nicole present when you met her, Miss Resnick?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Had you ever been in the company of Miss Resnick and Nicole at the
same time?

A: Maybe at a party, but not-I mean not what you would consider a
frequent occurrence.

Q: Not on a vacation together?

A: No.

Q: Not out to dinner together?

A: No, I never went to dinner with Faye or any of that. I didn't
socialize with Faye.

Q: Okay. And had you socialized at all with Cora Fischman?

A: Never.

Q: Did you even know who Cora Fischman was prior to June 12,1994?

A: I heard her name, but I don't believe I had met her.

Q: Did you understand that based on your conversation in the park with
Mr. Simpson, that Nicole was socializing with Faye Resnick?

A: Yes.

[Excerpt Deleted]

Q: What did you say in response to that?

A: I said, "I know. I've been through it."

Q: In connection with the separation and breakup of your marriage?

A: Yes.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson say anything about men whom Nicole was dating?

MS. LEVINE: In that conversation?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q: Or seeing.

A: Well, I recall the name Joseph, a guy named Joseph, which she had
been dating.

Q: Joseph [Name Deleted]?

A: I don't know his name. Joseph.

Q: Is it your understanding that he mentioned in this conversation,
May or June of 1994, that Nicole was seeing Joseph?

A: I believe that would have been the time because, I mean, that's the
only time that we had a somewhat in-depth conversation, so I would
think it would have been at that time.

Q: And it's clear in your mind that this last-that this conversation
in the park was the last time you sew or spoke to Mr. Simpson prior to
Nicole's murder. Right?

A: Most definitely.

Q: That stands out. Right?

A: I know that.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson indicate to you how it came to be that he and
Nicole had split up again?

A: No, we didn't get into that.

Q: Did he seem to be, in what he was saying to you, unhappy with the
fact that they had split up again?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

THE WITNESS: No, I didn't get that. I didn't get that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was it your sense that he had indicated the breakup?

A: I don't know. I don't know.

Q: Didn't he tell you that Nicole had ended the relationship?

A: I don't know that.

Q: You don't remember that?

A: No, I don't remember that, no. .

Q: Did he tell you that he was seeing a therapist?

A: No. No.

Q: Did he tell you that he was a bit depressed about the situation
with Nicole?

A: No. He wouldn't-he wouldn't talk about things like that to me, I
don't think.

Q: In your relationship with him, even if he was feeling things like
depression, he would not discuss them with you?

A: Not usually, no.

Q: He would keep his inner feelings private to himself?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he say anything about a birthday present that he had given to
Nicole in the month of May?

A: I can't separate whether-I know what you're referring to, but I
don't know if I learned it as my dudes as an attorney or whether he
said something. I can't answer that.

Q: Did he tell you that she had returned a gift of jewelry he had
given her?

A: Again-

MS. LEVINE: Only answer that if you can separate it out.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't know when I learned of that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did he talk to you about a conflict he was having with Nicole
regarding an IRS issue?

MS. LEVINE: Can we have a moment, please? I am just concerned when
this conversion would have taken place and whether it would have been
in the context of a legal consultation or not.

I don't-so I am going to caution Mr. Kardashian to think about it
before-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: This wasn't the legal conversation, was it?

A: I don't think I could answer that question. Based on privilege, I
don't think I could answer that.

Q: You gave legal advice in this convention in the park?

A: No. No, I did not.

Q: Okay. So no part of that conversation

A: That's correct, is privileged.

Q:-is a privileged conversation. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: What's the reason that you can't answer my question about whether
he discussed with you a conflict he was having with Nicole about the
IRS?

A: Well, because it's-part of that is the subject matter of
conversations earlier.

Q: Earlier with whom?

A: With Mr. Simpson and Nicole.

Q: Well, you had not-you had testified about certain conversations
with Nicole.

A: Correct.

Q: Private conversations, not with Mr. Simpson. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did those involve the IRS issue?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That could call for privileged information, and
until we hear from Mr. Kelly, I am going to instruct him not to
answer.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any- did you render any legal advice to Mr. Simpson
about the IRS issue at any time before Nicole's murder?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. So you had-did you ever talk to Mr. Simpson-Well, withdrawn.

Before this talk in the park had you ever discussed with Mr. Simpson
an issue involving Nicole and the IRS?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Okay. And did you talk with Mr. Simpson about it on this occasion
in the park in May or June of 1994?

A: I'm gonna be vague because I don't know if it was at this
conversation or whether I heard it later, so I can't-I can't separate
it. I don't know.

Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you whether or not he had sent Nicole a letter
in this conversation in the park?

A: no. I think this was- I think when I saw him in the park could have
been prior to that. I don't know.

Q: Did he tell you he was contemplating sending the letter?

A: No, no, we did not discuss...

Q: Did he tell you that she was using his Rockingham address as her
address?

A: He could have, but I don't-I don't know.

Q: Did you get the sense that things were-they were not getting along?

A: I got that sense, yes. But I didn't get the sense it was a
combative thing I got the sense that " I'm not with Nicole-

Q: Well, why do you say that you didn't get the sense it was
"combative"? Why do you say that?

A: Because it was more of a general discussion of all of the
reminiscences and of the feelings that I had gone through and just the
problems that I had had. And so he was relating those problems to
himself and-so I didn't-it wasn't-in other words, the conversation
wasn't a harsh one of, "Well, Nicole, she's this, this and this,"
or-it wasn't that type of a conversation.

Q: More of a philosophical one?

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: Did he do most of the talking?

A: That's usually the case, but here I think I did quite a bit of the
talking in this case.

Q: Okay. Were you trying to give him any advice or guidance?

A: No. When I said I did most of the talking, it was about some of the
pain I was feeling, and since he had counseled Chris and talked to
her, he knew intimately what I had gone through, and he was really-I
think I did quite a bit of that talking.

Q: Did he tell you what his plans were in his personal life at that
time?

A: No.

Q: Did he say anything about other women in his life, other than
Nicole?

A: He could have talked about Paula, but I can't-I can't recall.

Q: Okay. Did he tell you what was the problem with-in his
relationship- with Nicole that led to their breakup?

A: No. No. I'd have to say no, I don't think so.

Q: Did he tell you anything at all about what had gone down in their
relationship?

A: Well, not that anything had gone down. It was just that the-again,
I related- my impression of that discussion was that Nicole was having
a mid-life crisis or Nicole was changing a little bit. She was skinny;
she felt good about herself; she looked great, and she was exercising
her youth, I think, is the best way I could put it, and that's why she
was going out with the girls and hanging out here and that type of
thing. It was just an indication of what women through in their mid
thirties.

Q: all of what you have just said-

A: Excuse me. Some - a few women, maybe.

Q: All of what you just said is what you gleaned from this
conversation in the park with Mr. Simpson in May or June of 1994.
Correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Can you recall anything else that was said in that conversation?

A: No. That was the basic-me telling him things, he telling me things,
and it was just the back and forth of our-of this period in our life,
what we both had gone through.

Q: Have you ever made a note of that conversation a written record of
it, at any time?

A: No. There was never any need to, no.

Q: Even after Nicole's murder-

A: No.

Q:-did you do so?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you know that Mr. Simpson went to Palm Springs during
Memorial Day weekend in May of 1994?

MS. LEVINE: Did he know that then, or did he learn it-

MR. PETROCELLI: At that time.

MS. LEVINE:-sometime after-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: I am only asking about your knowledge prior to Nicole and Ron
Goldman's murder.

A: I learned of it, and I think my ex-wife told me, but I don't know
when I learned that.

Q: Learned it after the fact?

A: I don't know didn't tell me I'm sure I learned it from my ex-wife.

Q: Did you have any conversations with Skip Taft prior to Nicole's
death about O.J. Simpson or Nicole?

A: No.

Q: At any time?

A: No, not at any time.

Q: Taft has not been your lawyer, has he?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Did Mr. Simpson in this conversation describe any of the
things that Nicole was doing in her so-called mid-life crisis, as you
put it?

MS. LEVINE: Besides what he already talked about?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: In more specifics.

A: Not really, no. No. It was basically the going out and just, you
know, feeling good about herself, I guess.

Q: Now, you previously testified that you heard about this incident in
1989 by reading about it .J in the newspaper. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. And at that time you never talked to Mr. Simpson about it.
Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Or Nicole. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And I think you said on Larry King that you were shocked when you
read about this. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Is there any particular reason why you did not inquire of Mr.
Simpson or Nicole what had happened in this incident at the time?

A: There's no reason. It's just the type of person I am. I feel if he
wants to talk to me about it, he will, but I'm not a nosy kinda guy to
go ask him.

Q: At no time prior to Nicole's death did Mr. Simpson ever talk to you
about what had happened between Nicole and him on January 1, 1989. Is
that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And at no time did Nicole tell you. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And prior to Nicole's death had you heard from any other person
about what had happened?

MS. LEVINE: Besides the press report he talked about?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Other than what you read in the newspapers. For example, from Chris
or from mutual friends or colleagues or Skip Taft or anyone.

A: I could have learned a little more. I learned the most in the
trial, but-

MS. LEVINE: You can't go into that.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

-but prior to that I could have learned a few bits and pieces, but not
very much.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was this- do you remember what newspaper you read about this '89
incident in?

A: I'm sure it was the L.A. Times.

Q: Okay. And did you talk to anybody about it once you read it?

A: I could have talked to Chris.

Q: Was Chris married and living with you at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: In January of 1989?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever hear from anybody with whom you may have spoken about
this incident that O.J. Simpson had engaged in this kind of behavior
before?

A: I'm sorry-

MS. LEVINE: Prior to the time of the -was it the 14th at noonish?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't understand the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: My questions are focused to what you knew prior to Nicole's murder

A: Okay.

Q: -okay, on June 12, 1994, and what I am asking is: When you first
learned about this incident in '89  involving Mr. Simpson and Nicole
where they had a physical altercation that you read about in the
newspaper, did you learn that Mr. Simpson had engaged in this kind of
behavior before in any conversation that you may have had with people
about it?

A: No, I never heard that before.

Q: Okay. So this-when you read about this incident in the newspaper,
was that the very first time in your life that you had ever heard of
Mr. Simpson involved in any kind of physical altercation with another
woman?

A: Yes.

Q: Including Marquerite?

A: Yes.

Q: Never heard any such thing regarding Marquerite and him. Is that
right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And never between Nicole and him. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did you follow the progress of Mr. Simpson's legal proceeding
concerning this 1989 incident?

A: Well, I knew what happened, but I really didn't follow it. I just-I
learned the outcome.

Q: How did you learn that?

A: I believe again through the newspaper, or I could have learned from
Mr. Weitzman. We were friends, and we would lunch often. I could have
learned it from Howard, but I don't know.

Q: What did Mr. Weitzman tell you about what had transpired?

A: He didn't give me any details. He just-when you asked about the
outcome, Howard could have told me, "We are gonna plead no contest,"
or I could have read it. I don't know.

Q: Was it your understanding from what you learned about this incident
that Mr. Simpson hit Nicole?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: Actually, I can only talk about what I knew subsequent,
what I learned through the trial, and I don't think I could discuss
that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: I am not asking about that.

A: But prior to that time, no, I-I didn't know what really happened
other than what I read in the newspaper.

Q: Okay. You had never seen Mr. Simpson act in any way, again prior to
Nicole's death, in a violent manner towards another person?

A: I had never seen him act like that, no.

Q: Had you ever seen him lose his temper and yell and scream at
another person?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Had you ever seen him shout profanities in anger at another
person?

A: I don't believe so, no. I mean, I've heard him use profanity, but I
don't think I've heard him do it in an angry way to somebody.

Q: Have you ever seen him act in a way that you thought was out of
control?

A: No.

Q: Okay. You were shocked, I take it, when you heard Mr. Simpson yell
and scream on the 911 tape. Right?

A: Very much so, yes.

Q: And that was a side of Mr. Simpson that you had never seen before.
Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Does it surprise you that Mr. Simpson could engage in such
behavior?

A: I was-I was very surprised, very shocked, when I heard the tape.

Q: And you had the type of relationship with Mr. Simpson where he
would not confide or share in you things that were happening in his
private life. Is that right?

A: That's correct. Our relationship was very social for many years,
and so when we were together, it was usually Nicole and I and Chris
and O.J.

Q: When you were together and you testified previously that you
socialized with Mr. Simpson and Nicole quite often over the years, did
you see Mr. Simpson act in a jealous manner towards Nicole?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

THE WITNESS: He was protective of her, and she was protective of him.
They were both protective.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did he exhibit jealousy, is what I'm saying'

A: No, I didn't see that.

Q: Nothing more than-

A: Nothing more than-

Q: -what you would ordinarily expect in a couple?

A: Yes, I think so. I never saw any outward manifestation of anything
other than that.

Q: He didn't appear to be particularly controlling of her or towards
her, based on your observations?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

THE WITNESS: That is vague. mean, "controlling"-

MS. LEVINE: Can you answer it?

THE WITNESS: Well, I would like it restated a different way, if you
could.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You know what a controlling person is:

Someone who's always trying to dictate what the other person should
do.

A: Sure.

Q: And in the relationship between O.J. and Nicole, did it strike you
that Mr. Simpson acted that way toward her?

A: I didn't see that a lot, no.

Q: Did you see Nicole, other then the one occasion you described in
the limousine in New York, ever display a bad temper towards Mr.
Simpson in your presence?

A: No. I wouldn't call it a bad temper, no.

Q: Have you ever seen Nicole demean Mr. Simpson in your presence,
berate him, demean him?

A: No, other than a normal, "Oh, O.J., what are you doing?" I mean,
nothing of consequence, no.

Q: Did she, based on your observations of the two of them, appear to
be volatile in her temperament?

A: Out of the two, I thought she was more volatile than he, yes.

Q: She would lose it more quickly?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that something that Mr. Simpson would talk to you about from
time to time?

A: Somewhat, but not much in depth. I mean, if I were there and saw
something and "See what she does? That type of thing.

Q: Prior to the time that Mr. Simpson and Nicole were divorced, did
Mr. Simpson ever share with you any problems that he was having in his
marriage?

A: No.

Q: Did Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did either of them ever talk to you about infidelity on Mr.
Simpson's part?

A: No, Nicole never- never discussed that with me.

Q: What about Mr. Simpson, did he talk to you about that?

A: He didn't. No, he didn't.

Q: Who did?

A: I don't know. I had just heard things, but I couldn't tell you-

Q: From whom?

A: - specifically. I don't even know. You know, you just hang around a
group of eight, ten people or something and somebody will say
something. But I had heard this, but I never had any direct knowledge
of it.

Q: What you had heard is that while Mr. Simpson was married to Nicole,
that he was being unfaithful?

A: That's correct.

Q: And do you know the names of any of the women with whom he-whom he
was dating or seeing during his marriage to Nicole?

MS. LEVINE: If he does, can we put them off the record, give them to
you?

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, let's-

Q: Do you know the names of any of them?

A: I just had heard the name of one person, but I don't know-you know,
I don't know for a fact if he was ever with this person, but I heard
her name.

Q: Okay. You want to write it down on this piece of paper? And then I
will decide whether it's necessary to attach it. It's probably-it's
not a secret.

(Witness complies.)

MS. LEVINE: Yeah, I just don't want -I mean-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Now, have you ever spoken to this person whose name you just wrote?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And who did you hear that Mr. Simpson-from whom did you hear
that Mr. Simpson- from whom did you hear that Mr. Simpson was involved
in a relationship with her?

A: I don't-that I don't know.

Q: Do you know anything about the nature or extent of the
relationship?

A: Know nothing about-

Q: And do you know this person?

A: No, I do not. Never met the person.

Q: Okay. You don't know how you learned this either?

A: No. I just would have heard it in conversation by somebody. I don't
know.

Q: Do you know how long the relationship lasted?

A: I know nothing about it. I really aren't-I'm not that kind of
person to get into it.

Q: When Mr. Simpson split up with Nicole in 1991, early 1992, did you
talk to him about what was happening to him?

A: I don't know if I did not. I could have but I don't recall.

Q: Do you remember whether he told you the reasons why he and Nicole
were splitting up?

A: No. No. During this period since my divorce, I hadn't seen him very
often.

Q: In the year 1992 you did not see him very often?

A: I-yeah, maybe once or twice.

Q: And do you remember anything he said to you about Nicole?

A: No. No.

Q: That's all you saw him in 1992: Once or twice?

A: Probably from 1990 to 1994, maybe I saw him once or twice each
year.

Q: Okay.

A: Maybe three times. I mean, but it wasn't-

Q: Were you ever out with him and someone other than Nicole other than
that one occasion where you had dinner with Paula?

A: No. I-we could have gone out with he and Paula one other time
perhaps, but-

Q: In October of 1993 when Nicole and Mr. Simpson had the fight that
resulted in her calling 911, did you learn about that at that time?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Was the first time you heard about that in the trial?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. When-going back to your conversation in the park with Mr.
Simpson, did Mr. Simpson explain to you how he knew who Nicole was
going out with?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Did he explain to you-did he mention to you that he was following
her?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Did he say anything to indicate to you how he knew about her
activities?

A: No.

Q: Did he say anything to you in that conversation about the children,
Sydney and Justin?

A: Yeah, we talked about-well, Sydney was there; we were watching her,
and just-we just basically talked generally about our children, mine
and his.

Q: Did he say anything to you about the effect on the children of his
splitting up with Nicole?

A: No. He always, and I don't know if it was at this time or not, but
he always said what a good mother Nicole was and how, you know, he
could leave town and go on a business trip and not have to worry about
the kids and how it was great that she was such a good mother. Beyond
that, I don't really recall, you know, anything in depth about the
children.

Q: Prior to Nicole's death did you know about an affair between or
relationship between Marcus Allen and Nicole?

A: No. Never heard about it until the trial.

MR. BAKER: Just to be cautionary, when he asks you questions about
prior to your representation of Mr. Simpson or prior to June 14, just
a caution I don't want any answer to be -to lead to the conclusion
that you learned that information during the trial.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you ever spoken to Marcus Allen about whether or not he had a
relationship with Nicole?

MS. LEVINE: Up to the time of the murders as opposed-

MR. PETROCELLI: At any time.

MS. LEVINE:-to what he may have learned-

MR. PETROCELLI: I am talking about a direct conversation with Marcus
Allen.

MS. LEVINE: But if he interviewed him as interviewing someone as a
witness-

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think that would be privileged, but let me ask
him

Q: Did you ever interview him as a witness?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And did you ever have a conversation with him about whether
or not he had a relationship with Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did the subject ever come up in any conversation that you've had
with Marcus Allen?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever talk to Katherine about that, his wife?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever spoken to any witness about that relationship?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for work product.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Are you going to instruct him not to answer?

MS. LEVINE: I am. Thank you.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you ever spoken to any person who told you, other than O.J.
Simpson, that Marcus Allen and Nicole had an affair?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Work product.

MS. LEVINE: Yes, and to the extent it covers anything prior to the
time of the 14th of June, 199--

MR. BAKER: 4.

MS. LEVINE:-4, go ahead and answer, and put that in your answer so
it's clear.

THE WITNESS: Well, prior to 1994 -to June of '94, I had not spoken to
Marcus Allen or anyone else about any purported affair.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And afterwards?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for attorney work product information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Excluding O.J. Simpson.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Going back to your time with Mr. Simpson prior to noonish June
14,did-you testified that you observed a rather substantial cut on Mr.
Simpson's finger. Do you remember that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And-

MR. BAKER: Dan-

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We better change the tape here.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 1 of Volume II. The time
is approximately 11:57, and we are off the record.

(Discussion held off the record.)

(At the hour of 11:57 a.m., a luncheon recess was taken, the
deposition to resume at 12:57 p.m.)

(At the hour of 1:06 p.m., the deposition of ROBERT G. KARDASHIAN was
resumed at the same place, the same persons being present.)

(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 201 through 203 were marked for identification
by reporter and are attached hereto. Plaintiffs' Exhibits 204 and 205
were marked for identification by the reporter and were retained by
Mr. Petrocelli.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is approximately
1:06. This is the beginning of tape No. 2 of Volume II.

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Off the record we have marked some exhibits, which would I like to
go over with you.

MS. LEVINE: Are those these?

MR. BAKER: Yes. .

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Now, you have your own copies here. Here are the reporter's copy.

Starting with Exhibit 201, that's the subpoena duces tecum that was
served on you, have you seen this document before?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And have you searched your files for all responsive documents?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Have you produced them?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Have you withheld any documents responsive to the subpoena duces
tecum?

A: Not to my knowledge, no.

MS. LEVINE: Except the privileged documents? Is that what you're
asking?

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you served some objections.

MS. LEVINE: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: They don t identify the documents that are privileged.

MS. LEVINE: Right.

MR. PETROCELLI: So it's not clear to me what is privileged and what is
not privileged.

MS. LEVINE: Well, the problem was the breadth of the subpoena included
any document that he got in  the course of the representation of the
criminal trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't we work on that at some point at the end of
this deposition.

MS. LEVINE: Okay, or you and I can work on it even afterwards.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's what I mean. Okay?

MS. LEVINE: Yeah. Okay. That's fine. But anything specifically that
you asked about related to-you had a date perimeter with reference to
some of them, and anything that fell within those date parameters I
think has been produced. It's the broad category where it says
anything related to O.J. Simpson.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you have any copies of photographs of 61 O.J. Simpson and Nicole
that you had prior to June 12, 1994?

A: I looked. I couldn't find any. I may have one or two, but I
couldn't find any.

Q: Any videotapes?

A: Yeah, there was a videotape of yeah, I have one at a party about 10
years ago or so.

Q: Anything later than that?

A: I could-I don't have it, but I can't-I can't recall if my nephew
took any video at this birthday or not. He could have. I don't-I
don't- a Have you ever seen any?

A: No, I haven't seen it. If he did, you know, I just haven't seen it.

Q: Any letters or notes from either O.J. Simpson or Nicole that you
had in your possession or control-

A: No.

Q:-prior to June 12?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Exhibit 202 is a-you recognize that document?

A: No, I've never seen it before.

Q: Okay. That's a transcript of the appearance you made on Larry King
Live," October 6, 1995. You made such an appearance?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And the statements that you made on that show were true and
accurate?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for the
attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not asking him to divulge any communications. I
am not trying to get into that debate with you. I am simply asking
whether he said any-the things he said were at the time he said l them
true.

MR. BAKER: My objection is that if Mr. Kardashian made any statements
on October 6, 1995 about O.J. Simpson and may not have been aware that
O.J. Simpson was not waiving the attorney-client privilege, we are not
waiving it now, and I want Mr. Kardashian to be informed of that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Without waiving the attorney-client privilege, just tell me whether
or not the statements that you made on the Larry King show were true.

MR. BAKER: I don't believe he can separate that from his
attorney-client communications.

MS. LEVINE: So I will instruct him at this point not to answer the
question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you make the statements that appear in this transcript that are
attributed to you?

A: Yes.

Q: By the "transcript," I am referring to Exhibit 202.

A: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: And we are taking-we didn't review it

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I haven't read it.

MS. LEVINE:-take the time to go word for word, but presuming it's a
word-for-word transcript of the interview, that would be the answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And based on some of the passages that I have previously read to
you and discussed, you don't have any reason to believe that the
transcript is inaccurate. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. The next document has been marked 21 as 203, and it actually
consists of a grouping of documents. Do you recognize these documents?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And what are they?

A: Looks like my calendar and my call sheets from June 13,'94 to-it
looks like from June 9th, '94 through and including June 19th, '94.

Q: Now, the call sheet begins on June 13-01 excuse me. The calendar
begins on June 13. Correct?

A: Well, there is a-back here (Indicating),I think it's out of order,
June 9, the last page.

Q: I see. Is this a document that was maintained in your office?

A: It was one that I maintained myself. I carry a date book around
with me.

Q: The items-the entries on this document, on this calendar, are in
your handwriting?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: All of them?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: There are some entries that are blacked out. Why is that?

MS. LEVINE: In discussions with Mr. Kardashian, they contain
information that has nothing to do with this case, and we considered
it private and completely irrelevant. A complete copy has been
maintained, if we ever have a problem, for lodging with the court.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The next document appears to be a listing of incoming calls on-

MS. LEVINE: Excuse me.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-June 13?

MS. LEVINE: I wasn't complete, and let me-I apologize for interrupting
you, Mr. Petrocelli. I don't have the complete copy in front of me, so
I'm not sure whether there was any information on there that was also
privileged. I know there was on the call sheets, but I don't know
whether there was on here, and I can't recall by looking at it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, there wouldn't be privileged information on any
of the entries prior to June 14. Correct?

MS. LEVINE: That's right.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The-

MS. LEVINE: And I apologize.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The other documents in the package collectively marked as 203
consist of your incoming call sheets?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: For the days June 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17,1994. Is that right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And whose handwriting are these entries?

A: Either Barbara Stockton or Nicole Pulvers.

Q: And did they make these entries at the offices of Movie Tunes?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: At your home?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Is that still your current home?

A: Yes, sir.

[Excerpt Deleted]

Q: And that's the house where the office of Movie Tunes is located?

A: Yes. Yes, it is.

Q: Is it a separate part of the house where you have an office?

A: Yes, several - it's segregated where there is several offices at
that home.

Q: And you still reside in that home. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you have not moved out. Right?

A: No.

Q: But Miss [Name Deleted] doesn't live there anymore. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Where does she now live?

A: Century City.

Q: Okay. You are no longer engaged to her?

A: That's correct.

Q: Now, I notice that on the call sheets, the incoming call sheets,
there are a number of entries that are blacked out. Why is that?

A: To the best of my knowledge, these were pretty much the business
calls that came in during that time period, and so we redacted those
calls.

Q: Do you have a list of outgoing calls?

A: Well, there is attached here at the back-

MS. LEVINE: By each day there is a -the last page is outgoing calls.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is the list of outgoing calls that's attached to each of the pages
of incoming calls accurate and complete?

A: To the best of my knowledge. Sometimes when I make the call myself,
then we don't write it down.

Q: And when someone makes it for you, they write it down?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. I am going to come back to this and go through the entries in
a little more detail.

A: Okay.

MR. BAKER: These are collectively marked as Exhibit?

MR. PETROCELLI: 203.

Q: The next document is Exhibit 204, and that will be omitted from the
transcript, but I want you to verify that that contains the name of
the woman who you had heard rumored was seeing O.J. Simpson during his
marriage to Nicole.

A: Yes, it does.

Q: And the next exhibit, 205, which is also not part of the
transcript, contains the names of all the persons whom you currently
recall attended the birthday party for you held on or about February
22, 1994?

A: That's correct.

Q: I have a few more follow-up questions regarding Mr. Schiller.

Do you know whether there currently exists a manuscript?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Vague. A manuscript as to anything in the whole
world?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. A manuscript of a proposed book to be sold.

MS. LEVINE: I object-

MR. BAKER: By whom?

MR. PETROCELLI: By Mr. Schiller.

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Object on the grounds of California privacy rights.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you know whether there currently exists a proposed manuscript of
a book to be sold by you?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you know whether there currently exists a proposed manuscript of
a book in which you have furnished information-with respect to which
you have furnished information?

MR. BAKER: Same.

MS. LEVINE: Objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Are you attempting with Mr. Schiller to market a
fictionalized account of the O.J. Simpson story?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Or the murders of Nicole and Ron Goldman?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. .

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you been to New York with Mr. Schiller in search of a
publisher?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Do you currently have a publishing deal for a book?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And do you know whether Mr. Schiller

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection, as well as attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You testified before the Grand Jury in this case. Is that correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Actually prior to the murder trial of Mr. Simpson. Correct?

A: Correct.

MS. LEVINE: To be clear, there was no Grand Jury in which he was
involved that related to this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: I understand. I am just going to clarify that.

Q: That related to Mr. Cowlings'-

A: Yes, sir.

Q: -proceeding?

A: (Nods head.)

Q: You have to answer audibly.

A: Yes.

Q: Now, prior to your testifying did you object to having to testify
before the court?

A: I believe we did.

Q: And were you ordered to testify by the court?

A: Yes. It was a limited order.

Q: And Mr. Simpson's lawyers made objections and participated in the
court proceedings that led to the limited order?

A: I don't know if Mr. Simpson's attorneys did or Miss Levine did.

MS. LEVINE: It's - as you may or may not know-I don't know what your
experience in the criminal field is-the Grand Jury proceeding is
different than most other proceedings because it's not adversary, in
the sense that nobody can appear on behalf of the person that's
potentially accused of the crime. So any objections that are made have
to be made in advance very broadly, and generally the feeling is that
any- thing goes within the Grand Jury, and then if there is a problem
later, it's sorted out later.

What happened in this case was basically the judge said it's not a
Simpson Grand Jury; it's a Cowlings Grand Jury, and nothing related to
Simpson should be asked. But, of course, Mr. Simpson's lawyers could
not be present and I couldn't be present just because of the nature of
the Grand Jury.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: But the court issued an order directing you to testify in some
limited capacity prior to your testifying. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And was the testimony that you gave true and accurate?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: I am going-I,

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you read it recently?

MR. BAKER: I am just going to object to this line of questions. The
standard as it relates to Grand Jury testimony, as Miss Levine has
just mentioned, is different than it is here, and under California law
any act done in the presence of an attorney can be a communication
pursuant to San Francisco vs. Superior Court. I am going to object to
this line of questioning.

MS. LEVINE: Can you repeat the question?

MR. PETROCELLI: He already answered it. So I am finished with the
line, but you can have him-you can repeat the question and answer if
you would like.

MS. LEVINE: No, that's fine.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: We were talking before the lunch break about the cut on Mr.
Simpson's finger, and I think I had asked you whether you had observed
the cut and whether it was a substantial cut, I think was your word.

Do you recall that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Now, focusing for a moment on when you initially saw Mr.
Simpson for the first time, that would have been at Rockingham when
you saw him exit Leroy Taft's automobile?

A: Correct.

Q: And then go into the Rockingham property?

A: Correct.

Q: And then you later saw him get handcuffed?

A: I didn't see trim get handcuffed-

Q: In handcuffs.

A: -but I was aware he was handcuffed.

Q: You saw him in handcuffs?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And how long, by the way, was he in the house or out of your
view from the moment you saw him exit Mr. Taft's car till you saw him
in the handcuffs?

A: I'd be guessing. I thought it was maybe 10, 15 minutes, but I could
be wrong.

Q: And when he-when you saw him handcuffed, did you then see what
happened to him next?

A: No. All I recall is the handcuffs were removed subsequently there
to, and I don't know how long a period of time that was.

Q: And you didn't have a chance to talk to him at all. Right?

A: No, I did not speak to him.

Q: Did you see his finger at that time?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you have any knowledge that he had been cut?

A: No.

Q: Or had a cut?

A: No.

Q: Now, when you drove to-you met Cathy Randa there at the Rockingham
property and chatted with her a bit, got in the car and drove over to
the office of Mr. Simpson in Brentwood. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And during that time did she tell you that Mr. Simpson had a cut?

A: No, she did not.

Q: Did you learn about the cut?

A: Not at that time, no.

Q: Did you have any conversation about Mr. Simpson's whereabouts the
evening before, with Cathy Randa?

A: I could have. I just don't recall that conversation, what we talked
about there from to the office.

Q: Did you and she talk about the fact that the police may suspect Mr.
Simpson in this crime?

A: No. we did not discuss that.

Q: Okay. Did you have any idea why all the police were there?

MS. LEVINE: At the-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: At the Rockingham house.

MS. LEVINE: Any idea?

MR. PETROCELLI: Why all these police were there and why he was being
handcuffed.

THE WITNESS: No, I really did not relate any of it. I just knew there
was - his wife was murdered, and I figured they were there to find out
what was going on.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. In your own thinking did you form the opinion that the police
may suspect Mr. Simpson in this, since they were handcuffing him?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: No, at that time, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And no conversation with Cathy Randa about that at all, "Why is he
being handcuffed? What did he do?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Did you ask Cathy any questions about where O.J. Simpson had been
the night before?

A: No. It really didn't enter my mind at that time.

Q: Okay. When you first saw Mr. Simpson later on that day, did you and
he talk about what happened at the police department?

MS. LEVINE: Was that clear as to time here?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: This is in the afternoon of

MR. BAKER: June 13.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-June 13th at the Brentwood office when you next saw him. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: He arrived there with Mr. Taft?

A: And Mr. Weitzman.

Q: Mr. Weitzman?

A: Yes.

Q: And you were all talking. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And did he discuss what had happened at the police station?

A: No. I asked, you know, "How did it go?" or What happened?"

And he just said, "I answered their, questions, and it was"-he didn't
get into - he didn't get into - he didn't give me any information
other than, "I just answered whatever they asked of me."

Q: Did he make any complaints about what happened at the police
station?

A: No, I don't believe so.

Q: Did he say that he had in any way been mishandled by the policemen?

A: No.

Q: Or treated badly by the police officers?

A: No.

Q: Or the detectives?

A: No.

Q: Did he say anything to you-Withdrawn. Did he express any
dissatisfaction with how he had been treated or handled by the police?

A: No.

Q: Did he say anything to you about how his statement had been
recorded?

A: I don't recall him saying that, no.

Q: Did he tell you that it had been tape-recorded?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Okay. Did he discuss the kinds of questions he was asked and the
answers that he gave?

A: No, he didn't go into the questions.

Q: Okay. Do you know if he was then on any medication?

A: That I do not know.

Q: Okay. Is that when you saw his cut?

A: I don't- I don't remember. I mean, I could have, but I don't recall
if that was when I first noticed it or not.

Q: Did it have a bandage on it or Band-Aid or any kind of dressing?

A: I was asked that last time. I don't believe that he did. I don't
think so.

Q: Now, you testified that he said he cut himself in the Chicago hotel
room after he was apprised of Nicole's death?

A: That's correct.

Q: And that he backhanded a glass?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did he say he backhanded a glass?

A: No, he did not. I-all I know is he said that he was in-he learned
of her death, he was in Chicago in a hotel room in the bathroom, and
he either had a glass or something, and the glass broke or he broke
the glass or something (Indicating), and he cut his finger.

Q: Did he demonstrate how it happened?

A: No, he did not.

Q: When he described what happened, did he make any motions with his
hands and arms to indicate how the cut occurred, as you were just
doing in your answer?

A: I don't- I don't believe so. I don't think so.

Q: Okay. Did he say that he cut his finger when his hand struck the
glass?

A: No, I don't think he said that.

Q: Did he say how the cut actually occurred?

A: No. He just said he cut it-a glass broke or he broke a glass,
something like that.

Q: Was the sense of what he said, in so far as you understood it, that
he broke a glass in-as a result of being upset over hearing the news
of Nicole's death?

A: Very much so. That was the context.

Q: And you got the sense from what he said that he threw the glass in
anger?

A: I didn't get the impression he threw it. Somehow I got the
impression, and I don't know if it was from what he told me or just my
own interpretation, but I got the impression that he was in the
bathroom and either-

Q: While he was on the phone?

A: No. Somehow I think he put the phone down, but it's just what I
think occurred. I don't recall if he told me-

Q: I'm only-I only want you to tell me what he said. Forgive me for
interrupting you.

A: Yeah. No, that's fine. I can't recall what he said. I'm just giving
you my impression. I really don't know what he said.

Q: Was it your impression from what he said when he told you about
this incident that he had put the phone down; then gone into the
bathroom.

A: That was my impression.

Q: He went into that level of detail in this conversation?

A: Well, I can't-see, I have a problem separating the conversations.

MR. BAKER: Well, then I will object.

THE WITNESS: And that's my problem. I just-

M R. BAKER: Invades the attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer anything that's beyond
the conversation he had before noonish on the 14th of June, 1994.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was-did you suggest any medical treatment for this cut?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did it appear that he needed any treatment?

A: No. It appeared, you know, to-it wasn't oozing or bleeding, and so
it appeared that it was scabbing.

Q: Looked like it was scabbing?

A: Yes.

Q: Did he say whet time he sustained the cut?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Did you see-how many cuts did you see?

A: I just sew that-the cut on the top of his middle finger on his left
hand.

Q: And how long was the cut?

A: I'm not good at this. Maybe a half an inch, maybe a quarter. I-it
covered-it went past his knuckle, so I guess maybe a half an inch.

Q: Did you see any other cuts on his hands or fingers?

MS. LEVINE: Before the noonish on the 14th of June?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: Not that readily apparent to me, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you see any cuts on him at any time the rest of that week prior
to his arrest?

MS. LEVINE: To the extent that it calls for anything after the 14th of
June, noonish, I object on privilege and work product grounds.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Instruct the witness not to answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am not asking for any communications. I am
only asking for his observations-

MS. LEVINE: Sure.

MR. PETROCELLI:- whether he saw any cuts, abrasions, bruises, marks,
injuries, anything else beyond what you saw on Monday afternoon, June
13.

MS. LEVINE: That's exactly how I understood l the question, and the
same objection with the instruction. I may, you know, understand work
product different than you, but I'm going to give him the same
instruction.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is the only mark or cut or injury, bruise, abrasion that you saw on
Mr. Simpson before noon on the 14th that single cut on his middle
finger?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And did he at any time before then complain of any other cut or
injury or mark or bruise?

A: No.

Q: And after that time did he complain of any cut, injury, mark or
bruise?

MR. BAKER: Object on attorney work product grounds.

MS. LEVINE: I will object a swell and instruct Mr. Kardashian not to
answer the question, as well as attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: There has been, by the way, ample testimony of Mr.
Kardashian's movements and observations with Mr. Simpson after this
noon on the 14th already in this transcript in the presence of the
holder of the privilege's lawyer without any objection, including his
trip to get the golf bag, including-

MS. LEVINE: Well, I don't -

MR. PETROCELLI:- including at the house and watching him take a golf
club out and taking a walk and following behind him, et cetera, et
cetera, and so I don't see how this in any way differs at all.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I disagree, respectfully, and so if we need to, we
will fight it out later.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any discussion with OJ Mr. Simpson when you first saw
him Monday afternoon about the clothes he was wearing the night
before?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you have any discussion with him about the shoes he was
wearing?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Or his luggage?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any discussion with him about what transpired in
Chicago?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you have any

A: Excuse me. I'm wrong.

Q: Other than the cut.

A: No, I'm wrong on that. Yes, we did

Q: Tell me.

A: There was some discussion. All I recall is that he said he got to
his room-he got there-took this red eye; got there early in the
morning. I believe-I can't remember. I believe the Hertz person met
him at the airport-I could be wrong- kept his golf clubs and took him
to the course or kept them for the tournament the next day or
whatever.

He went to his room to sleep, learned - got a telephone call and
learned of these murders, went down to check out and couldn't get the
fellow from Hertz to take him to the airport. The guy was on his way,
but he wanted-he had to catch this flight, and someone else took him
to the airport. That's my knowledge of Chicago.

Q: When did this conversation take place?

A: I believe it was the morning of the 14th.

Q: Where?

A: At Mr. Taft's office.

Q: Who was present?

A: Mr. Taft, Mr. Simpson and myself.

Q: How long were the three of you there?

A: We were waiting for Mr. Shapiro to come over, so about 15 minutes
to a half hour.

Q: How did the subject of what Mr. Simpson did in Chicago come up?

A: I can't be sure, but I believe there was either a phone call from
the gentleman at Hertz or there was some discussion of the golf bag or
something to that effect.

Q: What else can you remember from that conversation?

A: That's basically what we discussed.

Q: Did anything else come up?

A: No, I don't think so.

Q: Was there any conversation at that time about Mr. Simpson's blood
test results?

A: No. No.

Q: When he came back from the police station on the 1 3th,at any time
thereafter did you and he talked about blood tests, blood test
results?

MS. LEVINE: Up to that noonish time on the 14th?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: No, I don't think we ever discussed that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: He never asked you a question about that?

A: I don't believe so. He could have told me that they took blood from
him, but I don't-I don't know.

Q: And did he ask you any questions during this same period of time
prior to noon on the 14th about a polygraph examination?

A: No.

Q: Or how it works?

A: No.

Q: Whether or not he should take one?

A: No.

Q: Nothing like that discussed at all?

A: I know nothing about that, so he wouldn't have asked me that.

Q: When you say you know nothing about that," you are aware that he
took a lie detector test?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for privileged-attorney-client and
attorney work product privileged information. I will instruct him not
to answer.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you go with him to the offices of Dr. Edward Gelb?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you go anywhere with O.J. Simpson in
mid-Wilshire on June 14th?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When you went to- let me think now. June 14th is a Tuesday. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: You went to-you got to your place around 4:00 o'clock.

A: Yes, 3:00 or 4:00.

Q: I think you said 4:00 or 5:00 the first time.

A: Yeah but I think-around 4:00.

Q: Have you- spoken to anybody about your account of the time when you
arrived at Mr. Simpson's house?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you leave the house at any time thereafter?

MS. LEVINE: Ever?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The rest of that day on the 14th and into the evening of the 14th.

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it's
attorney-client/work product if it relates to his relationship with
O.J. Simpson.

MS. LEVINE: And to the extent it relates to anything having to do with
Mr. Simpson, same objection with an instruction not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you go anywhere following your arrival on the 14th-With-drawn.

Did you leave your house alone?

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objection if it involves O.J. Simpson.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: I am now on the 14th, Tuesday, after you get to your house with
Simpson.

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: And you believe you stayed home the rest of the evening?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Misstates the testimony.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You believe you did not leave the house alone. Is that what you're
saying?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did you go anywhere with O.J. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: With the same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any conversations about O.J. Simpson with anyone other
than Mr. Simpson the rest of that day after you arrived at your house?

MR. BAKER: Objection on the grounds that it seeks information
protected by the attorney- client/work product privilege.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer the question.

A: Yes.

Q: And the children were there?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you talk to the children?

A: Yes.

Q: Privately?

A: No.

Q: Who else was present at the house besides Mr. Cowlings, you, Mr.
Simpson, Justin and Sydney?

A: Denice, and I don't know if my housekeeper was there or not. Excuse
me. Probably also Barbara and Nicole would have been there also.

Q: Barbara?

A: My-

Q: And Nicole Pulvers?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. Did Mr. Simpson care for the children the rest of that day
and evening?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did he spend all of his time there with the children?

MR. BAKER: If he spent all of his time at the house with the children?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: Objection if it goes to any attorney-client/work product.

THE WITNESS: I mean, do I answer that?

MS. LEVINE: To the extent you can answer the question about that
without getting into anything that's attorney-client or attorney work
product.

THE WITNESS: He spent- he and Denice really led spent most of the time
with the children.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Were you in their company the entire time all of you were at the
house?

A: No.

Q: Did you all have dinner together?

MS. LEVINE: All the people that were at the house?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: I don't remember. I think so, but I don't remember.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did he put the chi1dren to bed?

A: I believe he did. I believe they watched a video together or
something to that effect.

Q: Mr. Simpson did?

A: Yes.

Q: Watched a video with the two kids?

A: Yes.

Q: And then they went to bed?

A: I believe so.

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings stay there?

A: I think he did.

Q: Did he spend the night?

A: Mr. Cowlings?

Q: (Nods head.)

A: No.

Q: When did he leave?

A: I don't know, but I think he left after the children went to bed. I
think, but I really don't recall.

Q: What time was that, approximately?

A: 9:00,10:00 o'clock at night.

Q: And were you still there at the house when he left?

MS. LEVINE: "He" being Mr. Cowlings?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

Q: Were you still at the house with Mr.- when Mr. Cowlings left around
9:00 or 10:00 that night?

A: I don't recall. I think so, but I don't recall.

Q: Now, this walk that Simpson took with Cowlings, did that occur on
this Tuesday, or was it the next day?

A: I believe it was Wednesday.

Q: Okay. Did you see Simpson and Cowlings alone at any time on
Tuesday?

A: I'm sure they were in my home, but I m don't-I mean, I never-I
don't recall if, you know, if they were.

Q: Did you have conversations with Simpson and Cowlings during the day
once you got to the house that Tuesday?

MS. LEVINE: Together, the two of them-

MR. PETROCELLI: The three of them.

THE WITNESS: I'm sure we did.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What did you talk about?

A: I know we talked about the children, their ride up there. Other
than that, I don't know what we would have talked about.

Q: Did you talk about the murder of Nicole?

A: It makes sense we would have but I don't know what we discussed.

Q: Can you tell us what the three of you talked about relating to
Nicole's murder?

A: No, I don't-I don't recall what we would have talked about.

Q: Okay.

A: It would only make sense we would have discussed it, but I can't
tell you what specifically.

Q: Now, when you arrived at the house with Mr. Simpson around 4:00 or
5 00, whenever that was, Mr. Simpson's golf bag was in your trunk,
right, of the Rolls?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And also in the trunk was the Louis Vuitton bag. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And Mr. Simpson had his black grip with him. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Was that in the trunk also?

A: That I don't know.

Q: Did he bring it into the airport with him when he went to retrieve
the golf clubs?

A: No, he did not.

Q: He left it in the car?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. You don't remember where.

A: No.

Q: Do you know what was in it?

A: No.

Q: Now, you don't know how the luggage got into the house. Is that
right?

A: No. It would either-no, I don't know.

Q: You don't know who took it in. Right?

A: No.

Q: And you don't know where it was taken. Right?

A: I know it would have been taken upstairs to my daughter's bedroom.

Q: That's the room you designated for Mr. Simpson to sleep in?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. But you don't know who took it there, and you don't know who
could have. Is that right?

A: I could have, but I don't think I did. If at all, it would have
been my housekeeper, if she were home-if she were working that day;
and if she were not, it would have been myself or Denice or-I don't
know who did it.

Q: Okay. And the golf bag was taken directly into the garage?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And did you see that happen?

A: I probably put it there because the garage is crowded, and so I
would have had to have put it in a certain Spot. So I would imagine
that I did that, but I can't-

Q: Now, the first time you saw that garage-that golf bag opened was
the next day?

A: Was the night that we went for that walk.

Q: And you are not sure if that's Tuesday night or Wednesday night?

A: That's correct.

Q: But whenever that was, that was the first time. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: You saw Mr. Simpson open the bag, peel it down and remove an iron.
Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you notice if there were any golf shoes in the golf travel bag
or in the golf bag itself?

MS. LEVINE: Any what?

MR. PETROCELLI: Golf shoes.

THE WITNESS: I can't be certain, but I think there were.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And what color were they?

A: I'm guessing. I think they were brown, but I'm-

MS. LEVINE: Don't guess.

THE WITNESS: Okay. I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is your memory of the golf shoes based on your seeing the-Mr.
Simpson open that golf bag the first time?

A: I don't know. I really don't. I can't distinguish.

Q: Were you standing right next to him when he opened the golf bag?

A: We were all standing there together, A.C. and I.

Q: Is that when you saw the golf shoes?

A: I can't recall.

Q: Do you know where the golf shoes were situated?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever have occasion to from that point on-Withdrawn. The
golf bag was in your garage for a long time. Right?

A: I believe about seven months.

Q: Before it was turned over to whom?

A: Before I turned it over to the special master.

Q: Okay. And during the week that Mr. Simpson was at your house before
his arrest, you only saw him go to that golf bag on one occasion. Is
that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: When he took out that iron. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you saw him return the iron. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And did he close up the golf travel bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Or did he leave it peeled open?

A: No. He zipped it up.

Q: Okay. And from that point on you never saw him touch that bag
again. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did the bag remain in the garage where Mr. Simpson left it when he
closed the bag for the rest of the week?

A: Oh, yes.

Q: And for the next seven months?

A: No.

Q: When was it first moved to your knowledge?

A: Well, I moved it maybe a month or two later. It was just in the
way, so I moved it to another part of the garage.

Q: Okay. And you did not open it. Right?

A: No.

Q: And to your knowledge it had not been opened since Mr. Simpson last
opened and closed it. Is that right?

A: No.

Q: That's not right.

A: No, that's not right.

Q: Who had opened it?

A: I opened it to look inside it.

Q: And when was that?

A: I don't know. Maybe a month-I don't know. Maybe a couple weeks or a
month after his arrest. Maybe a couple weeks after his arrest.

Q: It was still in the original location?

A: Yes.

Q: Lying on the floor?

A: No. It was standing up.

Q: Were there any tags from the air- lines?

A: I don't know.

Q: Was it a new or old golf bag, if you could tell?

A: The bag itself, I didn't really look at it. It was-

Q: The outer travel bag.

A: The travel bag appeared to be new to me.

Q: Okay. What did you see when you opened it?

A: Golf clubs, golf balls, I believe a windbreaker.

Q: Did you --well, the golf clubs were in the golf bag itself. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Are you a golfer?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Well, bear with me because I'm not.  The golf balls were
where?

A: There was a pouch, an outside pouch with a zipper, and the golf
balls and tees and things like that were in this pouch.

Q: That was part of the golf bag itself?

A: Part of the bag, yes.

Q: And did you open up that-apparently you opened up that pouch of the
golf bag or that compartment of the golf bag to see what was in it.
Right?

A: I opened up every part of the golf bag, yes.

Q: Okay. And in that compartment you found golf balls?

A: Tees.

Q: Tees. Anything else?

A: Maybe a few ball markers or a few coins, something like that.

Q: Okay. Did you remove all the clubs from the golf bag?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: Okay. Did you remove all the contents from that golf compartment?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. And when you removed all the clubs did you look inside-

A: Yes, I did.

Q: -the golf bag?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you see anything?

A: No.

Q: Okay. It was empty?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And did you inspect each of the clubs?

A: No, I don't think I inspected each club.

Q: Did the clubs have covers on the clubs?

A: The heads - excuse me. The woods did. The irons did not.

Q: Okay. Was there a separate cover to the golf club bag itself, a
zipper- zip-top to it?

MS. LEVINE: Separate from the outside bag?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: I didn't understand the question.

THE WITNESS: You know, I think so. I can't be sure.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You know, that snaps on?

A: Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't recall.

Q: You don't recall?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And were there any towels in there, in the golf bag?

A: I think there was a towel attached to the golf bag. I can't be
sure.

Q: Were there any other compartments, other than the one that you
described which had the golf balls, golf tees and ball markers?

A: Yes.

Q: And how many were there?

A: Well, there was a main compartment with a zipper on each side in
the front of the bag, I guess it's called.

Q: And did you open up that main  compartment?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: And did you look inside?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did you find?

A: I think I found a windbreaker, and I think that could be when I
found the pair of golf shoes.

Q: Okay. Can you describe the windbreaker?

A: No. I think it was dark in color, but I can't recall.

Q: You did this in your garage?

A: Yes.

Q: Was anyone else present?

A: Yes.

Q: Who?

A: A.C.

Q: Okay. And was it nighttime? Daytime? When?

A: Nighttime.

Q: Were the lights on?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. You can't remember the color of the windbreaker?

A: No, I can't.

Q: And you said there was a pair of golf shoes in there also?

A: I believe so.

Q: Were they new, old, or could you tell?

A: No. Most of his stuff was new, so I would imagine it would have
been new, but I can't recall.

Q: Was there anything else in the  compartment?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Did you note the brand of the golf shoe?

A: No.

Q: Okay. By the way, did you then put -- after you looked inside the
golf bag itself after taking the clubs out, you then put the clubs
back in?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever turn the bag upside down?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And then you put in the  windbreaker as well?

MS. LEVINE: And then after he turned it upside down, you mean
completely?

MR. PETROCELLI: No, no.

Q: Did you-after you pulled the  windbreaker and the shoes out, you
inspected them?

A: Yes.

Q: And then put them back in?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you find anything unusual about the windbreaker?

A: No, I didn't.

Q: Or about the golf shoes?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Do you think they were brown?

A: I think so, but I can't be sure.

Q Were there any other compartments in the bag itself?

A: I don't believe so.

Okay.  And was there anything else found in the travel bag itself?

A: N, not that I'm aware of, no.

Q: So when you peeled down the travel bag, there was nothing situated
inside any of its --Withdrawn.

Did it have any inner pockets or  compartments?

A: I don't think so, no.

Q: Or outer pockets or compartments?

A: No. It was pretty much a shell. Q: Just a shell bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you now described to me everything that you found inside the
golf travel bag?

A: I believe so.

Q: And there was nothing-there were no pockets to the travel bag
itself, as you just said. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And what was your purpose in doing all this?

A: I had heard these stories about a purported bloody knife being in-
secreted in his golf bag, so I wanted to know if it was true, so-

Q: Was it true?

A: No, I did not find anything. I did not find any stains, anything
like that. I wanted to know what was going on.

Q: Did you find any traces of blood?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Anywhere in the bag?

A: No.

Q: On the shoes?

A: No.

Q: The windbreaker?

A: No.

Q: Were there any other pieces of luggage that you inspected in the
same fashion?

A: No. The golf bag was the bag I was concerned about.

Q: Were there any other pieces of luggage contained within the golf
bag?

A: No. There could-well, I don't know for sure, so-

Q: Well, you didn't find any at that time. Right?

A: I did not, no.

Q: Okay. Did you ever see anybody remove a piece of luggage from that
I golf travel bag or the golf bag?

A: Not that I recall, no.

Q: So as of the time that you did this inspection, you were not aware
of any other piece of luggage being contained in that travel bag.
Correct?

A: Yes, that's correct.

MR. BAKER: We got to take a break. I got too much iced tea.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 1:57.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:08.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Off the record Mr. Brewer gave me a little crash course in golf
equipment, so let me ask you a couple of other questions.

Did you see in any of the compartments of the golf bag or the travel
bag any golf gloves?

A: Yes. Yes. That would have been in the compartment where the balls
and the tees were, I believe.

Q: How many gloves were there?

A: I don't recall. One or two.

Q: And did you inspect the gloves?

A: I think I did look at it.

Q: Did you find any blood on the gloves?

A: No, I didn't.

Q: Were the woods metal woods as opposed to wood woods?

A: I didn't take the head covers off, so I'd be guessing. I believe
they were metal woods.

Q: And the clubs, did they have steel shafts or graphite shafts?

A: I don't recall.

Q: But they were metal. Right?

A: I don't -- yeah, I think they were metal. I don't think they were
graphite.

Q: Some kind of metal shaft to all the clubs?

A: Correct.

MR. BREWER: Size.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What size was the golf glove?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you try it on?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Were they new?

A: I think they were relatively new, yes.

Q: Were the golf bats new?

A: Most of them.

Q: Were they in sleeves or loose?

A: No. They were loose.

Q: Do you know what kind of golf balls they were?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you-

MR. BREWER: Dan, you missed a very important question. Surlyn or
Balata?

THE WITNESS: Neither.

MS. LEVINE: Does that have anything to do with whether they're wood or
steel?

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, that's two  or three - no. What's the - core.
Right?

MR. BAKER: Three-piece.  MR. PETROCELLI: Three-piece or two-piece.
Sorry for that.

MS. LEVINE: It's all over my head.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you put everything back together in the golf bag-

A: Yes.

Q:--and travel bag?

A: The way I found it, yes.

Q: And you left it in the garage?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Is that the last time you looked at the bag before bringing
it to the court?

A: That's correct, yes.

Q: Do you know whether anybody else ever inspected that bag besides
Mr. Cowlings and you?

A: I'm-no, I do not, but I'm quite | sure no one else touched it.

Q: While it was in your possession?

A: My garage, yes.

O: And who did you give it to?

A: Judge Delbert Wong.

Q: Did you bring it to him?

A: No. He came to my home, and I put it in his trunk of his car.

Q: Did he take anything else at your house?

A: Yes.

Q: What was that?

A: Whatever bags I had there, he took. I think he took a small bag
that I had described last time, from my home.

Q: Belonging to Mr. Simpson?

A: Yes.

Q: That he took from which room?

A: From my daughter's room.

Q: And what else did he take?

A: He could have taken the O.J.-- O.J.S. hang bag, the little silk
cover, and I can't recall if that was from my house or Rockingham, but
he did take that at some point.

Q: He took all these items on the same trip?

A: Correct.

Q: And did he also take the Vuitton garment bag?

A: Yes, but that was not at my home. That was at Rockingham.

Q: Okay, I will return to that. As of the date Mr. Simpson was
arrested on the 17th of June, okay, the golf bag was in your garage.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And this O.J.S. suit bag that you just described was in the bedroom
of your daughter where Mr. Simpson slept. Right?

A: I'm not sure about that one. It could have been. I'm not sure.

Q: How did it get there for Delbert Wong to pick up months later?

A: Because I would take his suits to court for him, and a lot of times
Cathy Randa or someone else would pick up clothes from his home, and I
 believe at one point they put them in this bag and brought them to
me.

Q: Brought them to you?

A: Brought them to me to take to court-

O: And you might have had that bag in your house?

A: And I might have-that's correct . (Daniel Leonard enters the
deposition.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And the -- but you do remember that Wong found it in your
daughter's bedroom?

A: The O.J.'s. bag-

Q: This O.J.'s. -- that's the bag we're talking about?

A: Yes. I'm pretty sure it was in that  room, yes.

Q: And was it in the closet?

A: Yeah, it would have been.

Q: Was it empty?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Now, you -- let's turn to the other bag, the Vuitton bag.

A: Yes.

Q: When you saw Randa exiting the -Taft's car with that bag, I think
you said you asked her if you could take it, to be a gentleman.

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Do you recall that?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you remember actually taking the bag out of Taft's car?

A: No. I believe she was already standing on the sidewalk with the bag
in her hand.

Q: Okay.  And when you said, "Let me take that from you," where did
you want to take it to?

A: I just meant, Let me hold it for you.

Q: Did you know whose bag it was?

A: I just assumed it was Mr. Simpson's-I had no idea, but I assumed it
was Mr. Simpson's bag.

Q: You didn't know whether it was Cathy Randa's bag.

A: That's correct. I just held it just to be a gentleman.

Q: So when you asked the police if you could bring the bag to Mr.
Simpson, that was based on an assumption that it was his bag. Right?

A: No. I believe a few minutes later she told me that this is O.J.'s
bag, and then I went up to the police. I didn't go to the police
immediately after taking the bag from Cathy. We stood over on the side
for a few minutes.

Q: And your purpose in going to the policeman -- I think you described
him as an African-American?

A: Yes.

Q: 6 foot 6?

A: Around there.

Q: Your purpose in going to this --  you know his name, by the way?

A: No, I do not.

Q: Your purpose in going to him was to see if you could go in the
house with the bag and bring it to the house?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

THE WITNESS: No. My purpose was to give him the bag. I had attempted
to get in before that time, and he didn't let me in.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you recall telling him, "This is O.J. Simpson's luggage, and you
must get it to him"?

A: No. I recall telling him, "I have  O.J. Simpson's"-"I have Mr.
Simpson's luggage, and you should take it in."

And he said, "No, you can't come in."

Q: Did you ask him to take it?

A: Yes.

Q: And he said no.

A: He said no.

Q: Did you ask for any instructions as to what to do with the bag?

A: No.

Q: And did you approach any other policeman or detective about what to
do with this bag?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. And when you saw Mr. Simpson in handcuffs, did you try to get
the bag to him?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Or to the policeman or detectives around him?

A: No. They were on the property, and I wasn't allowed on the
property.

Q: Did you try to get the bag into  Mr. Weitzman's car?

A: No. No, I did not.

Q: Or the detectives' car?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Now, you previously testified that you then took that bag,
and it was in the trunk of your car, right, the Mercedes?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you drove over to the office of Mr. Simpson, it just
stayed in your car. Right?

A: Correct.

(Daniel Leonard leaves the deposition.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And when you drove over to Rockingham with Mr. Simpson, it also
stayed in the car. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you neglect to take it out at that time?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: And there was no conversation with Mr. Simpson about the fact that
that bag was in your trunk. Right?

A: None.

Q: And he didn't call you later on that evening saying, "Hey, you have
my bag"?

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: Okay.  Now, curing the evening on the 13th, did you see Mr. Kaelin
at the house?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you notice if Mr. Kaelin spent any time talking to Mr. Simpson
privately?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

THE WITNESS: I did not notice.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did you speak to Mr. Kaelin?

A: I think I said hello, and that was it.

Q: Did you ask him what he had heard the night before or had seen?

A: No. I did not know Mr. Kaelin; never met him before.

Q: And you didn't know that he had heard or seen anything. Right?

A: I knew nothing, no.

Q: Okay. And did you ask anybody that evening at the house what had
happened the night before?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you see Mr. Simpson watching news reports of the cover-
age of what was going on?

A: Yes.

Q: And were you also watching the news?

A: To some extent. I was in and out and, you know, just around the
room, but to some extent I was watching along with everyone else.

Q: Okay. And when you went home that evening, you then left the bag in
the trunk. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And the next morning you got in the Rolls and realized the bag was
in the Mercedes. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And then got-took it out of the Mercedes, put it in the Rolls and
went to Rockingham. Right?

A: Yes, either I or Denice did or something.

Q: Okay. You went alone to Rockingham. Right?

A: Tuesday morning?

Q: Yes.

A: Yes, sir. l

Q: Did you call Mr. Simpson in the morning to tell him you were coming
over?

A: I previously said I didn't. I could have called, but I really don't
remember that.

Q: What was your purpose in going over there that morning?

A: Just to console him, just to be, you  know, a good friend basically
and sit with someone.

Q: Okay. And when you got there, you took the bag upstairs. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Right up to the bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: And why was that?

A: Because that's where he was, so I knew that's where his closet was,
and so I felt I should take the bag upstairs.

Q: And you testified previously that you're not sure whether he opened
up the bag in the bedroom or not. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And when you made the suggestion that he come to your house for a
couple of days to avoid the media, you said he packed a few things in
his black grip. Right?

A: Either in the black grip or in-I know the black grip was open. It
was on the floor, and I know he put a few things in there. Whether he
put some things in the Louis Vuitton bag, I don't know.

Q: Did you talk about how many days he would, spend at your house?

A: Yes.

Q: What did he say?

A: He didn't say too much. I-I was the one who suggested, "Why don't
you come and spend a couple days at my home, and then you could come
back here in a couple of days, and this will all blow over and you can
come back."

Q: Did he say anything to you about his children at that time?

A: He could have. Could have at that time.

Q: What did he say?

A: He could have said-I'd be guessing, so I don't know. I mean, I knew
they were in Laguna because he told me they were down in Laguna and he
said he wanted to see his children, but beyond that I don't recall.

Q: And the bag was then taken with his -- the Vuitton bag and the
black bag were then taken back to your car?

A: No. The Vuitton bag was taken to my car. He kept the black bag.

Q: But you both got in your car. Right?

A: No. This is when he went out the back way, and I put the Louis
Vuitton bag in my car.

Q: Picked him up -

A: Picked him up on the corner, and he had the black bag on his
shoulder and put it in my car.

Q: And the Vuitton bag in the trunk.

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And -

A: Or the back seat. I could have put it in the back seat.

Q: And the next time you saw that Vuitton bag was in his bedroom, in
your daughter's room where he slept. Right?

A: Right. As I say, I could have taken it up. I don t think I did. I
just-all I know is it was in my daughter's room.

Q: And that was a Wednesday, right, when you saw the Vuitton bag next?

A: No. I think it would have been Tuesday.

Q: The day you arrived?

A: Yeah, I think so.

Q: You mean later on in the evening or --

A: Yes.

Q: And you said it was opened?

A: It was open lying on my daughter's couch.

Q: And not yet in the closet?

A: It was never put in the closet.

Q: Never put on the floor of the closet?

A: No.

Q: It stayed the rest of that week on your daughter's couch, lying
flat?

A: Correct.

Q: When you saw it lying flat on the couch-excuse me.

Is this a couch in the same bedroom where O.J. Simpson slept?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And is there a closet in that bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: And he had the black grip in the closet, or not?

A: No. I think the black grip was on the couch also.

Q: Okay. So based on your recollection, his black grip and his Louis
Vuitton bag remained on the couch that week.

A: That's correct. Or the black grip could have been on the floor, but
I recall the Louis Vuitton was on the couch.

Q: Do you remember any of his clothes being in the closet?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Okay. And was the -- do you know whether the Vuitton bag had been
emptied or unpacked?

MS. LEVINE: In the house?

MR. PETROCELLI: As it was lying on the couch.

THE WITNESS: To my knowledge it was never unpacked.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: So it was just opened, but the clothes remained in it, so far as
you could tell. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: You didn't see what appeared to be the contents of that bag-

A: No, I did not.

Q:-located elsewhere. Right?

A: No.

Q: Was there a bedside table?

A: Yes.

Q: Were there two or one?

A: I think at that time one.

Q: Did you see if Mr. Simpson the rest of that week had any of his
belongings out on the bedside table, a book, anything?

A: I recall a magazine. I know he had his shaving kit and toiletries
in the bathroom.

Q: In a separate bag?

A: In a little travel kit.

Q: That was in the bathroom?

A: Yes.

Q: And did he have anything on those bedside tables?

MS. LEVINE: I think he testified there was one at that time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you say one table?

A: There was one table.

Q: Was there anything on it that appeared to belong to Mr. Simpson?

A: I think maybe a magazine or a book. I think there was a book and a
magazine, something like that.

Q: Mr. Simpson left the house sometime on Friday. Right?

MR. BAKER: Friday the?

MR. PETROCELLI: Friday the 17th.

Q: Last time you saw him before his

MR. BAKER: I am going to object.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-was that -- was when he was in your house on Friday, June 17. Is
that right?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on any information he knows that may
be violative of the attorney-client/work product privilege on June
17th, 1994.

MS. LEVINE: On that grounds I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you see Mr.-- did you go to Rockingham when Mr. Simpson arrived
there with Mr. Cowlings following their infamous ride in the  Bronco?

A: Yes.

Q: And you were there when Cowlings and Simpson arrived?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What time did you get to Rockingham?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When -- what time did you leave your house on Friday, June 17?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, this is all in a police statement, too.

Q: You gave a police statement, didn't you?

A: Yes.

Q: Let me show you a copy of it. Let me show you my marked-up copy of
what appears to be your police statement.

Can you identify that document?

A: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: Objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What is it?

MS. LEVINE: Could call for attorney work product information,
depending on how he gets his knowledge as to what this document is. I
think the  document speaks for itself as to what it is if you want to
put it in the record.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you ever seen that document before?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for work product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

MR. PETROCELLI: As to whether he's seen it before?

Q: Were you interviewed by Officers Carr and Tippin?

A: Yes.

Q: When?

A: June 17th, 1994.

Q: What time?

A: I don't know. It would have been

Q: Approximately-

A -- 2:00 or 3:00 something --

Q: 3:20?

A: Sounds good to me.

Q: At your house?

A: Yes.

Q: The house that Simpson stayed in. Right?

A: The house Movie Tunes is at.

Q: (Address deleted pursuant to stipulation of counsel.) Right?

A: I'd rather not say that in the re-cord.

MS. LEVINE: Can we have that address stricken from the record? I think
that when we were here last time, we --

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't have an objection to that.

MS. LEVINE: Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Should we, just for Dave's sake, should we put a blank
there?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: At the address indicated on this police statement that I've just
shown you. Correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And have you read this statement at any time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls for work product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Can you read it now and tell me whether , the information in there
is accurate?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object on the grounds it calls for-he can
read it. but if he-I object to him answering that as it would call for
attorney- client/work product information.

MS. LEVINE: And I will instruct him not to answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: I will have to mark this as an exhibit. We will have
to do it at the break, but it will be 206.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 206 was marked for identification by the reporter
 and is attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you read Exhibit 206?

A: Yes.

Q: Does it concern the subject matter with respect to which Officers
Carr and Tippin interviewed you on June 17, 1994?

MR. BAKER: I will object. The document speaks for itself.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Does it reflect what you told Officers Tippin and Carr?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for attorney- client and attorney work
product information. I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer the
question.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was Mr. Shapiro present during your interview?

MR. BAKER: Join.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was Mr. Cowlings present during this interview?

A: No.

Q: Was he at the house at the time you were interviewed?

A: No.

Q: At some time on June 17 were you handed the note that you read on
television later that day?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you receive that note on the 17th?

A: Yes.

Q: Had you ever seen that note before?

A: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, Mr. Simpson has testified fully about this
entire week, including all of his movements on every single day, so I
can't see how one witness can testify about it but not another

Issue two is, even if it is privileged, Mr. Simpson fully testified to
all of witness. It doesn't make any sense to these actions me.

MR. BAKER: I am not withdrawing the objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I think that's really wasteful.

Q: The note was in an envelope. Correct?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And the envelope was sealed?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And was there any writing on the outside of the envelope?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And what did it say?

A: I can't remember. I think it said, "To Whom It May Concern." I
can't remember.

Q: What time was it when you received the envelope?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object to this line of questioning. Again, it
calls for attorney- client/work product information. Acts that Mr.
Simpson does in the presence of his attorney can constitute
communications --

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Simpson fully testified to these acts, and you
were there, together with two other attorneys for him, and there was
no objection made on the grounds of work product or the
attorney-client privilege.

MS. LEVINE: You know, it doesn't matter what Mr. Simpson testifies to.
If you have a client and they testify, that doesn't mean they've given
up whatever they've told you.

MR. PETROCELLI: I wasn't asking what he told him. I was asking what he
observed and saw, and Mr. Simpson has given the identical-testified
about the identical subject matters. I don't believe he can claim
privilege.

MS. LEVINE: What Simpson has testified to is completely irrelevant to
whether or not there is a privilege. The question is whether this is
information he received from his client. You can sit there and talk to
your client, and just because your client testifies about it doesn't
mean that what your client's told you isn't privileged.

MR. PETROCELLI: What I am saying is this: There are two levels to this
analysis: One is whether any of this  stuff is privileged in the first
instance  at all, his observations of what Simpson did and his
observations generally during that week. That's issue one. I and
activities and there was no objection made, so I think if there was a
privilege, that privilege no longer exists. That's basically my
position in a nutshell.

MS. LEVINE: I respectfully disagree, but I don't recall what the
question was, so-

MR. PETROCELLI: The question was

MS. LEVINE: Do you want to go back to that? We can take-

MR. PETROCELLI: What was the question?

Q: Oh, what time was it when you received the envelope?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: And then I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer
based on that to the extent it calls for-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What did Mr. Simpson say to you

MR. BAKER: Same-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q:-about the envelope when he gave it to you?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: And same instruction. Also assumes facts not in evidence.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did he give it to you?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did Mr. Simpson give this envelope to you?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Before he handed it to you, you had never seen it before.
True?

A: That's correct.

Q: Was anyone else present when he handed it , to you?

A: Yes.

Q: Who?

A: I believe Mr. Shapiro; I believe  Mr. Cowlings. I'm not quite sure.
There were others in that room. I don't know who else was in that
room. There could have been some doctors, some nurses. I'm not sure.

Q: What was the room?

MS. LEVINE: I am going to object to him going any further. We are
getting into attorney-client and attorney work product-

MR. PETROCELLI: He said Mr. Cowlings was present.

Q: And where is that?

A That's in my office also.

Q: On the second floor.

MS. LEVINE:-information.

A: Second floor.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't believe a Is there a third floor, there would
be any privilege with Mr. Cowlings present.

MS. LEVINE: Well, it depends on what kind of stuff is going on, and
that's what you are asking about. I mean, just because Mr. Cowlings
may be in one part of a room at one time doesn't mean that something
that's going on in another quarter is-

MR. PETROCELLI: No. This is who was present when he handed him the
envelope, and he said Mr. Cowlings, among others, were present.

MS. LEVINE: That's right. Then you said, what was in the room?

MR. BAKER: Where was the room.

MR. PETROCELLI: I said, where was the room. I am trying to understand
--

MS. LEVINE: Where was the room like geographically? Okay.

THE WITNESS: It was my office upstairs.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Well, let me understand how the house works. If you go in the front
door, are you-what level of the house are you on?

A: First level. Downstairs.

Q: There is a downstairs.

A: Well, it's the first level.

Q: First level. How many levels are there?

A: Two.

Q: Okay. And the office is located on what level?

A: My office is on the second level.

Q: Second level.

A: Correct.

Q: That's the Movie Tunes office?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And the-

A: Or one of them. That's my office up there. The secretaries' offices
are downstairs.

Q: There are phones that connect up?

A: Phone and computers.

Q: Is there a comm. line between the two?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Is there a conference room anywhere?

A: Yes.

A: No, there is not.

Q: Okay. And where is the kitchen?

A: First floor.

Q: And where is the level that goes out to the backyard?

A: First floor.

Q: First floor. Where is the-where are the bedrooms?

A: Some are first floor; some are second floor.

Q: Where is the room where Mr. Simpson slept?

A: Second floor.

Q: Okay. Besides your office and this room where Mr. Simpson slept,
what else is on the second floor?

A: Well, it's split, and there is two second floors. There is a main
staircase, and you go to the left, and that's the master bedroom, and
you can't get to it by going to the right. So it's split on two sides,
the upstairs level.

Q: So on one side is a master bedroom. Right?

A: One side is a master bedroom.

Q: Where you slept.

A: That's correct.

Q: Anything else there?

A: Just the bathroom.

Q: And what's on the other side?

A: Is the -- I have a media room for Movie Tunes. It's a very large
media room where we have all of our equipment and televisions and
audio equipment. There is a bedroom suite. There is a-

Q: A bedroom suite?

A: Bedroom suite.

Q: Meaning a bedroom and a bath- room?

A: Yes, that's self-contained.  There is another bathroom. There is a 
pool room for a pool table, and then there is my office.

Q: Okay. And what's downstairs be- sides the secretary's office?

A: Downstairs is a living room, dining room, kitchen, laundry room,
maid's room and bath, powder room and two other bedroom suites.

Q: And where is the conference room?

A: Upstairs in my office. My office is about twice the size of this
room. It's quite a large room with a conference table on one side with
a conference -12 conference chairs, and then desk and couch and chairs
and tables on the other side.

Q: Okay.  And what room did Mr.  Simpson stay in?

A: The bedroom upstairs on the side with the office and all the other
--

Q: Your office.

A: Yes.

Q: Can you-can one go from that bedroom downstairs and out the door
without passing through your office?

A: Yes.

Q: Or without passing through your conference room?

A: Yes.

Q: Without being seen by anybody in the conference room or in the
office?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.  And where were you when Mr. Simpson handed you the envelope?

A: In my office.

Q: Okay.  And do you know where he got the letter or the note from --
the envelope, I should say?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object as it calls for attorney-client
privileged information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The answer is: Do you know? You may not know. The question is: Do
you know?

A: Yes.

Q: Where did he get it from?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: I'll instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you participate in writing the letter that appeared in the
envelope?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And the first time you saw that letter is when you took it out of
the envelope and read it on television?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: And I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When did you first open the envelope?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When you took -- Do you need to take a break here? He is writing
you a note.

A: No.

MS. LEVINE: Takes a long time to take a break with all these things.

Can we go back to the 1ast question?

MR. PETROCELLI: Sure.

MS. LEVINE: Can we reread that?

MR. PETROCELLI: Want to reread it? (Pending question read as follows:

"Q. When did you first open the envelope?")

MS. LEVINE: I think that question may have been asked at the last
deposition.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What's the answer?

A: I just blanked. I'm sorry. I told her that we asked it last time.
What-- read it again. I'm sorry.

Q: Okay. Did you show it to them,

A: Yes. We read it out loud.

Q: In the presence of the officers?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And the officers were whom? Tippin and Carr?

A: No. There was-I don't know- about 12 of them or l0 or them. I don't
know.

Q: Okay. Do you know whether during the entire time that you were at
the house with Mr. Simpson from, let's say, Tuesday, 4:00, 5:00
o'clock unti1 Friday afternoon he left the house without your
knowledge?

MR. BAKER: Object that it calls for attorney-client/work product
information.

MS. LEVINE: Did you say if it does or I --

MR. BAKER: In that it does. I apologize.

MS. LEVINE: I instruct him not to answer the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

MR. PETROCELLI: Whatever that means. Sounds like everything is work

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any conversation with Paula Barbieri and others,
excluding Mr. Simpson?

A: I think so, yes.

Q: Relate that discussion or those discussions to me.

A: I think it was A.C., Paula and I, and A.C. gave Paula a couple
thousand dollars and said to leave for her flight home. That was it.

Q: What bills, what denominations?

A: No, I don't know. A.C. had --

Q: How do you know it was a couple thousand dollars?

A: 'Cause I think he said that.

Q: "Here's a couple of thousand dollars"?

A: I think he said something like that, but I didn't actually see the
money change hands.

Q: Oh, you didn't see him give the money to her?

A: I don't recall it. I mean, I know he gave it to her, but I don't
recall seeing the bills or any of that.

Q: Was it in an envelope?

A: No.

Q: How do you know?

A: Because it wasn't an envelope. It was just a wad of money.

Q: So you did see a wad of money?

A: Yeah, but I don't know the de-nominations.

Q: Okay. So you saw Cowlings hand Paula a wad of money.

A: Some money, yes, and I don't know if it was a few thousand I don't
know how much it was. I just know he had said, "Here's a few thousand 
dollars."

Q: And where were you and Cowlings and Paula situated at this time?

A: Outside in front of my home on the side.

Q: And did she take the money?

A: Yes.

Q: And did she leave?

A: I -- that's when I believe her manager came, and then she left.

Q: Did she see Mr. Simpson after taking the money before she left?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: If you know. Did you see her go to Mr. Simpson after she took the
money?

A: Yeah, I think so.

Q: Excuse me?

A: Yes, I think so.

Q: And where was Mr. Simpson when you saw Paula and him together?

A: Out in the front in the same area.

Q: Outside?

A: Yes.

Q: So Mr. Simpson was out there with you and Paula and Cowlings?

A: Well, I think it was just the three of us, and then I walked
inside, and I believe he came out, and I felt I should leave him alone
to say goodbye, so I went in the house.

(Daniel Leonard enters the deposition.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is there one entrance through which you enter and exit the house?

A: No. We went to the Brown residence.

Q: And then after that?

there the night after.

murder-the possibility that the murder weapon might be located in the
bag?

A: Yes.

O: Okay. And tell me about that discussion.

A: I don't recall the specifics of it. It was generally that we had
either heard of some news reports or some tabloid writings or
something that  there was a knife in his golf bag, and I wanted to 120
fond out.

So I called A.C. and said, "I want to know if there's anything in
here, and if there is, I'm going to turn it in. Let's find out what's
here." So I said, "I don't want to do it alone. You come over with
me." So he did.

the WD to be there when you looked at the golf bag?

A: I did not, no.

.Judge Wong.

THE WITNESS: I met Judge Wong at the Holiday Inn on Sunset -

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And 405?

A: And 405, yes. He followed me to Rockingham. I took him up to Mr.
Simpson's closet and I showed him the Louis Vuitton bag, which was
folded and placed on a shelf in his closet-

Q: Empty?

A: Empty. It had the baggage tags and the airline tags, so I knew that
was the one. There were several of them up there, but this was the one
that identified.

Q: Just the two of you?

A: Yes. He then-I put it in his car for him, and then he followed me
to my home, and I showed him the golf bag, and I picked it up and put
it in his trunk-

Q: Open it up for him? red

A: No. I just picked it up and put it in his trunk.

We then went upstairs in my daughter's room where Mr. Simpson was
staying, and I think I gave him the O.J.'s little hang bag and this
other little bag that we had described previously that was sitting on
the floor in my daughter's closet.

Q: When you went up to Simpson's closet with Wong, is that the only
thing you-he got, was the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Nothing else?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Now, the last time the  Louis Vuitton bag-Withdrawn.

This Louis Vuitton bag was the same bag that was in-was on the couch
in your daughter's bedroom where Mr. Simpson was staying. Right? A:
That's correct.

Q: And do you know when it left your house?

A: Approximate--not for sure. l Approximately 30 days thereafter,
maybe two weeks, but I think it's closer to 30 days.

Q: After what?-

A: After his arrest.

Q: And where did it go?

A: It went --

MS. LEVINE: If you know.

THE W1TNESS: As far as I know, it went back to Rockingham.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who picked it up?

items in it?

MS. LEVINE: If you know.

THE WITNESS: I wasn't home. I was in court. I don't know. As far as I
know, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: During the entire time that Withdrawn.

Before Randa picked it up from your house while you were in court, it
was on that couch in Mr.-in your daughter's bedroom. Right?

A: It was left in the exact spot that it was when he was there.

Q: And was anyone else sleeping in that room during that period of
time?

A: My daughter could have slept there.

Q: Where was Mr. Simpson's little- Mr. Simpson's toiletry bag that you
previously described?

A: It remained in the bathroom.

Q: That entire time?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Now, was that picked up?

MS. LEVINE: By?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Randa, when she picked up the Vuitton.

A: It was not, no.

Q: So after Randa picked up the Vuitton, she left that little toiletry
bag in the bathroom. Is that right?

A: Correct. I don't think she knew of its existence.

Q: Okay. And was this other bag that was on the closet floor left
there also?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. And that Vuitton bag to your knowledge was picked up and
taken to Rockingham. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And during the entire time that that Vuitton bag was in your
daughter's bedroom on the couch, did you ever examine it or inspect
it?

A: I did not --

MR. BAKER: Object --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you ever touch it?

A: I could have moved it maybe a little bit.

Q: And did you ever-do you know whether anybody else accessed it in
any way?

MR. BAKER: I will object on the grounds it calls for attorney-client
privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did your housekeeper wash the laundry that was in it, do you know?

A: No.

Q: You don't know?

A: I don't know.

Q: Do you know whether or not anybody touched the bag before Randa
picked it up?

A: No, I do not.

Q: And you never did.

A: No, I did not.

Q: And you and Cowlings never inspected it. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Did you ever inspect the bag that was on the floor of the
closet?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information. you can answer it without that, go
ahead.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: When did you inspect that bag?

A: The best I could estimate is months later.

Q: Months after Cathy Randa picked up the Vuitton bag?

A: Yes.

(Fredric Goldman enters the deposition.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: That day that Randa picked up the bag, when you came back to
court-when you came back from court to your house, did you go into
that bedroom to see what she had taken?

A: No.

MS. LEVINE: I think-

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did you understand that she had picked up just the Vuitton
bag or all the items in Mr. Simpson's bed-room?

A: I didn't even know she had done it that day.

Q: While Mr. Simpson's -- this other bag of his was on your closet
floor and his toiletry bag was in the bathroom, did you know those
items were there?

A: I knew the toiletry bag was there. I'd see it when I would walk in
the bedroom.

Q: But you didn't know about the other bag?

A: No. Q: When is the first time you saw that other bag lying on the
closet floor?

A: I don't know. It had been some time. I didn't-it had been some
time. I really --

Q: After Simpson's arrest?

A: Yes.

Q: When you first noticed it?

A: Yes.

Q: At the time you first noticed it, was it after the Vuitton bag had
been taken by Randa?

A: I believe so.  Q: Okay. And when you first noticed it, is that when
you picked it up to see what it was?

A: No.

Q: Did you know what it was when you first saw it?

A: No, I did not. I thought it was my daughter's.

Q: Okay. And so you did nothing about it?

A: That's correct.

Q: And then at some point in time later you went back to that closet
and looked at that bag?

A: That's correct.

Q: And that was --

A: Months later.

Q: -- months after Simpson's arrest?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And did you do this alone?

A: Yes.

Q: And describe what you saw.

A: I believe the bag was empty.

Q: Did you pick it up in the light and look at it?

A: Yes, I did.

Q: Did you turn it upside down and I shake it?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you look for any blood?

A: I looked inside, but I didn't look for blood, no.

A: No, I did not.

Q: Did you notice if it was an old or new bag?

A: It appeared to be new.

Q: Okay. Did it have any tags on from the airlines?

A: No, it did not.

Q: By the way, did the golf travel bag have any airline tags on it?

A: I didn't recall if it did or not.

Q: And did the O.J.S. bag?

A: No, it did not.

Q: Okay. And what did you do with this bag 1 that was empty in your
closet floor?

A: I set it back down, just put it back where it was, and then at a
later date that's when we gave it to Mr.  Wong, Judge Wong.

Q: So the only two times you actually handled that bag is when you
first inspected it and later gave it to Wong.

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Do you know who that bag belonged to?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for attorney-client privileged or
attorney work product information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Has anyone ever told you?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to
answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was the last time you saw that bag when you gave it to Wong?

A: Yes.

Q: And same of the Vuitton bag?

A: Well, I- - yes.

Q: You might have seen them in court --

A: I saw them in court.

Q:-later on. Right? Okay. Same is true of the O.J.S. bag. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. Let me show you some photographs.

MS. LEVINE: Do you want Mr. Kardashian to come to that side of you?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Can you see okay?

A: Yes.

Q: I am first showing you what has  previously been marked as
Plaintiffs' Deposition Exhibit 24. Do you recognize that?

A: Yes, I do.

Q: Is that the Vuitton bag that we have been talking about during the
course of your deposition?

A: It appears to be, yes.

Q: Okay. And I am showing you picture -- excuse me. I am showing you
what has been previously marked as Plaintiffs' Deposition Exhibit 25.
Do you see that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: What is that?

A: That appears to be the O.J.S. hang bag, the silk hang bag.

Q: That was in your daughter's closet and that you gave to Delbert
Wong. Is that right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay.  And you see the airline tags on Exhibit 24, the Vuitton bag?

A: Yes.

Q: "Premium Service," and there is another tag or two?

A: Yes.

Q: Were those on the bag when you saw them?

A: I recall the "Premium Service" and the airline tag. I don't recall
these (Indicating).

Q: One of the tags you're pointing to appears to be a green evidence
tag, from my vantage point. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you don't recall that.

A: No, I don't.

Q: Let me show you what has previously been marked as deposition
Exhibit 26. Do you see that?

A: Yes.

Q: What is that?

A: That appears to be the small bag that I saw in my daughter's
closet.

Q: That you just testified about.

A: Yes, sir.

Q: That was empty.

A: Yes.

Q: That had no tags on it. Right?

A: Just had the leather tag on it.

Q: But no airline tags.

A: That's correct.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And what about the Swiss Army logo?

A: That could be the way it is. I --

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm speculating now. It just looks different to me.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Let me direct your attention to what has been previously marked as
deposition Exhibit 22. Do you recognize that?

A: No, I don't. I don't think I saw --

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You don't think you saw what?

A: The bag itself. It was always in the --

Q: Well, you had testified previously that you took the bag out of the
travel bag and removed all the clubs and dumped it upside down.

A: That I did. I'm thrown off by this (Indicating). I don't recall the
Swiss Army --

Q: Logo

A: -emblem on it.

Q: On the golf bag.

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Apart from the Swiss Army emblem on the golf bag, do you
recognize the other items on the golf bag, such as the towel-

What do you call these, Mike?

MR. BREWER: Head covers.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Head covers?

A: I don't recall the towel-or I don't recognize the towel, but other
than that, it looks similar.

Q: Let me show you what previously has been marked as deposition
Exhibit 10. Do you recognize that?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Is that the windbreaker that you found  inside the golf bag?

A: I don't know for sure.

Q: Prior to Mr. Simpson's arrest, had you ever seen the windbreaker
depicted in Exhibit 10?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Had you seen the shirt depicted in Exhibit 11?

MR. BAKER: That exact shirt or that type of shirt?

MS. LEVINE: It appears to be a short-sleeved white shirt. I'm not sure
how one could --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Can you tell if you've seen that before?

A: No. No.

Q: Okay. Did you see the items that Mr. Simpson put in his-either in
his black grip or his Louis Vuitton bag when he was packing in his
bedroom in your presence on the morning of June 14?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. If I show you-take a look at exhibits 13, 14. Do they look
like items that you saw him pack?

MS. LEVINE: He just testified he didn't see him packing them.

MR. PETROCELLI: By looking at them, he might have his recollection
refreshed.

THE WITNESS: No, I didn't see him pack any of these.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you see him pack something else?

A: No. I mean, I don't know what he packed.

Q: You just don't know what he put in there.

A: That's correct.

Q: Socks, underwear.

A: That's correct.

Q: You don't know. Right?

A: Do not know.

Q: Okay. Do you recognize any of the shirts depicted in exhibits 12,
15 or 16?

A: Yes. This shirt looks familiar with this logo, looks like one of
Mr. Simpson's shirts (Indicating). I don't --

Q: 15 or 16 you don't recognize. 12 you think is Mr. Simpson's shirt,
and do you know whether you saw that shirt prior to his arrest on June
17?

A: No, I do not.

Q: And do you know whether you've seen items 16 or 17, which are
additional garments, prior to his arrest on June 17?

A: No.

Q: Did someone in your house do  Mr. Simpson's laundry that week?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Okay. Do you recognize any of the items of clothing depicted in
Exhibits 19 or 20?

MR. BAKER: Outside the scope of his representation of Mr. Simpson.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Inside or outside.

MR. BAKER: I will object it goes to his representation of Mr. Simpson.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You have not seen any of those?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Have you seen the items depicted in Exhibit 21?

MS. LEVINE: White jockey shorts?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

Q: Did you see whether those were the kind of shorts Mr. Simpson took
over to your house?

A: No, I don't know.

Q: Okay. Let me show you Exhibit 173, which appears to be-which is
another picture of the-of that bag that you saw on the closet floor.
Do you see that?

A: Yes, sir.

MR. LEONARD: What exhibit number is that?

MR. PETROCELLI: This is Exhibit 173. He previously saw Exhibit 26.

Q: There is another photograph on the reverse side of Exhibit 173. Do
you see the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Has various pockets and compartments.

A: Yes.

Q: Do you see that?

We are talking about this sort of  brownish-blue bag. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you look in each and every one of the compartments or pockets
to see if there was anything in it?

A: I don't recall those compartments. You led know, if they were
there, I would have gone through f everything, but I don't -- I just
don't remember those  compartments.

Q: Does this not look like the bag you saw? You can take a look at
Exhibit 26 again if you need to.

A: This looks like the bag I saw.

Q: And you would have checked every compartment. Right?

A: I would think so, yes.

Q: And you found nothing in there. Right?

A: To my best recollection, no, I did not.

Q: Okay. Let me show you a pair of shoes that are identified by this
photograph No. 1063. Do you see that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Do you recognize those shoes?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for information he might
have learned in the representation of Mr. Simpson on the grounds of
attorney-client or attorney work product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Those appear to be the shoes that you took out of the golf
bag when you inspected it with Mr. Cowlings?

A: Could be. I don't know.

Q: I don't want you to guess.

A: I don't know.

Q: Do those shoes appear to be the shoes that you took out of the bag
with Mr. Cowlings?

Go ahead. You can answer.

A: Could be. Could be. I don't know.

Q: You don't know?

A: I don't know. I don't recall.

Q: Take a look at this other photograph of those same shoes --

MS. LEVINE: Also marked as 1063?

BY MR.-PETROCELLI:

Q: Excuse me. This is on the reverse side of that photograph also
bearing No. 1063, and then there is a ruler next to it. Do you see
that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Then you see what appear to be a pair of Nike shoes?

A: Yes.

Q: They appear to be golf shoes?

A: Yes.

Q: Do those appear to be the shoes that you saw when you took the
shoes out of the golf bag with A.C. Cowlings?

A: I don't know.

Q: Do they -- you don't remember if-

A: No

Q: -- the shoes you took out had dirt on them or mud on them?

A: I thought the shoes were clean that I took out, but it's just a
guess. I don't know.

Q: Now, at some point during the week a box with clothing was taken to
your home from Mr. Simpson's home. Correct?

A: Was taken from my home to Mr. Simpson's home?

Q: Excuse me. At some point during the week of June 13 a box of Mr.
Simpson's clothing was taken from his home to your home.

A: I don't know.

Q: Do you know whether additional clothes were brought to Mr. Simpson,
who was staying at your house during that week?

A: Yes.

Q: And do you know how they got there?

A: No.

Q: Do you know who brought them over there?

A: No.

Q: Do you know what they were brought in?

A: No.

1Q: Do you know if they were brought in a box?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you ever see a box in the room where Simpson was staying?

MS. LEVINE: Ever?

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, during that week and these ensuing days and
weeks.

THE WITNESS: I seem to recall that, but I really-now that you mention
it, I remember something with some clothes in it, a box.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What happened to the clothes that were brought over to your house
after Simpson's arrest?

A: After his arrest?

Q: Yeah. After Simpson was arrested, what happened to all the clothing
that was brought over to him, his clothing?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client or attorney work
product information. I will instruct him not to answer.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson's clothing in his room after his
arrest?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction, to the extent he hasn't answered the
question already. I mean, we've been through this a thousand times as
well about the bags lying on-

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, we went through the bag, the Louis Vuitton bag;
we went through the bag on the  floor; we went through the little
toilet bag, but there was a box of clothing brought over, and we
haven't gone through that, and that's what I am now asking him about.

MS. LEVINE: And what was your question?

MR. PETROCELLI: Randa testified that she brought over a box of
clothing.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Ask it again.

MR. LEONARD: I am not sure-

MR. PETROCELLI: You were there.

MR. LEONARD: I thought she had one brought.

MR. PETROCELLI: Had one brought.  MR. LEONARD: Well, I mean-

MR. PETROCELLI: Box of clothing.

MR. LEONARD: I just want to make sure the record's clear.

THE WITNESS: Okay. All right. Ask the question again.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: I want to know whether you saw any of Mr. Simpson's clothes in the
room after he was arrested.

A: Yes.

Q: Lying where or in where? .

MS. LEVINE: If you recall.

THE WITNESS: I recall seeing some clothes in 1 the closet.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And is that the only place?

A: I-there could have been-

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is the only place you remember seeing his clothing in the closet?

A: Yes.

Q: Hanging on hangers?

A: Yes. Q: Folded up on shelves?

A: No. Just hanging on hangers.

O: And what happened to that clothing following his arrest?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. To the ex- tent it calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information, I instruct you not to answer. To
the  extent it may have been turned over to Judge Wong, go ahead and
answer.

THE WITNESS: No, it wasn't.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: It was not turned over to Judge Wong. Is that correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Do you know what happened to it?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Tell us.

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client or attorney work
product information, I will instruct him not to answer.

MR. BAKER: Same objection. t2, BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You had testified in the prior session of your deposition that on
the Monday evening when you went up to the bedroom when you first got
back with Simpson from the office, that he was met by Officer Lange --
or Detective Lange.

Do you remember that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And Detective Lange asked Mr. Simpson what he had been
wearing the night before, and Mr. Simpson pointed to a pair of slacks
in the bathroom.

Do you remember that?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And did Detective Lange pick up those slacks and inspect them
in your presence?

A: Not that I recall, no.

Q: Okay. He just didn't touch them I so far as you could tell?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. And did Detective Lange pick up or touch any other of Mr.
Simpson's clothing other than the shoes that Mr. Simpson handed him in
response to Lange's request for the shoes that Mr. Simpson had been
wearing the night before?

MS. LEVINE: To his knowledge?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q: In your presence.

A: Not that I saw, no.

Q: Were you there the entire time Simpson was there with Lange in the
bedroom?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see anywhere in that bed- room a-any dark sweat outfit or
sweat suit or sweat pants or sweat jacket? And by "dark" I mean dark
blue or black.

MS. LEVINE: On that day at that time?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe so.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. And where?

A: In Mr. Simpson's closet.

Q: Why were you in his closet?

A: We walked in his closet.

Q: And who walked in?

A: I think Mr. Taft and myself, and I don't know if Mr. Weitzman was
there, and Mr. Simpson, and maybe Detective

Q: Was this before Lange got there?

A: No, no. Detective Lange was in there with us.

Q: When you got back to Rockingham, Lange was there. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. And you were-what happened in that closet?

A: You know, again I could be speculating. I know I'm speculating.

MS. LEVINE: Well, don't speculate.

THE WITNESS: I just-I just know we walked in the closet, and I thought
I saw, among other things white shirts and dark shirts and this and
that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Is that where Simpson handed Lange the ,l shoes, the Reebok tennis
shoes?

A: No. I'm believe he went in the closet and got it and brought it out
to him in the bedroom.

Q: And when you were in the closet, was that before or after Simpson
gave Lange the tennis shoes?

A: I think it was before, just before.

Q: Was that the last time you were in Simpson's closet prior to his
arrest?

A: No.

Q: When were you in there again, or the next time?

A: Tuesday morning.

Q: When Simpson was pulling together some belongings to take to your
house?

A: No, he wasn't pulling-no, not at that l time. We had walked in his
closet, and again, if I'm not mistaken, I think Mr. Weitzman and Mr.
Taft could I have been there also. But we walked in his closet and he
was in there and just talked for a second, and, I mean, we'd go in and
out. So it wasn't-it was just like common to walk in there.

Q: Is this when you arrived at the house on Tuesday morning?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you bring the Vuitton bag into the closet?

A: No.

Q: What was Simpson doing in the closet?

A: I don't think-he wasn't-I don't believe he was there when I first
walked in, but he would walk in there and talk-

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate. Just say what he did.

THE WITNESS: I don't know what he did at that moment, but I just know
his pattern, what he would do.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What were you doing in the closet?

A: Just talking.

Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson removed any items of clothing from
his closet?

MS. LEVINE: On that morning?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q: Well, let me ask you this: You've told me now two times you were in
Simpson's closet, Monday evening and Tuesday morning, before his
arrest. Okay?

A: Yes.

Q: Were you in his closet any other times that week before his arrest?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. The answer is no?

A: Correct.

Q: So you were only in his closet two times that week. Right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And during those two times that you were in his closet, did you see
Mr. Simpson take any clothing out of his closet?

A: No.

Q: Did you see him do anything with any of the items of clothing or
shoes in his closet?

MR. BAKER: Other than the shoes he gave Detective Lange?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Do you know whether any of Mr. Simpson's clothing that week
was- either shoes or gloves or sweats or anything, was taken from his
closet?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client privileged
information.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer.

Do you know how much longer you'll be?

MR. PETROCELLI: Not much. Getting ready to wrap up.

MR. LEONARD: He's winding up, I can tell. He's winding up.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you earned any money as a result of exploiting these two
murders on June 12, 1994?

MR. BAKER: Relevancy and argumentative.

MS. LEVINE: And it's vague. I don't think he can answer a question
that way. I mean, what do you mean, "earned any money...exploiting"

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you received any money for interviews regarding this case?

A: No.

Q: Have you received any money for photographs, posing for
photographs?

A: No.

Q: Have you entered into any contracts whatsoever regarding the events
and circumstances of this case?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it deals with matters I've already
objected to related to anything that's happening now. I continue to
object  on the grounds of privacy. To the extent it relates to
anything that happened during the course of the criminal case and not
related to attorney-client information, related to fees or otherwise,
he can answer the question.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: In answering the question "No," are you excluding from your answer
any proposed or actual book deal?

A: I'm sorry. You are going to have to ask that --

Q: I'm a little confused by your answer given your objection. I don't
know what he's including and what he's excluding. That's my problem.
Okay?

MS. LEVINE: Okay. Let's exclude the -- shall we exclude any fees he
might have earned from Mr. Simpson?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Well, let me ask you that question: Did you earn any fees?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you receive any fees?

MS. LEVINE: And I am going to object as well and instruct him not to
answer on the attorney-client privileged information

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the next thing now?

MS. LEVINE: Anything else in the whole world that he may have earned
excluding anything that's happening right now.

MR. PETROCELLI: "Anything that's happening right now" is a shorthand
expression for what?

MS. LEVINE: Well, we've already talked --

MR. BAKER: You've already gone into this.

MS. LEVINE:-you've asked maybe 300 or 400 times --

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I find it curious that you're taking this
position when you've asked every one of our witnesses the same thing
ad nauseam, and I don't know why this witness deserves any special
protection. Okay? It goes to his motive, it goes to  his bias and it
goes to his credibility.

MS. LEVINE: Well, I am not part of the rest of your case.

MR. LEONARD: Exactly.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. Leonard. "Exactly" what?

MR. LEONARD: No, I mean, he is represented by an attorney who has a
particular legal point of view,  and he has every right to be so
represented.

MR. PETROCELLI: And you agree wholeheartedly, don't you.

MR. LEONARD: I take no position. I haven't objected.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MS. LEVINE: So I have objected --

MR. PETROCELLI: Then why are you talking, Mr. Leonard, if you take no
position?

MR. LEONARD: No. I am taking a theoretical academic position.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, this is not the time and place for that.

MR. BREWER: We will take your course for that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, we will just have to see the judge about the
book deal.

Q: Did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Simpson following the
'89 incident on the effect on his career or his public image that that
incident caused?

MS. LEVINE: Prior to June 14th --

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MS. LEVINE:-at noonish?

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You testified previously that you spoke to Marcus Allen on the
telephone on June 13?

A: Correct.

Q: And he called Mr. Simpson's office when you were there. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that the only time you spoke to him?

MS. LEVINE: Excepting anything he may have done in the course of
representing him in the course of-after June 14th at noonish.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am not excepting anything.

MS. LEVINE: Well, then I am going to have to object to the question,
be- cause it does call for attorney-client or attorney work product
information. If you went to break it down, you can get the answer to
the first half and I will object to the second  half.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Were you friends with Marcus Allen prior to Nicole's murder?

A: Acquaintances.

Q: You considered him an acquaintance?

A: Not a friend.

Q: An acquaintance.

A: Yes.

Q: Is he still an acquaintance of yours?

A: I'm sorry. After the murder or --

Q: No. Before the murders.

A: I just knew him to say hello.

Q: Okay. And how many times did you speak to Marcus Allen in the six
months before Nicole's murder?

A: None.

Q: Okay. In the year before her murder?

A: If I saw him, I'd say hello, but I  couldn't tell you how many.

Q: Okay. And how many times did you speak to him that week of June 13?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. To the extent it calls for communications
learned after June 14th at noonish,  calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: How many times did you speak to him before noon on June 14?

A: I think one or two.

Q: And tell me about those conversations in detail, if you could.

A: He had called Mr. Simpson's office on the 13th and said he was at a
golf tournament in the Bahamas or Grand Cayman Islands or somewhere
and wanted to know what happened, and I said, I don't know. We don't
know anything right now," and that was the gist of the conversation,
as to he just wanted to know whet was going on. I believe he called
either one or two more times that day.

Q: At the office?

A: Yes, at the office.

Q: On June 13?

A: Yes.

Q: He called a total of two or three times in the afternoon that you
were there.

A: That's correct.

Q: Marcus Allen did.

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Did you call him at all?

A: No, I did not.

Q: Okay. And each time he spoke to you? .

A: I just happened to answer the phone. He could have called other
times and spoken to Cathy Randa. I don't know, but --

Q: Did he speak to anyone else besides you in your presence?

A: That I know of, no.

Q: Okay. And did you speak to him that evening at all on June 13?

A: I don't think so, no.

Q: Did you speak to him the next day before noon?

A: No.

Q: Did you speak to him at any time that week after June 14 --

MR. BAKER: Objection --

MS. LEVINE: Objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: --after noon -- afternoon on June 14?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client and attorney work
product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

A: When Marcus Allen was sought to be subpoenaed in connection with
Mr. Simpson's criminal trial, did you have any conversations with him
at that time?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client and attorney work
product information. I will instruct him not to answer it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any conversations with Katherine?

MS. LEVINE: With?

MR. PETROCELLI: Katherine, his wife.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection and same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Prior to Nicole's murder did you, know Katherine?

A: I just knew she was his wife.

Q: That's all?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Did Mr. Allen, in the several conversations you had with him
on June 13, tell you when he had left for the Bahamas or wherever he
was?

A: No, I don't think so.

Q: Okay. During Mr. Simpson's divorce proceedings in 1992, did he ever
tell you that Nicole was inventing stories of abuse to defraud or
deceive him?

A: No, he did not.

Q: Did he ever tell you that Nicole was making things up about him?

A: No.

Q: Making up incidents of spousal abuse?

A: No.

Q: Did anybody ever tell you that?

A: No.

Q: Did you know of any charges of spousal abuse by Nicole against Mr.
Simpson in connection with his divorce proceedings?

MR. BAKER: At what time? Before --

MR. PETROCELLI: Before.

MR. BAKER: -- June --

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, before June 12, 1994.

THE WITNESS: I knew nothing of his divorce proceedings.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Did you know of any of the discussions or negotiations after
the 1989 incident that resulted in Mr. Simpson making an agreement
with Nicole that if he ever willfully inflicted injury on her
hereafter, that she could void her prenuptial agreement?

MR. BAKER: Again, information he knew before June 14th, 1994?

THE WITNESS: No, never knew it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Knew nothing about that?

A: That's correct.

Q: Knew about none of the discussions between Taft and Nicole?

A: Correct.

Q: Did you know if Nicole and Simpson were separated following the '89
incident?

A: No.

Q: Do you know what time the children left Mr. Simpson's home on June
15? Excuse me. Withdrawn.

The children slept at your home on the evening of June 14, Tuesday.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And when did they leave your home to go back to the Browns?

A: Wednesday, I believe.

Q: And what time did they leave?

A: I don't know. I don't know. I believe it was Wednesday morning, but
I'm not sure.

Q: Who took them?

A: I think A.C.

Q: Did A.C. sleep over the house Tuesday night?

A: No.

Q: So he came back and picked up the children and took them to the
Browns?

A: Correct.

Q: You testified that on Wednesday, June 15th, you saw Simpson take
the club out and go- said he wanted to go for a walk, and you said,
"I'm not leaving you alone. I'm going with you." Do you recall that?

A: Yes.

Q: Why did you say that?

A: I didn't want him to go anywhere alone.

Q: Why?

A: I felt he was --

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information. I instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: But he wasn't alone because Mr. Cowlings was with him. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Was it at your insistence that Mr. Cowlings went with him?

A: Yes.

Q: So you not only went with Mr. Simpson, you got Mr. Cowlings to go
along. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Mr. Simpson originally was intending, insofar as you understood, to
take a walk alone. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: After having gone to the golf bag. Right?

A: No. No.

Q: You said he went to the golf bag, he peeled it open, he took out a
club and then said, "I want to go take a walk alone." Correct?

A: No, no, that's not correct. He said, "I'm gonna go for a walk."
Then he went and did that.

Q: He said, "I'm gonna go for a walk," and then he went --

A: To the golf bag.

Q:-- to the golf bag. Right? l

A: Correct.

Q: And you said, "I'm not gonna let you go alone." Right?

A: That's correct. That was prior to him going to the golf bag.

Q: And why is it that you specifically recall the sequence?

MR. BAKER: What?

THE WITNESS: Because --

MR. PETROCELLI: Did you have trouble hearing my question?

MR. BAKER: That was a strange one.

MR. PETROCELLI: I can repeat it.

THE WITNESS: Because I didn't want to let him out of the house without
somebody with him at all  times.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Why not?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for attorney-client or attorney work
product information.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was he ever out of your sight at any time on June 14?

MR. BAKER: Objection in it goes to attorney-client/work product
information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was he ever out of the house without your knowledge at any time on
June 14?

MS. LEVINE: Well, how would he know if it was --

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

MR. PETROCELLI: He might have found out later that day, the next day,
the day after.

MS. LEVINE: Objection. It calls for --

MR. PETROCELLI: He might say, "Where is O.J. Simpson?"

"He's missing." Lots of ways he could find out.

MS. LEVINE: -- attorney-client or attorney work product information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Was he ever out of your sight at any time on the 14th?

MR. BAKER: Same objection: Attorney-client, attorney work product
information.

MS. LEVINE: I'll instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: On the 15th?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: 16th?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And June 17th prior to his leaving your house upon learning of his
imminent arrest?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you have any understanding of Mr. Simpson's relations with the
LAPD prior to June 12?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Wait. Did he understand it before June 12th or
--

MR. PETROCELLI: Before June 12, yes.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you know whether he was friendly with police officers?

A: I had heard that, but I had no personal knowledge.

Q: What police officers had you heard that led he was friendly with?

A: With Ron Shipp.

Q: Did you know Ron Shipp?

A: Yes.

Q: Was he a friend of yours?

A: No.

Q: Was he at the house on the evening of June 13 at Rockingham.'

A: I had testified I didn't see him, but I had learned that he had
been.

Q: That he was there that night?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. Did you have any discussions with Ron Shipp about Nicole's
murder?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for attorney-client or
attorney work product information.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Well, prior to the noon on the June 14th, did you have any
conversations with Mr. Shipp?

A: No.

Q: And after June 14?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. You attended a New Year's Eve party one time when Mr. Simpson
played a game where everybody was handcuffed?

A: Yes.

Q: And do you know where those handcuffs came from?

A: No. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, I -- oh, I have to go through your notes, and
then I am done for now. Of course, we will have to come back after the
court rules on all these objections. That's what I have left.

MS. LEVINE: Do you want to save the notes for then so that if the
court orders us to unredact things, we can just go through it?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. I better go through them real fast.

Mike, do you want to jump in first while I organize my notes?

MS. LEVINE: I don't want to go because he's got some childcare --

MR. BREWER: That was my question, what type of childcare issue we
have.

MS. LEVINE: Well, how late -- I mean, how much longer? We've got -- I
just wrote him a note asking whether he could stay still 5:00 and he
said, "That's the outside limit."

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to make a phone call?

MS. LEVINE: That's 40 minutes from now.

THE WITNESS: No. My secretary left.

MR. BREWER: I don't have too long. My questioning is not that long.

MS. LEVINE: Okay. Why don't we go ahead, and we will go as long as we
can go

MR. PETROCELLI: You jump in and I'll --

MR. BREWER: Yeah.

EXAMINATION

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Mr. Kardashian, on the morning of the 13th when you arrived back at
Rockingham, you had some discussions with Cathy Randa. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: During the course of any of those discussions, did she ever whisper
anything into your ear?

A: Yes.

Q: What did she say when she whispered something into your ear?

A: I can't recall. I could give you the  general nature, but I can't
recall.

Q: Well, why don't we start with the general nature of what she said
to you at that time.

A: Basically about how horrible it was that Nicole was killed and just
how horrible everything was.

Q: And that's what she whispered to you?

A: It wasn't a-we were just hugging, so that was basically the import
of it, yes.

Q: And at the time that she whispered this into your ear, was she
holding a Louis Vuitton bag, or were you?

A: Oh, I don't know.

Q: One of you were holding a bag. Isn't that true?

A: Either that or it was placed by my feet. I can't recall.

Q: You've seen videotape of the sequence that I'm talking about?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. And that the Louis Vuitton was somewhere in the vicinity of
both of you at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Do you recall, other than what you've just described, the
nature of anything else that she whispered to you that day?

A: No.

Q: Now, you were asked in your last session about whether you
suspected that Mr. Simpson- whether you believed that he was a suspect
on the 13th at any time, and you indicated that you didn't. True?

A: Correct.

Q: Okay. I want to make sure that we differentiate this now. In your
mind on the 13th at any time did you ever believe that the police
considered Mr. Simpson a suspect?

A: In my mind did I consider that the police --

Q: Yeah.

A:-- considered him a suspect?

Q: Yeah. Not what you considered, but in your mind did you come to the
conclusion that the police considered O.J. Simpson a suspect in
connection with these murders?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And was that at or near the time that he was handcuffed when he got
back to Rockingham?

A: Yes.

Q: So at the point where you left with | the luggage, the Louis
Vuitton bag,  you had formed a conclusion or an opinion in your mind
that the police  considered O.J. Simpson a suspect in connection with
a double murder investigation. Is that true?

A: Not necessarily, no.

Q: All right. Well, where am I wrong?

MR. BAKER: The question is vague. Could call for a narrative.

THE WITNESS: The sequence of events was such that I didn't put
everything together at the time I saw these events transpiring, but I
didn't make hard-and-fast conclusions at this time. Everything was
just a whirlwind, and so I really didn't leave and say, "Aha, he's a
suspect." I didn't have that thought.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Okay. Did you see Mr. Simpson handcuffed at Rockingham before you
left with the Louis Vuitton bag?

A: I saw him handcuffed, yes.

MS. LEVINE: In handcuffs as opposed to the act of being handcuffed?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: That's a vague word.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And in your experience as a lawyer, as a citizen of this country,
the State of California, do you draw any significance to the fact that
someone's handcuffed?

A: Yes.

Q: What does that indicate to you, just generally?

A: Generally, that there's a problem. They're suspected of doing
something.

Q: Okay. And did you draw that same association when you observed Mr.
Simpson in handcuffs at Rockingham the morning of the 13th?

A: No. I just said that I didn't follow it to the logical conclusion.
I saw what transpired, but things were so emotional, that I really
wasn't thinking as I normally would.

Q: Okay. Well, did you suspect that they were handcuffing Mr. Simpson
for his own safety?

A: No.

Q: Did you think that they were handcuffing him because they were
worried about him fleeing the Rockingham premises?

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Can you just describe, just so I  understand what your thought
process was, if you even had a thought process, when you observed the
fact that Mr. Simpson was handcuffed the morning of the 13th when he
returned to Rockingham?

MS. LEVINE: I think he's explained that he saw it, but things were
going on so quickly and people he knew were involved that he didn't
have the thought process that you or I might have looking at a
stranger or that he might have right now.

I don't understand why you need to go through it a thousand times.
What he thinks isn't going to make your case or not make your case.

MR. BREWER: Well, that's your opinion, and you are not going to try
this case, and so I am going to ask the question because the witness
just said three minutes ago that when he saw the fact that Mr. Simpson
was handcuffed, that he thought the police considered Mr. Simpson to
be a suspect, after which he left the premises with luggage that
belonged to Mr. Simpson.

And so now he is saying that he didn't form that opinion or that
conclusion, that it was an evolving process, and I want to sort
through when he came to that conclusion.

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

MS. LEVINE: Well, as you know from the testimony today, he tried to
give that bag in, but that's neither here nor there. I mean, we don't
seem to be getting anywhere with this questioning. You have the facts.
You stated what the facts are that he knows and --

MR. BREWER: Well, that's your opinion. You have a legal objection you
want to put on the record --

MS. LEVINE: Calls for speculation --

MR. BREWER:- put your objection on the record, and I will go forward
with my examination.

MS. LEVINE: -- and argumentative.

Go ahead.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Okay. You want to go ahead and answer my question?

MS. LEVINE: If you can.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. You'd have to repeat it.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: All right. Well, you developed -- you have some mental process that
was going on the morning of the 13th when you saw that Mr. Simpson was
in handcuffs. True?

A: Correct.

Q: And you knew the two people had been killed, one of which was his
ex-wife. Is that true?

A: That's true.

Q: And as you are sitting there on the front driveway of Rockingham,
Mr. Kardashian, did you form any conclusion with respect to whether
the police considered O.J. Simpson to be a suspect in those murders
when you observed the fact that he was in  handcuffs?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

THE WITNESS: I answered it, yeah.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Yes?

A: Yes.

Q: Yes, you did?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Now, after that point, is that when you spoke with this
African-American police officer in an attempt to return luggage that
you believe belonged to Mr. Simpson?

A: I can't tell you if it was before or after. I don't know.

Q: When you had decided to leave the Rockingham premises with Mr.
Simpson's luggage, did you tell any police officer that you were
taking this luggage from Rockingham?

A: No.

Q: Did you form an opinion as to whether Rockingham had been declared
a crime scene at any time while you were there on the morning of the
13th?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Vague.

MR. BAKER: Calls for speculation.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Do you know what a crime scene is?

A: The crime scene I thought was at Bundy. I never-I didn't consider
Rockingham a crime scene at that time.

Q: Did you see any markers on the driveway where they had identified
the location of blood and --

MS. LEVINE: Asked and answered.

MR. BREWER: Excuse me. First of all that is not an objection for a
deposition when we have multiple attorneys --

MR. BAKER: Are you giving me legal advice, Mr. Brewer? Because --

MR. BREWER: Yeah, I'm giving you legal advice because you need it.

MR. BAKER: -- I am putting it on the record no matter if you want it
or if you don't.

MR. BREWER: We will waste your time, we will waste the witness' time,
and we will be back here another day if that's what you want to do --

MR. BAKER: Well, you weren't even at the deposition. It was asked and
it was answered.

MR. BREWER: I was at the first session of the deposition, sir.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nor were you Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: You were not.

MR. BAKER: Well, I read it last night.

MR. BREWER: Okay. Don't let the facts get in the way of your argument.

MR. LEONARD: Other than that...

MR. PETROCELLI: Other than that...

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Do you have the question in mind? I will ask it again if you want
to waste time.

A: No, I don't want to waste time. I want to answer the question
properly, so you are going to have to ask it again. I'm sorry.

Q: Okay. Good. Did you see any markers or indications that blood had
been found on the driveway  at Rockingham on the morning of the 13th?

A: I don't recall seeing that.

Q: And you have no recollection at all.

A: That's correct.

Q: Did you learn from any source while you there on the morning of the
13th that blood had been found on the driveway at Rockingham?

A: No, I don't believe so, not that morning.

Q: Okay. No police officers told you?

A: No.

Q: Cathy Randa didn't tell you?

A: No.

Q: Howard Weitzman didn't tell you?

A: I didn't speak to hardly any of them.

Q: Now, after Mr. Simpson had given a statement and he returned to his
Office, you had a conversation, I believe, where he related to you
some of the events that morning when he was in Chicago. Is that true?

A: No, I don't think I said it was at that time. It was I believe the
next day he related a little bit.

Q: On the 14th?

A: I believe so.

Q: Okay. And he related to you the sequence of events after he cut his
finger, went down to the lobby, attempted to contact Hertz
representatives and so forth. That was on the 14th.

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Now, on the morning of the 14th, you indicated that you went
over to Mr. Simpson's house to console him. Is that correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And that's because you thought he was probably grieving and in
shock as a result of the death of his ex-wife. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: And part of that reasoning was based upon  your observations from
the previous day. Is that true?

A: Correct.

Q: And part of that is based upon what you would expect from a person
who had just lost his  ex-wife within the past 24, 36 hours. Is that
true?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you went over there, did you have occasion that morning
before you went back to the office to observe Mr. Simpson's demeanor,
how he appeared?

A: Yes.

Q: And was that in the car ride back to the office?

A: No. It was in his bedroom and then on  the-in the car ride back to
his office.

Q: Did he appear to be in shock?

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

THE WITNESS: Well, I thought he was a different person than the person
I knew.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And this is on the morning of the 14th?

A: Yes.

Q: Was he crying?

A: No.

Q: Can you describe what you observed relative to his demeanor that
morning?

A: Best way I could put it is he was sullen. He wasn't as-he wasn't
outgoing. He wasn't the way I had seen him previously. He was very
quiet and --.I mean, that was a marked change in him.

Q: Reflective?

A: I would say so.

Q: Quiet?

A: Yeah.

Q: Emotional at all?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't know if I would describe it as emotional.
It was quiet and sullen.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And was that demeanor, what you had just described what you
observed that morning, was that consistent into the early afternoon?

MS. LEVINE: Objection to the extent it calls for anything after noon
on that day. I instruct him not to answer. Attorney work product and 
attorney-client --

MR. BAKER: Objection --

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Before noonish.

A: Yeah, he was pretty much the same throughout.

Q: Now, when you left the office and went to get the golf clubs, your
plan was to get the golf clubs and then head to your home in Encino.
True?

A: Correct.

Q: And he requested that you go to the airport to get the golf clubs.
Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: And if you left the office and went to your home, you would have
gone north. Is that true?

A: South.

Q: Your home is south of the office?

A: Oh, I'm sorry. No, I didn't go home. I went to the airport.

Q: I understand that. If you didn't go to the airport, you  went
directly from the office to your home --

A: I'm sorry.

Q: -- you would have gone north. Is that true?

A: That's correct.  Q: From his office. And in order for you to go to
the airport, you had to go south first. Correct?

A: That's right.

Q: Completely the opposite direction of your house. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Were you surprised, given the fact that Mr. Simpson's ex-wife had
been brutally murdered within the past 36 hours, that he asked you to
drive him to the airport to pick up his golf clubs?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant and vague.

THE WITNESS: I wasn't surprised. I knew he was in shock, and I didn't
-- you know, I just was l there to do whatever he wanted to do. I
mean, it was a little strange but, on the other hand, people handle
shock differently, so I just said, "Okay, I'll take you."

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: You weren't going to question what he wanted to do. You were just
there to be supportive as a friend. True?

A: Yes.

Q: But you thought that was somewhat of an odd request, didn't you
that someone whose wife had been killed 36 hours earlier wanted to go
to an airport to pick up golf clubs? Isn't that true?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant, vague sound-biteish.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And did you question at all Mr. Simpson at that point with respect
to whether there was something in that golf bag that he wanted to get?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client or attorney work
product.

Isn't this after that noon period of June 14?

MR. BREWER: Well, we've got all kind of discussion with respect to
what they talked about before and during that car ride, particularly
before, that Mr. Simpson was the one that made the request to go get
the golf clubs.

Q: And my question is: Given the oddity of that request, is there
anything that you asked him about relative to whether he needed
something from the golf bag?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Attorney-client/ attorney work product
information.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Did you ask him why he wanted to go to the airport to get the golf
clubs?

A: No.

Q: Was there any discussion about his motivation behind going to the
airport to get the golf clubs?

A: No.

Q: Did you suggest to him that he could have them delivered?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever had luggage delivered from the airport?

A: Yes.

Q: To your knowledge has Mr. Simpson ever had luggage delivered from
the airport where the luggage has come after a flight he was on?

A: That I don't know.

Q: But you've had personal experience in that regard. True?

A: Yes.

Q: And there was absolutely no discussion at all at that time
concerning the ability of Mr. Simpson to have his golf clubs
delivered-

A: No.

Q: -- to Rockingham or Encino if you wanted to.

A: No discussion.

Q: Have you ever heard from any of your ex-wife's friends anything --
and again, this is prior to the time period that your attorney has
indicated we are not going to talk about, just so you're clear.

Have you heard from any of your wife's friends that are common friends
with Nicole about the relationship between Nicole and Mr. Simpson as
it refutes to its volatility?

A: No.

MR. BAKER: Compound.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And before January of 1989 you had known Mr. Simpson for several
years. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: And you had a pretty close relationship. Is that true?

MR. BAKER: Vague.

THE WITNESS: We had the type of relationship that we'd see each other
a couple times a year, four, five times a year, but it wasn't -- I
wasn't one of _ his best friends.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: You had business relationships with him, though. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: You had a chance to observe him in different environments,
stressful environments, less stressful environments. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: You had a pretty good opportunity to assess what kind of person he
was. Is that a fair statement?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Vague.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: You had a pretty good opportunity to assess the type of character
that he had. Is that true?

A: Yes.

Q: And you had a good opportunity to assess his temperament. Is that
true?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Vague.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And based upon all of the things that you knew, did you think Mr.
Simpson, prior to January 1st of 1989, was capable of inflicting
physical harm on his wife Nicole?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And after January of 1989 when you read in the newspaper that Mr.
Simpson had in fact inflicted physical harm on his wife Nicole, you 
indicated that you were shocked with that information. Is that true?

A: That's true.

Q: And did you begin to question at that point how well you really
knew Mr. Simpson as a result of learning information that you thought
was so  contrary to what you knew about him?

MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And you indicated earlier also that when you heard the 911 tape,
that you were in shock as a result of hearing that tape because it was
a part of Mr. Simpson that you had absolutely no familiarity with. Is
that true?

A: Yes.

Q: And again, did you begin to question how well you really knew Mr.
Simpson as a result of hearing the 911 tape coupled with the '89
incident?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. That calls for attorney-client or attorney work
product information. I think the testimony was that he heard that
later on, after that 14th date.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Did you know the 911 incident, the verbal altercation that they had
in October of 1993, before noonish of June 14, 1994?

A: No.

Q: You had never heard that the police were called and had to restrain
Mr. Simpson --

A: No.

Q: -- at the Gretna Green location --

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q:-- in October of 1993?

A: No.

MR. BAKER: No foundation.

MR. BREWER: You know, you can go ahead and make the objection, Dan,
because the transference of the objection to Mr. Baker is more
disturbing than just if you made it first, because I have no objection
--

MR. LEONARD: That's bothering you?

MR. BREWER:-- if you want to make an objection.

Yeah, it does bother me.

MR. LEONARD: Wow.

MR. BAKER: Mike's sensitive today.

MR. BREWER: I just want to make your job easier.

MR. LEONARD: I'm glad I know that now.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: When Mr. Cowlings came over to your home to help you go through the
golf bag, you said you needed somebody to witness that process. Is
that  true?

A: Yes.

Q: Of all the people to select, how did you go about selecting Mr.
Cowlings to witness the event where you were going through a golf bag
in an effort  to determine whether or not it contained a murder
weapon?

A: I just -- he's a close friend. I just -- I knew that he would come
right over, and he did.

Q: Were you looking for somebody who would be -- who would keep this
confidential? Was that in your analysis at all?

A: No. My analysis was I never would have looked in it had I thought
that

I looked in it to find out if there was anything in that bag. If there
was anything in that bag, I would have immediately turned it over to
the police. I was not looking at it for any other purpose whatsoever.

Q: Okay. The primary purpose was some rumor or innuendo that there
might be a murder weapon in the  bag, though. True? That stimulated
this search?

A: That stimulated it, correct.

Q: Did you ever consider just giving the bag to the police in order to
let them go through the bag and look for a murder weapon?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you say you considered it, it's something you thought
about?

A: No, now this is privileged.

MS. LEVINE: Object on the basis of attorney-client or attorney work
product privilege and instruct him not to answer.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Did you ever contact the police department and ask them to come get
the bag because it may contain a murder weapon?

A: I did not, no.

Q: Same question with respect to the district attorney's office. Did
you ever contact the district attorney and ask them to search the bag
because it may contain a murder weapon?

A: I did not. However, the police searched my entire home on the 17th
and did not take anything. The Louis Vuitton bag, the golf bag, any of
his clothes, they took nothing, and they searched the entire home.

Q: Well, I am not sure how that relates to the question I just asked.

A: Well, it relates if they were interested in the bag, they would
have taken it. They would have searched and they would have looked.
They didn't take anything. They had us under house arrest and we were
all in one room, and they searched the entire home.

Q: That was on the 17th?

A: Yes.

Q: And at that point you indicated they searched the entire house, is
that excluding the luggage that belonged to Mr. Simpson?

Did you see them at any point search his luggage?

A: I didn't see them search at all. I was -- we were under house
arrest in a room.

A: I didn't see them search at all. I  was -- we were under house
arrest in a room.

Q: Did you indicate to them at that time that his golf bag was in your
garage if they wanted to search it?

A: They never asked me any questions at all.

Q: Okay. And you never volunteered any information relative to the
location of Mr. Simpson's luggage in the event they were interested in
searching it.

A: It was in plain sight in his bed --

Q: His golf bag?

A: The Louis Vuitton bag.

Q: I am talking about his golf bag.

A: No, they never asked.

Q: His golf bag was in the garage at the time. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: The conversation that you had with Mr. Simpson at the park where
you were with your son, who was playing baseball, and Mr. Simpson was
there playing basketball, that was about a half-hour conversation. It
that correct?

A: Yes.

Q: Of that half hour, how much time did Mr. Simpson take talking about
Nicole and what Nicole was doing going out with her girlfriends to the
club scene and things of that nature?

MS. LEVINE: If you know.

THE WITNESS: My best estimate would be about ten minutes, five or ten
minutes.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Okay. Five or ten minutes. And the remaining 20, 25 minutes was
spent just catching up on what you had been doing?

A: It was basically I was talking to him about what had been going on
in my life.

Q: Okay. So roughly five to ten minutes of the conversation related to
Mr. Simpson telling you what was going on between he and Nicole, and
then the remainder of that time period was you telling Mr. Simpson
about what was happening in your life?

A: I would think that's pretty close.

Q: Okay. And was he the first one to talk in terms of telling you --
telling either one of you what was going on?

A: That I don't recall.

Q: And at that point you had seen him once or twice a year. True?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you -- prior to noonish of June 14, 1994, did you ever talk to
Mr. Cowlings with respect to his involvement, if any, in taking Nicole
Brown to the hospital as a result of the  January 1989 incident?

A: No.

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings prior to that same time period ever indicate to
you that he had witnessed some of the events that occurred on that
day?

A: No.

Q: Did you know that --

A: No.

Q: -- prior to that time that Mr. Cowlings was at the Rockingham
location at various times that day?

A: No.

Q: Did you happen to see O.J. Simpson on New Year's Day, 1989?

A: No.

Q: Do you recall that occasion? Is there anything about that date
that's  significant? USC was playing in the Rose Bowl, for example.

A: No.

Q: You didn't see-you didn't go to the Rose Bowl that year with Mr.
Simpson?

A: I don't know. Who were they playing? Do you know?

MR. BREWER: Dan?

MR. LEONARD: It was on the 2nd that year, wasn't it, Dan?

THE WITNESS: You know what? I don't think so, but when you just said,
"you didn't go to the Rose Bowl" with him, we went to the Rose Bowl
one time, and I don't know what year it was.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Was it in the '80s or the '90s?

MS. LEVINE: Or the '70s.

THE WITNESS: It would have been  -- well, we've gone several times. I
would think it would have been in the '80s and not the '9 --  know
it's not the 90s.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: You went to USC. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And was it a common practice for you as an SC alum, along with Mr.
Simpson and Mr. Cowlings, to go to the Rose Bowl if SC was playing?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Together?

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Yeah. Would you all go as a group? Was it a --

A: Well, we'd go with the team and go on the bus.

Q: Okay. And so you would make it a habit -- if SC was playing in the
Rose Bowl, was there a practice that you all followed going together
to see the game?

A: No. We did this maybe twice.

Q: Okay. Two times where you went there as a group?

A: Where we went -- I can't recall if A.C. went --

MS. LEVINE: Plus SC wasn't that good in those years and never got to
play in the Rose Bowl.

MR. BREWER: Well, we made it in '89 at least.

THE WITNESS: O.J. and I would go, and maybe A.C., to the hotel and go
with the team, and we did that maybe twice.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: Let me ask this. Maybe this will help: Do you ever recall going to
a Rose Bowl game with Mr. Simpson where A.C. Cowlings was supposed to
go but did not?

A: I can't recall. Sorry, I can't recall.

Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was aware of your inactive status
as a lawyer before June 13, 1994?

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

THE WITNESS: He was never aware of it.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: You never had any discussions with him wherein you indicated to him
that you had allowed your status to become inactive?

MR. BAKER: Before June 14th?

MR. BREWER: June 13th, 1994 is the operative date.

Q: And the question is: Before that date did you ever have any
discussions with O.J. Simpson wherein you indicated to him that you
allowed your Bar status to become inactive?

A: No.

Q: How about noonish on June 14th?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Had you ever had any discussions before noonish on the 14th
with Mr. Simpson wherein you told him that you were no longer
practicing law?

A: No.

Q: That you did not want to practice law?

A: I could have had that discussion. I don't know when.

Q: When you say that you "could have had that discussion," do you have
a specific recollection of having a discussion with Mr. Simpson prior
to the applicable time period wherein you told him that you were no
longer going to practice law?

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: How about the same question but that you did not want to provide
legal advice to people?

A: No.

MR. BAKER: Speculation.

BY MR. BREWER:

Q: And you may have already said this, but what year did your license
become inactive? Was it 1990?

A: I don't know. '90. '89 or '90.

Q: At any time between Mr. Simpson returning on June 13,1994 and
noonish on June 14, 1994, did you ever tell Mr. Simpson that you did
not want to provide any legal advice in connection with the deaths of
Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown?

A: No.

Q: During that same time period, did you ever tell Mr. Simpson that
you did not want to legally represent him in connection with those
same murders?

A: No

MR. LEONARD: Too long. We're done.

MR. BREWER: I figure this is good point for you guys to, you know, get
your notes up to date.

Okay. Thanks, Mr. Kardashian.

THE WITNESS: Thank you, Mr. Brewer.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have a couple more questions.

EXAMINATION

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: On Exhibit 202, the King transcript, you told the television
audience that Shapiro told O.J. on the morning of the 17th:

"We've got to tell you something O.J.... You've got to surrender, they
are filing murder charges against you and you've got to surrender by
11:00." Can you recount that discussion in detail, please?

MS. LEVINE: Objection --

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client information.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You said that-to the television audience that you thought O.J. was
dead and that he was going to kill himself and that he was suicidal,
and comments to that effect.

What observations did you make that led you to form those opinions?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for attorney-client privileged
information.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. You told the television audience that you spoke to Simpson
while he was on the freeway with Cowlings on and off for an hour,
telling him- speaking to him. He said he wanted to come home and so
forth.

Can you recount those discussions to us?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You told the television audience on Larry King that a lot of
friends deserted Mr. Simpson. Who deserted him>

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client privileged
information if you learned that information during the scope of your
representation of Mr. Simpson.

MS. LEVINE: Can you answer it without things that you learned as
acting as one of his lawyers?

THE WITNESS: Well, it transpired through that whole time, so...

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You -- let me ask you a question: Were any ethical charges filed
against you by Mr. Simpson following your statements to the world
through these television shows?

A: No.

Q: Any charges at all filed by or on behalf of Mr. Simpson against you
for violating the attorney-client privilege?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Have you received any letters from him or any complaints from
him about that?

A: No.

Q: You said that you believe that there was a real killer or two out
there. What efforts are being made to find these killers?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client information.

MS. LEVINE: I will instruct Mr. Kardashian not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you done anything to find the people who you claim are still
out there who killed Nicole and Ron Goldman?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

MS. LEVINE: Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Are you doing anything on your own to locate these so-called
killers?

MR. BAKER: Outside the attorney- client privilege?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. I don't know that he has any.

Q: But outside of whatever it is these lawyers are telling you not to
answer, outside of whatever that is, acting on your own, are you doing
anything to locate the so-called real killer or killers who you think
are still out there?

A: No.

Q: Do you know of anybody who would have wanted to kill Nicole?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for   attorney-client or attorney work
product information. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Prior to June 12 of 1994, did you know of anybody who would have
wanted to kill Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did you know of anybody who had a motive to kill Nicole outside of
O.J. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

MS. LEVINE: Assumes facts not in evidence.  BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You may answer.

MR. BAKER: Prior to June 14?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

Q: Prior to June 14 did you know of anyone who -- other than O.J.
Simpson -- who had a motive to kill Nicole?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative. Mike Brewer-esque.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you know of anyone who threatened to kill Nicole?

A: No.

MS. LEVINE: That way I'll always remember your name. It's a new
objection. I'll always remember that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You told the television audience that O.J. wanted to take the
stand; he wanted to tell his story. Tell us what O.J. said about that.

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client and attorney work
product information. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You told the television audience that O.J. gave an excellent
statement to the police in that there was not anything damaging in the
statement he gave to the police.

What did you mean by that when you said he gave an "excellent
statement?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction.

MR. BAKER: Join.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Are you aware that O.J. Simpson said in that statement that he cut
his finger in Los Angeles before he went to Chicago?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you know that O.J. Simpson told that to the police?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: .

Q: Did you know that he told that to the police prior to June 14 at
noon?

A: No, I don't think so.

Q: Had you seen that-when is the first time you saw the statement that
he gave?

MS. LEVINE: Objection. Calls for  attorney-client/work product
information. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you consult with O.J. Simpson or any of his representatives
prior to giving these interviews?

MR. BAKER: Objection --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Now, I am not asking you for the content of your communications. I
just want to know whether you consulted with them prior to giving
these interviews.

MS. LEVINE: Same objection.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: To Larry King, to DATELINE, to Barbara Walters, when you went and .
told everybody all these terrific . things about O.J. Simpson, how he
was  innocent, how he didn't say anything damaging to the police, how
he  wanted to tell his story and so forth.

MR. BAKER: That question is very compound.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: All of those things that you said, did you consult with O.J.
Simpson beforehand?

MS. LEVINE: Same objection. Same  instruction.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The notes that you gave us, Mr. Kardashian, previously marked as
Exhibit 203, some of these were --  contain entries added after the
fact. Isn't that true?

A: Yes.

Q: The incoming calls, for example, have notes at the top. The one for
6-13 says, "Monday, Notified of Nicole's death."

That was added after the fact. Right?

A: Correct

Q: In whose handwriting?

A: I don't know. It looks like Nicole Pulvers.

Q: And the same thing with the entry on June 16, "Nicole's funeral."
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And the same thing on Friday where it says, "Robert"-what's the
rest of that say Friday, June 17th?

A: "Reeds Letter," it looks like.

Q: "Robert Reeds Letter"? Now, there are-is it your testimony that all
of the entries that you did not redact and left on Exhibit 203 in both
the calendar section and the incoming and out-calling sections
represent entries that somehow relate to the murder of Nicole and O.J.
Simpson? Is that right?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative. Relates to this litigation?

MR. PETROCELLI: This litigation.

MS. LEVINE: Well, let me tell you some of our thought process-

MR. PETROCELLI: I mean, I don't understand the theory by which you
redacted and did not redact. There are entries in here, for example,
which to me seem irrelevant, such as "four children in Fresno." I
don't know what that means.

Anyway, my --

MS. LEVINE: The thought process that we went through on this, if that
helps you any, is that there are certain calls on here that you might
see that are like obviously personal calls, like a family member,
which might be denoted by a family member, but there may have been-it
was our belief that there may have been some conversation in that call
regarding what  occurred and so we left it in, as opposed to things
that were purely business that wouldn't have had anything whatsoever
to do with that.

And so when there is a call, for example, from a family member but it
was our belief that it may have had some conversational content
related to the issues involved here, they were left in.

MR. PETROCELLI: So every single entry in this Exhibit 203 in some way
relates to the murder of Nicole and/or O.J. Simpson. True?

MS. LEVINE: May -- what I was saying, it may have. We couldn't recall
exactly what they were, so some of them that may have. For example,
there is one that says a "Uncle Bob." There is a belief that it could
have, although we couldn't recall.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Do you adopt your lawyer's statements about the description of this
document?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. On the first page, the calendar, on June 13, there is an
entry at 1:00 o'clock that's crossed out. Does that have anything to
do with this  matter?

A: No. That was a lunch meeting I had --

Q: That you canceled?

A: -- that didn't transpire.

Q: And "Mark Boone," he is a business acquaintance?

A: Yes.

Q: Does he know O.J. Simpson?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And the next day, on the 14th, you have another entry crossed
out, "Frank Baker?

A: Yes.

Q: Now, why were those entries left on here?

MS. LEVINE: Because they were canceled because of him doing things
related to this --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Is that true?

A: That's correct.

Q: And is the same true of the 12:00 o'clock Ben Littlefield lunch on
the 16th?

A: That was business, correct.

Q: Okay. Does he have anything to do with Mr. Simpson?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Underneath that there is a redaction, and underneath the
redaction there is something I can't read. What does that say?

A: It looks like "viewing."

MS. LEVINE: "Nicole's body," is what I read it as, "View Nicole's
body."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Turn the page. On the 16th it says "Studio." What does that
relate to?

A: That relates to Movie Tunes.

Q: Nothing to do with this. Right?

A: No.

Q: Then underneath that it says, "Nicole's funeral." Right?

A: Correct

Q: Okay. And on the first page of this calendar there is an entry on
June 9 Thursday. It says "9:00," and I can't read what it says.

A: I have no idea.

Q: Something "McCoy."

A: Looks like "Granger."

Q: Yeah.

A: But I don't know who that is.

Q: And what does that have to do with this matter?

A: Nothing as far as I know. I don't know who it is.

Q: Okay. You don't know why that was left on here then?

A: No.

Q: And under June 11, Saturday, there is something to the right of
Saturday that I can't read.

A: That's my niece's birthday, and then I went to Fresno on the 11th
and 12th.

Q: "AII 4 kids with me"?

A: "A114 kids with me." We went to Fresno.

Q: Okay. On the incoming calls for June 13, are these people who
called you relating to the murder of Nicole called you to talk about
or inquire --

A: Or inquire, yes.

Q: Is that accurate?

A: Yes.

Q: Kimberly is whom?

A: My daughter.

Q: Bob is your uncle?

A: Correct.

Q: Mark Boone?

A: Is-he's really a business associate.

Q: Helen?

A: My mother.

Q: Bruce Brandon?

A: He's a friend in Orange County.

Q: Tommy is your brother?

A: Correct.

Q: And in all these conversations people were inquiring about what was
going on. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And on the next page, the outgoing calls, "Frank Babern?

A: That's correct.

Q: And you included these because you spoke to him about the
situation?

A: No. I don't know why those are there. Those were -- he was from my 
law school. They wanted me to speak at the law school, and that's why
he was calling, and we were trying to reach him to cancel my speech.

Q: On the 14th of June who is Sheila?

A: Sheila [Name Deleted].

Q: Randy's wife?

A: Randy [Name Deleted]'s wife.

A: That looks like my aunt.

Q: Okay. Down at the end, Barbara is your sister?

A: My sister, yes.

Q: And who is Rod Sherman?

A: He's an acquaintance.

Q: A friend?

A: Football player from SC, uh-huh.

Q: Al Rodriguez?

A: Same thing. He's an acquaintance.

Q: Allen Ostroff?

A: That's business. That shouldn't be there. That's business. I did
not speak to any of these people.

Q: On the 15th, Alan Austin?

A: Right.

Q: He's a friend of yours?

A: He's a friend of O.J.'s.

Q: Okay. And what did he call -- what did you and he talk about on the
15th of June?

A: He would just be calling to inquire --

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate if you can't recall what he called about.

THE WITNESS: I don't know. He called constantly just to inquire as to
what was going on.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. Carolyn Cadish?

A: She's a friend from Chicago or somewhere back there.

Q: Uncle Bobby is an uncle of yours?

A: Correct.

Q: Bob Chandler is a friend of yours?

A: Yes.

Q: Denise Brown, you spoke to her, on the 15th?

A: No, I did not speak to her. This -- she could have been calling for
O.J., not for me. I don't speak to Denise Brown that often.

Q: Did you speak to the Browns on the telephone at all that week?

A: I did not, no.

Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson did?

A: Yes, I know he did.

Q: Okay. Jerry Tolman?

A: That's business.

Q: Okay. And Bill Clark?

A: Business also.

Q: Arthur Kardashian?

A: That's my father.

Q: Brian Avnet?

A: That's business.

Q: Why did you include the American Airlines item?

A: I don't know where I was going. "Ticket is refundable." I don't
know.

Q: On June 16, who is David McKenna?

A: He's a friend of mine from law school.

Q: Who are Bridgette and Tanacio Felix?

A: Those are friends of O.J.'s.

Q: On the 17th you spoke to Marcus Allen?

A: No, I did not. It could have been - O.J. could have, but I did not.

Q: Do you remember Mr. Simpson speaking to Marcus Allen? ;

A: No, I don't.

Q: Now, if the call came in for Mr. Simpson, was it recorded on these
incoming call sheets?

A: Sometimes - yes, sometimes they would be.

Q: And how would the person --

A: It was sporadic.

Q: And how would the person get Mr. Simpson on the phone? Just call
upstairs?

A: It was intercommed to either his room or wherever he was located.

Q: Okay. And this is Barbara and Nicole Pulvers who were faking these
calls?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: Okay. Who is third-fourth name down, somebody "Brown"?

A: Looks like "Judy Brown".

Q: Okay. Helene, is that your mother?

A: That's my mother.

Q: Okay. "Joan" on the next page?

A: Joan is my sister-in-law.

Q: Okay. Paula. You spoke to Paul?

A: No, I did not.

Q: But she called?

A: Evidently.

Q: Looks like she called several times.

A: Evidently, yes.

Q: Barbara Walters called you that day?

A: Yes. I was amazed she got my number.

Q: Who is Mark Kurian?

A: Oh, he's just a kid, a friend of my children.

Q: Who is Celeste? Someone who works for Wayne Hughes?

A: No. That's a cousin of mine.

Q: Now go to the next page. It indicates that somebody placed a call
to Marcus Allen at  9: 10, an outgoing call.

A: That was not me. That would have been Mr. Simpson.

Q: And do you know what he and Mr. Allen discussed at 9:10 on the
morning of the 17th of June?

A: I do not.

Q: You attended a meeting at Mr. Shapiro's office, I believe you
previously testified, with a lot of Mr. Simpson's friends in
attendance?

A: Yes.

Q: And that's a meeting that Cathy Randa called people to attend?

A: Yes.

MS. LEVINE: Can I have a date on this?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: This is a meeting that occurred when?

A: I don't know. I think shortly after

Q: Shortly after --

A: June or July, right -- beginning of July.

Q: Mr. Simpson's arrest?

A: Correct.

Q: And this was in Mr. Shapiro's office?

A: Yes, in his conference room.

Q: And there were a number of people there. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And people were phoned in as well, correct, conference-called in?

A: Correct.

Q: And Simpson was on the line from the jail cell?

A: Correct.

Q: And he was on the speakerphone?

A: Yes.

Q: And he spoke to everybody in that room. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And Mr. Shapiro spoke as well. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you speak?

A: Other than to say hello, I don't think I did.

Q: Okay. And tell us what was discussed at that meeting.

A: It was to get support, funds to pay attorneys, to have basic
support if anybody knew anything. Just really aid and assistance in
his case.

Q: And Mr. Simpson talked to most of the people individually in that
room. Right?

A: I think they passed-yeah, he did. I think they went around the
table and everybody said who they were, and he said, "Thanks for
coming," or...

Q: And one of the messages given was to try to support Mr. Simpson
through this ordeal. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And also not to talk to anyone. Right?

A: It could have -- I don't recall. It could have been, "Don't talk "
-

MS. LEVINE: Don't speculate . BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Don't talk. Right?

MS. LEVINE: Do your recall or do you not recall?

THE WITNESS: No, I think so. Not to talk to the press.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: And anyone else. Right?

A: I think it was press.

Q: Including the police. Right?

A: That I don't recall, no.

Q: In other words, Mr. Shapiro told everyone at this meeting that they
should not talk to investigators, press, police, anyone, unless --

MS. LEVINE: That misstates the testimony. He just said not -- he
doesn't recall him saying not to talk to the police.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't have to accept that answer. I can press on. I
don't believe that answer, and I'm probing to see if I can demonstrate
that it's not true.

MR. BAKER: Judge, juror and advocate.

MR. PETROCELLI: No. It's my job.

MS. LEVINE: Well, it's argumentative then, and it's compound.

MR. PETROCELLI: Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. That's an objection the
judge will rule on.

MS. LEVINE: Well, a compound question, he can't answer. That's a
question that needs to be dealt -- objection that needs to be dealt
with here. He testified-

MR. PETROCELLI: Are you going to instruct him not to answer that
question?

MS. LEVINE: Yeah, I am going to instruct him not to answer that
question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Okay. At this meeting Mr. Shapiro told the assembled mass not to
talk to anyone. True?

A: True.

Q: Thank you. Okay. That's all we have for now. We will have a
stipulation that --

MR. BAKER: That the original is sent to Miss Levine -- well, the
original will be sent to Miss-

MR. PETROCELLI: Anyway, we have the normal stipulation: The original
to Miss Levine. 30 days upon your receipt to advise us if there are
any  changes and if the witness has signed the transcript. If it's not
signed and we are not so informed within 30 days of your receipt, then
a copy can be used for all purposes in lieu of an original, and the
court reporter otherwise is relieved of the statutory duties.

So stipulated?

MS. LEVINE: Return to you?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MS. LEVINE: So stipulated.

MR. PETROCELLI: I will say this on the record, though: I am probably
going to set a motion to be heard on January- excuse me-on June 5,
which is a date that we are setting a number of motions in this case
to compel further answers, and I just want to give everyone ample
notice of that.

MS. LEVINE: I have to check my calendar because this isn't the only
case -the case that I have number one on my list.

MR. PETROCELLI: Believe it or not, it's not my only case either.

MS. LEVINE: No, but it's probably higher in your priority list.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, in the presence of my client, I would have to
safe you are absolutely correct.

MR. LEONARD: Dan, we're still on the record.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, we are? Okay. We are off the record now.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes the deposition of Robert Kardashian,
Volume II. The number of videotapes used was three. We are going off
the record, and the time is approximately 5:10.

(ENDING TIME: 5:10 P.M.)

I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING IS TRUE AND
CORRECT. SUBSCRIBED AT CALIFORNIA, THIS DAY OF ,19_. ROBERT G.
KARDASHIAN

producer Lawrence Schiller visited O.J. Simpson 16 times at the Los

Angeles County Jail in November and December of 1994. Schiller, a

former neighbor who once directed Simpson in a music video, gained

access to Simpson as a possible material witness in the criminal

trial. But those visits were primarily used to produce, "I Want to

Tell You," a book in which Simpson answers letters from the public and

proclaims his innocence. Royalties from the book, which received a $1

million advance, were paid to Simpson's legal defense fund. In this

June 7, 1996 deposition, lawyers for the family of Ronald Goldman

LAWRENCE J. SCHILLER,  having been first duly sworn, was examined and

testified as follows:



EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: State your full name for the record, please.



A: Lawrence Schiller.



Q:  I heard you say earlier you do have a middle initial?



A: Yes, but I don't use it. It's J.



Q:  But it's on your birth certificate?



A: No, it's not.



MR. LEONARD:  Don't even go down that road.



MR. GELBLUM:  I have decided not to.



MS. SAGER:  Thank you.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q:  Have you had your deposition taken before, Mr. Schiller?



A: I have.



Q: And have you had an opportunity to discuss with your counsel the

procedures that we will be going through?



A: I have.



Q: Do you  have any questions before we begin?



A: No.



Q: Have you taken any medication this morning or in the last 24 hours

that would affect your ability to listen, understand and answer my

questions?



A: I have not taken any medication.



Q: Have you taken anything that would(ingested anything in the last 24

hours that would affect your ability to listen to, understand and

answer my questions?



A: I have not digested anything.



Q: Have you inhaled anything?



A: I have not inhaled anything.



Q: All right. Do you anticipate any problem with understanding or

answering my questions?



A: Yes.



Q: You do.



A: Yes.



Q: What problem is that?



A: I have dyslexia, and many times I accidentally say different time

periods or dates or  names. I might be thinking of one name, and

accidentally it comes out another. And I have  difficulty reading

sometimes. I look at a word and the(I guess my brain takes the

letters, and I think for a second it's a different word. But I was ( I

havedyslexia.



Q: I always thought dyslexia only had to do with the written word.

It's also the spoken word?



A: Yes, there is a form of it. If I'm very slow and careful, I'm okay,

but if I go a little too fast, my mind thinks slightly different, so I

will try to keep myself slow.



Q: I prefer, obviously, that you go more slowly and be more accurate.



A: Yeah.



Q: When this happens, when you mix up dates or people's names(



A: Mostly people's names.



Q: (when do you realize that you've done that?



A: Sometimes I don't. People have to point it out to me.



MR. LEONARD: Peter, you might want to(I am sure he knows, but you

might want to remind him of the  opportunity to look at the deposition

afterwards.



MR. GELBLUM: Oh, sure, but he has trouble reading sometimes, so(



THE WITNESS: Right, but(





BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Your counsel, I am sure, will read it to you and point out any

errors she thinks exist.



A: Right. I just wanted to make you aware of it.



Q: I appreciate it. That's why I asked the question.



A: Sure.



Q: But from now on I will ask about conditions and not just things

people have ingested, which I have never done before.



MR. LEONARD: There you go.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are you represented by counsel today?



A: I am.



Q: Is it Miss Sager?



A: It is.



Q: Did you do anything to prepare for today's deposition?



A: I just had a conversation with my attorney before I came here.



Q: That's it?



A: (Nods head.)



THE REPORTER: You're nodding your head.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You need to answer audibly. That's my fault. David needs you to

answer with words that he can take down rather than gestures or(



A: Right.



Q:( non-verbal responses.  All right?



MR. LEONARD: You don't have to worry, because he will definitely tell

you.



MS. SAGER: The other thing that I noticed just if I can inject for a

minute, you have to make sure that Mr. Gelblum is done asking a

question before you start to answer because it's really hard for the

court reporter to take down two people, because even one word, like

saying "right" when someone else is talking, he is going to have

trouble with.



MR. LEONARD: Plus one more thing: that also gives me an opportunity to

object if I need to, and if I object, unless your attorney instructs

you not to answer, you must and should answer the question.



THE WITNESS: Thank you.



MR. GELBLUM: Thank you.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I'm here for you.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you review any documents in  preparation for the deposition?



A: No.



Q: Have you spoken with Mr. Leonard before this moment?



A: Yes.



Q: How many times?



A: About five months ago I met him, and then I spoke to him now.



Q: Just before the deposition started?



A: 10 minutes ago.



Q: All right. Did you discuss anything about what was going to be

discussed in the deposition?



A: No.



Q: Did you discuss anything about this case?



A:  About the case?



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: When you met five months ago, where was that?



A: North Carolina.



MR. LEONARD: Burlington.



THE WlTNESS: Burlington.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What were the circumstances?



A: I was meeting with Mr. Bailey.



Q: About this case?



A: No.



Q: Did you discuss this case at all with Mr. Bailey or Mr. Leonard at

that time?



A: No.



MR. LEONARD: We were trying a murder case.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: So the only times you spoke with Mr. Leonard were that one occasion

in Burlington and this morning?



A: I just said hello to him. We walked in and out of the room and we

said hi, and this morning.



Q: Those were the only two times?



A: To the best of my memory.



Q: Have you ever discussed the Simpson case with Mr. Bailey?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object at this point to any questions

directed to conversations that Mr. Schiller may or may not have had

with any particular individual that were done in the course of him

gathering information for preparation of any material for

dissemination to the public, including books, magazines, videotapes

films, on the basis that it interferes with his rights under the First

Amentiment, the California Reporter's Shield, under Article I, Section

2(b) of the California Constitution Evidence Code Section 1070 and the

common law, and any answers Mr. Schiller gives to any questions

involving discussions he may or may not have had with any particular

individual will be limited to any conversations he had that were

outside the context of any information he was gathering for

preparation of any of the materials I've described.



MR. GELBLUM: Could you read that back, please.



MS. SAGER: And for purposes of brevity, if you would prefer in the

future I will simply say, "We are objecting on the grounds of the

reporter's privilege," and ask you to rephrase the question, rather

than giving the whole litany.



MR. GELBLUM: That would be preferable, but I do want to hear the exact

parameters.



MS. SAGER: Sure.



MS. SAGER: And I guess I would add I am not intending to limit by

specifying those materials if it was gathered for some other type of

material for disseminadon to the public: Newspapers, television shows,

et cetera.



MR. GELBLUM: As you know, Miss Sager, we discussed this issue before

the deposition, and we have disagreements about the extent of the

application of the reporter's privilege to Mr. Schiller's

conversations and his work, which we almost certainly will take up

with the court after this, but I wanted  to proceed with this to see

what we can get and what  we can't get, and so we have some specific

issues to present to the court.



MS. SAGER: That's fine. And just so that you know, I will(my

interposed objections, if there is a suggestion I can make on how you

could rephrase the question to elicit an answer as opposed to simply

an  objection, if I think the question can be rephrased, I will

suggest that, but it's obviously up to you.



MR. GELBLUM: I will take all the help I can  get. If you want to do

that, too, Dan(



MR. LEONARD: I don't know how to do that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. Do you understand everything what your attorney just said?



A: Conceptually, yeah.



Q: And, for example, I just asked you a question that prompted

that,which was any conversations you had with Mr. Bailey concerning

the Simpson case.  When I talk about the Simpson case, Iam going to

use some shorthand myself. I mean the circumstances surrounding the

murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. It in-cludes both

the criminal case and thecivil case.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to object to that as vague.



MR. GELBLUM: Okay. Well, I just defined it. You can(fine.



MR. LEONARD: You may think you defined it, but that's vague.



MS. SAGER: There is no question pending.



THE WITNESS: No, I know.



MR. LEONARD: And so therefore I would like a standing objection every

time you use that shorthand term.



MR. GELBLUM: Fine.



Q: Have you had any conversations with Mr. Bailey regarding the

Simpson case other than those that you understand would be covered by

the reporter's privilege as your attorney has just described?



A: No.



Q: So every conversation you've ever had with Mr. Bailey, if any,

regarding the Simpson case was done in the course of gathering

information for dissemination to the public?



MS. SAGER: I would object to the question only to the extent that if

it assumes an answer that there have been such conversations.



MR. GELBLUM: I said, "if any."



Q: ls that correct?



A: Could you repeat the question?



Q: Yes. Has every conversation you've ever had with Mr. Bailey

regarding the Simpson case, if any, been in the course of gathering

information for dissemination to the public?



A: No



Q: Okay. How many conversations have you had with Mr. Bailey

concerning the Simpson case that were not in the course of gathering

information for dissemination to the public?



A: One conversation.



Q: When was that?



A: On St. Patrick's Day.



Q: What year?



A: 1995.



Q: Where was that?



A: I think it was in somebody's home.



Q: You don't recall whose?



A: Actually, it was an art dealer or something.



Q: Where?



A: Beverly Hills.



Q: Who else was there?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Were there other people there?



A: Yeah.



Q: Were there other attorneys for Mr. Simpson there?



A: I don't remember.



Q: So this was during the course of the criminal trial. Correct?



A: Yes.



Q: And what did Mr. Bailey say and what did  you say during that

conversation?



A: He came up to me and just kind of said to me that he wanted to make

sure that I just kept my journalistic integrity in what I was gonna do

and that he had read the EXECUTIONER'S SONG, which was written after 

1976, and he was very proud of the work, and he was being very

complimentary to me. But he did use(he says, "I hope you'll keep your

integrity in writing about or covering the case," and that was all he

said.



Q: What did you understand him to mean by that?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: I just accepted the words he said, and that was it. I

didn't analyze it.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Let's go back a little bit(or a lot, rather. I am going to go over

briefly your employment  history, occupation history(



MR. LEONARD: You said St.Patrick's Day. Right?



THE WITNESS: I think it was St. Patrick's Day.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. I just want to(for the  record, that's March 17th.



MR. GELBLUM: Yes, it is.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. I just wanted...



THE WITNESS: I think it was St. Patrick's Day.



MR. GELBLUM: I wrote down March 17, 1995.



THE WITNESS: But I think it was that weekend.  Maybe not on that day,

but



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay.



A:(it was a party.



MR. LEONARD: Just for the non-Irish(



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did the party have to do with the Simpson case?



A: No.



Q: Did you graduate from college?



A: College says I did. I never went through graduation.



Q: All right. What college?



A: Pepperdine.



Q: What year did they say you graduated?



A: I think 1956.



Q: What degree?



A: They say I have a bachelor of science.



Q: In what subject?



A: In business administration.



Q: Business administration?



A: They say I do.



Q: What was your first full-time occupation after that?



A: After I graduated college?



Q: Yes.



A: I was a journalist.



Q: Were you freelance?



A: I had a contract with Sport Magazine, but it was a(I was not an

employee. I was a contract photographer.



Q: Was it an exclusive contract with them?



A: No.



Q: Did you work for other people?



A: Yes.



Q: Were you mostly a photographer as opposed to a writer?



A: No. I did(well, I did both.



Q: How long did you do that, whatever it was you were doing?



A: My journalisti career started in 1953, actually and went through

197(as a working journalist through 1977(excuse me. Actually went

through 1979.



Q: '79?



A: Right.



Q: Were there periods during that time when you were employed

exclusively by some organization or other?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Tell me which periods those were and which organizations.



A: I had an exclusive contract with the Curtis Publishing Company, The

Saturday Evening Post.



Q: When was that?



A: I believe 1963 or '4 to 1966.



Q: What did you do for them?



A: I was a photographer and an interviewer.



Q: Okay. And were there any other times during this 1953 to 1979

period when you worked exclusively for some organization?



A: I had an exclusive contract with Time Life for domestic

publications, I couldn't work  for anybody else in the United States.



Q: When was that?



A: When I left The Saturday Evening Post for a period of about four

years, three, four years.



Q: So until around 1970?



A: '69,'70.



Q: All right. And what did you do from 1970 to 1979?



A: I wrote books(actually I started writing books in 1966, my first

book.



Q: How many books have you written?



A: I've collaborated on or written at least seven.



Q: Seven?



A: (Nods head.)



Q: Can you name them, please.



A: First book was called LSD WITH DICK ALPERT, Sydney Cohen and

myself, published by New American Library, I think, in 1966. The

second book(I may have the second and the third one mixed up. Okay?



Q: Okay.



A: So the second book was either the Manson book with Susan Atkins.

That was also done for  New American Library.



Q: What was the title?



A: I do not remember.



Q: Susan Atkins was one of the Manson(



A: Correct.



Q: (family?



A: Correct.  Then I did a book which carried another author's name,

but I prepared the manuscript. Then it was novelized. What I'm saying

is I wrote the book in reality, real,and then the publisher felt it

should be written as a novel. And my expertise is investigative

journalism, so Norma Klein was hired to novelize a book called

SUNSHINE, which John Denver wrote a song about.



Q: So that was never published with your name on it?



A: No. My name is in the book and my corporation is on the title page,

but not as the author. As the originator or something.



Q: Okay.



A: I don't have it in front of me. Then I did(I co-authored with

Albert Goldman a book called LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LENNY BRUCE.



MR. LEONARD: I got to talk to you afterwards.



THE WITNESS: About what?



MR. LEONARD: Well, I'm just a big fan, and there is a particular(



MR. GELBLUM: Dan, let's try to get through this.



MR. LEONARD: Sorry.



THE WITNESS: Then I did that book with Albert Goldman, which was for

Random House. Then I did a book called MARILYN in which Mr. Mailer

wrote the text for.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And what did you do?



A: I conceived it, directed it, helped design it, so forth, but he

wrote the text of that. We carried a joint credit. The book has a very

interesting concept.  It has two themes in it: One is the word theme,

and one is the visual, photographic theme. They both tell parallel

stories.



Q: And you were in charge of the photographs?



A: I was in charge of the whole thing. I actually had the right to

edit Mr. Mailer's material because I owned the book.



Q: Who did the photographic part of it?



A: 27 photographers.



Q: Okay.



A: So that was a book called MARI LYN. Okay?



Q: That's five.



A: Yeah. Then I collaborated(your question was books that I

specifically wrote.



Q: Or collaborated on.



A: Okay. Collaborated?



Q: Sure.



A: Then you'll have more books, then, than what I said.



Q: Okay.



A: I collaborated on a book called MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY

PHOTOGRAPHY, a series of six books for the Book of the Month Club.



Q: What was your input to that?



A: I was the conceiver, the director of the editorial approach, and I

wrote part of the text for the various books.



Q: Okay.



A: I interviewed the photographers, so forth, and put together the

text and so forth, hired  people to polish the text, but basically I

investigated how they worked, what was in their minds. Then I did a

book called MUHAMMAD ALI,  which was a collaboration. I didn't do any

writing in that book.



Q: Collaboration with whom?



A: Wilfred Sheed of Sports Illustrated.



Q: What did you do on that book?



A: I conceived it and directed its editorial content based on an idea,

and so forth. Then MINNIMATA, with Eugene Smith, in  which I conceived

the book, did the interviews with all the principals, drafted the

original draft of the book, and then it was polished by another

writer.  Called MINNIMATA.



Q: That's Eugene Smith, the photographer?



A: Yes. It's on the mercury pollution in Japan, first book about

industrial pollution. After MINNIMATA( MINNIMATA and MASTERS OF

CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY was at the same time.



MR. LEONARD: Can you speak up a little bit?



THE WITNESS: MlNNIMATA and MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY, since

it was a series of books kind of interwoven, all six were published

the same day(actually, there were eight, four and  four. Four were

published before MINNIMATA; four were  published after. Okay? Then I

did a book called THE FAITH, f-a-i-t-h, OF GRAFFITTI with Mr.

Mailer,which was about graffiti in the NewYork subways, in which I 

interviewed all the kids in the wee hours of the  night, put all that

together, prepared all the material, and then Mr. Mailer wrote the

book based on mY investigative journalism, combined it with

photographs by another photographer. Then I did the EXECUTIONER'S

SONG, which I interviewed, and the book(the afterward of the book

speaks for itself, maybe close to a hundred people over a

year-and-a-half period,and prepared all  that material.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: The name of the subject?



A: The-



Q: Of that?



A: The execution of Gary Gilmore, his life.  And prepared all that

material, and as Mr. Mailer I believe says in the afterward of thE

book, the book is  based primarily on my material. He never

interviewed any of the people or was at any of the events.



Q: Okay.



A: Oh, by the way, there was one other thing I did: I did a series of

interviews, investigative interviews, for the New York Herald Tribune

on LSD which became the basis of several chapters in Tom  Wolf's book

ELECTRIC KOOLAID ACID TEST, and Mr.Wolf gives me credit in that book.



Q: Who did you interview for that?



A: The Merry Pranksters, Ken Keysey, Mr. Leary. I was at his trial in

Laredo. A whole series. Hitchcock Mellon, Billy Hitchcock, the Mellon

family, Dick Alpert, and Mr. Keysey refers to me in  that book, as

parts of the book are based on my  interviews.



Q: Mr. Wolf, you mean?



A: Tom Wolf, right. I am sorry. The EXECUTIONER'S SONG brought back

that little memory, and I'd forgotten about it completely.



Q: Sort of a flashback?



MR. LEONARD: Move to strike.



THE WITNESS: Are you referring to something?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: No. Okay.



A: So EXECUTIONER'S SONG-



MR. LEONARD: I've never heard that word before.



THE WlTNESS: So EXECUTIONER'S SONG was done.  Then from EXECUTIONER'S

SONG I then did a whole series of interviews of a book to be published

and written by me which is not published yet.



MS. SAGER: Let's only talk about published works.



THE WITNESS: Yes, I understand(



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: But what's the subject of that book?



MS. SAGER: Objection. Shield law. Instruct the witness not to answer.



MR. GELBLUM: I am not asking for the sources or any information, just

the subject matter.



MS. SAGER: I understand.



MR. GELBLUM: I am certainly entitled to test whether the privilege is

applicable, and that's sort of a foun-dational question I need to know

to be able to test it. How can I test it otherwise?



MS. SAGER: I don't think you need to know the subject matter of a book

that's not been written or published in order to test whether or not

the privilege applies, so(but I instructed him not to answer.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I take it you are going to follow your attorney's instructions not

to answer questions?



A: Yes.



MR. GELBLUM: Can we have a stipulation on  that, that when you

instruct him, he will follow that?



MS. SAGER: Absolutely.



THE WITNESS: This reminded me of another book  that I did which I

forgot to mention, which was in the late '60s, which was called the

CRITICS AND SCAVENGERS OF THE WARREN REPORT, which I co-authored with

a writer, Richard Warren Lewis. That was actually done before the

Lenny Bruce story.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: It's called the CRITICS AND SCAVENGERS?



A: OF THE WARREN REPORT. I interviewed and actually wrote a large

portion of that book. Now we will go forward again. Then I did

investigative journalism into the KGB and interviewed a large number

of people and drafted, wrote material, which Mr. Mailer and I

collaborated on a book called  OSWALD'S TALE, and he credits me as his

colleague(collaborator in the book.



Q: When was that?



A: The book was done in 1991-92, but was not published until 1995. And

then I interviewed and wrote a book called I WANT TO TELL YOU in 1994.

Now, there may be a couple other books that I don't remember.



MS. SAGER: Okay.



THE WITNESS: That's what I wanted to say.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That's the complete list thatcomes to mind now of published books?



A: Right. But there are some others. I just don't remember.



Q: The one you mentioned that has not yet been published, but you did

a series of interviews for it, has that been written?



A: No.



Q: Do you intend to write it?



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That "No" was not directed to my question?



MS. SAGER: No. I am sorry. I asked Mr. Schiller a question, which he

responded to me. Without waiving anything, Mr. Gelblum, I think I can

tell you that particular work of Mr. Schiller has absolutely nothing

to do with this lawsuit, so for that reason I don't think it's

appropriate to go into that particular work.



MR. GELBLUM: That's one reason I want to find out, because I won't

waste my time asking the court to make him answer questions that I

don't care about.



Q: That has nothing to do with the Simpson case?



A: None whatsoever.



MS. SAGER: And the only reason that I may not let him answer certain

questions on things which he has not done is because even the subject

matter may give other people ideas for things that are original  to

Mr. Schiller. That's why I wouldn't let him answer that question. But

that's not relevant to this particular lawsuit.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Does that book have anything to do with OJ. Simpson in any way?



A: It has nothing to do with anybody in the United States.



Q: Including OJ. Simpson?



A: Including Mr. Simpson.



Q: Have you conducted any interviews for any  unpublished materials

relating to Mr. Simpson?



A: I think that's privileged.



MS. SAGER: I think we can say on the record that Mr. Schiller is

working on a book. Now, what he has done to prepare for that book, who

he has done it with and so forth, I don't think you are entitled to

inquire into.



MR. GELBLUM: Okay. Well, let's just see how far we can go with it.



Q: You are working on a book relating to Mr. Simpson?



A: Yes.



Q: Does it relate to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald

Goldman?



MS. SAGER: Without waiving the privilege, I will let him answer just

limited questions in order to establish the privilege as it relates to

this matter.



THE WITNESS: It has to do with the aftermath of those murders.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you have a publisher lined up for that?



MS. SAGER: I am going to instruct Mr. Schiller  not to answer any

questions concerning the arrangements, if any, he may have with a

publisher for that particular book. It's not only subject to the

privilege, but I also think it inquires into private, confidential and

proprietary information that is irrelevant for purposes of this

litigation, and it's proprietary to Mr. Schiller.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are you working on that book pursuant to a written agreement with

Mr. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: You do have a written agreement with Mr. Simpson to work on another

book(



A: Yes.



Q: (right?  Have you done anything, taken any steps to perform that

agreement?



A: No.



Q: Not done any work on any book that would(another book(Strike that.

Have you done any work(Can you read back the last question and answer,

please.



(Record read as follows:



"Q. You do have a written agreement with Mr. Simpson to work on

another book(



"A. Yes.



"Q. (right? "Have you done anything, taken any steps to perform that

agreement?



"A. No.")



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Would you characterize the book that you are working on regarding

the aftermath of the Simpson case as a piece of investigative

journalism?



A: Definitely.



Q: Definitely?



A: Definitely.



Q: Have you interviewed people in connection with that, without

telling me who they are?



A: Yes.



Q: Are you working on a book with Robert Kardashian?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question with respect to any

book(any of  Mr. Schiller's collaborators or non-collaborators. I

don't think you are entitled to know who he may or may  not have been

working on the book with, any more than you are entitled to know who

the sources of the book  may or may not be.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you ever spoken with Robert Kardashian with respect to the

Simpson case?



MS. SAGER: I'm going to make the same objection as I raised before

with respect to Mr. Bailey: To the extent that any conversations  Mr.

Schiller may or may not have had with  Mr. Kardashian were in the

context of gathering information for a book, then I will object and

instruct him not to answer. If you want to rephrase the question to

encompass only conversations, if any, outside the context of any that

might have occurred for news-gathering purposes, I will let him answer

that question.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you had any conversations with Mr. Kardashian about the

Simpson case that were not for news-gathering purposes?



A: No.



Q: Never?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



THE WITNESS: Have I ever(could you repeat the question?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you ever had a conversation with Robert Kardashian about the

Simpson case, as we've defined it, that was not for news-gathering

purposes?



MR. LEONARD: Vague and argumentative.



MS. SAGER: Are you talking about at any point in his life?



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



THE WITNESS: Concerning the Simpson case.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Concerning the murders of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.



A: They have all(



MS. SAGER: Excluding any conversations he may have had with Mr.

Kardashian on other subjects, if any.



MR. GELBLUM: Yes. Yes.



MS. SAGER: Okay.



THE WITNESS: Everything was for news-gathering  purposes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Well, Mr. Schiller, didn't you have a conversation with Mr.

Kardashian about visiting Mr. Simpson in jail before you had any  idea

about writing a book about the matter?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative, leading, lack of foundation.



MS. SAGER: And I am going to join in those objections and add

argumentative, and to the extent that Mr. Schiller had any

conversations with  Mr. Kardashian that related to news gathering or

in  his impression were for the context of him preparing material for

publication, then I will encompass those within my objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You can answer if(you can answer the question.



MS. SAGER: If there is information that's already been disclosed to

the public about any such conversations, we are not intending to

object to published information. Only anything, if it exists, to

unpublished information.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I am asking you a simple question: Didn't you have a conversation

with Robert Kardashian about visiting Mr. Simpson in jail before you

were retained to write a book with Mr. Simpson?



MS. SAGER: I am going to raise the same objections, and I think you

are misunderstanding when the privilege may or may not apply, but if

you will  give me a second.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Could you repeat your question again?



MR. GELBLUM: Could you read it back, please.



(Pending question read.)



"Q.  I am asking you a simple question: Didn't you have a conversation

with Robert Kardashian about visiting Mr. Simpson in jail before you

were retained to write a book with Mr. Simpson?")



THE WlTNESS: To that question, yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That was the question.



A: To that question, yes.



Q: Okay. And what did Mr. Kardashian say in that conversation?



MS. SAGER: To the extent that any of that information has been

publicly disclosed, I will let Mr. Schiller answer. To the extent it

has not and he was gathering information that he intended to use later

in publication, I will instruct him not to answer. But anything that's

public, I will let him answer the question.



MR. GELBLUM: Wait a second. You can't draw that line when it's not for

news-gathering purposes. It's irrelevant whether it's been published

or not if it's not for news-gathering purposes.



MS. SAGER: You are assuming, Mr. Gelblum, that Mr. Schiller was not

acting as a journalist at any point before he met with Mr. Simpson in

jail,and I think that assumption is inaccurate.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Mr. Schiller, you went to visit Mr. Simpson in jail because Mr.

Kardashian told you you might be a material witness. Right?



A: No.



Q: No? Okay. Did you bring any documents with you today?



A: I had no documents to bring.



MR. GELBLUM: Let's mark as the next exhibit in order, whatever it

might be(



MR. LEONARD: You know, I know it's late, but maybe I will have a

charitable judge at some point. I am going to object to that last

question as it's vague as to time. We all know that he visited him

many  times in jail.



MR. GELBLUM: (the notice of deposition(the original notice of

deposition of Mr. Schiller together with the subpoena and document

requests.



(Plaintiffs' exhibit 234 was marked for identification by the reporter

and is attached hereto.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you ever seen Exhibit 234 before, Mr. Schiller?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you review it to determine whether you had any documents

responsive to the items listed on Attachment A?



A: I reviewed it and forwarded it to my attorney.



Q: Did you review it to determine whether you had any documents

responsive to any of the requests listed on Attachment A?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And did you have any?



MS. SAGER: I think the responses that we have served on counsel

indicate whether Mr. Schiller had any documents responsive. To the

extent he has objected to some of the requests, I am not going to let

him answer additional questions about those requests that we have

objected to.



MR. GELBLUM: Let's mark as 235 the objections that Miss Sager served.



(Plaintiffs' exhibit 235 was marked for identification by the reporter

and is attached hereto.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you ever seen Exhibit 235 before, Mr. Schiller?



A: Which one is 235?



Q: The objections. The ones on the stationery of Davis Wright

Tremaine.



A: I have.



Q: The response to request No. l, it says that to the extent that you

have responsive material that has been publicly disseminated, it will

be produced. Have you brought with you today anything  in response to

request No. 1?



A: Could you repeat the question, please.



Q: Yeah. Request No. l on page(you can see it on page 3 of the

objections. Miss Sager was kind enough to put the requests in as well

as the responses. I had asked for various materials relating to what's

referred to here as the "Simpson Video," the video that encompassed

the Ross Becker interview, and the response to that makes some

objections and says at the bottom of page 3 that to the extent you

have responsive material in your possession that has been publicly

disseminated, that you will produce it. Do you have anything with you?



A: No.



Q: Is that because you don't have anything  in your possession that's

responsive to this request?



A: That's correct.



Q: What was your role in connection with that video?



A: Which video?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as vague.



MS. SAGER: Let's start with that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Which video?



A: Correct.



Q: The one I just described, the one that encompassed the Ross Becker

interview.



MR. LEONARD: Same objection: Vague with regard to "role." Lack of

foundation.



THE WITNESS: Is there a title to the video you're referring to,

please?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I don't know. Is there a title to it, Dan?



MR. LEONARD: There is, but I'm trying to remember.



MS. SAGER: So I am clear on the record, you are referring to the video

that was marketed and sold by(



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



MS. SAGER: (Mr. Simpson that involved an  interview or included an

interview by Ross Becker?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are you aware of more than one videotape marketed to the public

that includes an interview of Mr. Simpson by Ross Becker?



(Discussion held between the Witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: How many?



A: Two.



Q: What are their names?



A: One was one that was marketed by Mr. Simpson in association to(with

a video company(



Q: Mr. Hoffman's company?



A: Yes.



Q: And what's the other?



A: The other was a documentary that I did that was sold to "Hard

Copy," which Mr. Becker did appear in that documentary.



Q: And what was your role in connection with the "Hard Copy" video?



A: There was no interview.



Q: Did I say interview?



A: Yes.



Q: What was your role in connection with the "Hard Copy" video?



A: Video?



Q: Yes.



A: I filmed and directed a documentary concerning the events

surrounding Mr. Simpson's video that was marketed.



Q: Did you consider that investigative journalism?



A: Definitely.



Q: And what role, if any, did you have in connection with the(what

shall we call it?



MR. LEONARD: I think it's(



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: OJ TELLS?



MR. LEONARD: I think that's what it's called.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Does that sound right to you?



A: (Shakes head.)



Q: We will call it the Simpson video as opposed to the "Hard Copy"

video. The Simpson video is the one that includes the entire Ross

Becker interview and was marketed by Mr. Simpson and Mr. Hoffman. Did

you have any connection with the production of that video?



A: No official role.



Q: Did you have an unofficial role?



A: Yes.



Q: What was that?



A: As an acquaintance of Mr. Simpson, I advised him on certain visual

aspects so that the video looked professional.



Q: Do you recall any particular advice that you gave him?



A: Hire good cameramen, use a certain type of lighting, use three

cameras, overlap the tapes a certain way, where to place the cameras.



Q: Did you give(



A: That's generally what I discussed with him. How to move the

cameras.



Q: Did you give that advice to Mr. Simpson or Mr. Hoffman?



A: Mr. Simpson.



Q: Did you advise Mr. Hoffman at all in connection with the Simpson

video?



A: No.



Q: Do you know whether your advice was taken?



A: It was.



MR. LEONARD: Objection ( too late.



MS. SAGER: Give him a second in case he has an objection.



MR. GELBLUM: That's all right. They never have any merit, anyway.



MR. LEONARD: I did get cut off. My objection was calls for

speculation.



MR. GELBLUM: That's what I mean: Doesn't have any merit.



MR. LEONARD: I resemble that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you deliver to "Hard Copy"every inch of footage that was shot

for the documentary?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question as calling for

information that's unpublished and protected by the reporter's shield

law.



MR. GELBLUM: No. I am trying to find out whether there is any such

information.



Q: Did you deliver everything?



MR. LEONARD: Well, that's a different question.



MS. SAGER: That's a different question than whether everything was

broadcast.



MR. LEONARD: Nice try.



MS. SAGER: If you want to ask him if everything that he shot was

broadcast by "Hard Copy," I will let him answer that question.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Was everything you shot broadcast by "Hard Copy?"



A: No



Q: And you refuse to answer my previous question whether you delivered

everything?



MS. SAGER: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: How much film did you shoot in connection the "Hard Copy"

documentary?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



THE WITNESS: Privileged.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What percentage of all the film that was shot was broadcast by

"Hard Copy?"



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you film anything for the documentary outside of the Rockingham

estate?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you know Robert Blasier?



MS. SAGER: To the extent that Mr. Schiller has any contact with Mr.

Blasier or knows him for any reason other than any information or

context he had in  the course of news gathering, I will let him answer

that question.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did Mr. Blasier have any role in the production of the "Hard Copy"

documentary?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You can answer.



MS. SAGER: No, he can't answer. I am instructing him not to answer.



MR. GELBLUM: We are entitled to know witnesses, to find out, because

then I can go take Mr. Blasier's deposition(



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, sure you can. Don't be silly.



MR. GELBLUM: I am talking about the identity of witnesses.



MS. SAGER: No, you are not.



MR. GELBLUM: Well(



MS. SAGER: I don't want to argue with you, Peter(



MR. GELBLUM: That's really outrageous.



MS. SAGER: The question you asked is not the question you want an

answer to, but in any event, I am  instructing him not to answer the

question that was asked.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who worked on the "Hard Copy" documentary besides you?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



THE WITNESS: Privileged.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You understand I am not asking who you  interviewed or who your

sources were. Who was on the production crew, is my question?



A: Privileged.



Q: Let your attorney make the objections.  Okay?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you observe Mr. Blasier during the filming of the Simpson

video?



MS. SAGER: To the extent that any observations  Mr. Schiller had were

in the context of his presence for the production of his own

documentary, I will instruct him not to answer. If he had any

observations that occurred  other than during times he may have been

present for the filming of his own documentary, I will let him answer

that question.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You did not observe him?



MS. SAGER: Subject to the limitation that I've imposed on Mr.

Schiller, are there any other additional observations?



THE WITNESS: No, none whatsoever.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you observe the filming of the Simpson video?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you observe the filming of the Simpson video for any period of

time whatsoever that was not in connec-tion with your production of

the "Hard Copy" footage?



A: No.



MR. LEONARD: You can actually see the wheels going round in your head.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Have you ever spoken with Robert Blasier other than in connection

with the production of the "Hard Copy" material?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question to the extent there

have been any conversations, if any, with Mr. Blasier concerning any

gathering of information by Mr. Schiller for dissemination to the

public. If there are conversations you may have had with Mr. Blasier

outside the context of anything covered by the reporter's shield law,

you can answer.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: How many?



A: One.



Q: When?



A: One afternoon by my car.



Q: Where?



A: On the parking lot on Broadway and Temple.



Q: What date?



A: I do not remember.



Q:What year?



A: 1995.



Q: What month?



A: Do not remember.



Q:First half of the year? Second half of the year?



A: First half.



Q: During the criminal trial?



A: Yes.



Q: And how long did the conversation last?



A: About three minutes.



Q: And what was said?



A: He wanted me to get an autograph for his daughter of Tommy Lee

Jones, who I had directed in a  film. He knew that, and his daughter

was a big fan of Tommy Lee Jones, and I expressed desire that I would 

use my extreme best efforts to do that.



Q: Did you discuss the Simpson case at all?



A: No.



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: He already said that it was not a privileged

conversation.



MS. SAGER: Okay.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you attend the Simpson criminal trial at any point in time?



A: Yes.



Q: Were you a regular(



MR. LEONARD: Vague.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q:(attendee?



MR. LEONARD: Vague.



THE WlTNESS: What do you mean by "regular?"



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: How many days did you attend the trial?



A: More than half.



Q:And what was your purpose(or what were your purposes in attending

the trial?



A: To write a book or books.



Q: Have you written a book or books(



MS. SAGER: Has it been pubEshed?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q:(based on that information?



MS. SAGER: Are you asking if a book has been  published?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Has a book been published based on your attendance at the trial?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.Vague.



THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I will ask a different question. You said that the purpose for your

attending was to write a book or books.



A: Correct.



Q: Has any such book or books been published?



A: No.



Q: Has any such book or books been written?



MS. SAGER: Well, I think we have already indicated Mr. Schiller is in

the process of writing a book, and to the extent that(



MR. GELBLUM: But you said it wasn't about this case.



MR. LEONARD: What?



MS. SAGER: No, that's a different book. He has mentioned two books

that he is in the process of writing, Mr. Gelblum, one of which had

nothing to do with this case, and he has also indicated that he is

working on a book that does have something to do with this case.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And is the book that you are working on that does have something to

do with this case based in part on your observations and attendance at

the trial?



A: Yes.



Q: Was that your sole purpose in attending the trial: To gather

material for the writing of these books?



MS. SAGER: As opposed to other material(I am sorry. I am going to

object to the question to the extent it assumes that only a book would

be written as opposed to other information disseminated to the public.

I don't think that's what you intended.



MR. GELBLUM: You're correct.



Q: Was your sole purpose in attending the trial to gather information

to disseminate to the public?



A: Yes.



Q: And have you disseminated any information to the public based on

your attendance and observation of the trial?



A: Not as of this date.



Q: Let's turn back to Exhibit 235. That's your objections to the

subpoena. If you look at  request No.2, it asks you for various

written material used in connection with the Simpson video. I just

want to clarify what the response means. After the objections it says:

"Without waiving these objections, and assuming that this request is

not intended to encompass videotapes and other materials already

described in Request No. 1, Schiller and Polaris respond they do not

have any responsive documents."  Do you see that? It's on page 4.



A: You are asking for notes, scripts, transcripts prepared or used by

anybody in connection with the Simpson video or the "Hard Copy."

Right?



Q: Correct.



A: I see my response, yes.



Q: Okay. And what Iam asking you is: Does the response mean that you

have no responsive documents or that you have no responsive documents

that are not protected by the various privileges?



A: I have no responsive documents.



MR. GELBLUM: Let me ask you, Kelli, if you don't mind(



MS. SAGER: Let me just clarify one thing: You said before you don't

want the video itself. I think  that's one of these, and that's why I

am assuming you're not asking again in 2 for the same things you asked

for in 1.



MR. GELBLUM: Correct.



THE WITNESS: I understood 2 to mean written material.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That's right.



A: Correct?



Q: As distinguished from No. 1.



A: I have no written material.



Q: Did you ever have any written material responsive to this request?



A: No.



Q: There were never any(even a single written note that you had in

your possession regarding  the "Hard Copy" material?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



MS. SAGER: Join.



THE WITNESS: No. Excuse me a minute. May I consult with my attorney?



MR. GELBLUM: Sure.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



BY MR. GELBLUM: Q: Do you want to change your answer?



A: No.



MR. GELBLUM: Let me ask you, Kelli, if I might, just to compare that

response in request No. 2 and then on another exemplar is the response

to request No. 7 on page 8 where you say they do not have any

non-privileged responsive documents. I just want to make sure that's

an intentional difference. When you just say you don't have any

responsive documents, that's a flat-out we don't have any of any

color, flavor, whatever. Is that correct?



MS. SAGER: Unless some error was made, that's the way it was intended.



MR. GELBLUM: Okay.



MS. SAGER: No responsive documents meant there aren't any, so you

don't need to fight about it, even though we have asserted the

privilege.



MR. GELBLUM: Okay. I just wanted to make sure that's what you were

saying.



THE WITNESS: On No. 2?



MS. SAGER: Yeah. He is drawing the distinction between when we say we

don't have any unprivileged responsive documents.



THE WITNESS: Exactly. That's the way I understood it.



MS. SAGER: We tried to do that.



THE WITNESS: To be very careful.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Would you please look in Exhibit 235, at request No. 9 and the

response to request No. 9.  That's asking for all audiotapes, notes,

memoranda, et cetera, et cetera, drafts, regarding the book that

turned out to be I WANT TO TELL YOU, and your response, in addition to

the objections, was that you don't have any responsive documents.



MS. SAGER: "That refer to, reflect, or constitute performance by

Orenthal Productions Inc. or Polaris of the written Agreement."



MR. GELBLUM: Correct.



Q: Do you have in your possession, Mr. Schiller, any audiotapes of

interviews with Mr. Simpson that were made in connection with the

production of I WANT TO TELL YOU?



A: No.



Q: Do you have any transcripts of those tapes?



A: No.



Q: You had at one point those documents. Correct?





A: Yes.



Q: What did you do with them?



A: Gave them to Mr. Simpson's attorney,  Mr.Taft.



Q: So you have nothing anymorewhatsoever that relates to I WANT TO

TELL YOU?



MS. SAGER: Nothing that's responsive to the(



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You have none of the tapes or transcripts or notes that went into

making the book. Is that right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



MS. SAGER: And I think the question is responsive to the request. If

you are asking him(



MR. GELBLUM: No. I am asking him a fresh question. Okay?



Q: You can take your eyes off the paper if  you want.



A: You are not(referring no longer to item No.9 in Exhibit 235.



Q: Correct.



A: So I can put this down.



Q: Sure.



A: Thank you.



Q: We may pick it up again(



A: Right, I understand.



Q:(but for now you can put it down.



MS. SAGER: So what's the question?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you have any copies of any audiotapes that you made with Mr.

Simpson in jail when he was in jail?



A: No.



Q: Do you have any transcripts of any of those audiotapes?



A: No.



MS. SAGER: I think both of those questions were already asked, but I

give you a free shot at a repeat.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you have any notes that you took of any interviews that you

conducted with Mr. Simpson when he was in jail?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Your question was notes. Right?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: Did you take any notes in speaking to Mr. Simpson when he was in

jail?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object(well, I am going to object to the

question as seeking information protected by the privilege, but I may

let him answer.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of  the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: The question was(could you read it back? I want to be

accurate.



(Pending question read.)



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you have any of those notes?



A: No.



Q: Did you give them all to Mr. Taft?



A: Not those notes.



Q: What did you do with those notes?



A: Destroyed them.



Q: When?



A: After I wrote the paragraph in the book.



Q: As you wrote each paragraph?



A: No. You are referring to specific notes I took on a specific

occasion.



Q: Did you only(I wasn't. I was asking about any notes.



A: Yeah, well, I only did it once.



Q: You only took notes once during all the times you interviewed him7



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Otherwise everything was recorded on audiotapes?



A: By Mr. Simpson's attorneys.



Q: Were you present? A: Yeah.



Q: You were interviewing him?



MS. SAGER: I am sorry. Can you reread the question?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You were interviewing him?



MS. SAGER: In connection with(you are talking about the jail

interviews?



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



MS. SAGER: For I WANT TO TELL YOU?



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



MS. SAGER: It was a partial question. That's why.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And you had nine of those interviews. Is that right? Or ten?



A: I don't remember specifically. The book speaks for itself.



MS. SAGER: I think there have been published accounts that have that

information, Peter. If you want him to read those and refresh his

recollection, I am happy to have him try to answer that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Was there always at least one other person present with you while

you were interviewing Mr. Simpson in jail?



A: Yes.



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question as calling for

information that's unpublished to the extent it's not reflected in the

book.



MR. GELBLUM: Did you get the answer?



THE REPORTER: Yes.



MS. SAGER: Give me a second before you answer questions.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who was present?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: Are you instructing him not to answer?



MS. SAGER: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you know whether anybody other than you took notes of any of

your interviews with Mr. Simpson?



MS. SAGER: Calls for speculation. Same objection on reporter's

privilege as well.



MR. GELBLUM: Is that an instruction?



MS. SAGER: Yes. You can assume any time I object on reporter's

privilege that I am instructing  him not to answer.



MR. GELBLUM: Sometimes you say "to the extent that the reporter's

privilege applies."





MS. SAGER: Okay. If that's the case, then I will state it. Otherwise

you can assume(if you  want, you can always ask, but you can assume I

am  instructing him not to answer if I object on privilege grounds.



MR. GELBLUM: It seems to me, Kelli, as you in  fact have told me,

that, for example, if Mr. Simpson had notes, those would not be

covered by the reporter's privilege because he is not a reporter. He

is not the reporter. If there was somebody else there taking notes,

those would not covered by the reporter's privilege, and I am

entitled(



MS. SAGER: Those people can assert their own privilege(



MR. GELBLUM: But I can't find out who they are unless you tell me, so

I can't test it.



MS. SAGER: Well, no. You can find out from Mr. Simpson who they are,

if he's not asserting the privilege, and ask him who else was present

during any interviews he had with Mr. Schiller. I wasn't at his

deposition so I don't know whether if he was asked that question or

not, but he certainly is a logical person to have asked that question

of and if anybody else took notes. But under Delaney vs. Superior

Court and New York Times vs. Superior Court, Mr. Schiller's personal

observations, if occurring during a time when he was acting in the

news-gathering capacity are protected under the shield law in

California, and other states have adopted that under the First 

Amendment as well. So I am not going to have him testify except to the

extent that something is published; I can have him confirm published

information. Otherwise, I have to instruct him not to answer. And Mr.

Simpson can assert, if he has one, any privilege or he can answer

questions to garner the same information.



MR. LEONARD: I am sure they must have asked  him that during the 10

days.



MS. SAGER: I assume, but I have no way of  knowing. I haven't seen his

deposition.



MR. LEONARD: I was there, but I don't remember. Can we take a

five-minute break?



MR. GELBLUM: Sure.



(Recess.)



(Arthur Groman enters the deposition.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Mr. Schiller, have you been asked whether you'd be willing to

testify in this case on behalf of  Mr. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: And when I say this case, I mean the civil case.



A: No.



MR. LEONARD: Wait. That went by me. I think there was a lack of

foundation there, but go ahead.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: When did you first meet Mr. Simpson?



MS. SAGER: I am going to allow him to answer that question only

because I know that information is published, but otherwise, to the

extent(



THE WITNESS: Somewheres between(



MS. SAGER: I take that back. I'm sorry. I take that back. I forgot

about that. Go ahead.



MR. GELBLUM: You have to control your reflexes. MS. SAGER: Yeah.



THE WITNESS: Somewheres between 1963 and 1966.



MS. SAGER: I know you're tricky, so



BY MR. GELELUM:



Q: And what were the circumstances?



A: He was jogging backwards as my daughter and two sons were jogging

forwards in front of my  house.



Q: They run into each other?



MR. LEONARD: No.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. GELEILUM:



Q: This is when he was married to Marquerite?



A: Yes.



Q: Yes?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you develop a social relationship with him.?



A: No.



Q: Prior to(well,as of today do you have a social relationship with

Mr. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: Have you ever had one?



A: No.



Q: Have you ever been to his house for dinner?



A: Which home? Q: Any home.



A: No.



Q: Has he ever been to your home for dinner?



A: No.



Q: Or for any meal?



A: Excuse me.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: The answer is still no. No. You were referring to a

social occasion. Correct?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: So I don't limit it to meals, have you ever been to his house for a

social occasion?



A: No.



Q: Has he ever been to your house for a social occasion?



A: Not when I was present.



Q: That you're aware of?



A: I believe once.



Q: How long ago?



A: 1963 to '66.



Q: Have you been out(have you been with him on social occasions other

than at either of your houses?



A: No.



MR. GELBLUM: Let's mark as 236, I guess it is, a copy of the forward

to I WANT TO TELL YOU. (plaintiffs' exhibit 236 was marked for

identification by the reporter and is attached hereto.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you have Exhibit 236 in front of you?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Did you write that?



A: May I consult my attorney?



Q: Sure.Any time you want.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: What was the question?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you write that Exhibit 236?



A: Parts of it.



Q: Which parts did you write?



MR. LEONARD: You want him to identify every part?



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Okay.



THE WITNESS: I don't remember specifically.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you remember generally?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question to the extent that the

document doesn't  reflect portions that were written by Mr. Schiller

and portions that may have been written by someone else.  I think

that's unpublished information protected by the privilege.



MR. GELBLUM: You are instructing him not to answer which portions of

it he wrote? MS. SAGER: Well, I don't think he can, anyway, but I do

think(



MR. GELBLUM: Well, that's not the test, though. Are you instructing

him not to answer?



MS. SAGER: Yeah, I am.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who wrote the parts you didn't write?



MS. SAGER: Same instruction.



MR. LEONARD: Can we put this away now?



MR. GELBLUM: No.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Okay.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Let me go back to something else before we go deeper into this. You

said that you turned over certain materials from the production of I

WANT TO TELL YOU to Mr. Taft. Is that right?



A: (Nods head.)



Q: Yes? You have to answer audibly.



A: Yes.



Q: What materials did you turn over to him?



A: The tapes that he loaned me, the first draft of the book and the

second draft of the book.



Q: Anything else?



A: Not that I remember.



Q: When you say  "the tapes that he loaned" you, what tapes were

those?



A: The tapes that he made of my conversations with Mr. Simpson.



Q: When you say  "he made" them, what do you mean?



A: Mr. Taft was Mr. Simpson's attorney.



Q: Yes?



A: And(



Q: Did he own the tape recorder that was used?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



MS. SAGER: Calls for speculation.



MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS:I presume he did.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And was he the person who set it up each  time that you went in and

talked?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question again as calling for

unpublished information. I also think it's irrelevant. If what  you

are seeking is who has the tapes, then I think  you've gotten that

information. I don't know why we are spending time on this.



MR. GELBLUM: Because it's clear that Mr. Taft and Mr. Simpson were

setting up some kind of charade so they could argue that it's

attorney(client privileged or something, and I need to explore the

basis for that.



MR. LEONARD: Mr. Gelblum, do we have to do that? Do you have to say

things like that on the record?



MR. GELBLUM: In response to Miss Sager's comment, yes.  Let's go on.

Let's just ask questions. Come on.



MR. LEONARD: No. Let me put something on the record now.



MR. GELBLUM: Sure, go ahead.



MR. LEONARD: Okay?



MR. GELBLUM: Sure.



MR. LEONARD: Please don't do that. Please don't say things like that

that have no foundation."Charade?" I am asking you not to do that.

It's not  necessary. You know these transcripts end up on Jerry's

show. Okay? MR.GELBLUM: On whose show?



MR. LEONARD: Jerry.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Mr. Schiller(



A: Give me a second. I'm just reviewing this, because I haven't read

it in a long time.



Q: I am not asking about that right now. I will get back to that in a

minute, and we will spend quite a bit of time on it. Right now I am

asking about the tapes. Did Mr. Taft operate the tape recorder every

time you visited with Mr. Simpson?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: Kelli, he said that they're Mr. Taft's tapes. I have to

find out what he means by that. He said the tapes Mr.Taft "loaned"

him.



MS. SAGER: And he explained his answer to that, Peter, and the fact

that I let him answer that question so that you know who has custody

of the tapes doesn't mean you get to get into what Mr. Schiller

observed and what occurred when he was preparing information for this

book. You need to know who has the tapes. You  have that information,

and beyond that I don't think  you are entitled to ask this witness

any more questions about it. If you want to talk to Mr. Simpson and

Mr. Taft, then you are free to do  that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What's the basis, Mr. Schiller, for your statement on the record

here today that they were Mr.Taft's tapes?



A: I didn't make that statement.



Q: Whose tapes are they?



A: I have no idea.



Q: You said the tapes Mr. Taft "loaned"  you. Right?



A: Right. That doesn't mean they're his.  He loaned them to me.



Q: What's the basis for that statement that  he "loaned" them to you?

What do you mean, he "loaned" them to you?



A: I needed the tapes to write the book  because I had to accurately

portray what Mr. Simpson  had said in response to my investigative

questions.



Q: Wasn't the purpose for making the tapes  to write the book?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation,

argumentative.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You can answer.



MS. SAGER: To the extent you know what the  purpose of the tapes were,

then you can answer the question.



THE WITNESS: One of the purposes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What was another purpose?



A: I have no idea.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You don't know if there were other purposes?



A: No.



Q: Did you understand, Mr. Schiller, when you were interviewing Mr.

Simpson in jail and the conversations were being recorded, that one of

the purposes for those recordings was to enable you to put  together

the book that became I WANT TO TELL YOU?



A: Correct, yes.



Q: And you were to be the one to write that book, not Mr. Taft.

Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: When you left the jail each day, did Mr. Taft take the tape with

him?



MS. SAGER: I will let you answer that question just for custody

purposes. Did you take the tape?



THE WITNESS: When we left the jail?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Yes.



A: Not always.



Q: Who took the tapes when you left the jail?



A: Sometimes Mr. Taft did. Sometimes other parties did.



Q: Did you ever take the tapes when you left the jail?



A: When I left the jail, no.



Q: On any of the occasions that you interviewed Mr. Simpson in jail,

did you ever leave the jail building with one of the tapes of the

interviews in your possession?



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: I have a recollection on one occasion I took it out of

the building. Otherwise I, did not.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: On the other occasions how did you come into possession of the

tapes?



A: They were given to me shortly thereafter.



Q: By whom?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you get them from more than one  person on different occasions?



MR. LEONARD: That's the right question.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. From whom did you receive tapes on these different occasions?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to that question to the extent it

calls for unpublished information.



MR. GELBLUM: But you are allowing me to follow the custody of the

tapes. That's what this is meant to do.



MS. SAGER: But I don't think you need to know the specific identity of

the person in order to do that if you know that there is somebody that

was present at the interview and they gave him the tape afterward. I

don't want to get into a whole thing about who was there and what he

saw-



MR. GELBLUM: I am just anticipating the arguments that are going to be

laid when I go to court on this, and I need to have the foundation for

it.



Q: On every occasion when you received the tapes from somebody after

you left the jail, was it Mr.Taft?



A: No



Q: Was it ever Mr. Taft?



A: On one occasion.



Q: Okay. And who was it on the other occasions?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: On the other occasions was it ever another one of Mr. Simpson's

attorneys?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: On the occasions when you did not leave the jail with the tapes,

did more than 24 hours ever pass before you received the tape?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And you are not aware of any purpose for  making these tapes other

than writing the book, are you?



Q: I have no specific knowledge.



Q: Do you have any generalized knowledge of any other purpose?



A: Excuse me.



MS. SAGER: Sorry.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER: Good point. The question assumes  hat there is only one

book these would ever be used  for, and to that extent the question is

objectionable. If you are asking him if he is aware if there is any

other purpose other than potential use in some-to disseminate to the

public in some news medium, then that's a different question. So I

don't think you were intending to exclude other possible news medium

other than one book.



THE WITNESS: You understand why, of course.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Yes.  Are you aware of any purpose for making these tapes other

than for dissemination of the information to the public?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever have transcripts made of the tapes?



MS. SAGER: Did he personally have transcripts made? BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Let me ask it differently. Did you ever see any manuscripts of any

of the tapes?



MS. SAGER: Without waiving the privilege, I will let him answer that

only because I am trying to let you know if there are documents that

he had at one time that he no longer has.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Yes, I did see transcripts.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you know who prepared the transcripts?



A: Yes.



Q: Who?



A: Myself.



Q: You physically typed them?



A: In the majority of the instances, yes.



Q: And do you know where those transcripts are today?



A: Yes.



Q: Where?



A: They were destroyed after I wrote the first draft of the book.



Q: Is that your normal practice when you are writing a book, to

destroy transcripts of taped interviews after you write the first

draft?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



MS. SAGER: And I am going to object to the question as calling for

information protected by reporter' shield law and irrelevant to this

litigation.



MR. GELBLUM: Are you instructing him?



MS. SAGER: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: I also object. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you prepare chose transcripts on a computer?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you erase the transcripts from the computer's memory?



A: What part of the computer are you referring to?



Q: Do any of the transcripts presently exist  in any format that

you're aware of that can be retrieved from the computer or from a disk

or other software?



A: Not to my knowledge.



Q: Were the transcripts at one point on the hard drive of the

computer?



A: Never.



Q: Were they on disk?



A: Yes.



Q: And did you erase them from the disk?



A: I instructed people to erase them.



Q: Do you know whether those instructions were followed?



A: I believe they were, but I don't know for sure.



Q: Who did you instruct to erase them?



A: That's privileged.



MS. SAGER: He is talking about members of his staff or people who are

working with him. I don't think you are entitled to know the names of

those individuals.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I really prefer that your counsel make the objections.



A: I'm sorry.



MS. SAGER: Well, I instructed Mr. Schiller that he can make an

objection on his own behalf, so



MR.GELBLUM: I don't think that's appropriate.



MR. LEONARD: Why not?



MS. SAGER: - I think he is entitled to make an objection if he thinks

that there is information that's protected. As a witness he is

entitled to do that,and I would ask you not to tell him that he is not

entitled to make objections that I think he is entitled to make.



MR. LEONARD: Why is that inappropriate?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You said you went to law school for a  while to learn something

about appellate procedure. Is that right?



A: To understand something, yes.



Q: Did you go to -- were you auditing the class?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you go to law school at any other time



A: No.



Q: -- for any other purpose?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Let's look at Exhibit 236.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: On page VIII, I am referring to the page numbers at the bottom of

the pages



A: Yes, sir.



Q: the second page of the exhibit.



A: VIII.



Q: Yes. You refer to your "mutual friend," that's you and OJ.'s mutual

friend, "Robert Kardashian." Do you see that?



A: Yes.



Q: When did you first meet Mr. Kardashian?



A: Let's see. Somewheres around 1977 to maybe. Somewheres in there.



Q: Have you ever had a social relationship with Mr. Kardashian?



A: Have I ever?



Q: Yes.



A: Yes.



Q: Do you presently?



A: No.



Q: When did you have a social relationship with him?



A: When my ex-wife knew his ex-wife.



Q: Is that while you were married to your ex-wife?



A: That's correct.



Q: And when waswhat time period was that?



A: Well, I got divorced in '91, okay, and we actually ceased socially

seeing each other somewheres around '89, somewheres like that.



Q: When did you start socially seeing each other?



A: Somewheres in the late '70s or early '80s.



Q: Farther down on page 8 you say: "In October of 1994, Robert

Kardashian called me and said that I might be called as a material 

witness in OJ's case because of my past association with OJ and that I

would need to meet with him." Do you see that?



A: (Nods head.)



Q: Yes?



A: Yes.



Q: Were you at home when he called you?



MS. SAGER:I will object to the question as calling for unpublished

information. I will let you answer the question if you want to.



THE WITNESS: I don't remember.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What did he say to youdid he say anything to you about why you

might be called as a material witness?



(Discussion held between the Witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER:I will instruct Mr. Schiller not to answer that question to

the extent it calls for information that's unpublished.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Well, Mr. Schiller



MS. SAGER: If it wasn't published, then he can-



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: When Mr. Kardashian called youwell, let me ask you this: Is this

statement true?



MS. SAGER: The statement that's published?



MR. GELBLUM: Yeah, the one I just read.



THE WlTNESS: The statement as written is true.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. At the time of that phone call



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



MR. GELBLUM: Excuse me? Can I finish the question?



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, go ahead, but you've already misstated what he

said.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: At the time Mr. Kardashian called you, were you involved in

gathering information for dissemination to the public?



A: Yes.



Q: Regarding the Simpson matter?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. When did you start doing that?



A: In the last few days of June 1994.



Q: Was that under a contract with somebody?



MS. SAGER: Objection. The reporter's shield  law. Instruct the I

witness not to answer.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Were you



MS. SAGER: And I will add to the objection that it calls for personal

and proprietary information.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Well, when you say you started gathering you started being involved

in the process of gathering information for dissemination to the

public at the end of June 1994, was it just a decision by you that you

thought, "Well, I think I am going to write something about this

case," or was it something more substantial than that?



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: I had an intent, and I was taking steps in that

direction.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What steps did you take?



MS. SAGER: If he can answer that in general terms without identifying

anything in particular, I will let him answer that question. I don't

think you are entitled to know the particulars for the same reason I

stated.



THE WITNESS: I took the normal steps that I would take in any

investgative journalist project  that I had done based on my previous

years of experience.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Had you made any arrangements at the end  of June 1994 to get paid

for this work?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR.GELBLUM: I just want to be clear, Kelli.  It's your position that

the reporter's privilege applies the second that anybody decides that

they are going to try to write something about anything, any matter,

and disseminate it to the public



MS. SAGER: That's true.



MR. GELBLUM: and they form that intent, then everything they did from

that point on in the course of that is privileged, it's protected?



MS. SAGER: Anything that they do in the course of gathering

information for that purpose.



MR. GELBLUM: Right. From the moment they decide that they think they

are going to try to do  something like that, try to write something

for the public?



MS. SAGER: Yes.



MR. GELBLUM: I just want to be clear.



MS. SAGER: I do think that's true. I also do think that you are not

entitled to know any personal business arrangements that Mr. Schiller

had because it's private and proprietary, and you are not entitled to

know that.



MR. GELBLUM: That's not my purpose for asking. My purpose for asking

is to find out the beginning point of when you are going to assert the

privilege.



MS. SAGER: Okay. And he has given you the beginning point.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Well, when Mr. Kardashian called and asked you to come down to the

jail to meet Mr. Simpson, did you agree to go?



A: Yes.



Q: And was your purpose in going to gather information to disseminate

to the public on that first trip down?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you tell Mr. Kardashian that?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. But you can answer that question.



THE WITNESS: I don't remember.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you tell anybody before you went down to visit Mr. Simpson that

first time that your purpose was to gather information for

dissemination to the public?



A: Yes.



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who? Who did you tell?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: Last time you made the objection you said, "But you can

answer," so is that part of this objection or not?



MS. SAGER: No, I am not going to let him identify who he spoke to

because I also think that in addition to being privileged, that's

confidential and proprietary business information and private to  Mr.

Schiller.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did Mr. Kardashian tell you why he thought or somebody thought you

might be a material witness?



A: Yes.



MS. SAGER:I think that information is published, and for that reason I

will allow Mr. Schiller to answer, although I do think it's protected

by the privilege if it were not published.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q:  And what did he tell you?



A: I had an acquaintance relationship to  Mr. Simpson and I had filmed

him, and there was a possibility that I could be a demeanor witness.



Q: Do you recall anything else Mr. Kardashian said to you on that

subject?



A: Not on that subject, no.



Q: When had you filmed Mr. Simpson? Oh, for Kris Kardashian's birth-

day?



A: (Nods head.)



Q: Yes?



A: Yes.



Q: Is that the only occasion when you had filmed Mr. Simpson prior to

October 1994?



A: Yes, filmed him.



Q: As opposed to what?



A: Photographed him.



Q: Okay. When had you photographed him?



A: As a photographer, I photographed him when he was at SC.



Q: At SC?



A: Yeah, as a photographer.



Q: Did you meet him when he was at SC?



A: No.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did Mr. Kardashian



A: The



Q: I am sorry.



A: The picture has been published. That's what I'm saying to you. That

I did a film at SC.



Q: Did Mr. Kardashian explain to you how your knowledge of Mr.

Simpson's demeanor several years earlier would make you a material

witness in this case? MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. LEONARD: Objecton. Lack of foundation.



MS. SAGER: Same objection. I object on  reporter's privilege grounds

and I don't think you are entitled to get into any unpublished

information about that phone conversation because Mr. Schiller has

already testified that he was at that point gathering information for

dissemination to the public, including information he was getting from

Mr. Kardashian



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you tell Mr. Kardashian that you were planning to use what he

was telling you to disseminate that to the public?



MS. SAGER: Asked and answered.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You can answer it again.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER: Mr. Schiller is not going to answer any questions about

what else was said in that conversation other than what's been

published.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did Mr. Kardashian tell you that the reason he was calling you was

to give you information for dissemination to the public?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: You can't justifiably take the position, Kelli, that what

Mr. Kardashian said to him had anything to do with gathering

information for dissemination to the public. He is calling him to be a

witness in the case.



MS. SAGER: That's like saying if you are interviewing a source, what

information they give you is not protected.



MR. GELBLUM: He is calling him to come down to the jail to be a

material witness, according to this. This may be false, but that's

what it says. It has nothing to do with the dissemination to the

public.



MS. SAGER: That has nothing to do with what  Mr. Schiller's intent was

during that conversation, and he has already told you he is not going

to reveal information related to what he was doing for gathering 

information for publication. You can ask Mr. Kardashian that. I assume

you did. BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you have any intention when you went  to jail of talking to Mr.

Simpson about being a material witness as distinct from gathering

information to disseminate to the public?



A: Did I have any intent?



Q: Yes, sir.



A: No.



Q: Did you tell anybody that?



A: Don't remember.



Q: Did you lead them to believe that you were going to go down to see

if you could help him out as a material witness?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



MS. SAGER: I am going to assert the same objection as well, and what

Mr. Schiller did or didn't do in the course of trying to get

information for publication is privileged, and I am not going to let 

him answer questions about it.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. On page XI of Exhibit 236, the last full paragraph on the

page, you say that



A: Starting with what words?



Q: "As soon as the deputies left."



A: Yes, sir.



Q: The last sentence there is, "Then he started talking to his

attorneys." Do you see that?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. What did he say to his attorneys?



MS .SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What did his attorneys say to him? MS. SAGER: Same objections.



MR. GELBLUM: Am I correct in assuming that you will not let him answer

a single question regarding  anything that he observed or heard or

said during any of his conversations with Mr. Simpson in jail?



MS. SAGER: Unless that information is published. If that information

has been published, then I will let him confirm the published 

information. If it has not been published, you are correct. I will not

let him answer any questions about any of those categories of

information.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: So when you say here on page XIyou say: " I could tell by his body

language what he thought of people being mentioned. The moment his

lawyers uttered the name of someone he was unsure of, or mentioned a 

friend he felt had betrayed him,  OJ's voice would develop an edge" Do

you see that?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Do you recall any people whose mention caused his voice to

develop an edge?



MS. SAGER: Yes or no question.



THE WITNESS: Do I remember anybody?



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: The mention of whose name caused his voice to develop an edge.



A: I don't remember the names.



MS. SAGER: That's not the question. Do you remember anybody, was the

question?



THE WITNESS: Anybody's name?



MR. GELBLUM: He answered the question. The  name of anybody.



THE WITNESS: I don't remember anybody's name.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. And then the next sentence is: "Then a different person's 

name would come upsomeone he  likedand then his voice would soften,

his firm posture would  relax a little."   Do you recall the names of

anybody, the mention of whose name caused him to react that way?



A: No.



Q: Then at the end of the first paragraph on page XII you say, "Our

conversation moved to the subject of my being a material witness." Do

you see that?



A: (Nods head.)



MS. SAGER: I'm sorry. Where?



MR. LEONARD: I don't see that either.



MR. GELBLUM: End of the first paragraph on page XII.



MS. SAGER: Oh, gotcha.



MR. GELBLUM:Got it?



MS. SAGER: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Thanks, Arthur.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who was involved in that conversation?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: When you were having that conversation, was one of your purposes

deciding whether you would be a material witness in the case?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. GELBLUM: Wait a second. The privilege doesn't apply if the answer

to that is yes.



MS. SAGER: Well, he has already answered his  purpose in being there.



MR. GELBLUM: But I have a written statement  here. You said I can ask

him about his written  statements, okay, and I am asking him.



MS. SAGER: I said he will confirm information that's published.



MR. GELBLUM: I understand.



MS. SAGER: I didn't say that gives leeway to ask him questions that

are on the same general subject matter. MR. GELBLUM: Believe me, I

understand that.



Q: My question is: Was one of the purpose in the conversation at the

time you mention here where it moved to the subject of material

witness, was one of your purposes at that point in time helping Mr.

Simpson and his attorneys decide whether you could  be helpful as a

material witness?



MS. SAGER: You mean to the exclusion of any  purpose he may have had

to be gathering information?



MR. GELBLUM: Was that one of the purposes. That's my present question.



MS. SAGER: One of his purposes.



MR. GELBLUM: Yes.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Is your statement here correct, that you did discuss your being a

material witness?



MS. SAGER: You can answer whether that line is  correct.



THE WITNESS: It is correct, if I'm reading the same line.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: "Our conversadon moved to the subject of  my being a material

witness."



MS. SAGER:Is that an accurate statement?



THE WITNESS: Moved to the subject, yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And was there a conversation on the subject of your being a

material witness?



A: Yes.



Q: And one of the purposes of that discussion from your point of view

was helping them to decide whether you could be helpful as a material

witness?



A: No.



MS. SAGER: I think that's been asked now three times.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Farther down on page XII, Mr. Schiller, you discuss a conversation

where Mr. Kardashian called you at home that night.



A: Which paragraph, sir?



Q: "That night, after I returned home, Robert called."



A: Right.



Q: Is that sentence correct?



A: Yes, he called.



Q: Is each sentence in that paragraph true?



A: The second sentence is correct. It starts with "He" and ends with

"along." The next sentence is correct. Starts with the word "Robert"

and ends with the word "jail." The last sentence is  correct. Starts

with "He" and ends with the word "book."



Q: Okay. Is the next sentence correct, "I visited OJ the very next

day?"



A: Correct.



Q: Before I go on, will you refuse to answer any additional questions

regarding your conversation at home that night with Mr. Kardashian?



MS. SAGER: Yes, he will, unless to the extent you have any other

published information that contains references to that conversation.

But based on what you are showing us right now, he will refuse to

answer any additional questions about that conversation.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. At the top of the next page, on page XIII, it says "Robert."

That means Robert Kardashian. Correct?



A: (Nods head.)



Q: Yes?



A: Yes. Q: "Robert hooked up a tape recorder..." Is that correct?



A: He hooked up the tape recorder, but in fact I don't remember

whether he hooked it up on this visit or in the visit after, whether

it was on the third visit or the second that he hooked it up. It  may

have been Mr. Taft hooked it up on the second and Mr. Kardashian on

the third. I wrote it this way and said he hooked it up,but I don't

remember specifically whether he did it on the second visit or  the

third.



Q: Did Robert only hook it up one time of all the times that it was

hooked up?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



THE WITNESS: I don't remember.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: The next paragraph starts, "What came forth was a flood of words."

Is that correct?



A: That's correct.



Q: I mean, is that a correct statement?



A: Yes, it is.



Q: What did you mean by "flood of words?"



MS. SAGER: I am going to instruct him not to answer any questions

about what the words means. I think they speak for themselves, and to

the extent he has any additional subjective views, those are protected

by the reporter's privilege.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: The next sentence says: "Before Robert could even get the tape

going, OJ was talking, telling me of his innocence, his emotional

state, recent events, his  whole life."  Is that sentence correct?



A: Yes.



Q: Two sentences after that it says: "He spoke so quickly, like

torrents cascading from a ruptured dam, that I soon had to interrupt

him and try to channel his thoughts." Is that an accurate statement?



A: Yes.



Q: In the next paragraph there, the third sentence says: "Later,

reading the transcripts of the interviews, I  could see that he had

answered the questions, not in neat numbered  paragraphs, but in a

kaleidoscope of anguish and emotion." Is that statement accurate?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to the extent that that calls for

speculation.



THE WITNESS: The answer is yes.



MR. GELBLUM: Excuse me one second. I'm sorry.



(Pause in the proceedings.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. Sorry for the interruption.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: On page XIV



A: XIV, the last page of the document?



Q: Yes.



A: Okay.



Q: The first paragraph starts on that page, it starts with the words,

"noticed the clock." Do you see that?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Is the second sentence accurate,"We had spoken this time for almost

two hours?"



A: Slight exaggeration.



Q: How long was it?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to that question as calling for

information that's not published.



MR. GELBLUM: Wait a minute. You will allow him to say whether it's

true or not, but if it's not true, you won't let him say what is true?



MS. SAGER: Yes, that's right.



THE WITNESS: Excuse me.



MR. GELBLUM: Sure.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



BY MR. GELIBLUM:



Q: Did you want to amend your answer, supplement it?



A: No.



Q: A couple sentences down you say, "I would  make nine more trips to

visit him." Is that statement accurate, or is that a slight

exaggeration also?



A: No.



MS. SAGER: Is it correct or not? Answer yes  or no.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That would make a total of 11visits with  him.



A: Yes.



Q: Yes, it's accurate?



A: Yes, to the best of my memory.



Q: Then a few sentences down you say: "In each interview I seemed to

find a different man, but one who was ultimately optimistic,

reflective and introspective."  Is that statement accurate?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, vague.



THE WITNESS: That is inaccurate.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What is inaccurate about it?



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Do you mean for the sentence to be taken literally?



MR. LEONARD: Well, see, that's where



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: It was Orenthal James Simpson each time. Correct?



A: It was Mr. Simpson sitting there each time, yes. Q: What did you

mean by the sentence?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to that.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: You said it's not accurate?



MS. SAGER: Some of the words are a characterization,but you asked him

if it was accurate literally.



MR. GELBLUM: That's all you let me ask him,  Kelli.



MS. SAGER: Right. I don't want him to get  into what he means by

different phrases. He wanted to make sure that you weren't asking him

if this was literally true, that it was a different man.



MR. GELBLUM: I will ask whatever you let me ask, which isn't much.



MS. SAGER: Then there is no question pending.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Is it fair to say that he seemed different to you each time you saw

him,



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Lack of foundation, calls for

speculation.



MS. SAGER: What I think the question is, if I understand it correctly,

is whether you were intending to say that he seemed different as

opposed to that you were actually with a different person.



THE WITNESS: Right.



MS. SAGER: You are not being literally true.



THE WITNESS: Yeah, not being literally true. There was something

subtly different about him each time.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: What?



MS. SAGER: I am not going to let him answer that question for the same

reasons previously stated.



MR. GELBLUM: Okay. Off the record just for a second.



(Discussion held off the record.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you live in the same block as he and  Marquerite?



A: Yes.



Q: For how long?



A: If he moved away in '76, I moved away in  '75 or '74. I know I

moved away in '74-'75. Okay?



Q: Okay.



A: I don't know-'75. I don't know when  he moved away. I've been told

he moved away in '76 or '77. Okay?



Q: You moved away first, anyway. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: So you weren't living on the same block from that point forward.



A: Correct.



Q: So you lived on the same block for how long?



A: Well, Iagain, I built my house in '63, but I don't know when he

moved into his house. I  only met him



Q: During the time



MS. SAGER: The answer is you don't know.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: That's fine.  During the time you were living on the block, did you

ever hear anything about his having beaten his wife?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



MS. SAGER: During the time he lived there from, whatever, '63 to'75?



MR. LEONARD: Leading.



THE WITNESS:No.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you ever hear about any domestic discord



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q:between he and Marquerite during that time?



MR. LEONARD: Vague, lack of foundation, leading.



MS. SAGER: Between '63 and '75.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you ever meet-not ever. Prior tolet me start again. While you

were living on the same block  as Mr. Simpson, did you meet Jason or

Arnelle Simpson?



A: Yes.



Q: Did they ever come to your house?



A: My daughter brought them once, yes.They  were children.



Q: How old, approximately?



A: Oh, they would have been like three, four, or something, you know.

I don't remember how old. My daughter was a baby-sitter.



Q: Did you ever meet Nicole Brown Simpson?



A: Never.



Q: I would like to find out, unless your attorney won't let me, in

general terms the process by which the taped interviews were

transformed into the published book. Will you allow him to answer any

questions regarding that process?



MS. SAGER: No, not unless it's been published somewhere.



MR. GELBLUM: Let me just try a few, for example, and make sure that we

are on the same wavelength here.



Q: Who decided which letters to Mr. Simpson would go into the book?



MS. SAGER: Objection.



MR. LEONARD: I object. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation.



(Discussion held between the Witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER: Okay. My client informs me that that has been published, so

he can answer that question.



MR. GELBLUM: Good.



MR. LEONARD: Same objection.



THE WITNESS: I made a selection and I brought them to Mr. Simpson,and

he accepted my selection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you know whether his attorneys, any of  his attorneys, had any

involvement in the selectionthe process of selecting the fetters that

were in the book?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



MR. GELBLUM: Dan, if the question is, do you  know, that doesn't call

for speculation, which is the question.



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question to the extent that it

calls or any unpublished information, but I believe that there has

been information published. In response to that question, I will let

Mr. Schiller reveal that.



THE WITNESS: In my presence his attorneys had nothing to do with it.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Do you know whether they had anything to do with it out of your

presence?



MS. SAGER: Same objection as to the extent there is unpublished

infrmation, but published information you can answer.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Who selected which portions of Mr. Simpson's interviews would be

included in the book?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. To the extent that  there is published

information on it, I will let  Mr. Schiller answer. (Discussion held

between the witness and counsel outside the hearing of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER: You can answer that.



THE WITNESS: I made the total selection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Without anybody else's input?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. To the extent there is published

information, I will let Mr. Schiller answer that.



MR. LEONARD: Well, Inever mind.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Me and members of my editorial  staff.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did any of Mr. Simpson's attorneys have any input into deciding

which interviews would be included in the book?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. I will let him answer to the extent that

that information has been publicly revealed.



THE WITNESS: None whatsoever.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Where was that information publicly revealed?



A: I've said a couple times on television shows and so forth that Mr.

Simpson's attorneys had nothing to do with the writig of the book, and

I made the total decisions.



Q: Are the



A: Excuse me a second.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Yes.



MS. SAGER: He has already answered the question, so... BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are the words that are attributed to Mr. Simpson in the book I WANT

TO TELL YOU verbatim transcripts of the interviews?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: I don't mean complete, but is every word that's printed in here

something coming from Mr. Simpson, something that he actually said?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound, overbroad.



MS. SAGER: To the extent you can answer that question without looking

at it, I will let you answer  it, but...



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: No person speaks in perfect  English that you can read,

and sometimes people use  the same word in a sentence many, many

times. So all  of the material is exactly what he said, but it has 

been made readable so it can be consumed and disseminated in a

literary form. So in some instances he may have used in a paragraph

the same word five times or four times, and I may have looked up in

the thesaurus other words that were more apropos.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: More apropos of what?



A: From a reading point of view.



Q: It sounded better to your ear?



A: Or that might be better to a reader, a  reader's ear. When you

read, you don't hear.  Sometimes you hear yourself reading, yes, okay,

but, you knowso the grammar, the structure, has been  made readable,

but it is what he said.



MS. SAGER: I think that answers question. Sounds like it's a no, not

verbatim.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: So the substance of everythingyou didn't change the substance of

anything.



A: That's correct.



Q: Did you ever discuss with Mr. Simpson his whereabouts on the

evening of June 12, 1994?



MS. SAGER: Same objection to the extent that  information is not

published. If that information has been publicly disseminated, I will

let Mr. Schiller answer to the extent that it has been.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



MS. SAGER: We are not aware of any published  information that answers

that question. If it's out there, then he would answer it, but we are

not aware of any, so the objection stands.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you ever discuss with Mr. Simpson any of his activities from

June 12, 1994 through June 17, 1994?



MS. SAGER: Same objection.



MR. LEONARD: Same objection.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are you aware of any published material regarding any of that time

period, your discussions with him during that time period?



A: No.



Q: Upon Mr. Simpson's release from jail, you  took some pictures of

him. Correct?



A: That is correct.



Q: And some of those pictures have been published?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you take pictures of Mr. Simpson within a month after his

release from jail anywhere other than at Rockingham?



MS. SAGER: I am going to object to the question to the extent it calls

for any unpublished  photographs or material that Mr. Schiller

gathered for the future publication. To the extent there is published

information, I will let him answer that question.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: The answer is yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Yes? Where?



MS. SAGER: And again, only as to published  photographs.



THE WITNESS: The residence of Don Ohlmeyer; a  golf course in Panama

City, Florida; my hotel room in  Panama City, Florida; the beach in

Panama City, Florida. Various locations in Panama City Florida.  There

may have been one other location, but I don't remember specifically. I

have some images in my mind,  but I don't remember exactly where, but

it's in that period of time.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: And did you take pictures of  Mr. Simpson's children during this

time frame also?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. To the extent the information is published,

I will let Mr. Schiller answer it.



THE WITNESS: His older children.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Did you take any pictures of his younger children after



A: Never.



Q: Have you taken any pictures of Mr. Simpson's younger children, that

is, Sydney and Justin, since Mr. Simpson's acquittal?



MS. SAGER: Same objection to the extent the  information is

unpublished.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: I have not photographed the children, the younger

children. That information has been published.



MR. LEONARD: Do you mean that the fact that  you have not photographed

them



THE WITNESS: Yes.



MR. LEONARD:has been published?



THE WITNESS: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Because I didn't



MS. SAGER: The fact that he has not



MR. LEONARD: Okay. Take a break?



(Discussion held off the record.)



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Were the photographs that you took of  Mr. Simpson and his older

children after his release from jail pursuant to a written agreement

that Polaris Communications entered into with American Media?



MS. SAGER: To the extent that information is  public, I will let Mr.

Schiller answer it. Otherwise I will object on the same ground.



THE WITNESS: Yes.



(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing

of  the reporter.)



THE WITNESS: Okay.



MS. SAGER: You are talking about the publication of the photographs? I

missed the question. I'm sorry. Was the publication pursuant  to? Is

that what you said?



THE WITNESS: Then my answer is yes.



MR. GELBLUM: Did he take them pursuant to.



THE WITNESS: Did I take them pursuant to, the answer is yes.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Are you aware of whether Mr. Simpson has ever taken a lie detector

test in relation to the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown

Simpson?



MS. SAGER: Same objection. Instruct the witness not to answer unless

there is published information one way or the other.



MR. GELBLUM: What's your definition of  "published" for these

purposes?



MS. SAGER: If Mr. Schiller has information that he has publicly

revealed, then he has published that information, and he can't assert

the privilege as to information he has already revealed.



MR. GELBLUM: But only if he has publicly  revealed it?



MS. SAGER: Right. Because he is the one who  holds the privilege,

so... And as to anything, if  it's published information or something

that's been  revealed by Mr. Schiller, I will let him answer as to 

that, so I don't need to keep saying that.



MR. GELBLUM: Well, I assume your objection was only if he had some

informationif he had obtained some information, if there was any, in

the course of  gathering information or dissemination to the public.



MS. SAGER: Correct.



BY MR. GELBLUM:



Q: Okay. Other than in the course of gathering information for

dissemination to the public, have you ever learned any information

about Mr. Simpson having taken a lie detector test regarding the

murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?



A: No.



MR. GELBLUM: Why don't we take a break to  change paper, and when we

go back on, we are going to  have to do it under seal, because there

are going to be documents fromthese are the contracts.

JASON LAMAR SIMPSON, having been first duly sworn, was examined and

testified as follows:



EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Good morning, Mr. Simpson. My name is Daniel Petrocelli, and I

represent one of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit against O.J. Simpson.

I represent Fredric Goldman.



You are here to give a deposition in this lawsuit. You've been put

under oath by the court  reporter, and that means you are obligated to

tell the truth just like you were testifying in a court of law.



Do you understand that?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And that means that you're subject to the same penalties of perjury

just as though you were  testifying in a court of law.



Do you understand that?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you understand that deliberately  lying under oath is a felony

under California law for which you can go to prison.



Do you understand that?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Have you ever been examined under oath before?



A: No, not that I recall. Not that I recall.



Q: Well, are you unsure whether you've given testimony under oath?



A: Yeah, I'm not sure.



Q: Can you describe to me some proceedings  when you think you may

have testified under oath but are not sure?



A: Yeah. A court case I had gotten into, I got in a car accident a

while back, and I don't -- I'm not sure if I swore in or anything like

that. I just  remember going to court and taking care of the matter.



Q: Okay. Let me --



A: It wasn't a trial or anything like that.



Q: Okay. Let me mention a couple of things  just so we can get a clean

record. Let me finish my  question before you answer, and I will try

not to interrupt you.



A: Okay.



Q: This is to make the reporter's job easy,  because he can only,

despite his extraordinary  abilities, get only one person down at a

time.



A: Okay.



Q: Secondly, your voice has a tendency to trail off near the end of

your sentences, and if you could keep your voice up so that everybody

can hear, and also so that we can tell when you've completed your

answer.



A: Okay



Q: Okay? Rather than kind of mumbling near the end, just try to give a

complete answer.



A: Okay.



Q: You were in an automobile accident, and  the case went to court and

you gave testimony?



A: Yes.



Q: Was that a trial?



A: No.



Q: Was it in a courtroom?



A: Yes.



Q: Was there a judge there?



A: Yes.



Q: A jury?



A: No.



Q: Okay. And when was that?



A: Last summer, I believe.



Q: Summer of 1995?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Who sued you?



A: I forgot her name. Olga Klavaris or something like that.



Q: Over what?



A: A car accident. I ran into her.



Q: Okay. Were you under the influence of alcohol?



A: No, sir.



Q: Were you under the influence of drugs?



A: No, sir.



Q: Was anyone injured?



A: No, sir.



Q: Just property damage?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Is that the only time you've been involved in an automobile

accident?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Have you ever been convicted of a crime?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Tell me what crimes you've been  convicted of.



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object, unless you can lay a foundation

under the rule. You can ask him if it was a felony. You are going to

lay a foundation for that?



MR. PETROCELLI: I want to know all crimes that he's been convicted of.



MR.LEONARD: Well, I don't think you have a right to ask for anything

other than felonies.



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it may lead to discoverable -- felony

convictions are admissible --



MR. LEONARD: Right.



MR. PETROCELLI: -- but other convictions may or may not be, but they

may lead to discoverable evidence.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to instruct him not to answer other than

felony convictions.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you been convicted of crimes other than felonies? You can

answer that yes or no.



A: I wasn't quite sure exactly what it was.  It wasn't a felony.



Q: It was not a felony.



A: No.



Q Was it something that you pled guilty to?



A: No.



Q: Was it something that you were found  guilty of after a trial?



A: No.



MR. PETROCELLI: What are we talking about, Mr. Leonard?



MR. LEONARD: Go ahead. Ask him.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Tell us what you have in mind.



A: I got DUI. I don't know what that is, though. What's that?



Q: Driving under the influence?



A: Yeah. I don't know what thing that goes  under.



Q: Okay. Let me see if I can find out what we're talking about here.

You were charged with driving under the influence?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: What year was that?



A: I think I was 17, so it must have been -- or 18. It might have been

1988, '89.



Q: How old are you?



A: I'm 26.



Q: When were you born?



A: 1970.



Q: What's your birthday?



A: April 21st.



Q: What year did the DUI occur?



A: I think it was maybe in 1989.



Q: Were you involved in an automobile accident at that time?



A: Uh-uh.



THE REPORTER: No?



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: That's another rule. You have to --



A: I understand.



Q: -- give an audible response.



A: I forgot. Sorry.



Q: That's all right. Was this a charge brought against you by the City

of Los Angeles?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And what was the disposition of that charge?



A: I don't understand the question, "disposition of that charge."



Q: Were you found guilty or what?



A: Yeah. Yeah.



Q: Was there a trial?



A: No, there wasn't a trial.



Q: How were you found guilty?



A: What did I do? It's a while ago. I'm trying to remember. I remember

going to court and --



Q: Did you testify?



A: No.



Q: Was there a jury?



A: No.



Q: Did your lawyer plead guilty on your behalf?



A: I don't remember



Q: Make a deal?



A: Yeah, I believe so.



Q: Okay. Did you serve any time?



A: No. No.



Q: Community service?



A: Yes.



Q: How many hours?



A: 30 hours, I think, community service and AA meetings, and what

else.



Q: Did you attend the AA meetings?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did you perform the community  service?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Is that the only time that you've ever been charged with a

DUI?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Is that the only time you've ever been charged with a crime?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. You ever been sued for anything else in your life?



A: Other than --



Q:  You mentioned the -- excuse me. Was the automobile accident

litigation? Did that result in litigation, the one this past summer?



A: What do you mean? Did it --



Q: I don't -- did someone sue you?



A: Yeah, she started to, but I guess she dropped it.



Q: She dropped it?



A: Yeah.



Q: Was there a settlement?



A: No.



Q: She just dropped the case?



A: Dropped the case.



Q: And you gave us the name of the  plaintiff?



A: Olga something.



Q: Olga?



A: I don't remember what her last name was.



Q: Against Jason Simpson?



A: Uh-huh.



Q: You have to answer.



A: Yes.



Q: Where was that case filed?



A: Los Angeles.



Q: Who represented you in that case?



A: I forgot the lawyer's name. Carl Jones.



Q: Private practictioner?



A: Yes.



Q: Who represented you in the DUI case?



A: I forgot his name. It was a long time ago.



Q: Was that a public defender?



A: No



Q: A private lawyer?



A: Uh-huh.



Q: You have to answer yes.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And have you ever been sued either criminally or civilly in

any other proceeding?



A: No, sir.



Q: Okay. Isn't it true that you were -- that charges were brought

against you by the City of  Los Angeles for assault on a guy named

Goldberg at a restaurant?



A: Yes. Yes, sir. I forgot about that, but I wasn't sued.



Q: Charges were brought against you for assault. True?



A: Right. Right.



Q: You didn't tell us about that earlier.



A: I totally forgot about that.



Q: Okay. Well, it's crucial that you not forget --



A: Okay.



Q: -- and that you try to give it your best in answering these

questions.



A: Okay.



Q: This was a case brought against you by  the People of the State of

California in January of  1993. Correct?



A: Yes.



Q: And you assaulted a man named Paul Goldberg. Correct?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: At Revival Cafe restaurant in Los Angeles. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q And you pled guilty to this. True?



A: No, sir.



Q: What was the outcome?



A: The -- I had to -- what I had to do?



Q: Did you plead nolo contendere or no contest?



A: No contest.



Q: Okay. What was the sentence you received?



A: Community service.



Q: Was that all?



A: That's it.



Q: How many hours?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Who represented you?



A: A public defender.



Q: Did you ask your dad for assistance in  hiring a private attorney?



A: No, sir.



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Excuse me? You can answer it. It was no.



A: You asking him?



Q: I asked you. I only ask you questions.  He answered no, for the

record. Were you under the influence of drugs or alcohol when you

struck Mr. Goldberg?



A: No, sir.



Q: What injuries did you inflict on Mr. Goldberg?



A: None that I know of, sir.



Q: What did he claim you inflicted upon him?



A: None that I know of.



Q: Have you ever been arrested for use of drugs or narcotics?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object and instruct him not to answer. Not

relevant, doesn't lead to any  relevant evidence in the case.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you take an overdose of drugs that resulted in your

hospitalization?



MR. LEONARD: Objection, and I am instructing  him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you attempt to commit suicide?



MR. LEONARD: Instructing him not to answer and objecting.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you -- you've been hospitalized in  the last three years?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Instruct him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When were you hospitalized as a result of an overdose of drugs?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object and instruct him not to answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: Could be highly relevant, Mr. Leonard.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am instructing him not to answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: It could have to do directly with his reaction to the

events --



MR. LEONARD: It could be a lot of things.



MR. PETROCELLI: -- and incidents involved in this case, and I am

entitled to probe --



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am instructing him not to answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: It's obvious that you are  trying to hide the facts

here, but we will get to that sooner or later.



MR. LEONARD: That's not --



MR. PETROCELLI: You are not even permitting appropriate foundational

inquiries, so you are just  taking a blanket objection, and there is

no way of my  knowing whether there is relevant evidence that you're

concealing or not.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am not concealing anything.



MR. PETROCELLI: Then let him answer.



MR. LEONARD: No. I am instructing him. It's not relevant, can't lead

to relevant evidence in this case.



MR.PETROCELLI: That wasn't the position you were taking when you were

asking lots of witnesses about their drug use. As I recall, your

argument, among other things, was that it had to do with the

witnesses' capacity to observe and remember and recollect events.



Q: Are you currently on any medication or drugs, Mr. Simpson?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: What is that?



A: Depakote.



Q: Can you spell that?



A: D-e-p-a-k-o-t-e.



Q: I am not familiar with that. Could you describe --



MR. LEONARD: You have to lower your hands.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Could you describe what condition that drug treats?



A: Epilepsy.



Q: When were you diagnosed as an epileptic?



A: About five years now. '91 maybe. Maybe longer than that. Seven

years.



Q: Seven years?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Is that the only reason you take Depakote: For epilepsy?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And are you under any other -- are you  under Depakote now?



A: Uh-huh.



Q: You have to answer audibly.



A: Yes.



Q: Are you under any other drugs now?



A: No, sir.



Q: Do you believe that your taking of  Depakote now would in any way

impair your ability to  hear, understand and answer truthfully my

questions?



A: No, sir.



Q: How many times have you been arrested?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object and instruct him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever been arrested?



MR. LEONARD: He has already testified to one or two occasions.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Were you arrested on those two occasions, once for the DUI and the

other for the assault?



A: Once for the DUI, and that's it.



Q: Not arrested on the other occasion?



A: No, sir.



Q: How did you prepare for the giving of your deposition today?



A: Just some questions with him (Indicating). That was it.



Q: Him being Mr. Leonard?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: When did you meet with Mr. Leonard?



A: Yesterday.



Q: For how long?



A: 20 minutes, half hour.



Q: Where?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object now. I think that gets into the

attorney-client privilege at this point.



MR.PETROCELLI: I don't think where you met invades the attorney --

client privilege.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I do.



MR. PETROCELLI: It could lead to very relevant evidence, including --



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to object and instruct him not to

answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



Q: Who was present?



A: Mr. Leonard and myself, Mr. Simpson. Jason Simpson.



Q: Two people.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Yourself and Mr. Leonard.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And did -- was there anybody else present but not involved in

the conversation, present in the building, in the house, in the room,

wherever  it is that you met?



A: Could you be more specific?



Q: I am having trouble because your lawyer has blocked my ability to

fully understand the facts here.



A: That's too general.



Q: I understand. It's because of your lawyer's objections, so you will

have to bear with me.



Wherever you met yesterday, my question to you is whether there was

anybody else in the building, in the home, in the facility, wherever

it was, in the park, on the airplane.



A: Yeah.



Q: And who was present?



A: My girlfriend. Who else --



MR. LEONARD: When you say "present," you're asking in the building? Is

that what you're asking him?



MR.PETROCELLI: If there was a building.



MR. LEONARD: Yeah. Go ahead.



MR. PETROCELLI: You might have been --



THE WITNESS: Anybody I know or just in general? All the people?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah, all of them. Name them all.



A: My father came at one point, I believe.



Q: Your father is O.J. Simpson. Right?



A: Last time I checked.



Q: Okay. There is no reason to be sarcastic.



A: Sorry.



Q: This is a serious proceeding. Are you unsure whether your father is

O.J. Simpson?



A: No, sir.



Q: And who is your girlfriend?



A: [Name Deleted].



Q: Okay. Who else was present?



MR.LEONARD: Would you define "present"?



MR. PETROCELLI: He --



Q: You were in the process of naming me, quote, "all the people," end

of quotes. Name the rest of the people.



MR. LEONARD: People that were present in the  building?



MR. PETROCELLI: I am going off of his answer,  Mr. Leonard, whatever

he had in mind.



THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You seem to have phased out. Is there a  problem?



A: Yeah. He held a sign up to me, and I was reading the sign. You were

asking me a question while I was reading the sign.



Q: What is the sign? "Can you please not twist the microphone cable"

is the sign.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. That's because it affects the audio.



A: Yeah. Sorry.



Q: Okay. So besides O.J. Simpson and [Name Deleted], who else was

present during your conversation with Mr. Leonard?



MR. LEONARD: No, that misstates his evidence. I object. That's not

what he said.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Please identify the rest of the people that were in the home, in

the facility, in the  building, in the park, in the airplane, wherever

it  was that you and Mr. Leonard met yesterday.



A: That's it. The housekeeper, Gigi.



Q: Okay. So you met at Rockingham. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. [Name Deleted] was with you?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: At Rockingham yesterday?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did she talk to Mr. Leonard at all?



A: Other than saying hello, no.



Q: Okay. And you and Mr. Leonard met in what room in Rockingham?



A: Outside. No room.



Q: Where outside? Near the pool? In the backyard?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Is that the first time that you met with Mr. Leonard to talk

about your testimony?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Instructing him not m to answer. Invades the

attorney-client privilege.



MR.PETROCELLI: I am entitled to know how many times he met with you.



MR. LEONARD: Well, you had some content in there as well. You can ask

him how many times he's met with me.



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, to prepare for this deposition. He may have met

with you socially. I am not interested in that.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. Go ahead.



THE WITNESS: Can you repeat the question?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah. I am trying to find out how many  conversations you had with

Dan Leonard regarding your  having to be a witness in this case,

involving your  coming here to testify at your deposition.



A: Just the one.



Q: Just yesterday. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: But you had met Mr. Leonard on a number of prior occasions. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And in those prior occasions did you have any discussions

with Mr. Leonard other than social conversation?



A: No, not really



Q: Never discussed this lawsuit with Mr. Leonard before yesterday. Is

that true?



A: Not really, no.



Q: It's not true or it is true?



A: It's true.



Q: Okay. And before yesterday did you ever discuss with Mr. Leonard

the criminal case against O.J. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: Okay. So yesterday is the first time that you ever had any kind of

legal conversation with Dan Leonard. Is that true?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Are you paying Mr. Leonard?



A: Me personally?



MR. LEONARD: I am objecting. That definitely invades the

attorney-client privilege.



MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to establish whether there is any bona

fide attorney-client relationship.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I can represent that there is, and I am not going

to let him answer that  question.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



Q: Are you paying Mr. Leonard for his services?



MR. LEONARD: I am objecting and instructing him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Who is paying for Mr. Leonard's services on your behalf?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object and instruct him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have an agreement by which  Mr. Leonard has

been retained to represent you here today?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object and instruct him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Who else was present at the Rockingham  home yesterday when you met

with Mr. Leonard other than [Name Deleted], Gigi Guarin and O.J.

Simpson and yourself?



A: No one that I remember.



Q: Nobody at all?



A: (Shakes head.)



Q:  You have to answer audibly.



A: No. Sorry.



Q: How long were you at Rockingham yesterday?



A: About three hours, four hours.



Q: Okay. And only 20 minutes of that time did you spend talking to Dan

Leonard?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: What did you do the rest of the time?



A: Swam in the pool with my girlfriend.



Q: Okay. And did you discuss with your  girlfriend this case or this

deposition today?



A: No.



Q: Did you talk at all yesterday with O.J. Simpson about this case?



A: No.



Q: Not at all.



A: No.



Q: Not a word.



A: No.



Q: At any time did Mr. Simpson join your discussion with Dan Leonard?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Have you ever discussed this civil lawsuit with O.J. Simpson?



A: Not really, no.



Q: What does "Not really" mean?



A: I'd say, "How's everything going.?" and he might reply whatever,

however -- whatever happened in the day, but specifics, no.



Q: Do you understand what this lawsuit is about?



A: Yes --



Q: What is your understanding?



A: -- generally.  My understanding is that your case is a little bit

different than the other two. You're representing the Goldmans. The

Browns representing for monetary reasons -- I don't know. I don't

know. I'm not -- I kinda got it and I kinda don't. And then  Rufo, I

don't know. You're Rufo, or you're Goldman?



Q: I represent Mr. Goldman.



A: The Goldmans. Okay. The Rufo thing I really don't understand, so...



Q: And what do you understand to be the nature and purpose of the

Goldman suit against O.J. Simpson?



A: To -- the -- was it -- I -- they want -- it's the just the next

step under what he just went through, except they think -- I don't

know. I don't understand it totally.



Q: Did you ever ask your father what this case is all about?



A: No, I haven't.



Q: And you understand that in this lawsuit Mr. Goldman accuses O.J.

Simpson of killing his son  Ronald?



A: That I understand.



Q: Okay. Have you ever asked your father whether he killed Ron

Goldman?



A: No, sir.



Q: Have you ever asked your father whether he killed Nicole Brown

Simpson?



A: Absolutely not.



Q: Okay. Has he ever told you whether or not he killed Ron Goldman?



A: No, sir.



Q: Has he told you whether or not he killed  Nicole?



A: No, sir.



Q: Have you had any conversation with O.J. Simpson on the subject of

whether or not he killed Ron Goldman, any conversation at all?



A: No.



Q: And any conversation with O.J. Simpson on the subject of whether he

killed Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Did O.J. Simpson ever tell you that he did not kill these people?



Q: MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that. That's argumentative.



MR. PETROCELLI: It's not argumentative.



MR. LEONARD: Yeah. Well, I am objecting.



You can ask -- answer the question.



THE WITNESS: He never said he killed Nicole.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did he ever say to you he did not kill Nicole?



A: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: He did say he did not kill  Nicole.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Well, I previously asked you whether you had any conversation

with him on this subject at all, and you said no. Now you are telling

me he said he did not kill Nicole, so that would have been responsive

to my prior question.



A: I guess I heard you wrong.



Q: Well, you need to really work hard at this and let me know if we're

not clicking. Okay?



A: Okay.



Q: I asked you that question previously in the broadest form possible

so that you would give me any conversation at all.  So tell me now

about the conversation where you just said O.J. Simpson claimed he did

not kill Nicole.



A: I believe he might have said, "I can't  believe that this is

happening. How could they think I killed Nicole?"



Q: What else did he say?



A: In that specific or particular conversation --



Q: Yes.



A: -- I don't recall. I remember hearing that, though.



Q: When did he say that to you, Mr. Simpson?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Was it shortly after the murders?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Who else was present, if anyone?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Where were you and he when O.J. Simpson said this to you?



A: I don't remember.



Q: You don't remember anything?



A: I remember things. I don't remember exactly where I was standing,

where -- who was there.



Q: Well, tell me -- one of the other things you need to understand

about this process is that if you don't -- cannot remember exact

things, which by and large people can't --



A: Right.



Q: -- but you do remember generally, tell me whatever it is you

recall, however vague and general that may be. I am entitled to your

best recollection,  whatever it is. You understand?



A: I understand.



Q: So if I say, "What did O.J. Simpson say?"  and you don't remember

exactly what he said but you  remember the gist of what he said, then

tell me that.



A: Okay.



Q: Is that fair?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay.



A: I believe I told you the gist of what he said.



Q: Okay. And can you tell me anything else that he said or you said?



A: No.



Q: And can you tell me where you were, when it was and who was

present?



A: Not exactly, no.



Q: Generally?



A: Generally, I think it was the house, after, our house, my dad's

house.



Q: The night of the 13th when he came back from Chicago?



A: I think -- I think, because that was the last time I had a chance

to be with him, so...



Q: The last time you were with O.J. Simpson --



A: Yeah. Could actually touch him and everything, you know.



Q: Was the night of the 13th a Monday night, on his return from

Chicago?



A: Yes.



Q: Where he -- when he slept at Rockingham that night?



A: I think so.



Q: And then the next several nights he slept at Mr. Kardashian's home.

Correct?



A: I believe so.



Q: And you were not at the Kardashian home. Right?



A: No, sir.



Q: And then on the 17th he had this ride in  the Bronco which

culminated in his arrest.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you did see him at Rockingham on the 17th. You were there at

the house when he came back with Mr. Cowlings in the Bronco. Right?



A: Yes, I was.



Q: Okay. And you saw Mr. Simpson also at  the funeral. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: And you also saw Mr. Simpson at Nicole's viewing. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: So in fact you saw him Monday, you saw  him Wednesday, you saw him

Thursday and you saw him  Friday.



A: That's right.



Q: Okay. Do you remember all that?



A: Now, yeah.



Q: Okay. Well, we will get to all that. Did you see him on Tuesday,

the 14th of June, the day that he went to pick up his golf clubs and

the day that he went to Mr. Kardashian's house?



A: Tuesday. I don't know. I don't remember.



Q: Was [Name Deleted] your girlfriend in June of 1994?



A: Yes.



Q: When did she become your girlfriend?



A: November. November of '91. It's been  five years now, I think --

six years, five years.



Q: Was [Name Deleted] with you at Rockingham at any time between June

13 and June 17, 1994?



A: I think every -- no, not every night. She was with me, yeah, at

some point.

Q: Of 1993?



A: '93.



Q: Okay. What was the address there?



A: [Address deleted.]



Q: When did you vacate that apartment?



A: Like it was the week -- it was the week that everything happened,

so from the 12th or the 13th to the 17th. I had friends like move all

my stuff into my dad's house, because once he went away, I moved into

the house. So that was...



Q: Okay. So --



A: During the week --



Q: -- the week or so after the murder, you  then moved out of the

Hollywood apartment and into Rockingham.  True?



A: Yes. Yes, sir.



Q: What room at Rockingham?



A: The -- my old room, the guesthouse room,  would have been the

second room to the back.



Q: Okay. Is that the room that Kato Kaelin was staying in?

living in that room.



Q: Is that the same room he occupied,  Kato Kaelin, when he was there

between January and  June --



A: No, it's not.



Q: -- of 1994?



A: It's not.



Q: As I understand the property, there was the Kaelin room and then

next to the Kaelin room, going to the back of the property, there was

a room that Arnelle was living in?



A: Yeah, she was living there, but that was my room.



Q: Okay.



A: Bigger closet.



Q: And then there is another room back  there also?



A: Right. That's Arnelle's room originally.



Q: Okay. Okay. So you then moved into this room next to Arnelle's

original room after the murder of Nicole. Right?



A: Right. Right.



Q: And who was then in Kato Kaelin's room after he moved out?

A: Six months ago.



Q: Okay. And then you moved in with [Name Deleted]?

November of last year?

Q: Early 1994?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. She moved out into her own apartment, you stayed there until

Q: From 1991 till the time that you moved into the Sycamore apartment

you lived in your  mother's apartment building.



A: Yeah.



Q: Is that true?



A: Yes, sir.

Arnelle?

A: Not anymore.



MR. LEONARD: Oh, okay.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



THE WITNESS: I don't want to --



MR. LEONARD: Okay.



THE WITNESS: The address was [address deleted].



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Where is that located?



A: It would just be Los Angeles.



Q: Okay. Did your mother also have an apartment at that building at

the time?



A: She had a house around the corner.



Q: Around the corner. Okay. Before you moved into this apartment on

South Orange Drive, where did you live?



A: Dormitory at USC.



Q: What year were you at the USC dormitory?



A: '88 -- actually, before that -- sorry.  I got that wrong.



Q: That's all right.



A: I had an apartment. I had an apartment in Hollywood.



Q: Alone?



A: No.



Q: With whom?



A: A girlfriend.



Q: Okay. What years did you live in this apartment in Hollywood?



A: No. You know what? That's wrong. I'm sorry. I had an apartment by

myself in Hollywood.



Q: In Hollywood?



A: Yeah.



Q: What years?



A: That would have been '90.



Q: Okay. To '91?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Lived there alone?



A: Uh-huh. Yes, sir.



Q: And before this apartment in Hollywood in  1990, where were you

living?



A: In another apartment, in '89, I believe,  but not the whole year.

Just like six months, something like that.



Q: Where was that apartment?



A: It was in Hollywood -- West Hollywood.



Q: You lived there alone?



A: No. Roommate.



Q: And before --



MR.LEONARD: You have to keep your hands down,  Jason.



THE WITNESS: I'm not going to answer --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Before this apartment in Hollywood, where did you live?



A: Before this apartment I lived then in the dormitory.



Q: At USC?



A: At USC.



Q: For how long?



A: For a year and -- I'm sorry. About 10 months.



Q: What was the time period?



A: It was '88, '89 --



Q: September of '88?



A: The latter part of '88 and the beginning of '89.



Q: September of '88 until when?



A: Till -- through the summer session, so it  would have been --



Q: Summer of '89?



A: Right.



Q: Okay. When did you graduate -- when did you enroll in USC?



A: '88,1988.



Q: And you attended USC for how long?



A: One full winter end summer term. That's it.



Q: One year at USC?



A: One year.



Q: Okay. So the '88-89 year at USC was your only year there. Is that

right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Is that the only year that you have gone to school?



A: To college.



Q: To college.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. When did you graduate high school?



A: In 1988.



Q: In June. Right?



A: Yes, sir. No. May.



Q: May. Excuse me. What high school?



A: Army-Navy Academy.



Q: Where is that located?



A: Carlsbad, California.



Q: How long were you there?



A: Three years.



Q: Did you live there?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: When you came home for -- excuse me. Did you come home at all for

vacations, weekends, from time to time?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And at that time you were living with your mother, Marquerite?



A: No, sir.



Q: Where were you living?



A: With my father and Nicole.



Q: During what years?



A: '88, so it would have been from --



Q: '85 to '88?



A: Well, from the 6th grade, which was -- I  don't know-up until the

time I graduated or -- graduated high school.



Q: Okay. So give me a year on sixth grade.



A: We gotta go back. That would have been 19--



Q: '82, around there?



A: Yeah, a little bit younger than that. Right?



Q: You were 12 years old?



A: Yeah, I guess that's about the time frame, I think. 1982.



Q: Are you telling me that from about 1982 or thereabouts until the

time you graduated high school in May of 1988 --



A: Yes, sir.



Q: -- that you resided at Rockingham with your father and Nicole?



A: It was my home.



Q: Rockingham was your home.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Except when you were living at the Army-Navy Academy.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Is that right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. In other words, during that period  of time from about sixth

grade until you graduated  high school, you did not live at all with

your mother. Is that right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Do I have it?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Was the Army-Navy Academy the only  boarding school you

attended?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Before you enrolled in the Army-Navy  Academy, where were you going

to school?



A: Crossroads in Santa Monica.



Q: When you lived -- Withdrawn. You moved into Rockingham for the

first time after you got out of sixth grade?



A: It was just toward the end of sixth grade.



Q: And did you move in with Arnelle at that time? Did Arnelle move

into Rockingham with you?



A: No, sir.



Q: Okay. Arnelle was -- where was she living when you moved into

Rockingham with O.J. Simpson?



A: With my mother.



Q: She stayed with her mother?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Did there come a time when then  she moved into Rockingham?



A: Not permanently.



Q: What do you mean by that?



A: She'd stay -- we went to the same school.  She'd stay a week.



Q: I see. But basically her principal  residence throughout her

schooling was with Marquerite?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. All the way through high school that was true, that she lived

with Marquerite, except for occasional nights over at your father's

house?



A: Yes, sir, but -- yes, sir.



Q: Okay. But what?



A: When I was away at school, I don't know, sometimes she might stay

for a week or something. I wouldn't know.



Q: Okay. When you moved into Rockingham after sixth grade or around

the end of sixth grade --



A: Uh-huh.



Q: -- who was living there with you besides O.J. Simpson? Anyone else?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Had Nicole moved in yet?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. So Nicole was living there. O.J. Simpson was living there.



A: Uh-huh.



Q: You were living there.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Anyone else?



A: We probably had a housekeeper, but I don't remember.



Q: It was not Michelle. Right?



A: No, she wasn't. She wasn't -- she didn't work for us.



Q: She came along later. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Do you remember who the housekeeper was at that time?



A: I don't.



Q: Okay. And when you -- did you stay continuously at Rockingham from

sixth grade until the time you went off to boarding school?



A: Yes.



Q: And when you used to come back for vacations and weekends from

boarding school, did you always go back to Rockingham?



A: Sometimes.



Q: And sometimes where?



A: To my mom's.



Q: Okay.  And May of 1988 when you graduated  from boarding school,

was that the last time that you permanently lived at Rockingham prior

to the murder of  Nicole?



A: No, sir. No, sir.



Q: Okay. When did you live at Rockingham permanently after you

graduated from boarding school?



A: Sometimes -- some -- well, it wasn't permanently. Sometimes between

the apartments, I might stay for a week.



Q: I don't mean an occasional week here or there.



A: Okay. Well, then, no, that was it. That's the last time I lived

there.



Q: Where did you live in the summer of 1988 between boarding school

and USC?





[Portion del



Q: Okay. And they all met Nicole on numerous occasions. Correct?



A: She was like a -- yeah, they all met her.



Q: Did you love Nicole?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Were you close to her?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Was she like a second mother to you?



A: I wouldn't say second mother, no.



Q: Did you always remain close to your -- to Marquerite, your mother?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Did you ever have a period where you had a falling out with

Marquerite?



A: Yes.



Q: And what period of time was that?



A: Right when I first moved into -- with my  dad and maybe

periodically.



Q: Around sixth grade?



A: Yeah, around sixth grade.



Q: That's the period you're talking about, when you moved into

Rockingham?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did there come a time when you were able to mend the breach

with your mother?



A: Yes.



Q: When did that occur?



A: I don't -- I don't remember exactly.



Q: Just generally speaking.



A: Not too long after. I mean, my mom -- this was -- I moved in with

my dad maybe a week before graduation, and she was at graduation, and

I spent  time with her.



Q: So you never had a prolonged period of  estrangement from your

mother, like a year or longer?



A: No, not that long, no.



Q: Okay. Describe your relation to -- your relationship with Nicole

during the years that you lived at  Rockingham with her from 1982 to

1988.



A: She was -- she was like a good friend. She was like a real, real

good friend, more like an older sister than -- I mean mother doesn't

really fit into the relationship, you know?



Q: Nicole was born in 1959?



A: I don't remember exactly when Nicole was  born.



Q: And you were born 1970?



A: Uh-huh. Yes.



Q: And she was like a big sister to you. Right?



A: Yeah. She was fun.



Q: She talked to you a lot?



A: Did she talk to me a lot?



Q: Yeah. Did the two of you spend time talking alone?



A: Sometimes, yeah.



Q: Would you tell her about things going on in school?



A: School, girls, whatever.



Q: With girls and everything?



A: Yeah.



Q: Do you believe she loved you?



A: Yeah.



Q: And you loved her dearly?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And was that true even after you moved out of Rockingham in 1988?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Did you always remain close to Nicole?



A: Yes.



Q: All the way up until the end of her life?



A: Yes.



Q: And did Nicole -- and did that remain  true even after Nicole and

your father split up?



A: That -- yes.



Q: You still remained close to Nicole?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did there ever come a period of time when  you had a falling out

with Nicole?



A: Lots of times.



Q: I don't mean an occasional argument or  two, but I mean a lengthy

estrangement, let's say six months, a year, where you just didn't talk

to her and she didn't talk to you.



A: No. Not -- no. The kids were born. No. There was -- no.



Q: "The kids" meaning your step --



A: My sister and my brother.



Q: Your stepsister and your brother.



A: Yeah.



Q: Or your brother and your sister. Right?



A: That's what I call them.



Q: You like to call them your brother and your sister.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: By your "brother" and your "sister " you  are referring to Sydney

and Justin. Right?



A: Yes, I am.



Q: Okay. So there never came a time when you had any significant

falling out with Nicole. Is that right?



A: What do you mean by significant?



Q: Well, tell me what you have in mind.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to object to that. You're asking the

question.



MR. PETROCELLI: I know, but he seems to be  troubled, and I am

wondering if there is anything that you have in mind that I'm not

understanding.



MR.LEONARD: Well, I don't think he's appearing troubled. I probably

should have objected. I think it's a vague question, but -- and I

don't think he understands it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you understand what I'm asking you?



A: No. That's why I'm asking you, what do you mean --



Q: That' s fair. Did you have any falling out with Nicole where you

didn't talk to each other for a long period of time?



A: In high school, but maybe a week or -- that's my opinion--



Q: After high school?



A: No. No.



Q: Did you ever have any big fights with her?



A: No. Never. We were never really --



Q: Did you ever scream and yell at her?



A: After high school?



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: Before high school?



A: Before -- in high school, yeah.



Q: Over what kind of things?



A: Sneaking my dad's car out and she caught me, and she was gonna

tell, and we were yelling at each other.



Q: Okay.



A: And that's about it. That was the only time we ever really got in a

heated argument. I was like in the ninth grade or something like that.



Q: And you snuck your dad's car out.



A: Yeah, and I got busted.



Q: Okay. So other then that incident, after high school did you ever

have an occasion where you  were  screaming and yelling at her for

something?



A: No.



Q: Or she at you.



A: No.



Q: Okay. What kind of person was Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Object. Vague.



You can answer.



THE WITNESS: My opinion?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah. Describe her to me.



A: I don't know. Nicole changed. I mean,  in high school I remember

her one way, and when I grew up I remember her another way. When she

was married,  I remember her one way and --



Q: When did Nicole change?



A: She went through a lot of changes. I mean, I've known her for 17

years.



Q: Can you describe the changes that she went through?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as vague and overbroad, but go

ahead.



THE WITNESS: She -- sorry. She went from being at one point a young,

fun-loving person to being a beautiful mother. You know, I mean, when

you want to explain --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: A young, fun-loving --



A: Whatever, going out, you know, and  single --



Q: Young, fun-loving person going out was when you -- she was living

with you at Rockingham, and  before she had the children. Right?



A: Before she got married to my dad, when she was married and they

would do couples things and stuff like that, and then when she got

married, and  then another stage when they got divorced.



Q: And what changes did you see in her when she got divorced?



A: Maturity.



Q: She became more mature?



A: She always was becoming a little bit more mature. You know what I'm

saying? She was off on her own. I've never seen her alone before, you

know, living in a house. I never really got to see what it would be

like for her to have a place of her own, what everything, you know,

she would like. Do you understand what I'm saying? Go to her house and

look and, you know, see all the things  that, you know, she liked --



Q: As opposed to what your father would  like?



A: Yeah, it would be --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



MR. PETROCELLI: It's not argumentative.



Q: Okay. You can answer.



A. "Yeah, it would be?" Continue.



A: Different -- well, than the group of us.  Say if you live in a

home, you know, everybody's got  input, so there might be a whole

bunch -- the home might look one way. If there's one person living 

there, you see their interests, and I had no idea that she liked-the

music selection that she had and certain other things like that.



Q: What was the music selection?



A: It was big. It was huge. I never thought she liked so much things.

She had new CDs, new stereos and stuff. I liked going over to her

house. It was cool.



Q: At Gretna Green.



A: At Gretna Green.



Q: Gretna Green is the first time that you saw Nicole in an

environment where she made her own home and lived alone. Right?



A: Yes. Yes.



Q: And you went to visit her at Gretna Green from time to time. Right?



A: Once in a while, yeah.



Q: And she moved to Bundy in January of  '94. Did you ever visit her

there?



A: A handful of times.



Q: At Bundy?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. So when she moved from Gretna Green to Bundy, you continued

to maintain your  relationship with her. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And, of course, she was the mother of Sydney and Justin, and

you're -- I assume you've  been very close to them?



A: Yeah.



Q: Since the time they were born?



A: Yeah.



Q: To the present?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see Nicole suffer what in your mind was a

nervous breakdown?



A: Didn't seem like it, no.



Q: In the entire time that you knew Nicole, did you ever see her go

through what you believed was akin to a nervous breakdown?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to lack of  foundation, asking him

to speculate.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: A nervous breakdown, no.



Q: Okay. Did you ever observe a period of time when you thought Nicole

was not in control of  herself?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as vague and  lack of foundation,

calling for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: Repeat the question.



Q: Yeah. Did you ever observe a period of time when you thought Nicole

was not in control of herself?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ever observe a period of time when you thought that Nicole

was not a fit mother?



A: No, absolutely not.



Q: Did you ever observe a period of time when you thought that Nicole

was a danger to Sydney and Justin?



A: Never.



Q: Did you ever observe a period of time when you thought that Nicole

was repeatedly under the  influence of drugs?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of  foundation, calls for

speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: No.



Q:  Or under the influence of alcohol repeatedly to the point where

she needed help.



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. It's vague, overbroad, calls for

speculation and lack of  foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: Not that I know of.



Q: Okay. Did your father ever tell you -- Withdrawn. Did O.J. Simpson

ever tell you that Nicole was not a fit mother?



A: Never.



Q: That Nicole was dangerous to the children, Sydney end Justin?



A: No, never.



Q: That Nicole was going through a nervous  breakdown?



A: No.



Q: That Nicole was out of control?



A: No.



Q: That Nicole needed help?



A: No.



Q: That Nicole was a pathological liar?



A: No.



Q: That Nicole was attempting to defraud him in any way?



A: No.



Q: That Nicole was attempting to cheat him  out of money?



A: No.



A: That Nicole was excessively taking drugs?



A: No



Q: That Nicole was excessively consuming alcohol?



A: No.



Q: Did O.J. Simpson ever express any concern to you over Nicole's

welfare prior to her death?



A: Once.



Q: What did he say?



A: She was sick.  She had pneumonia a couple weeks before it happened.

He just brought her some chicken soup or something like that.



Q: You're referring to a period of time shortly before Nicole's death?



A: I -- yeah, it wasn't too long before then. She was really sick.



Q: What did Mr. Simpson tell you about  Nicole?



A: She was sick and he was going to go get her some chicken soup.



Q: Did she tell you what was wrong with her?



A: She said she had pneumonia.



Q: She said that to whom?



A: To me.



Q: You went to see her?



A: I spoke to her on the phone, I think. I don't remember if I saw

her. No, you know what? I did see her. I did see her. She was really

sick.



Q: Did you see her after your father told you that she was ill?



A: No. Before. Before.



Q: So you saw Nicole, knew she was ill; then later on had a

conversation with your father when he said what to you?



A: He --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. I think you've already asked him that. But go

ahead.



THE WITNESS: He had brought her chicken soup.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Would you describe Nicole as an independent woman?



A: Toward -- yes. Yeah, I would.



Q: Toward the end, you were saying?



A: I was going to say, toward the latter  part of -- yeah, I would.



Q: Toward the latter part of what? Her life?



A: Of her life, yeah.



Q: And what does the "latter part" mean in your thinking,



A: The last -- the last few years.



Q: When she moved out on her own?



A: Yeah, it would have been.



Q: What changes did you see in Nicole after she moved out on her own?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What kind of changes in her personality or in the way she handled

herself? You talked about you saw signs of maturing. I'm trying to

explore that in greater depth.



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. It's  vague. It's compound --



MR. PETROCELLI: That's fine.



MR. LEONARD: -- overbroad.  You can answer if you can.



THE WITNESS: In one sense, at home, her home life seemed good.

Everything seemed fine. In another sense, her social life was

expanding more. She was  going out more. She was partying a little bit

more. But I wasn't around Nicole as much as I was in high school, but

I knew that much.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: How did you know about her life after she moved out of Rockingham

to Gretna Green and then to Bundy? By your personal contact with her?



A: Yes.



Q: During the Gretna Green years, '92 and 93 --



A: Uh-huh.



Q:-- how often would you have contact with Nicole?



A: Gretna Green years, maybe three days a  week, four days a week,

about two hours, three hours a  day. After school, go by, see the

kids.



Q: And also on the telephone, too?



A: Not that much on the phone.



Q: You wouldn't call her too often?



A: No, not that much.



Q: You wouldn't call the children on the phone too often?



A: Sometimes. They'd call me, but I'd usually just run out there and

see them. I'm not a big phone person.



Q: Now, during these two years at Gretna Green, 1992 and '93 --



A: Uh-huh.



Q:  -- did you maintain this level of contact with Nicole pretty

constantly throughout that two-year period?



A: Steady? I think so.



Q: Okay. Then when Nicole moved to Bundy in 1994 up until the end of

her life in June of 1994, did  you continue to maintain that level of

contact with her?



A: I tried to, but I couldn't get around as much.



Q: Because of your own --



A: Work.



Q:-- work requirements?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: Okay. Nicole always made you feel welcome at the home?



A: Yeah, she did. She did.



Q: Did you have a key to her Gretna Green home?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Was there a place where she left a key  for you to go there?



A: Not -- she never told me about anything.



Q:  So the only time you could go there is if she or the housekeeper

were home. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: And her housekeeper during the Gretna Green years was whom?



A: I don't remember her -- there being a housekeeper. There might have

been. I don't remember, though.



Q: When you were at the Gretna Green house, it was mainly when she was

there, Nicole. Right?



A: Yeah. Can I explain?



Q: Yes, please.



A: I'd usually stop by because my bank's out there, usually stop by my

dad's house. It's on the way. I would go by my dad's, go by Nicole's,

go by my friends, whatever. It's just -- I'd kinda sweep the  whole

area and say hi to everybody. If she wasn't home, if I saw her car

wasn't there, I wouldn't stop in. If she was, I would  go in. It was

more like if she was home, I saw her. If she wasn't, I wouldn't, that

kinda thing. I never  usually called before I came by.



Q: And the same true during the time she was  at Bundy?



A: At Bundy, yeah, but I'd only been there a  couple of times, so I

wasn't -- I'd only been there a couple of times.



Q: Did you have a key to Bundy?



A: No.



Q: At any time?



A: No.



Q: Did she ever lend you her key?



A: No. She never even offered me a key.



Q: Did she have a place where she kept a key --



A: Not that I know of.



Q: -- to your knowledge?



A: Not that I know of.



Q: Did you have a clicker for the garage?



A: No. I didn't even know she had a garage.



Q: When you used to go to Bundy, where would you park?



A: In the front on Bundy.



Q: How many times were you there in the six months she lived there?



A: Maybe five times. Not as often as --



Q: And during the five times that you were there, who else was

present?



A: One time I was there, her mother was  there. The first time I was

there, the movers were  there. The kids. That's all I remember.



Q: When was the last time you were there?



A: It was when her mother was there and they were doing something, and

I stopped by to say hello.



Q: Were the children home?



A: No, they weren't home.



Q: They were in school?



A: Yeah, I think.



Q: Was this in June of 1994?



A: No. It was in -- I don't remember when it was.



Q: Was it before or after Nicole was ill when you visited her?



A: I think it was -- I don't know. I think  it was -- I don't know. I

think then the last time would have been when she was ill. I really

don't  remember.



Q: When you went there the time she was ill, who else was there?

Anyone?



A: I don't remember. That might have been  the time when her mother

was there.



Q: Just not sure?



A: Yeah.



Q: When you would go to Nicole's house at  Bundy, how would you get

in?



A: Front door.



Q: How would you get past the front gate?



A: Usually you'd have to buzz it or it wasn't closed all the way.



Q: Okay. And if it was not -- closed and you had to buzz it, did the

person have to come out to get you, or could they buzz you -- buzz the

gate open from inside the house?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Okay. Did you have a key in 1994 to Rockingham?



A: I think to my room, but not to the house. I think.



Q: You didn't have a master key?



A: No. I think, though. I'm not quite sure.



Q: You didn't have a room at Rockingham in  1994.



A:'94?



Q: This is before the murders. Excuse me.



A: I always had a room in Rockingham.



Q: But you didn't live there for years.



A: Yeah, but it was always my room.



Q: What do you mean by that?



A: It was still my room. It didn't -- it didn't -- it never did not

become my room. At one point I left.



Q: Well, there was a place there that you regarded as your room even

though you hadn't stayed there in many, many years?



A: We all regarded it as my room, yeah. I mean, I still had clothes

and crap and stuff in the room.



Q: You had clothes there in June of 1994?



A: Yeah. In the closet? Yeah.



Q: This is the closet of the room in which Arnelle was sleeping?



A: Yeah. Some stuff, yeah.



Q: Okay. And was there an empty bed in that room? Or was there a bed

in this room you're calling your room?



A: Yeah.



Q: Is that a bed that was unoccupied in June?



A: Arnelle was sleeping in it.



Q: Sleeping in that bed?



A: Yeah.



Q: So in effect she was sleeping in what you call your room.



A: Yeah.



Q: So even though you call it your room, you were not living there.



A: Yeah. It was still my room. I mean --



Q: That goes back to high school days. Right?



A: Well, yeah. I mean, you know --



Q: Okay.



A: -- if I were to ever come back, she would  have to go back to her

room.



Q: Okay.



A: That's my room.



Q: Okay. So you did not have a key to the -- a master key to the

house. Right?



A: No. I don't think so, like I said.



Q: Did you have a key to the Rockingham gate?



A: No, because that would be the same one.



Q: As the master key?



A:  Okay. So when you wanted to go to  Rockingham in June of 1994, how

would you get in the property?



A: I'd have to ring the buzzer



Q: At Ashford. Right?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: And then they would buzz you in. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. And could you manipulate the gate to get in without the

ringing of the buzzer?



A: Lots of times before all this, we never had the gate all boarded up

and everything the way it is now, so, yeah, I mean usually it was

unlocked. You'd  just push the gate open and get in.



Q: At Ashford?



A: At Ashford.



Q: Just so we can clarify your answer, when  you said, "before all

this," you meant from the time of the murders. Right?



A: Yes. Yes,  sir.



Q: Now you have this boarded-up area?



A: The gate is now securely locked, and you can't see through it

because it's, you know, bars.  We've got wood up. It's --



Q: All that as a result of the press and media being --



A: People.



Q:  -- at your property and lookey-loos and all that?



A: Sightseers. Sightseers want to see stuff.



Q: Describe the way it was in June of 1994 prior to Nicole's death.



MR. LEONARD: And when you say it --



MR. PETROCELLI: The situation with the gate there.



THE WITNESS: The gate?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah. You said it was open.



A: Looking at the gate on the Ash- --



MR.LEONARD: Let me just -- I think you are mischaracterizing. You said

"open." I don't think that's what he said.



MR. PETROCELLI: That's exactly what he said. But, anyway, why don't

you just let him testify. I'm not trying to put words in his mouth,

but I don't want  your testimony.



MR. LEONARD: But I'm not.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



MR. LEONARD: I mean, I just think -- I want  you to be fair to the

witness. That's all.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



Q: Describe to me the condition of the gate.



A: From what I remember --



Q: Yes. Before the murder, now.



A: From what I remember, the gate -- the gate -- the left gate usually

was unlatched. Unless -- there's an arm, say, like this  (Indicating).

Unless it was like that. If it was locked into position, you could not

open it. If you would jimmy it, then you could open it.



Q: Okay. And you are referring now to the Ashford gate. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And if you were outside and you saw that that arm was fully

-- arm of the gate was  fully extended --



A: Right.



Q: -- could you unhook it or disengage it  from outside the property?



A: You couldn't reach it, no.



Q: Couldn't reach it?



A: You'd have to know how to do it.



Q: Could you do it?



A: Sometimes. Or I'd just hop the wall.



Q: Okay. And that gate, by and large, was  not kept locked. Right?



A: No. It was -- sometimes. It depended  on the gardeners or whoever

was the last person in or out.



Q: And the same true of Rockingham?



A: No. Rockingham was always locked.



Q: Always?



A: Yeah.



Q: Why is that?



A: I don't know.



Q: Now, the Ashford gate was the gate that people used to come onto

the property, and Rockingham, the gate used to leave the property.



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Was that generally the case before  Nicole's murder?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: Sometimes.



Q: Generally true?



MR. LEONARD: I think he just answered it  twice. He said "Sometimes."



MR. PETROCELLI: I don't care how many times he answers.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I do. How many times you  going to ask it?



MR.PETROCELLI: Till I get the truth.



MR. LEONARD: Well, till you get -- oh, the truth. You know -- Dan, you

know what the truth is.



MR. PETROCELLI: I do indeed.



MR. LEONARD: Well, that's amazing.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: What's the question?



Q: The question is: Isn't it true that, generally speaking, the people

who came to the Rockingham house would enter on Ashford and leave on

the Rockingham gate? Isn't that generally true?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Meaning more often than not?



A: Depends on what people, what time, when.



Q: You.



A: Me?



Q: Yes, you.



A: Personally?



Q: Yes.



A: I'd come on through Ashford or I'd park outside and just -- it

depends. I usually didn't park my car in the driveway, though.



Q: You parked your car on Ashford usually.  Right?



A: Yeah. I did.



Q: Your father did, too. Right?



A: Sometimes.



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What do you mean, "Sometimes"?



A: Sometimes he parked it on Rockingham. Sometimes --



Q: More often than not he parked his car on Ashford. True?



A: I couldn't tell you. I didn't live there, first of all.



Q: So you have no idea?



A: No. I do. I have an idea. Sometimes I'd see it on Rockingham.

Sometimes I'd see it on Ashford.



Q: You wouldn't see it on -- parked on  Rockingham for extended

periods of time. Right?



A: I wouldn't see it parked anywhere for extended periods of time.



Q: Where would it be parked for extended  periods of time?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



THE WITNESS: In the neighborhood.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Where in the neighborhood?



A: Either on Rockingham or on Ashford.



Q: Did your father usually park that Bronco on Ashford?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. He's asked -- you've asked him that I think

three or four times. Oh, yeah.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



MR. LEONARD: I think you are badgering the witness at this point.



MR. PETROCELLI: He hardly appears badgered.



MR. LEONARD: I'm badgered.



MR. PETROCELLI: That's true.



Q: And you can answer.



A: Can you repeat the question?



Q: Yeah. Your father, O.J. Simpson, usually parked the Bronco on

Ashford. True?



A: Sometimes he parked on Ashford.



Q: I said "usually." You said "sometimes."



MR. LEONARD: I think the answer is no.



MR.PETROCELLI: That's your answer. I know  that's your answer.



MR. LEONARD: Well, you say he usually does, and he says "sometimes" --



MR.PETROCELLI: No, that's not true.



MR. LEONARD: Oh, that's right. You know what's true. I forgot.



BY MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. You can answer.



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Asked and answered. Go ahead.



THE WITNESS: Can you repeat -- the same question?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes. In front of the mailbox on Ashford.



A: Sometimes in front of the mail box, sometimes in back of the

mailbox and sometimes on Rockingham.



Q: Okay.



A: Depends on which way he came up the street.



Q: If he came up the street on --



A: On Rockingham, on Ashford -- on Bristol.



Q: When he came up the street on Rockingham, where would he park?



A: Sometimes I'd see the car on Rockingham. Sometimes I'd see the car

on Ashford in front of the gate. Sometimes I'd see the car on Ashford

past the gate where the call box was. In, what, the period of five

years, six, seven, eight years, something like that we've had our

Bronco, the car was never consistently parked at one place.



Q: Did you drive that Bronco?



A: Yeah, sometimes.



Q: Did you have keys to it?



A: No. When I drove the car, I had the keys.



Q: Where did you get the keys?



A: Every single time I drove the car?



Q: Where would you get the keys? From someone else?



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, I am going to object. I  think -- I was a little

slow there on the gun. I  think --



MR. PETROCELLI: He doesn't need you. He's doing just fine.



MR.LEONARD: I think it's overbroad. Are you  asking him --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Generally speaking --



MR. LEONARD: Okay, there you go.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- how would you get keys to the car?



A: I'd ask my father if I could get the keys.



Q: And there would be a place --



A: Or Nicole.



Q: And there would be a place where you could get the keys?



A: Yeah.



Q: Where would that be?



A: The kitchen, somewhere in the kitchen, in a cup or something like

that.



Q: And did the Bronco -- and I am talking about the Bronco that your

father had in June of  1994 -- it had a clicker in it to operate the

gates?



A: I think. It probably did.



Q: You don't remember?



A: No. I didn't drive the car that often.



Q: When was the last time before Nicole's death that you drove it?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Okay. When was the last time before Nicole's death that you were at

Rockingham?



A: I don't remember that either.



Q: Months? Weeks? Days?



A: No, it wasn't months. It wasn't that long, but I don't remember --

oh, annually, it was -- we had a party. My sister and I had a party

there. What was it --



Q: Monday of Memorial Day weekend?



A: Yeah.



Q: Allright. Was that the last time you  were there?



A: I think I'm almost sure that was the last time I was there.



Q: At Rockingham before Nicole's death?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And the last time you saw Nicole before  her death was when you

visited her when she was ill?



A: Yeah.



MR. LEONARD: You have to answer --



THE WITNESS: Yes.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: That was the last time?



A: Yes, last time I saw her.



Q: Last time you spoke to her?



A: Was I think the day before.



Q: Did you go to Justin's Sunshine graduation on June 7?



A: Oh, yes, I did.



Q: And you saw Nicole then. Right?



A: Yeah. Yeah, I did. Thank you. I did.



Q: Arnelle went also?



A: Yeah, she was there.



Q: And your father, O.J. Simpson, did not show up. Right?



A: No, he wasn't there.



Q: Okay. And do you know why he didn't show up?



A: No.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



MR.PETROCELLI: I said, "do you know why"  How can that be lack of

foundation?



Q: Do you know?



A: I don't know the reason why.



Q: Did you ever talk to him about why he didn't show up?



A: I didn't talk to him about it, no.



Q: Who did you talk to?



A: Nicole.



Q: What did you and she talk about?



A: She said he had some business thing. That's all she said.



Q: Nicole said to you, "Your father's not going to be here"?



A: Not in those words, no.



Q: What did she say to you?



A: She said, "He's got some business thing."



Q: Did she appear upset to you?



A: No. She seemed happy.



Q: Happy that Mr. Simpson was not coming?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI: Is that the sense that you got?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: No. It was happy that it was Justin's graduation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah, but what was her reaction to  Mr. Simpson not showing up for

the --



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- for his son's graduation?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: She just -- just like I'm saying right  now, she just said he had a

business thing.



Q: So you don't know how she felt one way or  the other about his not

being there?



A: I wasn't trying to get into it, no.



Q: I understand that, but I am just trying to find out whether you

know.



A: No, I don't.



Q: Okay. You don't know. Right?



A: No, I don't.



Q: Okay. How did you get invited to Sydney -- to Justin's graduation?



A: She told me about it. She called me and  told me about it.



Q:  She called you at the apartment?



A: I think so.



Q: Okay. And --



A: I found out about it somehow. I don't know. I think she told me

about it.



Q: Did you discuss with --



MR. LEONARD: Let me just instruct you, we don't want you guessing. It

doesn't help Mr. Petrocelli. It doesn't help me.



THE WITNESS: Okay. Sorry.



MR.LEONARD: If you know, you know. If you  don't, you don't. Go ahead.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you discuss with your father whether or not he would be there

at the graduation?



A: I don't remember.



Q: You don't remember any conversation at all with O.J. Simpson about

going to this event?



A: No, I don't.



Q: Did you talk to him after the event about it?



A: No.



Q: Did he call you and ask you how it went?



A: No, I don't think so. I don't remember.



Q: You -- did you go anywhere after you left the school? Was there a

family dinner or outing?



A: I had to go to work.



Q: You went off to work?



A: Yeah.



Q: I think that event took place on June 7.



A: I had totally forgot about it --



Q: Or June 8.



A: -- until you brought it up.



Q: When after that event did you next talk to Nicole?



A: That would have been June 8th, you're  saying?



Q: I think so.



A: I think the day before the re- --



Q: Recital was on June 12.



A: I think it would have been the day before the recital.



Q: And how did you come to speak to Nicole on that day?



A: I wanted them to come in to my restaurant.



Q: Which restaurant was this?



A: This was Jackson's restaurant in West Hollywood, after the recital.



Q: Were you invited to the dance recital of  Sydney?



A: Yes.



Q: How did you get invited?



A: I was -- she invited me.



Q: Who is --



A: Nicole.



Q: And when did Nicole invite you?



A: Couple -- a long time before, 'cause it was coming up. This is a

long-planned event usually,  and it's like a yearly thing, too. She's

done it for like two, three years, Sydney. So I knew it was  coming

up. It was a planned event.



Q: You had gone to the ones in the past?



A: I've gone to one in the past, but I've always been invited.



Q: And the usual custom was that after the recital the family would go

to dinner?



A: I don't know about the usual custom. The one I went to, I think we

went out to dinner. I don't remember. It was a while ago.



Q: And at some point long before the 12th of June you were told by

Nicole of the upcoming recital --



A: Reminded.



Q: -- and you were obviously invited.



A: Right.



Q: And you were told that you would be going  to dinner afterwards?



A: They wanted to go to dinner. I had to work, so what better idea,

"Why don't you come to my restaurant?"



Q: When she said, "they," meaning that the family would go out to

dinner after the recital.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you then suggested to her, "Why not my restaurant?"



A: Yeah.



Q: And you were working where at the time?



A: Jackson's.



Q: Jackson's. What were you doing at Jackson's?



A: I was cooking. I was the sous chef.



Q: At that time were you contemplating having to work that evening?



A: I had to work. That's why -- it could kill two birds with one

stone: I could see the kids -- I could see Sydney, since I had to miss

the -- since I had to miss the recital, plus, you know, they were

going to go out to eat, so why not just come in here.



Q: Now, being that she apprised you of the recital so far in advance,

how did you know you would  have to work that night on the 12th?



A: Because I have to work every Sunday.



Q: That's just a given. Right?



A: Yeah. There was no way. I couldn't get out of it.



Q: What hours --



A: It was the chef's day off. I had to work for him.



Q: What hours were you --



A: From 3:00 o'clock to closing.



Q: Which is? At midnight or so?



A: No. Sundays are usually slow, so probably around 10:30, 11:00. You

close around 9:30, but --



Q: You don't make any exceptions to that?



A: Well, I mean --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. "Exceptions." I don't --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Meaning saying, "I'II take off that night. I'll make arrangements."



A: I'm not the boss, no. I mean, I wish I could.



Q: Did you ask?



A: If I could?



Q: Yeah.



A: No. I mean -- no.



Q: Okay. So what did Nicole say to you when you suggested Jackson's?



A: First she said yes.



Q: First -- was this a telephone call?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay.



A: I think.



Q: And then she changed her mind?



A: Yes.



Q: In the same conversation?



A: No. Later. Actually, the day of the recital.



Q: How did you find out that the plan had been changed?



A: She -- in the conversation she said, "We can't come. It's just a

little bit too expensive, so we're just gonna go right up the street."



Q: How did Nicole inform you of that? By telephone?



A: I think so, yeah. Yeah, I called.



Q: Did she call you?



A: No. I called her because I wanted to get some special stuff ready

and everything.



Q: So it's fair to say that as of the 12th,  the morning of the 12th

of June, it was still your understanding that the family was all going

to Jackson's. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you had made appropriate reservations for them there?



A: Yes.



Q: And what kind of reservations did you make?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Why don't you ask him the question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Your lawyer is comical. He's trying to make me laugh. He's trying

to actually get me off track.



MR. LEONARD: How could I do that with you, Dan.



MR. PETROCELLI: You're very good at it, too. I'm doing a very poor job

of --



MR. LEONARD: You're doing an excellent job.



MR. PETROCELLI: -- staying focused here.



Q: Anyway --



MR. LEONARD: What kind of reservation? Do you mean how many people did

he make a reservation for?



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it's a little broader than that --



MR. LEONARD: Come on.



MR. PETROCELLI: -- but let's ask your lawyer's  questions.



Q: How many people?



A: I don't remember. I remember --



Q: That's why I didn't ask that. Okay. You don't remember.



A: No. I -- no.



Q: A large group, though. Right?



A: Yeah. It was just -- yeah, I was --



Q: And you were expecting your father to be there also. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: I was expecting whoever to show up.



Q: Including your father. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: Including Sydney. Right?



A: Oh, absolutely.



Q: Including Justin. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Including Nicole. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: And Nicole's family. Right?



A: I didn't know -- parts of Nicole's family. I didn't know who was

coming --



Q: You knew Lou and Judy were coming. Right?



A: Yeah, I knew those two were.



Q: You didn't know about the sisters. Right?



A: I didn't know if they were coming.



Q: And their children.



A: I didn't know about that.



Q: Okay. What kind of restaurant is Jackson's?



A: What do you mean?



Q: What do they serve there?



A: What kind of food?



Q: Yeah.



A: It was --



MR. LEONARD: Good food.



THE WITNESS: Yeah. It was California/French type food.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you say sushi before?



A: No. I was sous- --



MR. LEONARD: Sous. Sous chef.



THE WITNESS: The assistant to the chef.



MR. PETROCELLI: Oh.



MR.LEONARD: You don't know what sous chef means?



THE WITNESS: S-o-u-s.



MR. PETROCELLI: No, I don't.



Q: Where were you when you had this phone call with Nicole?



A: I'm not sure. I think I might have been at the apartment, at my

house, at my apartment.



Q: Let me go back to my notes and see where you were living at that

time.



A: Sycamore.



Q: You were living on Sycamore.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And you were no longer living with [Name Deleted].



A: No, sir.



Q: Was [Name Deleted] going to be at this recital dinner at Jackson's?



A: No. She didn't know anything about it, I don't think. I don't

remember if she knew anything about it or not.



Q: Okay. What time did you leave to go to work that day?



MR. LEONARD: "That day"?



MR. PETROCELLI: The 12th.



THE WITNESS: 3:00 -- I usually got to be there around 3:00 o'clock.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Where is Jackson's located?



A: It's located on Beverly between La Cienega and Robertson.



MR. LEONARD: I think you have to sit up.



THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. Between -- I'm sorry -- Doheny and

Robertson. Swall is the closest cross street.



MS. ROIT: Impossible to get into for lunch.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



THE WITNESS: What?



MS. ROIT: Impossible to get into for lunch.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You think you left to go there around 2:30 or so?



A: Probably.  Sunday, I was probably -- yeah, around 2:30 or so.



Q: Did you see Nicole at any day -- at any time on June 12?



A: No.



Q: Did you see her at any time on June 11?



A: No, I don't think so.



Q: Did you speak to her on June 11, June 11 being Saturday?



A: I think that that's when we were talking  about the reservations,

about coming into the restaurant.



Q: You told me -- I thought you said before that the conversation when

she told you she's not going to go there, to Jackson's, occurred on

the 12th.



MR. LEONARD: But he also told you that the previous day there was a

conversation about reservations. That's the state of his testimony.



MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What is it?



A: What is what?



Q: What is your testimony on this?



A: I talked to her on, let's see, Friday or Saturday about coming into

the restaurant, and she called me the day of the recital or I talked

to her the day of the recital and she said that she couldn't --



Q: Okay.



A: -- because it was too expensive.



Q: But when you talked on the Friday or  Saturday --



A: You said the 11th.



Q: Excuse me. Let me finish my question.



A: Sorry.



Q: Let me finish my question.



A: Okay.



Q: When you spoke to her on Friday or  Saturday --



A: Okay.



Q: -- about the family going to Jackson's after the recital --



A: Yes.



Q: -- she did not then tell you that the family would not be going to

Jackson's. True?



A: This was what date, now?



Q: On the Friday or Saturday.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And it was only until Sunday, on the 12th,when she told you

for the first time that the family would not be going to Jackson's.

True?



A: Correct.



Q: Now let's go back to the Friday or Saturday conversation. Can you

give me your best recollection as to which of the two days it was?



A: No.



Q: Did you work that Saturday, June 11, from  3:00 to closing?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you work that Friday --



A: Yes.



Q: -- from 3:00 to closing?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you have the conversation with Nicole while you were at work?



A: No. I think I was home.



Q: So it would have been before 3:00 o'clock?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Who called whom?



A: I don't recall.



Q: Tell me the substance of the conversation.



A: It could have been -- I don't know what it was. When we got on the

subject of the recital, we spoke about -- that's when -- when we got

on the subject of the recital, that's when we spoke about dinner

arrangement or whatever, but I don't remember why I called in the

first place.



Q: Okay. And can you recall anything else --



A: Or if she called in the first place.



Q: Can you recall anything else that Nicole and you discussed other

than the dinner arrangement?



A: No, I don't think there was anything else discussed.



Q: Tell me what was said by Nicole and you  regarding the dinner

arrangements in this conversation which occurred either on Friday or

Saturday June 10 or June 11.



A: Well, I think she wanted me to go, and I said I couldn't. I

couldn't get out of it. And I said, "Why don't you guys come into the

restaurant?" And she thought it was a great idea. So we were getting

all excited about her coming to the restaurant,  or the kids coming to

the restaurant, the whole family coming to the restaurant. I was

excited, because I didn't want to have to miss another recital, and,

like I said, I felt like finally, you know, I'd be able to take care

of everything.



Q: You had had a previous conversation with her about going to the

recital when you suggested that she come to Jackson's also. Correct?

You previously  testified that it was a long time before the recital.



A: No. It's just a standing -- everybody  knows that the recital's

coming up, but I never said anything about coming to the restaurant.



Q: Well, before you testified that when she first informed you about

the recital, it was long before the recital, not the day before. True?



A: Yeah, but we never said anything about coming to the restaurant.



Q: Okay. Now, in that conversation you --



MR. LEONARD: Which conversation?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: The conversation when she first informed  you of the recital. You

told me --



A: She's never informed me of the recital.



Q: Excuse me. My question's not over.



A: I'm sorry.



Q: You previously testified that you were first informed of this

recital not one or two days before, but well in advance of it.

Correct?



A: Right. Right.



Q: And you had a telephone conversation with Nicole wherein she

informed you of the recital and invited you to attend. Right?



A: Right. Yeah.



Q: You told her at that time you could not attend because it was on a

Sunday and you worked on Sunday. Correct?



A: No, not necessarily, no.



Q: Well, what do you mean, "not necessarily"? Did you or did you not

say that?



A: No. No, not -- when she told me a long time before that her recital

is coming up, I didn't say I couldn't go. I just -- it was like, "Oh,

okay  her recital is coming up."  I never said I was going  to go or

anything like that. Finally, when she reminded me soon before, I knew

I had to work on Sundays; I couldn't go, so I said, "Why don't you

just come into the restaurant."



Q: Is it your testimony that the first time that you and Nicole

discussed that she would come and take the family to Jackson's was on

this Friday or Saturday before the 12th of June?



A: Yes.



Q: And she thought that was a good idea, and so did you. Correct?



A: Yes. Yes.



Q: And that's what the two of you discussed. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you then proceeded to make a reservation at Jackson's for the

family. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Did you and Nicole discuss your getting a ticket or how you

would get a ticket to the recital at any time?



A: No, I don't think so. I don't remember.



Q: Is the first time that you informed Nicole that you would not be

attending the recital on the 10th or 11th of June?



A: I believe so.



Q: Do you know whether she had procured a  ticket for you in the

meantime?



A: No, I don't.



Q: Did anybody ever talk to you about a ticket?



A: No.



Q: Cathy Randa? O.J. Simpson? Gigi? Anybody?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you and Nicole discuss the menu in this conversation?



A: No, sir.



Q: What would be served and so forth?



A: No.



Q: Had Nicole ever been to Jackson's?



A: No.



Q: Did she ask you what kind of food was  served there?



A: Yeah.



Q: In this conversation --



A: No, not in this conversation. Before.



Q: Before she had?



A: Yeah. I say, "I'm working at Jackson's." "What kind of food do they

have?" I answered the question.



Q: Did she answer the question?



A: No. Like a long time before, when I got the job in the first place.



Q: When did you first start working there?



A: Let's see. It would have to be March of -- March or February of

'94, I think. I think.



Q: Okay. And --



A: Or -- no. '93.



Q: '93. So from March of 1993 till the time of Nicole's death, to your

knowledge she had never been Jackson's.



A: No.



Q: True?



A: Positive.



Q: True?



A: To my knowledge she's never been there.



Q: Okay. And did she ever tell you whether she had gone there?



A: No. I wanted her to come. This was -- she finally was gonna come.



Q: So you and her had talked from time to time about --



A: Yeah. I would like for her to taste my food and taste all my stuff.



Q: And you were going to cook the food.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you were going to cook the food for the family when they came

after the recital. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay.



MR. LEONARD: I need to take a break.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We will take a break then.



MR.LEONARD: With the teacher's permission.



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, permission granted.



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. l. The time is

approximately 11:27, and we are off the record.



(Recess.)



THE V1DE0GRAPHER: We are on the record. The  time is approximately 11

:44.This is the beginning of tape No. 2.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Let me go back and pick up a little bit of chronology on your

background. After the year at USC, what did you do?



A: With my life?



Q: Yes.



A: The whole year? The summer -- the rest  of the summer I lived with

a girlfriend --



Q: Who was that?



A: Cici. After that I moved in with my mother and worked.



Q: Did you move into a house with your mother?



A: Yeah. Yeah, first.



Q: And where did you work?



A: I worked at Atlas Bar and Grill.



Q: As what?



A: Then I was a busboy.



Q: Full time?



A: Yeah.



Q: And how long did you work there?



A: I think I worked there about seven months.



Q: What year is this?



A: '89 --



Q: What did you do --



A: -- to '90. Sorry?



Q: What did you do next?



A: I moved on to the Border Grill in Santa Monica, working.



Q: What's the name of the place?



A: Border Grill.



Q: Border Grill? And what years there?



MR.LEONARD: Did you ask him what he did?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What did do you there?



A: I started cooking. I started to cook then.



Q: Chef.



A: No, I wasn't the chef yet. I was working my way there. I wish I

could start being the chef.



Q: I am not familiar with the hierarchy of cookers.



A: You just don't become a lawyer. You  gotta go to school and stuff.

Right? You gotta start somewhere.



Q: This is true.



A: Same thing with, you know, with cook -- I just started cooking at

the Border Grill, and the year --



Q: Sort of like being a paralegal, I guess. Okay. So you started

cooking. What  years were you at Border Grill?



A: I was there for the next -- after that  the next probably seven,

eight months.



Q: 1990?



A: Yes.



Q: What did you do then?



A: I was working, living at a --



Q: I want you to do this in chronological order, if you could, please.



A: You need a job resume? I mean --



Q: Well, your jobs --



MR. LEONARD: Just keep going:



THE WITNESS: Oh, okay.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Your jobs and whether you're going to school. I would --



A: Okay. Yeah. I was living -- I was living at my mother's.



Q: Yes.



A: I moved into the apartment at some point around the corner.



Q: Yes.



A: She had the apartment. I just finally cleaned it up and moved in.



MR. LEONARD: I think Mr. Petrocelli is interested in your employment

history at this point.



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, that's fine. He was just doing it by reference

to where he was living.



THE WITNESS: Oh, sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can continue.



A: I was working at the Border Grill, and  then I changed jobs --

after about seven months, seven, eight months, I think, I changed jobs

to the -- to Bravo Cucina in Santa Monica, couple blocks away, and

worked there for a little bit over a year, maybe two years, I think,

and after that restaurant --



Q: What did you do there?



A: I was cooking there as well.



Q: What years were these?



A: Let's see. That would be going --



Q: '91-92?



A: Not to '92, no. So it would be going to '91 maybe. It would be just

a year then. It wouldn't be '91. It would be '90. It would be '89 and

'90.



Q: '89 and '90?



A: Or '90 and --



Q: When you had the assault at the  Revival Cafe, were you working at

that cafe?



A: I was working at the cafe, yes, so let's go from there back.



Q: According to my document here, you were working at the Revival Cafe

in December of 1992.



A: Okay.



Q: If that helps you at all.



A: Yeah, that does. Thanks.



Q: After Bravo Cucina, then where?



A: After Bravo was -- where did I work after Bravo. I went to Cafe

Laboheme in West Hollywood. I was there for only a couple of months.



Q: Cooking?



A: Cooking. After there -- after there I believe I went to Revival.



Q: Revival Cafe?



A: Yeah, and I helped to open up that place with Paul and somebody, a

couple other people.



MR. LEONARD: You have to speak up.



THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I -- should I repeat it?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Helped open up that place with Paul and some other people. "Paul"

being Paul Goldberg --



A: Yeah.



Q: -- the man who --



A: Yeah.



Q: -- you assaulted.



A: Yeah, the man where we got into a fight.  I just didn't press

charges. He did.



Q: Okay. How long were you cooking at -- were you a cook or a chef at

the Revival Cafe?



A: Yeah, I was more of a consultant. I hired a kitchen staff for him.



Q: Okay. How long were you there?



A: It was just three months. I was just there to consult --



Q: And that was --



A: -- and to help open the place.



Q: That was during the time frame that included December of 1992,

according to the --



A: Yeah.



Q: -- complaint of Mr. Goldberg.



A: Well, that would have been -- yeah, I guess that would have been

the latter part of it, so it would have been a couple months before

then.  Right?



Q: Okay. And then after the Revival Cafe, what did you do?



A: After Revival I went to Jackson's, I think.



Q: Now we are in the beginning of 1993.



A: Yeah. That would be about right.



Q: And when did you -- what was your position at Jackson's again?



A: I started off as a line cook. There's a line with a bunch of

different people.



Q: Then what?



A: I moved up to the sous chef,  to the assistant.



Q: How do you spell that?



MR. LEONARD: S-o-u-s.



MR. PETROCELLI: S-o-u-s chef. Okay.



THE WITNESS: Uh-huh.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is that the position that you left when you left Jackson's?



A: No. Actually, I was the chef when I left.



Q: Okay. When did you leave Jackson's?



A: About six, seven months ago. No, no, not  seven. About six.



Q: November of 19- --



A: I'm sorry. November. November --



Q: Of 1995?



A:  -5.



Q: Were you fired?



A: No. I left.



Q: You just quit?



A: Yeah.



Q: And where did you go after Jackson's?



MR. LEONARD: If that's his present place of  employment, I would like

to also write that down.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is that a secret?



A: I would like for not everybody to be coming to my job. That would

be nice.



Q: That's fine. Okay. Could you --



MR. LEONARD: Why don't you ask him the question if that's where he's

working now.



MR. PETROCELLI: Is what?



Q: Is the next place --



MR. LEONARD: Yeah.



Q: -- after Jackson's where you are now working?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did you go work at that place right after November of 1995?



A: No. I've been working there about two months now.



Q: So you were unemployed for three or four months?



A: About three months.



Q: How did you support yourself?



A: What do you mean? I had money from Jackson's. I have a savings

account.



Q: Does your dad support you?



A: No.



Q: Does he give you any money?



A: No. Not me, no.



Q: What do you mean, not you?



A: Just what I said: Not me. I'm a self-supported person. As a matter

of fact, I pride myself on being self-supported.



Q: How long have you been self-supported?



A: Since we got this busboy job here. Since I got the busboy job at --



Q: Atlas Bar and Grill?



A: Atlas Bar and Grille, yeah.



Q: So since the late '80s you've been self-supported?



A: Well, in high school. While in high school. I mean, I've been

working ever since I was 14.



Q: Your dad provides you no money for support?



A: Yeah, of course. In high school he did. I was living under his

roof.



Q: Last five years?



A: No. I've asked a couple of times if I -- you know, I've been in a

little bit of trouble and needed to pay the rent or something like

that and asked for a couple bucks.



Q: Do you owe him any money?



A: No. I mean...



Q: What did you do between November of  '95 and a couple of months

ago?



A: Catered private parties and stuff like that.



Q: Did you work for a company?



A: No, not -- no.



Q: You did it on your own?



A: Yeah.



Q: During the course of your dad's criminal trial, you were working at

Jackson's?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: The place that you currently work, what is your position?



A: I'm a line cook.



Q: And when did you start there? Two, three months ago?



A: Two months ago, not three.



Q: You work full time?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Why don't you write it down on a  piece of paper.



MR. LEONARD: Can we use your -- I'm running out of paper. Can we use

yours?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. I'll give you a pad if you run out of paper.



MR. LEONARD: Thanks, Dan. You're unbelievable.



THE WITNESS: Can I borrow your pen?



MR. LEONARD: That you can borrow. He wants the address, name, phone

number, I guess.



MR.PETROCELLI: Yeah, name and address --



THE WITNESS: I don't know the phone number and the address. I could

tell you where it is.



(Witness complies.)



MR. PETROCELLI: You can stamp that, David, as the next exhibit in

order.



(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 182 was marked for identification by the reporter

and was retained by Mr. Petrocelli.)



MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you go to school at all after USC?



A: No, sir.



Q: What about culinary school?



A: No. I just started on-the-job training kind of thing.



Q: So you've taken no courses in school of any kind after USC?



A: No.



Q: That's true. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. You hold no degrees of any kind?



A: No, sir.



MR. LEONARD: Other than high school.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: High school diploma?



A: Diploma, yeah.



Q: Were you ever interviewed by any lawyers or investigators retained

by O.J. Simpson's criminal defense team?



A: Never interviewed, no.



Q: They never asked you where were you on the night of June 12 or

anything like that?



A: I think maybe once. No, I don't think so. Well, yeah, I guess so.



Q: Who asked you?



A: Mr. Cochran. I think. I think he might have asked where I was and

whatever.



Q: When was this when he asked you these questions?



A: Sometime early on in the trial. I don't remember exactly when.



Q: You and he met alone?



A: In his office.



Q: He asked you to come in to see him?



A: I think he asked me and my sister to come in to see him, just to

have a conversation with him.



Q: And how long was your conversation with him?



A: No more than 10 minutes.



Q: Did you have a separate conversation from your sister's?



A: No.



Q: You were in together?



A: Yes.



Q: And what -- tell me about that conversation.



A: It was just a general conversation.



Q: What did he ask you?



A: He didn't really ask too many questions.  He just -- besides, "How

are you?" you know, "How's  your mother?"



Q: Why were you brought down to his office?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Why were you to your knowledge asked to go to this meeting at his

office?



A: To talk to him.



Q: About what?



A: How we were, how we were holding up. I know Mr. Cochran from before

this case.



Q: How did you know him?



A: Social event.



Q: He was a friend of yours?



A: Yeah. I wanted to meet the guy who was going to defend my father I

mean...



Q: This was before the trial started?



A: Yeah.



Q: Were you interviewed by anybody else?



A: No.



Q: Any members of the prosecution team, the District Attorney's Office

--



A: No.



Q: -- or the Los Angeles Police Department?



A: No, sir.



Q: Have you read any discovery materials, deposition transcripts,

trial transcripts, any other documents from the criminal or the civil

case?



A: No, I haven't.



Q: Nothing?



A: Nothing.



Q: Okay. Have you been briefed by anybody about this case or the

criminal case other than your short conversation with Dan Leonard?



A: No. Uh-uh.



Q: Have you watched the videotape put out by O.J. Simpson?



A: Yeah, I just recently saw that.



Q: When?



A: About a month ago.



Q: Who were you with when you saw it?



A: I was by myself.



Q: Was that the first time you saw it?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Were you present during the making of it?



A: No.



Q: Not at all?



A: No.



Q: Did you talk to your father, after you  saw it, about it?



A: No, I didn't.  I think I need to explain something about  the

present during the making of it. I came home one  time -- I came home

when they were doing it, saw all  the cameras and everything, and

left. So if you're talking about as far as being present, I never --

once  I saw all the action going on, I turned around and  left,

because I'm just not down with all that camera stuff.



Q: You're not what?



A: I don't -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I don't like that. I don't really

like cameras and all that crap. I think it's a bunch of bull.



Q: Cameras?



A: Well, you know, this case and everything kinda made me sick of

cameras, so --



Q: The criminal case?



A: I didn't really want to be around all that, so I decided to leave.



Q: Did your father consult with you about the making of this video?



A: No, he didn't.



Q: When was the first time you found out that it was being made?



A: Then.



Q: When you walked upon the scene of camera equipment and camera

crews?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did you ask someone, "What's going on  here?"



A: Yeah.



Q: Who?



A: I don't remember.



Q: What was the answer you got?



A: "We're doing the video." I remember hearing something about the

video, so I was aware of what they were talking about.



Q: What do you understand the purpose of the making of that video to

be?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer



MR. LEONARD: Vague.



If you know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Well, when he objects, you can still answer. This is --



MR. LEONARD: He knows that, and he has been doing it consistently.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah, just so you understand and don't change your answers based on

any of the objections.



MR. LEONARD: I object to that statement.



MR. PETROCELLI: Some witnesses may not  understand that they're

supposed to --



MR. LEONARD: Are you suggesting that he has changed any answers? And

if so, let's find out right now. You show me where you think he has

changed an answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know if he has or not. I just don't want him

to.



MR. LEONARD: Well, he's not doing it. Okay?



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, that would be nice. I don't want him to be

coached.



Q: Anyway, can you answer the question, please?



MR. LEONARD: Well, Dan, you want to repeat the question, because I

think it's very vague, and I don't  know how he would know that,

but...



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What is your understanding about why that videotape was made?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, calls for speculation, lack of

foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: My understanding is for two reasons: One reason being the fact that

he wanted to explain his side of the story, one reason. Another reason

is that financially he has a right to earn money as much as anybody

else does. Two reasons.



Q: On what do you base those reasons? Conversations with him?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Were you troubled at all when you found out that your father was

going to make this video?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. I don't know how that could possibly be

relevant to any issue in this case or lead to any relevant evidence.



MR. PETROCELLI: The fact that --



MR. LEONARD: I mean, seriously.



MR. PETROCELLI: The fact that O.J. Simpson made this video to me is

perhaps the most probative evidence of his guilt.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I don't share your opinion, but that's not what you

asked.



MR.PETROCELLI: It doesn't make a difference if you and I agree. It

goes to consciousness of guilt.



Q: You may --



MR. LEONARD: But you are asking him if he was troubled. How could that

lead to any probative material, relevant evidence?



MR. PETROCELLI: Because the next question is going to be an

appropriate follow-up question I do not  want to preview, which I am

sure you would agree would be an appropriate question.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am objecting, but go ahead.



THE WITNESS: What's the question?



MR. LEONARD: The question was, were you  troubled by the making of the

video?



THE WITNESS: I wasn't troubled by it, no.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you have a conversation with O.J. Simpson about it?



A: No, I didn't have a conversation with O.J. Simpson about it.



Q: Did you ever say, "Dad, why are you doing this?"



A: No.



Q: Okay. But he came and told you why he was doing it. He gave you

those two reasons that you told me.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Did you participate with your father in going to Nicole's

grave site to take photographs --



A: No.



Q: -- that were sold to tabloids?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: I don't know anything about that.



MR. LEONARD: -- lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you know whether your father has had photographs of Nicole's

grave site sold to the  tabloids, or sold to any organization, for

that  matter?



A: Well, the Browns do. I don't know about my dad, no.



Q: Well, I move to strike your answer regarding the Browns since it's

non responsive to anything I remotely asked you.



A: I apologize.



MR. LEONARD: I thought we were reserving motions to strike.



MR. PETROCELLI: I know, but --



MR.LEONARD: Are we changing the rules at this point?



MR. PETROCELLI: No. That was inappropriate.



MR. LEONARD: No, but I want to know if you're changing the rules.



MR. PETROCELLI: If you want to attack the  Browns, you may do so at

your own time.



THE WITNESS: I don't want to. That's my family.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Exactly. I don't know why you are talking about the Browns.



A: Well, you're talking about my dad.



Q: That's right, not the Browns.  So you want to answer my question?



A: Knee jerk. Sorry. What's your question?



Q: The question was whether you are aware of whether or not your

father, O.J. Simpson, has been selling or has sold photographs of

Nicole's grave site.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. You can answer.



THE WITNESS: I -- I was never aware of it until you just said it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You have no knowledge of that?



A: No.



Q: Did you participate in any photographs  following your father's

release from prison?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. I don't  understand that.



MR.PETROCELLI: Well, that's a good objection.



MR.LEONARD: Well, thanks. Was that the only one so far that was good?



MR. PETROCELLI: No. There was one other, but  I'm not going to tell

you which one.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. Okay.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you know whether your father sold any  photographs to anyone

following his arrest from following his release from prison?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You're looking at me like you're not supposed to answer. What --



A: You know, because I don't know who is winning here or who has won.



Q: Exactly. Exactly.



A: You guys are like two little kids.



Q: Let me explain something to you. After he objects, you simply

ignore everything that he says and you answer the question.



A: Okay.



Q: Unless he instructs you otherwise. Could you please direct your

client to do so?



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, he knows that. He hasn't  done anything --



MR. PETROCELLI: He does not appear to know that.



MR. LEONARD: No. You are characterizing how he looks. Okay? We have a

video camera that's going  to capture that --



MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely.



MR. LEONARD: -- so I don't appreciate your  characterizations of what

you think he looks like. And you know what the truth is in the case,

and you also have this power to know, you know, how he looks.



MR. PETROCELLI: And you know what the truth is also.



MR. LEONARD: So let's go.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



Q: Did you understand that you are to answer the questions --



A: Okay.



Q:  -- whether or not he objects, unless he, your lawyer, tells you

not to answer.



A: Okay. Thank you.



Q: Okay? Just so you understand that. The objections are for the court

to worry about later on. You are not to be concerned about them.



A: Understood.



Q: Okay. There is no judge here. That's why --



A: That's why I get a little confused and I wonder what am I supposed

to do. Watching too much TV.



Q: And it was that confusion that was apparent to me, and that's why

I'm responding. Okay?



A: Okay. Can we repeat -- can you repeat the question?



Q: Yes. Are you aware of any photographs that have been shot or taken

involving you, your father, your family, after your father's release

from prison, that were then sold for money?



A: Yeah.



Q: Which ones?



A: Okay. For a magazine, but I don't remember the name of the

magazine.



Q: The Star?



A: Might have been it.



Q: Okay. And did you sit for some of those photographs?



A: Yeah, a couple of them.



Q: Where were the photographs taken?



A: At a friend's house. Friend of my father's.



Q: Whose house?



A: Don Ohlmeyer's house.



Q: Is he a good friend of yours also?



A: Of mine?



Q: Yes.



A: Yeah, I mean, I think he's a nice guy.



Q: When were those photographs at Don Ohlmeyer's house taken?



A: Not too long after, so November maybe.



Q: Of 1995?



A: -5.



Q: And who was present besides yourself?



A: My sister, my father, Mr. Ohlmeyer. It was his house. His assistant

-- I don't know her name -- and a photographer.



Q: Okay. Did you receive any money?



A: Yeah, I did.



Q: How much?



A: $25,000.



Q: How long were you there?



A: About half hour, 45 minutes, maybe an hour.



Q: And for the half hour to an hour, you got  $25,000?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. What were the pictures of ?



A: I think there's a picture of us sitting around a table eating, a

picture of the three of us,  my mother -- my sister, my father and I

standing on some stairs. Just took a bunch of...



Q: Was Marquerite Simpson there?



A: No.



Q: How much did Arnelle get?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Same as me, I believe. I didn't see it.



MR. PETROCELL1:



Q: $25,000?



A: Yes.



Q: And how much did O.J. Simpson get?



A: I don't know.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELL1:



Q: Who gave you the check?



A: It came in the mail.



Q: It's from the organization who took -- who is printing the picture,

or was the check from your father or some intermediary?



A: It was I think they probably mailed a lump sum to my father, and he

-- I don't remember. I don't remember exactly what was on the check.



Q: How much other money have you made as a  result of these murders?



A: Nothing.



Q: Just the 25,000?



A: Yeah, that.



Q: Have you been approached?



A: Yeah.



Q: By whom?



A: Everyone.



Q: You mean tabloid organizations?



A: Yes. Talk shows, you name it.



Q: Okay. For money?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Have you -- do you have any plans  to earn any more money or

make any other deals --



A: No.



Q:  -- with regard to this whole aftermath of the murder?



A: No.



Q: Do you have any current agreements in  place by which you are to

receive any further money  beyond --



A: Didn't like it the first time.  I'm sorry.



MR. LEONARD: You have to let Mr. Petrocelli --



THE WITNESS: Sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELL1:



Q: What didn't you like about receiving the $25,000?



A: I just -- I didn't feel clean. It didn't feel right.



Q: And why did you keep the money?



A: I needed it.



Q: Did you tell your father you didn't feel  right; you didn't like

this?



A: I said that I wasn't gonna do it anymore. I said I just wasn't

gonna do -- be a part of anything like that.



Q: And what did he then say to you?



A: He said "Okay."



Q: Do you know whether -- did he tell you what his feelings about

taking the money were?



A: Taking what?



Q: The money. The money. Money for these photographs.



A: Yeah.



Q: What did he say?



A: I told you before.



Q: You said you didn't like how it felt, "didn't feel clean." What did

he say to you about how it felt to him, if anything?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of -- well, okay.



THE WITNESS: He said that with as much money  as everybody else has

made off of him for everything  and as much money as he's lost because

of this, and I believe rightly so, because he's not -- he hasn't done

anything, he has a right to get some of his money back. This is the

only -- he doesn't feel necessarily good about it, the fact -- the

reason why he has to do it, but he's got to do it. He can't just  go

out to Hertz and get a job because of people have called him a killer

and says that he's murdered Sydney and Justin's mother. So he can't

just go get a job; he's not Mr. Squeaky Clean anymore because of

everything that everybody's called him, so he needs to get money the

way he can get his money.



BY MR.PETROCELLI:



Q: I know that's how you feel, but is that what he told you?



A: You asked me for --



Q: No. My question was what he said to you.



MR.LEONARD: If anything.



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, if anything.



THE WITNESS: Generally -- generally it was -- that was my

understanding of what he said.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Do you know whether he has sat for photographs for money

other than on that one occasion at Mr. Ohlmeyer's home?



A: I don't know.



Q: You don't know?



A: I don't know if he has.



Q: You have no knowledge?



A: I don't know if he has for money sat for photographs, no.



Q: Or has he sat for photographs for any other company or

organization?



A: I don't know.



Q: You don't have any knowledge at all?



A: No.



Q: You don't have to have been there. You could have heard from

somebody else.



A: Exactly. And that's why I said, "I don't  know." I don't know what

he's done for charity. I  don't know what he's done for money.



Q: You have no information on whether he has participated in sitting

for photographs other than on that one occasion.



MR. LEONARD: Well, now you have changed it, because before you said

for companies or something like that. Are you talking about whether he

has been photographed by anyone?



MR. PETROCELLI: No, no, no. I mean where someone comes into the house

and takes photographs. He may not know the financial arrangements, but

he may  know that such photographs were taken.



MR. LEONARD: But you are limiting it to you know, media or entities

that are -- I mean, seriously --



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: -- because I can tell you that, you know, he's probably

had thousands of photographs taken from, you know, people in the

street.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you understand my question?



A: I do, and that's what I said: I don't know. I don't know what he

got money for or what he didn't. I don't know.



Q: Okay. Besides these photographs, what money are you aware that your

father, O.J. Simpson, has made as a result of these murders?



MR. LEONARD: Object. "As a result of the murders." But go ahead.



THE WITNESS: I don't know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What deals has he made?



A: Besides the tape?



Q: The videotape, you mean?



A: Yes.



Q: Yes, besides the videotape and besides the money received at the --

from the Ohlmeyer photographs.



A: I think autographs. Autographs.



Q: He has sold his autograph?



A: Yeah. Autographed balls.



Q: Do you know whether O.J. Simpson has  signed memorabilia from the

trial, such as pictures of the Bronco and things like that?



A: Pictures of the Bronco, I don't know about that.



Q: Pieces of evidence from the trial?



MR.LEONARD: Object. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: I don't know. I see things on TV, but I don't know what -- to

believe what's on TV or not. So I may see Home Shopping Network. They

say they got a  football card signed from him. I don't know if it's

true or if it's not.



Q: I am not talking about sports memorabilia. I am talking about

things that have to do --



A: That have to do with the case. I'm sorry.



No, I don't know anything about that.



Q: You said previously that if no one was available to buzz you in at

Rockingham, you would climb the fence.



A: Uh-huh. Yes.



Q: Where have you ever climbed the fence at Rockingham?



A: What do you mean, "where"?



Q: Name all the locations.



A: Just down on Ashford, there's a tree that comes through the wall,

and you just kinda -- it makes  it easier to hop the fence that way.

The tree comes through the wall and then forks. You can just grab on

and hop over. I've been doing it ever since I was a  little kid. That

was actually a shortcut to get to my friend's house, so...



Q: If you wanted to hop onto the property at some other location, not

on Ashford, how could you do so?



A: You talking about the whole house?



Q: Yes. Let's say you wanted to sneak in so no one would see you.

Let's assume there was a person sitting on Ashford, and you didn't

want that person to see you, and it was at nighttime, and you wanted

to get into the house. How could you access the  property?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation.



MR. PETROCELLI: I thought I gave you a pretty good foundation.



Q: Anyway, you can answer.



MR.LEONARD: And to the extent you are giving him a hypothetical, it's

an incomplete one. I don't know what you're doing. But go ahead.



THE WITNESS: There's an adjoining gate from our next-door neighbors,

our old -- former next-door neighbors, the Von Vatts, on Ashford and

Bristol.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: That adjoining gate is where the tennis courts meet?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: On either side of that gate there is a  tennis court --



A: Yeah.



Q: -- one on the Von Watts property, one on the Simpson property?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: So -- and how could you get onto the Von Watts property?



A: You could --



Q: Just walk up?



A: Well --



Q: Let's say you didn't want them to know.  Let's say you were a

burglar, okay, and you didn't want them to know. Could you just run up

-- run into the Von Watts' backyard from the front of their house and

then go through that gate and get to Rockingham?



A: I'm not a burglar. I don't know. I couldn't tell you.



Q: Are there any other places, other than that fence, that adjoining

gate on the Von Watts-Simpson boundary line, by which you could get to

Rockingham?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. I mean, that's vague.  It's overbroad. You

mean at any point in time?



MR. PETROCELLI: Nighttime.



MR. LEONARD: Oh, nighttime. Now we are at nighttime?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. We don't want to be seen at Ashford either.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. I object. This is --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



MR.LEONARD: I don't know what purpose this is serving. Go ahead.



THE WITNESS: You're asking if a normal person  wanted to break into a

house --



MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Person of your father's height and strength and build.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. I am going to object. You know, it's an incomplete

hypothetical, if that's what  you're asking him. You are asking for an

opinion.



MR. PETROCELLI: Why are you so concerned about  this?



MR. LEONARD: I'm not concerned. I am  concerned that the questions are

appropriate. I am  doing what I'm supposed to do as a lawyer.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. You've made your  objections.



MR. LEONARD: He can answer. I am not  instructing him not to answer.



MR. PETROCELLI: You are taking up a lot of  time, though.



Q: Go ahead.



MR.LEONARD: That from Dan Petrocelli? Go ahead.



THE WITNESS: Can you repeat it?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Why? You don't remember? Is it necessary --



A: Do you not want to repeat it?



Q: I don't want to waste time. You want me to repeat it, I will.



A: I asked you to see if you would, but if you don't want to, then I

guess we're gonna be stuck. You don't want to waste time.



Q: No, I don't.



A: This is wasting time.



Q: I agree.



A: If you could just repeat it, I could answer it.



Q: Okay. I'll repeat it again. Okay?



A: Please, sir.



Q: If you wanted to get onto the property and not be detected by a

person sitting or standing out at the Ashford gate, how could you get

over the fence and get onto the property --



MR. LEONARD: Same objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- to the Rockingham house?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



HEWITNESS: Assuming you're a burglar or something like that, I guess

you could do it any way you wanted to, anyway you wanted to, if you

needed to bad enough. Right?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You could climb the fence?



A: Climb the fence?



Q: Yeah. The fence could be physically climbed at any point --



A: The wall? Or -- I mean, you talking about four sides of the

property. You got to be more specific.



Q: Okay. What are the four sides?



A: You got Rockingham, Ashford, and you got the next-door neighbors of

the Von Watts and whoever's next door to them.



Q: The Salingers?



A: No, it's not the Salingers. It would be Bristol, their backyard.



Q: Bristol.



A: And then you got the Salingers that are next door to us.



Q: Could you get over from the Salinger property onto your property?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for a conclusion, lack of foundation,

vague, calls for speculation, incomplete hypothetical. I think that's 

it. You can answer.



THE WITNESS: At some parts I'm sure you could.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Which parts?



A: Toward the gate, Rockingham gate, I bet you could get over there if

you needed to bad enough. And that's about it. Toward the front --

toward the front part of the estate.



Q: I will show you a map, Mr. Simpson. This is -- this exhibit has

been marked various times. The latest incarnation of it is Exhibit

179. We may end up marking it again.



MR. LEONARD: You going to mark it again?



MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know. Maybe. We may not have to. It's also

Exhibit 100, I think, too.



Q: You see this sketch of the Rockingham property?



A: Uh-huh. Yes.



Q: Now, this part here where I am pointing to, which is all darkened

(Indicating), which is immediately to the -- immediately south of the

Rockingham gate, is the Salinger property. Correct?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And the Salinger property runs the boundary line of the Rockingham

property. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Now, where were you just mentioning or just referring to a few

minutes ago in your testimony that one could go onto the Salinger

property and get onto the Rockingham property?



MR. LEONARD: Just -- I have the same -- registering the same

objections. He can answer.



THE WITNESS: Okay. I would assume if they  wanted to jump over, they

could jump over anywhere from here to here (Indicating). It's just a

plain fence.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Now, could you --



A: I am sorry. From here to here (Indicating). From Rockingham --



Q: Yes.



A: -- where the gate begins, to probably just to where the garage or

where the back door is.



Q: We will mark this again, this exhibit, so what I want you to do is

I am going to start drawing a blue -- with blue pen the line starting

at the Rockingham gate,  and I will go all the way down to where you

just mentioned. Tell me when to stop.



A: Right about there (Indicating).



Q: Okay. Right about there (Indicating)?



A: Maybe a little bit further. Maybe around  here (Indicating). Yeah,

well, here right where this wall starts (Indicating).



Q: Okay.



A: That's about as far as you can  probably -- as you can --



Q: Now, why would it be not possible to climb the fence from the

Salinger property onto the Rockingham property after that point where

we just stopped?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: 'Cause there's a succession of  trees that are probably

about six inches apart and probably about four inches in diameter that

are right -- I mean that go from here all the way back (Indicating).

So, I mean, you'd have to be a pretty thin dude or female to slip

through them. And they got branches.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is there a carport on the Salinger  property?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: Are you able to get on that carport and then jump on over?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



MR. PETROCELLI: You are shaking your head no. Have you tried that, Mr.

Leonard?



MR. LEONARD: No, no. I'm shaking my head at  the question, that's all.



MR.PETROCELLI: You aren't suggesting the answer?



MR. LEONARD: No. In fact, the videotape will show the witness wasn't

even looking at me at the time. You were looking at me.



MR. PETROCELLI: I am.



MR. LEONARD: But he wasn't. And the same objections.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.



MR. LEONARD: I will keep perfectly still now. And, no, I haven't tried

it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Opposite the air conditioner --



A: Right.



Q: -- that is affixed to the -- a wall where it's marked "Kaelin's

Room" --



A: Right.



Q: -- on this sketch here, Exhibit 179, opposite that air conditioner

on the Salinger property is a carport. Correct?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Are you able to -- could one get on that carport and then

jump over at that point?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: I believe the trees don't stop at  the top of the

carport. They continue up. So not only would you have to be skinny,

you'd have to be a pretty good hurdler.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q:  Okay. How --in June of 1994 there was  no barrier to getting onto

the Salinger property from  the sidewalk. Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: So you could just walk up the Salinger -- walk up to the Salinger

property and then walk all the  way down till you hit those trees that

you were just talking about. Right?



A: Correct.



Q: Okay. And anywhere along that path, you were saying that you might

be able to jump the fence.  Right?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: Yeah.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. And I will put a little --an end point line to denote where

you were pointing as the sort of final point where one might be able

to jump  the fence. True?



A: True.



Q: Okay. Have you ever done that, by the  way?



A: No.



Q: You never jumped that fence?



A: Not that side, no.



Q: The only side that you've jumped is on Ashford where the big tree

is?



A: No. I've jumped Rockingham a couple  times.



Q: You've jumped the fence on Rockingham?



A: Yeah, I used to when I was a kid jump off  here all the time

(Indicating). We used to have a tree in the front.



Q: Okay. Have you ever jumped the fence any other place besides on

Rockingham or on Ashford?



A: Jumped the fence --



Q: Or hopped the fence or the wall or done  anything else to get onto

the Rockingham property.



A: No, just --



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to the compound nature of the

question.



MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to cover all  possibilities.



MR. LEONARD: I know you are --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Go ahead.



MR. LEONARD: -- but I am trying to cover the record.



THE WITNESS: Just the two streets, Rockingham and Ashford. I've never

--is it okay?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes. That's my assistant.



A: Okay. There's the fence that goes next door, so there's no reason

to jump over anything, and  then all back here is bushes and stuff

(Indicating), so...



Q: Where is the gate that goes to the Von Watts tennis court?



A: Well, this right here (Indicating), which is the street on the map

--



MR. LEONARD: Hold on till he's paying attention so we don't have to do

it twice.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: I am sorry, Mr. Simpson.



A: Okay. This corner (Indicating), which is Ashford and Bristol, would

be moved out (Indicating), right, so you got the house here

(Indicating). It would be right here (Indicating) --



Q: Where there is a gate?



A: Yeah, there's a gate. We have -- like  there's a little outside

house there or like kitchen  kinda.



Q: Who owns that?



A: My dad. He still owns -- this is part of  the -- it's not on the

map. It's still part of the --



Q: Property?



A: -- property.  And they have like an outside house  that's between

our two tennis courts, and there's a gate, just a chain-link gate.



Q: So the chain-link gate is between the two  houses?



A: Uh-huh.



Q: It's not between the two tennis courts?



A: It's between the two properties -- yeah, between the two houses,

exactly.



Q: What is that house or shed?



A: Ours --or my father's, rather, is -- there's a kitchen and

refrigerator out there and stove. Theirs is like a whole -- they have

like an office upstairs, and it's like you could live out there.



Q: What did your father in June of 1994 use  that little cabana for,

whatever it was? What was its purpose?



A: I don't know. If people were playing on  the tennis court -- in

June, I mean, I don't think he used it for anything.



Q: Prior to Nicole's death what was its  purpose then?



A: It was for -- they built it out there for -- you know, the tennis

court, if they were having  parties, outside parties or something, and

they wanted to use a stove or something.



Q: It's fully enclosed?



A: Yeah, it's -- yeah, so you would never  have to go in the house.

Everybody could just still get inside.



Q: And could you put an X where that little cabin is?



(Witness complies.)



Q: Okay.



A: Yeah. Well, actually, let me just put a big thing over here because

it's about this big (Indicating).



Q: Okay. You have put three Xs in a box.



A: Yeah.



Q: And where is the gate onto the Von Watts'  property?



A: It would be going -- it would be right here (Indicating).



Q: Okay. You put a circle and you colored it in.



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay.



A: Yeah. See how this goes out like that (Indicating)?



Q: Have you ever been in the path behind where it's designated as

"Kaelin's Room" where that  air conditioner is?



A: Yes, I have.



Q: And when was the last time?



A: Not for a while. So --



Q: After Nicole's death have you been back there?



A: Yeah. Well, that being the reason why: Just to check it out and see

--



Q: Because there was a glove found there?



A: Yeah. Well, because of everything that happened.



Q: You wanted to go back there and -- for  what purpose?



A: Curiosity.



Q: Who did you go with?



A: I never really -- I don't think I ever  went with anybody. I went

with one of the guards once, I think, at one point.



Q: And how many times have you done that?



A: I don't know. A couple times.



Q: Did you do it at night?



A: Never did it at night, no.



Q: It's very dark back there at night. Right?



A: Yeah. It's dark in the daytime.



Q: You -- when you went back there, how did  you get back there? From

around the garage?



A: No. I would just come straight down the driveway and go back.



Q: I'm sorry. Right here (Indicating). You --



A: Yeah, because there was a door in the garage.



Q: There's a little gate here (Indicating).  Right?



A: No. It's open.



Q: Tell me what you did. You walked around  the garage?



A: Yes.



Q: And then started to head in a southerly direction -- excuse me --



A: East.



Q: -- in an easterly direction down that path. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And how far did you go?



A: To the air conditioner. I never wanted to go under because spiders

and s---.



Q: When you got to the air conditioner, you stopped?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Were you physically able -- How tall are  you?



A: About 5-10-1/2, 5-11.



Q: How much do you weigh?



A: About 230, 235.



Q: Were you physically able to go past that air conditioner by going

around it rather that underneath it?



A: Around it?



Q: Yes. Is there sufficient distance between the air conditioner and

the fence that --



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation, calls for

speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- to permit you to get by?



MR. LEONARD: Same objection.



THE WITNESS: I got kind of a big belly. I think I'd have a hard time

doing it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Was the guard able to do it? Do you  know?



MR. LEONARD: Object --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did he go past the air conditioner?



A: I don't think so.



Q: Okay. Did you try to go past it?



A: No. You know who I was with? I was with the cable guy. It wasn't

the guard. I was back there with the cable guy. We were trying to get

cable for a room back there.



Q: For whose room?



A: For both the rooms -- all the rooms.



Q: This was not --



A: Something was wrong with the cable in the whole house.



Q: In the whole house.



A: Yeah. And they were back there trying to fix the wires. I was with

the cable guy back there.



Q: Did you go underneath the air conditioner?



A: No.



Q: Were you able to?



A: I wasn't trying to.



Q: Could you?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Could you physically do it? Could you -- was there enough room so

you could get underneath it  and go past?



A: If I really wanted to, I mean, I guess I could -- have to. I mean

--



Q: If you -- have you ever been past that air conditioner to the tip

of the property?



A: Yes, but there were no two rooms here (Indicating) when I been back

there.



Q: That was before the rooms were constructed?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. After -- you are referring to what is denoted on this map as

"Arnelle's Room"?



A: In Arnelle's room.



Q: In Arnelle's room.  And in your view, in your heart, one of  those

rooms is your room. Right?



A: In my heart of hearts.



MR. LEONARD: Put a J there.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: In your heart of hearts. Okay. Put a J.  Is it this one right here

(Indicating)?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And that's the room you used to live in  when you lived there

during high -- before high  school. Right?



A: High school. High school.



Q: High school.



A: All through high school.



Q: Okay. I will put a J there. Since the -- when were these rooms,

which are now denoted as "Arnelle's Room" on Exhibit 179, constructed?



A: Jeez. I think it was -- I think '85.



Q: Okay.  And since 1985 yon have not been past the air conditioner?



A: No. I was, but -- yes, I was.



Q: But what?



A: I went this way (Indicating) to see what was going on back here

(Indicating).



Q: When did you do that?



A: In '95 there was a big rain, and it was all flooded back here, and

I had to go -- we had to go  back there. It was just a big mess. I had

to go back there and --



Q: And when you say "back there," you meant --



A: Behind Arnelle's room. I'm sorry.



Q: And you did it by starting in the backyard and going around that

way (Indicating) rather than from the front yard?



A: Coming down this walkway (Indicating) in front of Kato's room, this

says "Kato's room," in  front of my room, Jason's room, all the way

back --



Q: Starting in the backyard.



A: Yeah, yes.



Q: And going around Arnelle's room?



A: Right.



Q: And coming around and then sort of coming back in a westerly

direction?



A: But I never came down here (Indicating), no. I just went to here

(Indicating). There was a water-a broken pipe that was spilling into

these neighbors or something.



Q: Now, in June of 1994 was there any way  that one could walk in the

same path that you just  described, around the yard, to go behind

Kaelin's  room, or was it blocked off by fences?



A: There's a fence right here (Indicating), right at Arnelle's room,

to the tennis court.



Q: And how do you get on the other side of  that fence?



A: You'd have to hop over.



Q: There is no gate?



A: I don't think so, no.



Q: So that area behind and around Arnelle's room was kind of cordoned

off and not for use?



A: Unless you came down by the south side of  the house. And go past

the air conditioner.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: So there wasn't really any ready and easy access to that area.

Right?



A: No, sir.



Q: And what was the purpose of that area? Bad question.



What was in that area in June of 1994?



A: Old -- from what I saw, it was like an old lawnmower, an old raft.



Q: Well, if you needed to get the lawnmower  or the raft, you were out

of luck?



A: You were out of luck.



Q: Okay. So it was just a bunch of junk --



A: Junk.



Q: -- back there.



A: Exactly.



Q: Okay. And there was no way to get there,  not even from the tennis

court. Right?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Does the same configurations exist, by the way, today?



MR. LEONARD: When you say "configuration," do  you mean the junk and

everything?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: The same fence, the same inability to get back to that area, or has

it been changed?



A: No. It's the same.



Q: It's exactly the same?



A: Yes. As far as I know, it's the same.



Q: Have there been any structural changes to m the property since June

of 1994?



A: Yes.



Q: What?



A: They put -- they put a barrier, kind of, all along the Rockingham

gate and the Ashford gate.



Q: That's to prevent people from looking in?



A: Looking over the fence.



Q: And have there been any other changes  made to the property?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: If you know.



A: No, not that I know of.



Q: Any change to lighting?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: What changes?



A: Movement lights, certain -- some movement lights.



Q: What are "movement lights"?



A: When -- they turn on at nighttime if you know, if it catches

movement.



Q: New lights like that have been installed?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Where?



A: See, this is the pool (Indicating). Right around the pool -- all

along, actually, the perimeter.



Q: Meaning Ashford and Rockingham.



A: Yeah, at certain spots.



Q: In June of 1994 before Nicole's death,  were there lights on the

outside property that would  go on when motion was detected, so called

motion light?



A: Not that I knew of, no.



Q: Okay. And were there lights that would go on on the timer

automatically?



A: Yes, there were.



Q: At nighttime?



A: Yes.



Q: What time would they go on in June of  1994?



A: I don't remember. I haven't been in the  house.



MR. LEONARD: I'm hungry.



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, we're going to stop soon.



THE WITNESS: Let's just finish.



MR. LEONARD: Well, unless you -- he says, "Let's finish." You are not

going to finish before lunch. Right?



MR. PETROCELLI: No. No. Let me just think what I can do on this right

now.



MR. LEONARD: Dan, you could think of a thousand questions on that

diagram.



MR. PETROCELLI: That's true.



MR. LEONARD: I know you now.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Other than that one time when you went to look for the water

damage, have you been back in that cordoned-off area behind Arnelle's

room since Nicole's  death?



A: No.



Q: Not at all?



A: No, sir.



Q: Do you know whether there were any  sprinklers on the Salingers'

property where it adjoins  the Simpson property?



A: I don't know.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, now is a good time to break for lunch.



I will have this marked as the next exhibit in order with your

markings on it, which will become Exhibit 183.



(Plaintiffs' exhibit 183 was marked for identification by the reporter

and is attached hereto.)



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is

approximately 12:37.



(At the hour of 12:37 p.m., a luncheon  recess was taken, the

deposition to resume at 1:37 p.m.)



(At the hour of 1:39 p.m., the deposition of JASON LAMAR SIMPSON  was

resumed at the same place, the same persons being present.)



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record  now, and the time is

approximately 1:39.



EXAMINATION (Resumed)



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: The exhibit that we had you mark on that was the sketch of the

Rockingham property we have marked as Exhibit 183, for the record.



The next exhibit in order, Exhibit 184, is the subpoena duces tecum

served on you in connection with this deposition.



Can you mark that, please, Mr. Reporter.



(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 184 was marked for identification by the reporter

and is attached hereto.)



MR. LEONARD: We never got a copy of this, by  the way.



MR.PETROCELLI: Of course you did.



MR. LEONARD: Well, according to Baker's firm,  we didn't.



MR.PETROCELLI: Well, it was served on Mr. Baker's firm.



Q: This was the subpoena that was served on  you?



MR. LEONARD: Take a look at it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: I know we had trouble seeing you so eventually the lawyers for Mr.

Simpson accepted service on your behalf.



Where are all the documents that I asked from the subpoena?



A: I --



MR.LEONARD: You know what? I would like to take a five-minute break

and review the subpoena with the client at this point.



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am in the middle of a  question.



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, and I know, and I want to confer with my client.



MR. PETROCELLI: I would like him to answer the  question first.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I would like to confer with  him first.



MR. PETROCELLI: There is a pending question. You can't talk to him --



MR. LEONARD: Sure I can.



MR. PETROCELLI: -- and tell him what the  answer is.



MR. LEONARD: I'm not going to tell him what  the answer is.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Let me ask you this: Have you ever read  the subpoena?



A: I kinda quickly went over it. That was it. I didn't like sit down

and --



Q: Why not?



A: I don't know. I just didn't.



Q: Well --



MR. LEONARD: Let me -- I would like to go off the record and confer

with my client at this point.



MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I object.



MR. LEONARD: Okay, you can object. Let's go.



MR. PETROCELLI: I can't stop you; there is no  judge here, but could

you make it quick, please?



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, two minutes.



MR.PETROCELLI: I noticed that you were  working with your client in

the conference room.



MR. LEONARD: Two minutes. Are we off the record?



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and the time is

approximately 1:41.



(Recess.)



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record  now, and the time is

approximately 1:45.



(Fredric Goldman enters the deposition.)



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Now that you have had a chance to talk to your lawyer, where are

the documents that I subpoenaed?



A: I don't have any of this stuff.



Q: And by "this stuff," what are you referring to?



A: Everything that's in this subpoena.



Q: All of which you've ascertained in the last two minutes by talking

to your lawyer. Right?



A: Well, I just looked at it --



Q: In the last two minutes. Right?



MR. LEONARD: No, I don't think that's his  testimony. I think he

testified earlier he looked at  it before.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you just look at this in the last two  minutes with your

lawyer?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to anything  that occurred between,

you know, he and I as attorney-client privilege.



But go ahead.



THE WITNESS: I've seen this. I've kinda  flipped through it before --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: I know. That's what you said. You said you didn't read it

carefully. You flipped through.



A: I didn't get to finish my answer.



Q: Keep going.



A: I flipped through it before, and I kinda  had a rough idea as to

what was on here but not  specifically, but then looking in there, I

looked over  and looked to see the specifics of what's on here and, I

don't have any of this stuff on it.



Q: And when you just now said then looking at the "specifics" of this,

you meant just a few  minutes ago. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And just a few minutes ago you  made a determination that you

don't have any of this. Is that what you're saying?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Do you have any -- you have phone bills, don't you?



A: I think I might have last month's phone  bill.



Q: Were your phone records subpoenaed in  June of 1994?



A: Not that I recall, no.



Q: Did you have a cell phone at that time?



A: No.



Q: You had a phone at your apartment. Right?



A: I didn't have --



Q: On Sycamore. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: In June of '94. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And did you have any kind of calendar or papers on which you kept

your appointments?



A: Calendar, no. No. I had like one of those boards you put up in the

kitchen and you write with a marker sometimes.



Q: You had nothing that resembled a calendar or appointment book?



A: I had an address book, but not a --



Q: Where is that address book?



A: I think it's at home.



MR. PETROCELLI: I call for its production pursuant to the subpoena.



Q: Next, do you have any documents that in  any way mention Nicole

Brown Simpson? Do you have  anything that mentions her?



A: Anything that mentions her?



Q: Anything. Anything.



A: Like a magazine that says her name in it?



Q: Anything that mentioned her before her death.



A: Probably.



Q: What do you have?



A: Like a cookbook that says, "To Jason, Merry Christmas."



Q: Okay. Anything else besides the cookbook?



A: I don't know. I'd have to check.



Q: Do you have any photographs?



A: Yeah, I got lots of photographs.



Q: Okay. Of Nicole?



A: Nicole, the whole family and Nicole.



Q: Do you have photographs of O.J. Simpson  and Nicole?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Do you have photographs -- Well, I call for the production of

those photographs as well.



Prior to the death of Nicole, had you ever heard of Ron Goldman?



A: No, sir.



Q: Had Nicole Brown Simpson ever told you  about a person named Ron

Goldman or Ronald Goldman?



A: No, sir.



Q: Had anyone?



A: No, sir.



Q: Did you ever discuss Ronald Goldman with O.J. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: With anyone?



A: No, sir.



Q: At any time?



A: Ever?



Q: Yes, ever.



A: Yeah.



Q: With whom?



A: I don't remember I wondered who he was.



Q: What did you wonder about?



A: I wondered who -- who and -- who he was, finding out what happened.

I found out that Nicole  had died, and I found out that somebody else

at that  time had died, too.



Q: And how did you find out who he was?



A: I think the news.



Q: Did you speak to any person about who  Ron Goldman was?



A: Probably, but I don't remember specifically.



Q: Tell me who you spoke to.



A: In the last two years, everybody I've ever spoken to?



Q: No. About Ron Goldman to find out who he  was.



A: I never -- I heard from the news, from the media, from TV, who he

was.



Q: Other than the news and the media, conversations that you have had

with people.



A: Never.



Q: No one.



A: No one.



Q: Did Nicole ever discuss with you before her death that she was

dating someone or seeing someone who was a waiter at a restaurant?



A: No, sir.



Q: Did she ever describe to you a person who  fit the description of

Ron Goldman?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Go ahead.



A: No.



Q: Did she ever discuss with you any persons that she was seeing as

friends or dating as friends in  the last few months of her life?



A: No, sir.



Q: Now, you said you last saw Nicole -- first of all, you said you

last saw her when she had pneumonia. Then you said, when I asked you

the  question about Sydney's -- about Justin's graduation,  that it

must have been on that occasion that you last  saw Nicole.



Do you recall that?



A: Yeah, you reminded me.



Q: Okay. So it's now your recollection that you last saw Nicole at

Justin's graduation at the  Sunshine School?



A: I believe that was the last time.



Q: And when you went to that event who did  you go with?



A: I went by myself.



Q: Did you get tickets to go there?



A: You didn't need a ticket for it.



Q: Who was there on behalf of your brother  Justin?



A: My sister Arnelle, I don't know if Sydney was there, and Nicole was

there.



Q: Did you go out afterwards?



A: No, I didn't. I think they went back to the house. I'm not sure.

I'm not sure if I weft with  them back to the house.



Q: Which house?



A: Back to Bundy, I think, but --



Q: Where did you go?



A: I know I had to work, so I couldn't spend the rest of the day with

them. I wanted to.



Q: Which day was this?



A: The day of the graduation.



Q: Why did you want to spend the rest of the day with them?



A: Because I love them.



Q: Who is "them"?



A: Sydney, Justin, Nicole.



Q: Do you know what they did after they left  the graduation?



A: No, I don't remember.



Q: Do you know if they went to dinner?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, asking him to speculate.



THE WITNESS: Actually, it was early still.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: In the afternoon?



A: Yeah. So, no, they didn't go out to dinner.



Q: Were you disappointed your father was not  there?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: I actually didn't really -- since Nicole told me that he

was at some business thing he had to take care of, I really didn't

think too much of it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: It was not uncommon for your father to miss family functions

because of business. Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: He was gone a lot. Right?



A: Correct.



Q: And that was through -- that was true throughout your lifetime as

well. Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: And that continued to be true all the way up until Nicole's death.

Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: So he missed lots of family functions involving you. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: And involving Sydney and Justin. Right?



A: Sydney and Justin, I don't know so much  because I wasn't really

there, but I'm sure he missed his share.



Q: A lot with you. Right?



A: Yeah. I mean, yeah, he was working a lot.



Q: Out of town?



A: Yeah.



Q: Played golf a lot?



A: Played golf every morning, but I wasn't up that early anyway, so...



Q: Went out of town on golf tournaments a lot, celebrity tournaments

--



A: Not --



Q: -- golfing for Hertz, those sorts of things?



MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound nature of  the question.



Q: You can answer it if -- you can try.



THE WITNESS: He didn't play golf when I lived  at home.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What was your relationship with O.J. Simpson like?



A: What was it like?



Q: Yes.



A: At what point?



Q: Did it ever change?



A: Well, I mean, it's matured.



Q: Other than matured as you became older and he, too, did you have a

good relationship with him throughout your life, or did you have a --



A: Yeah, I mean --



Q: -- bad relationship with him at times?



A: At times.



Q: Did you have any falling-outs?



A: At times.



Q: What times?



A: I don't know. When I was 16 and wanted  to get a car right away.

What else. When I wanted my  own room further away from the house. He

won every  time.



Q: These are less specific little incidents where you had arguments?



A: Yeah. I mean, I've argued with my dad.



Q: But other than normal father-son arguments, your testimony is that

you've had a very  strong relationship with him since day one?



A: I think so. Well, now, looking back, I mean, since everything

that's happened it's gotten  stronger, so in my opinion it's like I

start to  realize it is a lot stronger now than it was before.



Q: What was your opinion as of June of 1994?



A: Of our relationship?



Q: Yes.



A: I mean, I didn't have any problems with  it.



Q: Was he there for you all the time?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Did he ever beat you?



A: No.



Q: Never?



A: Beat me? No.



Q: Yes, beat you.



A: No.



Q: Did he ever hit you?



A: I've gotten a whipping on the butt before  with his belt when I was

a kid.



Q: Nothing that you would regard now, looking back, as abusive?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did he ever strike you with anything other than his hands?



A: No. He's never stricken me with his hands, though.



Q: How has he hit you when he --



A: I told you, with a belt on my butt.



Q: Just a belt?



A: Yeah.



Q: Once or twice?



A: I don't know. I kinda -- kinda messed around a lot when I was a

kid. No, I don't know.  Maybe 10, 20 times. I don't remember exactly.



Q: When was the last time?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Small kid?



A: I was about 14 maybe. It was not too long before Nicole and my

dad's wedding, which I think was in '85.



Q: Did he ever inflict serious injuries upon you?



A: Never.



Q: Did you ever have to get medical treatment as a result of a

beating?



A: No, sir.



Q: Did you ever go to the hospital or the doctor as a result of being

hit by your dad?



A: No, sir.



Q: Were you afraid of him?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see him in a rage?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that as  vague.



THE WITNESS: No, not in a rage. I -- wouldn't  characterize it as a

rage.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ever see him in what you would characterize as somebody out

of control?



A: Out of control, no.



Q: Did you ever see him throw things around?



A: No, I've never seen him throw things.



Q: Never saw him throw anything?



A: No. I saw him throw a football, saw him throw a tennis ball.



Q: Never saw him throw any item or article in anger?



A: No, I've never seen him throw an article.



Q: Like photographs or a glass or anything  like that?



A: I've never seen him do that.



Q: Okay. Have you seen him get mad?



A: Yeah.



Q: Have you seen him get really mad?



A: Yeah.



Q: Have you ever seen him, when he got  really mad, pick up a glass

and throw it?



A: No.



Q: You ever see him get so mad that he actually hurt himself, cut

himself?



A: No.



Q: You ever see him take a baseball bat to anything?



A: No.



Q: You ever see him break down a door or break -- or put his fist

through a wall?



A: No, sir.



Q: Anything like that?



A: No, sir.



Q: So in your opinion, based on your experience living with your

father and knowing him all  these years, he was in total control of

his emotions and temper. Is that true?



A: I never said that.



Q: Answer that question.



A: I said I've never seen him do anything like that.



Q: So you've never seen him lose control of  himself. Right?



A: No, sir.



Q: And you've always seen him in control of  himself. True?



A: Yeah. I've seen him upset, but he was in  control.



Q: When he -- when you've seen him upset, how did he behave?



A: Angry.



Q: And did that manifest itself in any physical way?



A: Arguing.



Q: Just arguing?



A: Yeah. Maybe raising his voice, pacing.



Q: Veins in his neck bulge or pop?



A: I don't know about the veins.



Q: Or his eyes start to bulging?



A: Yeah, yeah, I've seen that.



Q: When he was angry at you?



A: A couple times.



Q: Did he ever threaten to hit you?



A: Yeah. I mean, yeah, if I don't get up to  my room, "Get up to your

room," or something like that. I mean --



Q: Did he ever threaten to hit you in such a  way that you were really

afraid for your life?



A: Well, any time he threatened me -- not for my life, no.



Q: Not for your life.



A: Hell, no. Sorry. Excuse me. No.



Q: Did he ever threaten you with anything  other than a spanking?



A: No. Or punishment.



Q: Or punishment.



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see him on drugs?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever see him take drugs?



A: No.



Q: You ever been in the same room when he took drugs?



A: No, sir.



Q: Did you ever take any drugs?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



MR. LEONARD: -- and instruct him not to answer.



BY MR PETROCELLI:



[Portion Deleted]





Q: Okay. Did you ever see your father get  angry at another person

other than yourself?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: Who?



A: My sister, Nicole, my mom, I think a guy  that ran over our dog

once a long time ago; tried to get away with it.



Q: What did your father do in that incident  with the dog?



A: I think he yelled at the guy. That's all. Guy tried to get away.



Q: Did you ever see O.J. Simpson strike  somebody?



A: No. I got a picture of him hitting somebody -- that's about it --

in a football game.



Q: I don't mean in professional sports or college sports or any

sporting activity. I mean in  anger, in a fight, losing his temper or

being provoked or whatever.



Did you ever see him strike another person other than when he spanked

you?



A: No.



Q: Never?



A: Never.



Q: Never saw him hit Marquerite, your mother?



A: No.



Q: Did he?



A: Not that I know of.



Q: Did she ever tell you that he did?



A: No.



Q: Did anybody ever tell you that he did?



A: No. No.



Q: Did the police ever come out to the house  when you lived -- when

he lived with Marquerite and  you?



A: Not that I ever remember.



Q: You have no knowledge and no information about anything like that.

Is that true?



A: If he hit my mother, he'd know.



Q: How would he know?



A: Because nobody hit my mother.



Q: Nobody ever did.



A: No. If anybody ever hit my mother believe me, they'd know about it.



Q: From you?



A: Hell, yeah.



Q: Including your father?



A: Yes.



Q: That would be unacceptable to you. Right?



A: Very.



Q: Just because she's your mother or because it's unacceptable to hit

another woman?



A: Both reasons.



Q: And would it also be unacceptable to you if he ever hit Nicole?



A: Yes.



Q: And you would find that totally outrageous and wrong on his part.

Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you ever see him hit Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Ever?



A: No, sir.



Q: Did you ever -- were you ever told by  anyone that he struck or hit

Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that as --



MR. PETROCELLI: Why?



MR.LEONARD: -- lack of foundation.



Told by anyone?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, by anyone.



THE WITNESS: I was never personally told that  he hit Nicole.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What do you mean, "personally"?



A: No one ever said, "Jason, your dad hit  Nicole" or "O.J. hit

Nicole."



Q: Did Nicole ever tell you that?



A: No, Nicole never did.



Q: Did Arnelle ever tell you that?



A: Arnelle never did.



Q: Did Mr. Simpson, O.J. Simpson, ever tell  you that?



A: No, he never did.



Q: Did Al Cowlings ever tell you that?



A: No, he never did either.



Q: Did anyone ever tell you that?



A: No one ever personally ever told me that he did.



Q: Did you ever overhear a conversation where someone said O.J.

Simpson hit Nicole?



A: On TV.



Q: When on TV?



A: I don't know. During the trial, on the HARD COPY shows and stuff

like that.



Q: Is that the first time -- Strike that. You heard this on TV after

Nicole's  murder for the first time. Is that right?



A: That he hit Nicole?



Q: Yes.



A: Yeah.



Q: First time you ever heard it. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: Never heard it in 1989 when you were 19 years old.



A: That's -- no. I heard they got in  fight. I never heard that he hit

Nicole.



Q: What did you hear about the fight in  1989?



A: That they got --



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object unless you  can lay a foundation.



MR. PETROCELLI: I just asked him, what did he hear about it.



MR. LEONARD: Yeah, why don't you ask him where he heard it and when he

heard it and who he heard it.



Is that the way you want the record?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.



MR.LEONARD: Okay, great, go ahead.



THE WITNESS: What was that?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What did you hear about the fight in  1989?



A: I got a phone call, and my father told me that he and Nicole had

gotten in a fight, and he  wanted to tell me because he's probably

gonna -- I was  probably gonna hear about it in the paper or something

 like that.



Q: And when did you get that phone call?



A: I think it was either New Year's Eve or  New Year's Day. New Year's

 Day.



Q: 1989?



A: Yeah. Because the Rose Bowl was on the 2nd that day. It wasn't on

the 1st. It's usually on  the 1st.



Q: How do you remember that?



A: Because he called me at the hotel. I was getting ready to go --



Q: What hotel?



A: -- to the Rose Bowl. I can't remember the name of it. We stayed in

a hotel before football games at USC. It's on Wilshire. I think it's

-- I don't know the name of it.



Q: So you think on January 2, 1989 your father --



A: No. January 1, it would have been.



Q: Why? You stayed in the hotel overnight?



A: Yeah, you stayed before the game.



Q: Who?



A: The team.



Q: You were on the team?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And he called -- You were a freshman?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. And you were part of the SC varsity squad?



A: SC football team, yeah.



Q: On the football team.



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And he called you at the hotel where the USC football team was

staying on January 1, 1989 to inform you that he and Nicole had gotten

into a fight.



A: Yes.



Q: And where was he, if you know, when he made this phone call to you?



A: I don't know.



Q: Did you ask him?



A: No. I was kinda upset.



Q: What did he say to you had happened?



A: He said, "Look, we got into a fight.  You're probably gonna read

about it. I just wanted to tell you because I don't want you to find

out reading  in the paper."



Q: What about that upset you?



A: The fact that they got in a fight. I knew that it must have been a

pretty big fight if it's  gonna make it to the paper.



Q: Well, he had gotten into fights with  Nicole before. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You had seen them argue before. Right?



A: I've heard them argue, yeah, seen them  argue.



Q: So what about this particular account of  his fight with Nicole

upset you?



A: The fact that he called me to tell me, to warn me that for some

reason I should know about this particular fight because -- I don't

know -- because, "You might find out from somebody else." I knew that

for some reason it must have been something severe about the fight.



Q: Now you say "for some reason."  In fact, he told you much more than

that. Correct?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



THE WITNESS: No. He told me just what I told  you.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: He told you that the police had come out  to the house, for

example. Correct?



A: No, he never said that. He just said, "We got into a fight."



Q: He said, "I want you to know we got in a  fight and it may be in

the newspapers," and that's all  he said. Is that your testimony?



A: Basically, yes.



Q: Okay. He didn't tell you, "We got into a fight, and Nicole got

hurt." Did he say that?



A: I don't remember him saying that.



Q: Did he say that Nicole had marks on her face or bruises?



A: He didn't get into detail.



Q: Did he say that the fight was a physical fight?



A: No, he didn't get -- he didn't even say that, I don't think.



Q: So as far as you knew --



A: He was pretty vague.



Q: -- it might have been just an argument. Right?



A: He was pretty vague. No, I knew it wasn't just an argument because

arguments don't make it to the news paper.



Q: You knew this was a physical altercation. True?



A: It had to be.



Q: And he told you it was. Right?



A: Either that or the fact that the police must have found out or a

neighbor must have found out or somebody must have found out in order

for the newspapers to be alarmed by it. I mean, why would the 

newspapers print a fight between my father and my stepmom.



Q: Unless something serious happened.  Right?



A: Yeah. I mean, it didn't take, you know, Einstein to figure that

out.



Q: So you understood something really serious had happened. Right?



A: Something serious must have happened.



Q: And did you ask him, "What, Dad, happened?"



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did you ask him if Nicole was okay?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Did you call Nicole to find out if she was okay?



A: I saw her the next day or two days later.



Q: After the Rose Bowl?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you ask her at that time?



A: If she was all right?



A: Yes.



A: Yeah.



Q: So from the moment your father called you  on January 1 to tell you

about his fight with Nicole the time you saw her a couple of days

later, you  did not speak to Nicole at all. True?



A: No. True.



Q: Never once called her to see if she was okay. True?



A: She wasn't home. I didn't know where she was.



Q: I didn't ask you that. You didn't call her. Right?



A: No. I called the house. She wasn't home.



Q: You did call the house.



A: Yeah.



Q: How many times?



A: I think a couple times.



Q: Okay. From where?



A: I think my dorm room, maybe somebody  else's room.



Q: What days did you call the house?



A: I think the 2nd -- or not the 2nd. The 3rd and the 4th.



Q: So you didn't call on the 1st, and you didn't call on the 2nd.

True?



A: No. I found out the 1st at night.



Q: Right.



A: And I didn't call on the 2nd, no.



Q: Okay.



A: And the 3rd is the day I'm guessing I probably called, and I think

I saw her on the 4th.



Q: Okay. Did you -- can you remember specifically calling her on the

3rd?



A: No.



Q: And when you spoke to her on the 4th, was it over the telephone or

in person?



A: I said, "...I think I saw her on the 4th."



Q: Where did you see her on January 4?



A: It was the house.



Q: Whose house?



A: My dad's house and her house.



Q: You went over there?



A: Yeah.



Q: And did you talk to her about the fight?



A: Yeah. I said, "What happened? How are  you?"



Q: When you said, "What happened," what did she say?



A: She was like -- I didn't see her. It wasn't like face to face. She

was kinda like far  away, and she was pretty upset, and from my best 

recollection, I mean, she was up -- she was just  walking around, and

I asked her if she was all right,  and she was just like (Sound).



She didn't really say anything about it and I knew she was upset, and

I just asked her, "Look, can I borrow the Bronco?" She didn't want to

talk to me either, it seemed.



Q: Describe the marks and injuries that you saw on her.



A: I didn't see any marks or injuries on her.



Q: Nothing?



A: No, because I wasn't this close to her.



Q: How close were you?



A: I was -- she was probably about mid table, but --



Q: Like 15, 20 feet?



A: 15, 20 feet, yeah, but it was in the kitchen, and I couldn't tell

if she was -- I mean, in  retrospect it was like she didn't -- it was

like she  was acting like she didn't want me to see.



Q: Do you carried on a conversation with her  from a distance of 15 to

20 feet. Is that what you're  saying?



A: Yeah, but we weren't talking to each  other  me and you are talking

to each other right  now.



Q: Who were you talking to?



A: What do you mean? There was no mistaken  who I was talking to. I'm

saying just because I look like this (indicating) doesn't mean I'm not

talking to  Mr. Petrocelli. I may not be looking at you, but I'm 

still talking to you.



Q: What I am trying to find out is this:  You went into the house, and

you went and you saw her there. Right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And you asked her how she was what had happened, et cetera. Right?



A: I didn't really get into what had happened right away. It just kind

of --



Q: But you told me just a few minutes ago --



A: -- blurted out.



Q: -- you said, "What happened?" that what you said?



A: I think.



Q: Okay. And you're telling me that for however long you and she

conversed, it was conducted at a distance of 15 to 20 feet, and you

got no closer  to her at that time. Is that your testimony? Yes or 

no.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Did you ask Nicole why she didn't  want to see you or to be

with you or even to talk to  you?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. I think that's misstating his testimony. Plus

it's a compound question.



Go ahead. You can answer it.



THE WITNESS: She never said, "I didn't want to see you." She wanted to

be left alone.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: How do you know that?



A: Just in knowing Nicole.



Q: What did she say to indicate that to you?



A: She didn't say. She didn't really want to be bothered.



Q: Did you try to get closer to her to look at her?



A: Kinda, yeah.



Q: What stopped you?



A: Her moving away.



Q: She ran away from you?



A: I didn't say run. I said move.



Q: Where did she move?



A: She was kinda pacing around, being fidgety all in the kitchen.



Q: Did you go up to her to hug her?



A: I kinda moved a little bit closer, but it wasn't a hug kind of --

it wasn't a real emotional type of thing. She was very standoff-ish.

She was  upset. I mean, she was upset about the whole  situation, I

guess.



Q: And that's the only conversation you ever had with her about this

fight on New Year's Day?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you ever ask her again?



A: About?



Q: Was she trying to avoid showing you her face, based on your

observations?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can tell when a person is trying not  to show you their face

such as if I'm talking to you now, I'm turning my head away

(indicating).



Did she make any movements to you to  indicate that she really didn't

want you to see her  face?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for  speculation.



Go ahead.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: I don't know.



Q: You don't know.



A: No, I don't know.



Q: It's fair to say that you love your father?



A: Yes.



Q: Fair to say that you don't want to see him lose this case?



A: I wouldn't want to see him lose it, no.



Q: And is it fair to say that even if a jury were to conclude that he

killed Nicole and he killed Ron, you would stand by his side?



A: It would be kinda hard.



Q: You wouldn't abandon him, would you?



A: It would be really hard. He's my father, but...



Q: You're loyal to your father. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: And you don't want to hurt him in this case, do you?



A: No. I mean...



Q: Did you ever talk to your father again  about this incident on New

Year's Day other than the  telephone conversation?



A: No. Never came up again.



Q: Do you think your father killed Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for a conclusion. Calls for speculation,

lack of  foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Why do you think that?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same basis.



THE WITNESS: Just a feeling.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Just a feeling you have?



A: Feeling in my heart, feeling in my head.



Q: It's not something that you would want to believe to be true.



A: Of course not.



Q: Okay. Do you know how your father's blood got at the crime scene

where the two bodies were found?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you have any information whatsoever as  to how blood of your

father's rare type was found next  to the two bodies?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked him?



A: No.



Q: Do you have any information as to why a shoe print in blood in size

12 the size of your father's shoes, was found at the crime scene?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Calls for  speculation, lack of

foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked him about that?



A: Never asked him.



Q: Has he ever told you?



A: No.



Q: Has he ever given you -- whether or not you asked, has he ever told

you or given you an explanation for why his blood was found at the

crime scene?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Or why a size shoe-a size 12 shoe  print was found there? Has he

ever told you about any  of that?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as compound,  lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: No, sir.



Q: Has -- do you have any explanation or information as to why blood

matching the type of Ron Goldman's was found in your father's Bronco?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation, calls for

speculation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Or Nicole's blood.



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked your father about those circumstances?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No, I haven't.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Has he ever given you any information or  any explanation for those

circumstances?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No, he hasn't.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Does it not matter to you?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object because that's argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Does it matter to you or does it not matter to you?



MR. LEONARD: I'm going to object as argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: Yes, it matters.



Q: Why don't you ask him?



A: You're asking me, does it matter about  the blood, or does it

matter that he -- has he told me?



Q: Does it matter that this evidence was found linking him to these

crimes?



MR. LEONARD: I am going on object. Lack of  foundation, calls for

speculation, it's argumentative,  and I am going to instruct the

witness not to answer that question.



Don't answer that.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Does it matter to you that your dad may have answers to these

questions, and you haven't even  asked him and he hasn't even told

you?



MR. LEONARD: Same Objections.



Don't answer the question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: These things don't matter to you?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



Don't answer the question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you have any information or any explanation as to why blood

matching your father's  rare type was found on the Rockingham

property?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for  speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, I don't know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You don't know?



A: Huh-uh.



Q: Did you ever ask him?



A: No.



Q: Did he ever tell you or give you an explanation as to why his blood

was found on the  property, having been dropped there the same time

that Nicole was being murdered --



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- or the same night of her murder?



MR. LEONARD: -- lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, sir.



BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have any explanation or any information

as to why your father's gloves were found, one at the crime scene and

one at Rockingham?



MR. LEONARD: Object. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation, calls

for a conclusion.



THE WITNESS: No, I don't know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You don't know?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever ask him, "Why were your  gloves found at the crime

scene, Dad?"



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: "Why was one of your gloves found at  Bundy near Nicole and Ron's

body," did you ever ask  that question to him?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No, I did not.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did he ever give you any answer or any information or any

explanation about that?



MR. LEONARD: Same objections.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ever discuss that with him?



A: That, yeah, I think.



Q: Tell me about your discussion.



A: I mean, I think I heard him say like "I don't know where they got

the gloves," or something like that, or even if they were his. I think

I heard him say something like that.



Q: You heard him say, "I don't know where  they got my gloves"?



A: "They got those gloves."



Q: "Those gloves"?



A: Or, "If they're even mine or not."



Q: You heard him say that they might not be his gloves?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. That mischaracterizes his testimony.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is that your testimony?



MR. LEONARD: That's not what he said.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is that what you heard him say?



A: I heard him say, "I don't know where they found those gloves,"

something like, "I don't know where they found those gloves or if

they're even my gloves at all."



Q: And when did you hear O.J. Simpson say  that?



A: I think it was at a-I think it was in jail or something.



Q: And to whom did he say that?



A: He was just saying it to whoever was in the room.



Q: And who was in the room besides you and O.J. Simpson?



A: I think Nicole Pulvers, me. I think that was it.



Q: Had you ever seen those gloves before? Yourself.



A: No.



Q: Were they your gloves?



A: No.



Q: Did you have any of your gloves at  Rockingham on June 12, 1994?



A: Not that I know of.



Q: Did you have any -- What size shoe do you wear?



A: 11-1/2.



Q: What size glove do you wear? Extra large?



A: I don't know. I don't wear gloves, so I wouldn't know what that is.



Q: You don't own a pair of gloves. Right?



A: I mean, I've gone skiing- before, you  know, and just gone for one

that fits, but I've never  really paid attention to what the size was.



Q: Okay. Where are your ski gloves?



A: They might be at my dad's house.



Q: Where?



A: In a closet somewhere. I don't know. I  haven't seen them in a

while.



Q: Do you even know if you have any ski  gloves?



A: I did. I mean, when I was in high school, I went skiing. I had

gloves.



Q: Is the last time you saw the ski gloves  that you had in high

school?



A: Yeah.



Q: 1988?



A: Well, before, prior to 1988. Right around in there.



Q: Prior to 1988.



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. So you haven't put on a pair of gloves since after -- since

before 1988. Correct?



A: No. I put on a pair of gloves since 1988.



Q: For skiing?



A: No.



Q: For what?



A: I don't know. Just farting around.



Q: Your gloves?



A: No. Friends or something like that.



Q: Friends. Okay. Have you seen any of your father's gloves in the

past five years?



A: No.



Q: You've seen -- you saw those pictures at  the trial of your father

wearing gloves at football games. Right?



A: Right.



Q: You attended most of the trial, did you  not?



A: Some of it. Not most of it.



Q: Okay. And you saw him wearing those photographs, right -- wearing

the gloves depicted in  the videos --



A: Yes.



Q: -- when he was announcing or broadcasting at football games?



A: Yes.



Q: Do you know where those gloves are?



A: No, I don't know.



Q: Did you ask him?



A: No.



Q: Did you say -- did you ever ask him,  "Dad, where are the gloves

that you were wearing that they showed in the court" --



A: No.



Q: -- "the gloves that you were wearing in  the football"-"at those

football games, where are  they? Did you ever ask him that question?



A: No, sir.



Q: Okay. Did he ever tell you where those gloves are?



A: No, sir.



Q: Do you know where they are?



A: No, I don't.



Q: You've seen your dad wear sweat pants  before, haven't you?



A: Yes,



Q: In all different kinds of colors, for that matter. Right?



A: I think just three colors.



Q: Including a dark color. Right?



A: Yeah, barely. I mean, just three colors.



Q: What three colors?



A: Red, blue and white.



Q: Okay. You've seen him with dark --you've seen him with dark blue

sweats. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You just said "blue."



MR. LEONARD: Yeah.



THE WITNESS: Blue, but -- yeah, but like -- like the color of this

shirt (indicating). If you think this is dark.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever seen your father wearing a  pair of dark blue sweats

or black sweats?



A: Black, never, but --



Q: Dark blue?



A: No.



Q: Never?



A: Not dark blue. I wouldn't call it dark  blue.



Q: You can positively exclude that never worn dark blue sweats to your

knowledge?



A: To my knowledge, I can't say he's never worn them, but I'm telling

you I've never seen them.



Q: Have you ever seen them in his house?



A: No.



Q: Did you see the clothing that your father wore during the shooting

of a video, an exercise video that he made a few weeks before Nicole's

death?



A: No, I never saw that video.



Q: You never saw that video?



A: The workout video?



Q: Yes.



A: No, I never saw that.



Q: Did he give you any of the clothing that  he received from that

production?



A: No.



Q: Did you even know about that production?



A: I knew mostly about it during the trial.



Q: That's the first you learned about it?



A: Yeah.



Q: Were you at that Rockingham property during any of the filming?



A: No.



Q: Do you have any information or  explanation as to why your father's

watch cap was found at the crime scene?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of  foundation, calls for

speculation.



THE WITNESS: I didn't even know if he even  said it was his watch cap.

I always thought that they  found a watch cap. I never knew that they

concluded --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you believe that it belonged to your father?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: No. I never even seen my dad in a watch cap, so --



Q: Do you know whether he owned one?



A: No. That's what I'm saying. I don't think he -- I didn't even think

he had one.



Q: You weren't familiar with all his clothing, were you?



MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. I didn't hear that.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You were not familiar with all the clothing that your father owned

as of June of 1994. Correct?



A: Not all of it.



Q: Correct?



A: Yeah.



Q: Do you know whether your father owned Bruno Magli shoes?



A: I don't know.



Q: Do you know what Bruno Magli shoes are?



A: I do now.



Q: Before June of 1994 did you ever see or hear of Bruno Magli shoes?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did you ever own a pair?



A: No.



Q: After you saw shoes of the Bruno Magli type depicted in the

courtroom at your father's trial, you learned what they were. Right?



A: And not even then. I mean, just  recently. When they -- Geraldo had

did something because he got some -- that matter. Right?  property 

during any of the filming thing --



Q: The photograph?



A: Enquirer, yeah.



Q: In the National Enquirer?



A: Yeah. Yeah.



Q: Wearing a pair of Bruno Magli shoes?



A: Yeah, I saw some picture.



Q: Of your father?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you ask him when you saw that  photograph of him wearing the

Bruno Magli shoes?



A: This was like just a couple days ago I found out.



Q: I know. Did you ask him, "Hey, are those your shoes?"



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Why not?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. That's argumentative.



Go ahead.



THE WITNESS: First of all, information from the Enquirer, I don't

really tend to hold with much weight, so I don't think I would take

that --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Why? Because they pay for stories?



A: No. Because I've heard stories reported by them that were totally

wrong. Paying for stories,  hey, it seems like everybody's doing that

now, so, I mean, that's common practice.



Q: And you took money, too.



MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to object, because you are not

suggesting he took money for a story, are you?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You took money for photographs. Right?



A: For a photograph --



Q: Right.



A: -- I did.



Q: Okay. So --



MR. LEONARD: I just wanted to make sure that  was correct on the

record.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Anyway, when you saw this photograph of O.J. Simpson wearing Bruno

Magli shoes in the National Enquirer a few days ago, did you ask your

father about those shoes?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, I didn't.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ask anyone?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did you overhear any conversation about  whether -- about that

picture?



A: Did I hear any conversation?



Q: Yes.



A: No, because I didn't really hear what they were saying on the TV

because I was just flipping through. I didn't even have -- I didn't

even hear their conversation.



Q: Okay. Did you ever ask your father where he was between 9:30 and

11:00 on June 12, 1994?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Has he ever told you?



A: No.



Q: Never?



A: No.



Q: Never discussed it with you?



A: No. I've heard his explanation, but I've ever sat down and had that

conversation with him.



Q: Where have you heard his explanation?



A: I think I heard it throughout the case.



Q: What case?



A: What case?



Q: This case?



A: Yeah. Well -- yeah.



Q: Or the criminal case?



A: No, no.



Q: They are two separate cases.



A: The past case. I'm sorry. The criminal -- the previous case.



Q: What did you hear him say?



A: About with Kato and going to McDonald's and all that stuff.



Q: Tell me what O.J. Simpson said.



A: I could tell you what Kato said. I can't tell you what he said.



Q: How do you know what Kato said?



A: Because I watched it.



Q: No, no, no. You mean on television?



A: Yeah. And I was there I think at one point.



Q: At the trial?



A: Yeah, when Kato was there.



Q: I am only interested in your conversations with O.J. Simpson or

conversations which you heard O.J. Simpson say things, and we started

out his line by your telling me that you heard him give  his

explanation of his whereabouts between 9:30 and  11:00 on the evening

of June 12, and I now want you to  tell me what you heard O.J. Simpson

say about that.



A: Well, I never heard him say anything, then, if that's the case.



Q: What do you mean, "if that's the case"?



A: Well, I got what you said wrong.



Q: What does that mean?



A: I've heard -- I've heard testimony from him to the police when he

spoke to the police and everything that was released through that and

then through everything that he-or everything that went  on through

the case between a certain amount -- a certain time frame, and that's

what I guess I was gonna tell you. He's never said anything to me

about it, but...



Q: You've never been in the same room where  he discussed his

activities or his whereabouts between 9:30 and 11:00 on June 12?



A: No.



Q: And when did you overhear or when did you  hear about his statement

to the police?



A: I don't know. At some point on TV. They let out little things.



Q: So you have never spoken to your father at anytime or been in the

same room and heard your  father speak at any time about his

whereabouts on June 12, 1994. Is that true?



A: I think, yeah.



Q: You never once asked him where he was?



A: I never asked him, no.



Q: Why not?



A: Never thought to.



Q: Never occurred to you?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. That's argumentative. I instruct him not to

answer.



Next question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Don't you want to know who killed Nicole?



A: Yeah.



BY MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: So why don't you ask your father --



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- where he was?



A: Why don't I ask you.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Instruct the witness not to

answer the question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Because my blood wasn't found at the  crime scene.



MR. LEONARD: Come on.



THE WITNESS: Good answer.



MR. LEONARD: Come on.



MR.PETROCELLI: It's a good answer.



MR. LEONARD: Is there a question?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever discussed with your sister -- Sydney what happened to

Nicole that evening?



A: No.



Q: Or your brother Justin?



A: No.



Q: On the day your father was acquitted, you read a statement saying

that he was going to devote his life's work to finding the real killer

or killers of Nicole and Ron Goldman.



Do you remember that?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. What has he done to your knowledge  to find the real killer

or killers?



A: I have no idea.



Q: What have you done?



A: What have I done?



Q: Yes.



A: Did I pledge? I don't recall pledging anything to try to find out

who did it.



Q: Have you done anything?



A: No.



Q: Do you know whether O.J. Simpson has done  anything,



A: No, I don't know.



Q: Do you know whether anybody in your family has done anything to

find out --



A: I don't know, no.



Q: -- who committed these murders?



A: No, I don't know.



Q: Have you ever had a conversation with your father where you said,

you know, "I read that statement on your behalf to the world at large.

Dad, what have you done to fulfill your pledge?"



A: No, I never asked that.



Q: Do you care?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.  Instruct him not to answer.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You spoke to your sister Arnelle about  any of this?



A: Any of what?



Q: About finding the real killer or killers.



A: Not finding, no.



Q: What have you spoke to Arnelle about in  this regard?



A: Who the hell could have done something like this.



Q: And what did -- tell me about those conversations.



A: I mean, I can't remember everyone exactly, but, I mean, just

sitting there, like, "Why is this happening? Who? What? You know, This

just seems too crazy to be. "too crazy even to be real." You know,

why? Who? What?" But I can't tell you, you know, I couldn't give you a

date we --



Q: Did Arnelle identify any person who she thought might have killed

Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Did she identify any suspect to you?



A: No.



Q: Did she give you any thoughts or theories  as to who might have

done it?



A: No. We might have maybe agreed with a  couple or thought maybe some

sounded kinda plausible, but we never --



Q: And who sounded plausible?



A: Who did it?



Q: Yeah.



A: Oh, I can't think of anybody who actually  did it, but certain

little things.



Q: Like what?



A: Like Faye.



Q: Faye Resnick?



A: Yeah.



Q: What about Faye Resnick?



A: She's just a real suspect character, in my opinion.



Q: You think she murdered Nicole?



A: No, I don't think she did it.



Q: What do you think she has to do with Nicole's death?



A: I just think she -- she ran with a suspect crowd, and just being

around there and being around Nicole and even have the kids around it,

it's  just -- it's just -- it seems too fishy. She's just fishy.



Q: Is that the extent of your conversation  with Arnelle?



A: The extent of the conversation?



Q: Yeah.



A: Not in so many words, but, you know, I mean, that's basic --



Q: Is that the only name that's popped up in  your conversations with

Arnelle, is Faye Resnick?



A: Yeah, hers is the biggest, I think,  yeah.



Q: Who else pops up?



A: I think that's the only one. Nobody else's name really pops up.



Q: Before June 12, 1994, did you know Faye Resnick?



A: Yeah.



Q: Had you ever met her?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. How many times?



A: A handful of times.



Q: Where had you seen her?



A: Our home in Laguna. At Nicole's house.



Q: Yeah. At Bundy?



A: Nicole's house -- no, not at -- was it at Bundy? Yeah, I guess it

would have been at Bundy.



At my dad's house. And I think that's  about it.



Q: Did you ever have a conversation with  Faye about staying away from

Nicole, that she was a  bad influence on her?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you ever have that conversation with Nicole?



A: About staying away from Faye?



Q: Yes.



A: No, because I wasn't really aware of  their -- wasn't really aware

of what they were doing  or anything like that.



Q: You were not aware of what Nicole and Faye Resnick were doing in

the months leading up to Nicole's death. Correct?



A: No, I wasn't. I wasn't.



Q: So you never had any conversations with anybody on the subject of

whether Faye was fishy or suspicious?



A: Previous?



Q: Yes.



A: To?



Q: To Nicole's death.



A: No.



Q: And you never had a conversation with  O.J. Simpson about that

either before Nicole's death.  Right?



A: No, sir.



Q: Okay. So at no time did O.J. Simpson  tell you, you know, "I'm

really concerned about  Nicole. She's hanging out with Faye. She's

hanging out with the wrong crowd. She's leading a dangerous  life."

You had no conversations with O.J. Simpson  about that prior to

Nicole's death. True?



A: True.



Q: Okay. At any point in time from the  moment you learned of Nicole's

death to the present,  did you ever form a belief that your father

might be responsible for these deaths?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as it's not relevant, calls for

speculation, lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: I never formed a belief, no.



Q: Did you ever form a suspicion?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objections.



THE WITNESS: I formed a suspicion.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. And did you ever share your suspicion with Arnelle?



A: Probably, but I don't remember.



Q: Did Arnelle ever tell you that she, too formed a suspicion that

your father might be  responsible?



A: Never.



Q: Did she ever tell that you she thought your father was guilty?



A: No, never.



Q: Did she ever tell you that she thought  your father was innocent?



A: Yeah, she has.



Q: Has she given you any explanations for  the various items of

evidence that I recounted to you?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object on the same grounds I did before:

Lack of foundation,  speculation.



THE WITNESS: Like I said before, me and her talking, that just added

more confusion to the mix.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did she ever tell you why O.J. Simpson's blood was found at the

crime scene?



A: Did she tell me why?



Q: Did she give you an explanation as to why that blood was there?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: No.



MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation, lack of  foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You may answer.



A: No. She didn't know. She was just as  confused as I was.



Q: So based on all your conversations with  Arnelle, it is your

understanding that she doesn't  have any more information than you do

on the evidence. Correct?



A: Basically.



Q: Is that correct?



A: Basically.



Q: Okay. Did you ever ask Arnelle whether O.J. Simpson hit Nicole? Did

you ever discuss that subject with Arnelle?



A: With Arnelle, no.



Q: No?



A: No.



Q: Who have you talked to about that subject?



A: Nobody.



Q: Nobody?



A: No. This is the first time I ever really  talked about it.



Q: Okay. Did you ever have a conversation with Marquerite Simpson

about O.J. Simpson's  responsibility for the death of Ron and Nicole?



MR.LEONARD: Objection. It calls for  speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Did I ever have a talk with my  mom about his

responsibility?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah. In other words, whether he did it  or not.



A: I don't think we actually got into that,  no.



Q: Your mother never asked you any questions about where O.J. Simpson

was or whether he had anything to do with it? You never discussed the

subject at all with your mother?



A: No. She wanted -- she might have wanted to know questions about,

you know, what was it like, what were they like. You know, she was

curious.



Q: What was who like?



A: What was Nicole like, what were they like  together. She was

curious. She wanted to know. That was it. She never really asked about

the actual killing.



Q: You are talking about questions that she  asked you, what were

Nicole and O.J. like?



A: Yeah. Were they happy, what was going on  with them at the time.



Q: She asked you these questions after Nicole's murder. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: And what was going on at the time between  them and so forth.

Right?



A: What was their -- what was the state of  their affairs, you know,

the kids, what was it like,  you know, with the divorce and

everything, were they  together, were they apart.



Q: What did you say to her?



A: On what questions?



Q: In answers to all those questions.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. It's overbroad --



THE WITNESS: Say yes, no, maybe. Which questions?



MR.LEONARD: It's -- objection --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Tell me --



MR.LEONARD: Objection. It's overbroad. It's vague. You know, if you

want him to try to answer a  question like that --



BY MR. PETROCELLI



Q: Tell me what you told Marquerite about  what was happening between

O.J. Simpson and Nicole in their relationship at around the time of

Nicole's death.



A: I said, "I don't know."



Q: Did you tell -- what did you say in  answer to the question about

whether they were happy  together?



A: Last time I saw them together, they were cool with each other.



Q: "Cool"? What does "cool" mean?



A: "Cool" is a term, you see -- "cool" they seemed all right. They

seemed fine with each other. They didn't seem --Nicole didn't seem

really pissed off at my father, and my dad didn't really seem too

pissed off at Nicole. They were pretty civil.



Q: When was the last time you saw them together?



A. I never saw -- I didn't see them together I mean, one person --one

person's feeling toward the other, that was the general feeling I had,

 and that was around the time that he had gotten soup for her when she

was sick. He didn't have anything  bad to say about her. She didn't

have too much bad to say about him.



Q: Did you find out that they had split up  shortly before Nicole's

death?



A: See, that part confuses me. I don't remember. They had gotten

together and split up,  gotten together and split up so many times, I

don't remember. I'd come by sometimes; Nicole would be at  the house,

and they'd seem fine and everything would  be cool, and then I'd come

by again and Nicole wasn't  around or Nicole was doing something else.



So I really tried -- I didn't even try to get into it, you know. I

knew that sometimes they  were together and sometimes they were apart.



Q: Well, what was your understanding as of the morning that -- of June

12th or the afternoon of June 12th when Nicole called you and told you

that they were going to have dinner at Mezzaluna and not at Jackson's?



A: What was her what?



Q: What was your understanding at that point in time about the

relationship between Nicole and O.J. Simpson?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Calls for speculation, lack of

foundation.



THE WITNESS: I didn't really think anything of  it.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: In other words, did you think they were  split up during this time

or back together during this time?



A: No, no, I didn't think they were -- I didn't think they were

sleeping together. I knew -- I didn't think they were sleeping

together.



Q: You thought that their sexual/romantic relationship had ended.

Right?



A: Yeah, because they were always pretty  civil as far as the kids

went --



Q: Yeah.



A: -- I mean that day, I mean, he was at the recital, and other days,

you know, they were together, but they weren't, you know, romantically

--



Q: And did you have an understanding as to when the romantic

relationship ended --



A: Ended? Not --



Q: -- prior to Nicole's death?



BY MR. LEONARD: I am going to object because it's calling for

speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I would be speculating because I don't know whether or

not they were romantically  involved when he brought her the soup or

not. I don't  know. Maybe they weren't just doing it because she was

sick.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did there come a time --



MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. If you'd just sit up  a little bit, I think

you are going to be in the shot  a little bit better. There you go.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did there come a time in the last two or  three months of Nicole's

life when you learned that  their attempt at reconciling had come to

an end?



A: Not that I knew of



Q: No one ever said, "By the way, Nicole and I are finished," or "O.J.

and I are finished"?



A: Not to me.



Q: Did you hear from anyone that that had happened?



MR. LEONARD: At the time?



MR. PETROCELLI: Prior to Nicole's death.



MR. LEONARD: Okay.



THE WITNESS: No. I didn't hang around too much, you know. I was just

-I just came by once in  a while.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did Arnelle pick up the phone and say, "Dad and Nicole have split

up for good"?



A: No. Arnelle wouldn't do that.



Q: Why not?



A: I don't know. She just wouldn't. I mean, I knew they got divorced

when they got divorced, but, I mean, they were already divorced, so I

wouldn't  get a phone call saying, "Dad and Nicole split up for 

good." Arnelle wouldn't do that, you know.



Q: In any event, you didn't get any such  call. Right?



A: No, I didn't. I didn't.



Q: Okay. You had no information whatsoever  about the state of their

relationship other than that they were divorced, as of the date that

Nicole was killed. Right?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. I think that mischaracterizes his

testimony.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Well, you said you didn't think they were sleeping together, but

you have no basis for that. Right? Nobody told you that.



A: No, nobody told me.



MR. LEONARD: He said --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: After they were divorced --



MR. LEONARD: Excuse me-



MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. Let me ask a  different question.



MR. LEONARD: Okay.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: After they were divorced, did you ever learn that they had begun

sleeping together again?



A: Yes, I did.



Q: And how did you find that out?



A: When Nicole was at the house and they  were all lovey-dovey with

each other.



Q: Okay. And that's the first time that you  found out, by seeing them

together, not by someone announcing to you or telling you, "By the

way, they were getting back together"?



A: No. Did I make it seem that way? If I did, no. No. They were just

together.



Q: Okay. And when did that happen? Do you remember?



A: I don't remember the date. I don't remember dates.



Q: Did you talk to your father about, "Hey, what's going on? Are you

getting back with Nicole?" Did you have a conversation like that with

him?



A: No, I didn't get into it.



Q: Or with Nicole?



A: No, I didn't get into it. What they did  was what they did. I did

what I did.



Q: Okay. And you can't put a time frame on when you saw them

lovey-dovey together?



A: No. Let's see. It was a nice day out. Let's see. It was at some

point Nicole had just  gotten in a car accident with Faye, so, I mean,

I  don't know if you have a date on that. Something --



Q: Is that the last time you saw O.J. and Nicole lovey-dovey together?



A: No.



Q: When is the last time?



A: I think it was when we were all together, and when I say "all," it

was my father, myself, my girlfriend, my sister, a friend of my

sister's, Faye, her boyfriend at the time Christian. I think I already

said Nicole. We were all down in Laguna for a weekend, and everybody

was one big, happy family.



Q: Do you remember the month?



A: No, I don't.



Q: Is that the last time you can recall all  being together again as

one big, happy family?



A: That was the one time I can recall.



Q: That's the last time. Right?



A: Yeah. That I can remember.



Q: Was it before -- before Mother's Day 1994?



A: I don't remember.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We have to change the  tape here.



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape  No. 2.The time is

approximately 2:46, and we are off  the record.



(Recess.)



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The  time is approximately

3:00 o'clock. This is the beginning of tape No. 3.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When you were born in 1970, where did you first live?



A: Up on Mulholand off the 405.



Q: On Deep Canyon?



A: Not Deep Canyon.



Q: What was the name of the place?



A: The street was Elvill, I think.



Q: And at that time O.J. Simpson and Marquerite were married and

living together?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And when is the next house you lived in -- what is the next house

you lived in?



A: We got a house in Buffalo, so we lived in  Buffalo like, you know,

during the football season a couple times.



Q: And then --



A: And then Rockingham.



Q: And then Rockingham.



A: Yeah.



Q: So the -- you lived at this house on  Mulholand?



A: Yes.



Q: And in Buffalo.



A: Yeah, just during -- just a couple months out of the year.



Q: But all the time you were in Los Angeles until you moved to

Rockingham, you lived in this house on Mulholland?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: What's the name of the street again?



A: I think it's Elvill or Elvito. I don't remember, it's such a long

time ago.



Q: And your father left the household when?



A: Early '80s maybe. I'm sorry -- yeah, early '80s, late '70s.



Q: Late '70s? You were a young boy?



A: Yeah, ten, nine, maybe earlier. Seven. I mean, I know he was seeing

Nicole while my mom was married.



Q: How do you know that?



A: Both of them have told me. All three of  them, actually, have told

me. But I can't remember  when he actually moved out.



Q: Okay. And you first saw -- met Nicole  when?



A: First time I really -- first time I met  her I didn't know it was

her. First time I officially  met her had to be '81.



Q: The first time --



A: I don't know. It's a long time ago.



Q: The first time you met her when you didn't know it was her was

when?



A: My dad took me and a friend to see THE CHAMP, and Nicole and Denise

were there, and my dad said, "Look at those two girls. You think

they're pretty?" I mean, he knew them already.



Q: I see. But he didn't tell you.



A: He didn't think it right that I met them  yet, so it was just too

soon.



Q: Okay. And when your dad left the home, he then moved into

Rockingham?



A: When he left, no.



Q: Excuse me. You went to -- the whole  family moved to Rockingham,

including Marquerite. Right?



A: Yes, sir. Yes.



Q: And you lived with Marquerite and Arnelle  and your father at

Rockingham for a short period of  time?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: And then when your father and Marquerite split up, Marquerite left

the household. Right?



A: No. She stayed at the house, and he left  first.



Q: And then as part of their divorce, he kept the house and she moved

out?



A: Exactly.



Q: And then where did she move from Rockingham'



A: [Address deleted.]



Q: When she moved to Encino, did you move in with her at that time?



A: Yeah.



Q: With Arnelle?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. And you stayed at that Encino home  for how long?



A: Until the 6th grade, so --



Q: Then you moved to Rockingham. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see Nicole and O.J. Simpson get into any heated

arguments in your  presence?



A: Yeah.



Q: Where they were really pissed off at each  other, to use your

terminology?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. And how did each of them behave? Did they scream, They yell?

They throw things at one another?



A: I --



Q: Describe the arguments to me, the way they conducted themselves.



A: They would scream and yell at each other. I never seen them throw

things. I've seen maybe one  person walk out into the next room and

slam the door behind them, but that's the most actual physical thing

that I've seen.



Q: They would yell profanity at each other?



A: Yeah, I'm sure there was some profanity  in there.



Q: And what would they argue about in your presence?



MR. LEONARD: I'm going to object as being  vague, compound, overbroad.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: I don't know. I remember one time there  was bills were high in the

house, and there was some  argument  about that.



Q: Anything else?



A: There was some other stuff. I don't remember specifically what it

was.



Q: Do you remember whether they argued over infidelity on your

father's part?



A: Yeah, I know -- yeah, I'm sure I heard them arguing. I never know

exactly what it was about, but I had a -- I could tell by what Nicole

was arguing about that, you know, it was about something like that.



Q: And do you know who your father was seeing while she was -- while

he was living with  Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Object. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Do I know who he was seeing when  he was living with

Nicole?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes.



A: No. I mean, no.



Q: Do you know who he was unfaithful with?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No. Not specifically, no.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You don't have any knowledge or information about other women that

he was seeing?



A: No. I knew there were other women, but I didn't know exactly who.



Q: Well, you didn't know who they were. Is that what you're saying?



A: No.



Q: And how did you know there were other women?



A: I hear stories. And I know my dad, too, so...



Q: What do you mean, you "know" your dad"?



A: I know my dad. I know that he likes women.



Q: You ever see your dad hit another woman?



A: No.



Q: You ever see your dad restrain Nicole  physically?



A: Because they were upset or something?



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: Did you ever see Nicole hit your father?



A: No.



Q: When O.J. and Nicole split up, do you  know why they split up?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Not exactly.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you talk to either one of them about why their marriage was

coming to an end?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound.



THE WITNESS: I listened.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: To whom?



A: Both of them.



Q: As they talked to you?



A: Yeah, basically.



Q: What did they say to you?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound.



THE WITNESS: Nicole might talk about maybe my father's womanizing, and

my dad might talk about -- about whatever bugged him about Nicole and

about the  situation, how -- where is she going to live in relation --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: What did he say bugged him about Nicole?



A: I don't know. Being accused all the time  of actually doing

something with other women.



Q: He being falsely accused?



A: Yeah. Well, he would say that.



Q: And he said that would bug him?



A: Yeah. I thought it was kinda funny. I just don't think that was the

reason why they broke up with each other.



Q: What was the reason?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: I don't -- I mean, I don't know. It was a combination of

things, I'm sure.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you know what they are?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: No, I don't.



MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation.



You have to let me get an objection in, Jason.



THE WITNESS: Sorry.



MR. LEONARD: Want to go through that again?



MR. PETROCELLI: No. It's all right.



MR. LEONARD: Okay.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When Nicole moved into the Gretna Green  place, did you talk to her

about men that she was dating?



A: Never.



Q: Never?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever meet or see any of the men she was dating?



A: Yeah, I met one guy, but I didn't know  she was dating him until

after, when I saw him during -- and I say "after," I mean after the

killing. I didn't know she was seeing him until I saw him on TV and

"Geraldo" and stuff like that.



Q: And who was this guy?



A: What's his name --



Q: Keith Zlomsowitzh?



A: Yeah, the tan guy, yeah. I saw him at the house, but I didn't know

they were seeing each  other.



Q: Nicole never discussed any of that with  you. Right?



A: No, she didn't tell me she was seeing  him. I don't know if they

were, though. I thought  they were just friends at the time. I thought

he was in the restaurant business or something, because we  spoke

about restaurants.



Q: Prior to Nicole's death do you know  whether she was involved in

the use of drugs?



A: I don't know if she was involved with drugs, no.



Q: And do you know whether Faye Resnick was?



A: Prior to her death, no.



Q: Okay. Do you know of anybody other than O.J. Simpson who would have

a reason to kill Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: I can't understand why anybody would want  to kill Nicole or Ron.



Q: Well, you didn't know Ron. Right?



A: I can't see why anybody would want to kill anybody.



Q: But you knew Nicole. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: And you don't know of anybody that she  was having any

confrontations or conflicts with,  putting aside O.J. Simpson?



A: I don't know anybody, no.



Q: Excuse me?



A: I didn't know of anybody she had any  conflicts with. Enough to

kill her?



Q: Any conflicts --



A: No.



Q: -- or confrontations with. Excuse me? The answer is no. Correct?



A: No, yeah.



Q: So she never told you about anybody that she was having a problem

with. Right?



A: Not that she was having a problem with.



Q: Correct?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. For example, she never told you  that one of her -- one of

the men that she was seeing she was having a real problem with or he

was giving her a hard time or anything like that. Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: Did you buy Nicole a birthday present for  her birthday in May of

1994?



A: May of '94.



Q: Her last birthday.



A: No, I don't think I did.



Q: Do you know whether your -- whether  O.J. Simpson did?



A: I don't know.



Q: Do you know whether O.J. Simpson was  seeing Paula Barbieri near

the end of Nicole's life?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: I don't. I don't know if he was seeing her at that time.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When was the last time before Nicole's death that you had seen

Paula Barbieri?



A: I don't even know. I don't even know. I've only seen her a handful

of times.



Q: When was the last time before Nicole's death?



A: I really couldn't even tell you. I think I saw Paula maybe four or

five times. I wasn't real  tight with Paula or anything. I'm not now.



Q: Did you know that Paula Barbieri had  gone with O.J. Simpson to

Palm Springs on Memorial Day  weekend, 1994?



MR. LEONARD: Are you asking if he knows that  now or if he --



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.



Q: Whether you knew it at the time that they had gone off together.



A: Memorial Day weekend?



Q: Yeah.



A: '94?



Q: Yes.



A: That was the weekend of the barbeque. He was at the house.



Q: That was on a Monday, the barbeque. I am talking about the Saturday

and Sunday.



A: Oh, no, I didn't know.



Q: You didn't know any of that?



A: No, I didn't know.



Q: And was Paula Barbieri at that barbeque?



A: No. I didn't see her there if she was. I don't think she was.



Q: Were friends and family at that barbeque?



A: Yeah. Four family members and the rest was friends.



Q: Did you invite Nicole?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did you invite Sydney and Justin?



A: Yes. I think Nicole was sick still.



Q: Did you -- you didn't invite her.



A: No, I didn't. Sorry.



Q: Okay. What family members were there?



A: Sydney, Justin. My Aunt Shirley and my  Uncle Benny surprised us.

They were coming back from a reunion, so they stopped by on the way,

and then my  dad came home and my sister. That's all the family was

there.



Q: And do you have any understanding as to why Nicole was not there?



A: It was my sister's friends and my friends. It was a bunch of kids.

It was a barbeque for a bunch of younger folks. I didn't even expect

my dad to come, to be perfectly honest.



Q: He showed up unexpectedly?



A: I think Arnelle knew he was coming. I didn't think he was gonna

come.



Q: Okay. And during the week of -- first  week of June, do you know if

your father went out of town at all?



A: No.



Q: What about the second week of June?



A: Yeah, I knew he went to Chicago, but --



Q: Before the Chicago trip, did you know where any of -- where he went

out of town?



A: I have no idea.



Q: Did you know that he went back East to Connecticut and Long Island?



A: No idea.



Q: Did he call you from the East?



A: Never.



Q: Okay. Did you speak to your father on  June 12, 1994 --



A: No.



Q: -- the day of the recital and of Nicole's murder?



A: No.



Q: Did you speak to him on June 11?



A: No.



Q: In person or telephone?



A: No, I don't think so.



Q: And not on June 12 either. Right?



A: No.



Q: What about Friday June 9, the day he arrived back from New York?



A: Uh-uh. I don't remember when the last  time was I saw him.



Q: When was the last time before Nicole's  death that you spoke to

your father?



A: I'd have to guess. It would be at the barbeque, that Memorial Day

barbeque.



Q: Was it Labor Day or Memorial Day?



A: Memorial Day.



Q: You didn't tell your father that you were  going to see him at the

recital -- or see him at  dinner, I should say, following the recital?



A: At the barbeque. I knew I wasn't going  to be going to the recital.

In the first place, I wouldn't have said that to him. So, no. I mean,

I don't remember -- I just remember seeing him at the barbeque, and

that was it. I never --



Q: Did you say, "I'll see you at Jackson's, where everyone is going to

after the recital"?



A: I hadn't known that yet until the Friday or Saturday before I --



Q: So you had no conversation with him at the barbeque about seeing

him at the recital --



A: Yes.



Q: -is that right?



A: Right. I didn't have a conversation with him at all about any of

that.



Q: None.



A: No.



Q: And did you have any conversation with him at the barbeque about

Nicole?



A: No.



Q: How he was feeling towards her, what was  going on in their life,

how she was, anything like that?



A: No.



Q: Okay. By the way, what was the  relationship like prior to Nicole's

death between O.J. Simpson and Sydney Simpson?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as being vague.



Go ahead if you can answer.



THE WITNESS: It was -- it wasn't -- there  didn't seem like anything

wrong to me. I didn't see a problem.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You didn't see any problems in that?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did Sydney ever talk to you or complain  to you or talk to you

about her father?



A: Yeah.



Q: And did she ever complain about him?



A: Sometimes.



Q: What would she say?



A: "Dad is being dorky," or "goofy" or  whatever. But not -- I mean,

not like "I hate him" or  anything like that.



Q: So from your observations, there was a  normal relationship there?



A: Yes.



Q: And with Justin also?



A: Justin, yeah.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see your father spank either Sydney or Justin?



A: I've never seen it, no.



Q: Last time you were hit by your father was when you were how old?



A: I don't remember. I mean, I gotta guess.



Q: 14, you said?



A: I'd have to guess. I'd say 14.



Q: Did he ever hit you with anything other than a belt?



A: Never.



Q: Okay. Let's go back to the telephone call that you had with Nicole

on June 12. Who called  whom?



A: I don't remember. I probably called her, though, I would think,

just to find out exactly how  many people were coming, you know, that

whole thing.  I think I did call her, actually, to find out exactly 

how many people, if they wanted like, you know, a  fixed menu. "What

time do you think you guys are going to be there?"



Q: What did she say to you?



A: What?



Q: Tell me what she said after you called  her.



A: She said she didn't think that they were  gonna be swinging by

Jackson's because it was just too expensive, and the kids, by the time

they got way out there, they're gonna be all restless, and by the --

you know, "We're just gonna have dinner up the street."



I mean, she went to Mezzaluna all the time so it was just easier for

her. I figured okay, fine go. I was kinda hurt; I wish they would have

come to the restaurant, but now I really wish they would have come to

the restaurant, but she wanted to go to Mezzaluna.



Q: Did she tell you that O.J. Simpson would be going to the dinner?



A: She -- no, it never came up.



Q: That didn't come up?



A: It didn't. Because actually I was calling to find out how many

people and who was coming, so once I found out they weren't gonna be

coming at all, it was moot.



Q: When you first spoke to her about coming to Jackson's either Friday

or Saturday before the 12th, did she tell you that Mr. Simpson would

be attending this dinner?



A: She never -- that was never brought up.



Q: Your understanding was that the whole  family would be coming, and

if he was at the recital, he would come also. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Excuse me?



MR. LEONARD:-- lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



You may answer.



A: Yeah, I would assume he would be there if he was in town.



Q: Did you learn after the -- you learned after the recital that he

did not attend the dinner at  Mezzaluna. Right?



A: Yes.



Q: And did you find out why he didn't  attend?



A: From my understanding, it's because she didn't want him there.



Q: How did you find that out?



A: Through the previous case.



Q: Did you ever ask your father why he did  not go Mezzaluna for

dinner?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Did you ever ask your father why Nicole did not want him to go and

did not invite him to go?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, I didn't.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked anybody about that?



A: About why he didn't go?



Q: Yes.



A: No, I didn't.



Q: Have you come to learn since Nicole's murder that there was a

severe conflict in your father's relationship with Nicole just before

her death?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: That seems to be the general belief, I guess, now.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked your father about that?



A: No, I haven't.



Q: Do you know that he wrote her a letter dated June 6 concerning her

possible violation of IRS laws?



A: No --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: -- I never knew that.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You didn't know that?



A: No.



Q: Never seen that letter?



A: No.



Q: Did you know that he was threatening to report her to the

authorities?



MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I can't ask you a question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: For violating tax laws, did you have any information like that?



A: No, I didn't. I didn't know anything.



Q: Does that come as a surprise to you, that your father would do such

a thing?



A: Yeah. I was just about to ask you. For what?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: I'll show you the letter.  Did you believe Nicole to be an honest

person?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Did you ever know her to lie to  you?



A: Not that I know of.



Q: Okay. Are you aware that she wrote down in her own handwriting

incidents of abuse at the hands of your father?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Am I aware that she did it?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes.



A: I heard that she did it.



Q: Have you ever seen her notes?



A: No, I haven't.



Q: Have you ever asked your father about them?



A: No, I haven't.



Q: Excuse me for a second while I find these exhibits.



(Pause in the proceeding.)



MR. PETROCELLI: You know the exhibit number,  Dan?



MR LEONARD: No, I'm sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Let me show you Exhibit 52. Do you  recognize the signature as your

father's?



A: Half of it, yeah.



Q: Where it says "O.J."?



A: Yeah.  Do you mind if I read it?



Q: You can read it.



(Witness reviews document.)



A: You know what? I am aware of it, but I didn't know it was for that

stuff. I just -- I thought he -- I remember him saying something about

he just was gonna tell her not to use his address for anything to be

mailed, but I didn't know it was stuff. I remember hearing him just

saying something in passing.



Q: When did he tell you that?



A: I don't know. At some point.



Q: Before Nicole's death?



A: At some point before this, I guess,  yeah.



Q: Before June of 1994?



A: Yes.



Q: Tell me as best you can recall what he said to you about this

subject.



A: He had brought it to my attention that he was drafting a paper --

oh, sorry -- he was drafting a  paper and telling Nicole to stop using

Rockingham as an address to mail her mail. Here it says taxes and 

stuff. I didn't realize -- he wasn't specific like  that. I didn't

really think too much of it because  I'm like, well, so what, you

know, mail.



Q: Did he tell you why he was writing such a letter to Nicole?



A: No. Something like I would do in high school or something like

that. It was chintzy. Just seemed like he gets tired of looking at her

mail. You now, "Why don't you just have it mailed to your house?"

That's the way I took it.



Q: Did you understand that they were going through -- a little fight

or something at this time?



A: They must be if he's doing something so small. But this is taxes.

That -- I would see  something for a sale at Theodore and it said, 

"Nicole," and he'd be like (Sound), you know, and it as like, okay,

whatever.



You know, it was divorce stuff. I'd seen it with my mom and my dad.

I've seen it with my friends' parents when they were getting divorced.

It  was typical divorce stuff. I didn't know it was tax, though,

whatever that is.



Q: This is another letter, Exhibit 53 June 8, 1994, which is four days

before Nicole's  death. It says:



"Dear Nicole, to set the  record straight, when Arnelle, Jason or

myself are at home to watch the kids, especially around the pool, they

are welcome here at any time. I would love to have them 24 hours a

day, as it is their home, too. However, Gigi is not an emergency cook,

baby sitter or mad runner for you. She's an employee of mine and I

expect you to respect that now and in the future." Do you know

anything about that letter?



A: No. That's a little hard-core but, no, I didn't know about that.



Q: Okay. Did you have any argument with Nicole before her death about

her coming to the house?



A: No.



Q: Did you know of any argument between  Nicole and Gigi?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation --



THE WITNESS: No.



MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: Sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: These are Nicole's notes that she made.  This is Exhibit 86. Do you

recognize the handwriting as Nicole's?



A: Yes, I do.



Q: Okay. Nicole has several pages of notes dealing with Justin and

Sydney and whether their dad was picking them up or taking them home

or on time, things like this with Justin and Sydney.



Do you recall in the months before Nicole's death any arguments

between O.J. and Nicole about Sydney and Justin?



MR. LEONARD: Are you asking if he overheard any such --



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You're not aware of anything?



A: No. No. Between -- no.



Q: Were they fighting about the children --



A: No, I've never heard --



Q: -- to your knowledge?



A: No. No.



Q: You know nothing about that?



A: Uh-uh. No. Sorry.



Q: Okay. On June 3 Nicole writes:



O.J. came to pick up kids at  8:30 p.m. They wanted to stay home cuz I

let them organize sleep overs at last minute -- thought daddy wasn't

coming." Do you have any knowledge of whether your father was supposed

to pick up the kids on June 3 but got there too late to get them?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you have any information about that?



A: I have no clue about that. This is all news to me.



Q: She writes:



"Told O.J. I'd drop them off 1st thing in the morning [sic]. He said

OK. Then 'You hung up on  me last nite, you're gonna pay for this

bitch, you're holding money  from the IRS, you're going to jail you

f---ing c--t. You think you  can do any f---ing thing you want, 

you've got it coming -- I've already  talked to my lawyers about this,

bitch - they'll get you for tax evasion bitch I'll see to it.  You're

not gonna have a f---ing dime left, bitch, etc."' This was all being

said as Sydney's girlfriend Allegra was being dropped off.



You want to take a look at that?



MR. LEONARD: Is there a question?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, I'm going to ask him a couple questions about

that.



MR. LEONARD: Was that part of a question, what you just --



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, it is.



THE WITNESS: Go ahead. Go ahead.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever heard -- well, first of  all, were you aware of any

argument between Nicole and  O.J. on -- along the lines of what Nicole

wrote in her  notes?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, lack of  foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, not like this. This doesn't  even sound like he

talks.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: My next question was: Have you ever heard your father use language

like that --



A: No.



Q: -- towards Nicole?



A: The C word? No way. No. Not like that.



Q: You know of any reason why Nicole would make such things up?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, I don't. No, I don't.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ever hear your father curse at Nicole like other than the C

word, call her a bitch  and things like that?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: No.



Q: Never?



A: I've heard him cuss, but not call her names.



Q: You ever hear him call her a bitch to her face?



A: Not that I remember he ever called her a  bitch.



Q: Nicole ever tell you that she was afraid of O.J. Simpson?



A: No.



Q: Did she ever tell you that he had a very violent temper?



A: She never said that to me, no.



Q: She ever tell you that he -- that  she had to call the police on

him at Gretna Green?



A: No, she never told me.



Q: You heard your father's voice on the tape, the 911 tape?



A: Yes.



Q: You heard how angry he was on that tape?



A: Yes.



Q: You heard him ranting and raving and  cursing?



A: Yes.



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever hear him do that?



A: I've heard him arguing, yeah, yelling, yeah.



Q: Like you heard him on the tape?



A: Yeah, not that much different. Sometimes. Once or twice.



Q: You've heard him arguing with Nicole  like how he sounded on the

911 tape?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. You are  asking him to remember

something he heard at a trial months ago, to compare that to something

else that may have occurred a long time? That's what you want to ask

him?



MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly.



MR. LEONARD: Okay. I am objecting. I think it's an unfair question.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Go ahead.



A: I've heard both of them but, yeah, he was -- he was at that level,

but her voice was, too. So they were --



Q: You heard them --



A: -- both trying to get over each other's  voice.



Q: When you heard them fighting like that,  like at the level of

intensity and anger, as reflected  by that 911 tape, what were they

fighting about?



A: The 911 tape, I don't know.



Q: The ones you heard.



A: I don't remember. I don't remember  specifically. It was usually

behind a closed door. I  can hear them yelling. I wasn't trying to get

into it  because, I didn't like to hear it; I wasn't  trying to hear

something I didn't want to hear in the  first place.



Q: Were you with O.J. Simpson and Nicole on Christmas 1988 when they

went to Hawaii?



A: No, I wasn't.



Q: Did you hear about an incident when O.J. got upset with Nicole

because she permitted a gay man to kiss Justin?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Are you -- did you ever hear about an incident when your

father beat Nicole in their apartment in San Francisco and threw her

clothes out  of a window?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No, I haven't heard that one either



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: During Nicole's and O.J.'s divorce, did  your father ever tell you

that Nicole was inventing stories of abuse against him?



A: Absolutely not.



Q: Do you have any understanding or information as to why Nicole would

write these incidents of abuse in her own handwriting --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- if they were not true?



MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation. It's argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. You can answer.



A: No.



Q: It wasn't your experience with Nicole in all the years you knew her

that she would lie about  serious things. Correct?



A: No, she wouldn't do something like that.



Q: And it wasn't your experience with Nicole  that she would do things

to hurt your father. Right?



A: No.



Q: You've never asked your father since the  murder of Nicole whether

he hit her, whether he ever  hit her?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: You never discussed that with him?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: He has never come to you and said, you  know, "We never had any

altercations. "We did" or  ever come to you at all to discuss that

subject?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: No, he hasn't.



Q: Okay. Are you familiar with an incident where your father hit

Nicole and put her in the wine closet at the Rockingham house?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I'm aware of the story.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You are?



A: Yeah.



Q: You heard all those stories during the  criminal trial?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you think that they were all fabricated?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: All of them?



MR. LEONARD: -- lack of foundation --



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes. You can answer.



MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation, calls  for conclusion.



THE WITNESS: No. That one just seemed really  far -- really

far-fetched to me.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When you heard these stories, did you do anything to find out if

they were true or not?



A: Such as?



Q: Whatever. Ask Arnelle?



A: Investigate?



Q: Ask Arnelle, ask Marquerite, ask anyone, "Hey, is that true?"



A: Why would I ask Arnelle? I mean...



Q: Do you think that's a preposterous thing  to do? Is that what

you're suggesting? You're looking at me like I'm crazy.



A: Well, no. Arnelle, I don't think she knows anything.



Q: How do you know that?



A: Because she was just as surprised as I was.



Q: How do you know that?



A: Because like I said, when we just talked to each other, we -- when

we would watch or we would  see or hear this testimony, we were just

as surprised  to hear it. That's why if she obviously didn't know  it,

I didn't know it. Why would I ask her.



Q: So you and she have talked about this, and both of you have told

each other that you had no  knowledge of any of these incidents of

abuse. Is that what you're saying?



A: We didn't -- no, we didn't look at each other and say we had no

knowledge. We were just surprised. We were listening to it --



Q: And the implication --



A: -- dumbfounded.



Q: -- being that neither of you had any knowledge of this. Is that

right?



A: Something like that?



Q: Yeah.



A: Yeah. Like that, yeah.



Q: And neither of you -- and both of you  were just as -- and both of

you were shocked when you heard these things in court. Right?



A: Like that, yeah. The 911 tape, to me heard it that -- I mean, I

wasn't shocked to hear  that. That was bad; it was disturbing, but me

personally wasn't shocked. I don't know about Arnelle. That's

different. She didn't grow up with  my father.



Q: You were disturbed by the 911 tape but  not shocked.



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay.  And you were disturbed by hearing  these other things as

well right, these incidents of physical abuse?



A: The physical abuse all disturbed me.



Q: Just like the 911 tape?



A: And those shocked me, yeah.



Q: Did you -- you weren't shocked about the 911 tape because you had

been used to hearing your father talk like that at times?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. That mischaracterizes his evidence.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Right?



MR. LEONARD: That's argumentative. I instruct  him not to answer



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You weren't shocked when you heard him on the 911 tape, just

disturbed but not shocked, because you had heard him like that before.

Correct?



A: I was disturbed because -- yeah because I heard him yelling. I've

heard that, but I've heard  him yelling before.



Q: Yes.



A: Yeah.



Q: That's why you weren't shocked when you heard it on the 911 tape.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Correct?



A: I would be shocked to find out that Nicole was physically beaten

up. I wouldn't be shocked to find out -- to hear somebody yelling in

the background or somebody yelling. That doesn't shock, to hear people

yell.



Q: That doesn't shock you --



A: It shocks me to hear people or see people  hurt other people.



Q: Did you -- when you listened to that 911  tape and knowing Nicole,

did you sense fear in her  voice?



A: Yeah, she sounded scared.



Q: Did that shock you, that your father could frighten her that badly?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you go to Michael Millitello's wedding at the Ritz Carlton?



A: No. I don't even know --



Q: Do you know who he is?



A: I remember hearing the name, but I don't  even know who that is

really.



Q: Who were your father's close friends in June of 1994?



A: Close friends? I would have to say A.C. --



Q: Who?



A: Allen Cowlings.



Q: A.C.?



A: Yeah. June of '94? Allen's always been his friend. Who else. I

don't know who he was really tight with, who his really close friends

were. Sorry.



Q: You can't identify any close friends in June of 1994 other than

A.C. Cowlings?



A: No, because my dad hangs around with a  lot of people, and I don't

hang around my dad that  much, so I don't know. One week he could be

with a  group of people, you know, and another -- next week see him

with another group of people.



Like I said, I don't hang around that much. I stop in a couple times a

week, grab a sandwich, do my laundry or something, and I'm back  home

to my apartment again.



Q: Where -- you were working on the night  of June 12?



A: Yes.



Q: When did you leave work?



A: I think -- I think it was around 10:00, 10:30.



Q: Did you punch out?



A: Yeah.



Q: Where did you go?



A: Home, to my apartment.



Q: What time did you get there?



A: I don't remember. It had to be around between 10:30 and 11:00.



Q: Your apartment on Sycamore?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: How far was that from your job, which was  Jackson's at that time?



A: About three miles.



Q: Okay. And when you got to your apartment  at Sycamore around 10:30

or so, did you call anyone?



A: I might have called my girlfriend.



Q: And who was that?



A: [Name Deleted].



Q: Do you know if you did?



A: I don't remember, no.



Q: Has she told you that you and she talked  that evening?



A: No. No.



Q: Okay. What did you do at your house when  you got these?



A: Watched TV.



Q: Do you remember what you watched?



A: Not exactly.



Q: What time did you go to sleep?



A: Not till probably late, 3:00.



Q: So from 10:30 to 3:00 you  watched television?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you eat?



A: Probably.



Q: Did you drink anything?



A: Probably. I don't know.



Q: What did you drink?



A: Cranberry juice maybe.



Q: Did you drink any alcohol?



A: No.



Q: Did you take any drugs?



A: No.



Q: You think you spoke to [Name Deleted]?



A: Maybe.



Q: Did you make any plans to do anything?



A: That night?



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: Did you call over to anyone in the family to find out how the

recital went?



A: No.



Q: Did you call Sydney or Justin --



A: It was too late, no.



Q: -- or Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Or your father?



A: No.



Q: You didn't even know where your father  was. Right?



A: No.



Q: You didn't know he was going to Chicago.  Right?



A: No. No.



Q: The last time you had spoken to him was the barbeque on the 31st of

May. Right?



A: To the best of my recollection.



Q: Okay. So when you came home on June 12  from work, you had no idea

where O.J. Simpson was.  Correct?



A: I wasn't even thinking about my family,  to be perfectly honest.



Q: And you didn't know where he was that  evening. Right?



A: No.



Q: And you didn't know what his plans were. Right?



A: No.



Q: Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: Okay. Did you then get a phone call sometime in the middle of the

morning?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: From whom?



A: From first my sister, but I didn't answer the phone.



Q: Why not?



A: I didn't want to get up. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know

what time it was.



Q: How do you know it was your sister?



A: I found out. In retrospect I know it was  my sister.



Q: Did you have an answering machine?



A: Yeah. It was --



Q: Was the answering machine on?



A: The volume was turned down low.



Q: So you didn't hear the message being  recorded?



A: No.



Q: You still have that answering machine message tape?



A: I think so.



Q: Can you bring it to the deposition at the next session, please?



A: Sure.



Q: With the machine so that we can hear the message?



A: Sure. Well, it's not -- I don't have  the message on the machine

anymore.



Q: You don't?



A: No.



Q: You erased it?



A: I didn't erase it. I just rewinded it.



Q: You just rewind it.



Q: I see. Okay. So you learned later on that you had that message.



A: Yeah.  Can I tell you what the message --



Q: Yes.



A: I mean, she just said, "Jason, call me  back."



Q: That's all.



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. What's the first thing that  happened in the middle of the

night or the next morning that you recall?



A: Well, then I got another phone call, and I decided to pick it up

this time because I figured it must -- whatever, I got to pick it up.



Q: And what time was it?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Who was it?



A: My mom.



Q: What did she say?



A: She said, "Call your sister. It's important."



Q: Nothing else?



A: I don't think so.



Q: Did she tell you what had happened?



A: I was groggy. No, my mom didn't tell me.



Q: You called your sister?



A: I think so. No. You know what? I didn't talk to my mom. I can't

remember if I talked  to my mom, 'cause it was so early. I think I

talked  to my mom, hung up the phone. I can't remember if I  called

the house and Arnelle picked up the phone or if  Arnelle ended up

calling me back, but I did talk to Arnelle. It was the third phone

call made, and she  told me.



Q: You talked to your mother. She said, "Call Arnelle. "



A: She said, "Did Arnelle talk to you?" She said, "Jason, you need to

talk to her."



I said, "I don't know. The phone just rang." I said, "Okay, fine," and

I hung up the phone.



I can't remember then if I picked up the phone, called the house and

got Arnelle or if I just put the phone down and the phone rang again.



Q: Anyway, the next call was with Arnelle?



A: Yes.



Q: And what time was it?



A: When was it. 6:30, 7:00.



Q: What did Arnelle say?



A: She -- she said, "Jason, you need to come  to dad's house." She

said, "Jason," she said, "Nicole had -- Nicole had just died."



Q: What did you say?



A: I don't think I said anything. I was -- I said, "How?" I couldn't

figure out how. I thought  she had died of steroids or something. I

thought she was taking steroids because her body, every time I saw

her, had changed. I thought -- I don't know. I thought she had a heart

attack or something.



And Arnelle said, "No. She was killed,"  and that's it, and I hung up

the phone.



Q: Did she tell you how she was killed?



A: No.



Q: Is that the end of the conversation: "She was killed"?



A: "She was killed.". "She's been killed."



Q: Was anything said about your father?



A: I just hung up the phone. I said, "I'm coming over now. " I hung up

and got in my car immediately.



Q: No conversation about O.J. Simpson in the call with Arnelle?



A: No. I just got in my car. I left.



Q: Okay. And when you arrived, you went to  Rockingham?



A: I first went to my girlfriend's house on  the way 'cause I couldn't

drive. I couldn't breathe.  I couldn't do anything. I told you before,

I have epilepsy. I have to take my pills in the morning and  at night.

Sometimes -- you know, when I'm scared -- I didn't want to get too

overly excited, and on the way  I just had to pull over, and I was

right by her house, so I went there and I banged on her door, kinda 

collapsed there for a second, and -- no more than five minutes, and

said, "I gotta go get Arnelle." So I went to the house, Rockingham.



Q: With your girlfriend?



A: No. By myself. I just said, "I gotta leave."



Q: And what happened when you got to Rockingham?



A: Arnelle was outside with Kato. We couldn't go anywhere. They were

out on the curb. I tried to find out what was happening. I was asking

questions, and Kato couldn't answer any questions.  Arnelle couldn't

answer any questions. She couldn't say anything. And I tried to ask

the police. They wouldn't tell me anything.



Q: This was outside the property?



A: Yeah. They wouldn't -- they wouldn't let in. They wouldn't let us

do -- I couldn't find anything out. All I know is that Nicole's dead.

I didn't know where dad was. I was so far out of the picture, I felt

like --



Q: Did at this time Arnelle tell you that  they were trying to pin

this on your father?



A: No, she never said that.



Q: There wasn't any suspicion at that time  that they were trying to

--



A: He was out of town. When I found out he  was out of town, I was

like, "Well, when he's coming back?"



Q: Who did you ask that to?



A: Arnelle said, "Well" -- I said, "Well, where's dad?"



And she said, "He's out of town."



"Does he know?" you know, I think. And I asked questions about the

kids.



Q: What did Arnelle say when you said, "Does  he know?" You asked

Arnelle, "Does he know?" and what did she say?



A: I said, "What about dad, does he know?"  And she said, "Well, he's

out of town."



Q: Did Arnelle indicate to you whether or not she had spoken to your

father?



A: No, she never said that to me. I found  that out later.



Q: What did you find out later?



A: That she had talked to him on the phone.



Q: Before she saw you outside on the property?



A: Yes.



Q: How did you find that out?



A: TV.



Q: Did you ever ask Arnelle?



A: I think. Maybe -- I probably did. I don't remember exactly. I mean,

we did go over everything over and over and over again. I can't

remember, though, exactly.



Q: Who went over and over and over?



A: My sister and myself.



Q: When did you do that?



A: Later that night.



Q: On the 13th?



A: Yes.



Q: You mean the two of you were talking to each other, going over

everything that had happened during the day?



A: Trying to piece together the course of events from when she found

out to then.



Q: Where was Arnelle during the evening of June 12?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did she tell you where she was?



A: I still don't know to this day. She was out. I don't know exactly

what she was doing.



Q: You don't know?



A: I don't know if it was a movie or something. I'm not going to

speculate, though. She was out.



Q: Did she tell you?



A: No. She might have told me, but I forgot, but she's always out.



Q: Okay. When did you first hear from your father?



A: The 13th. The 13th when he came home, and I -- I then came to the

house.



Q: So you saw him for the first time at the  house on Rockingham

sometime in the evening of Monday, June 13?



A: Exactly.



Q: He had not spoken to you on the telephone  yet?



A: No, I didn't -- no. No.



Q: Do you know whether he tried calling you?



A: No, I don't know.



Q: Were there any messages on your answering machine from him?



A: I don't remember.



Q: When you went home later that day and checked your messages, you

then heard the message from Arnelle that you received in the early

morning?



A: No. I think I might have gone out and  replayed it once my mom said

to call Arnelle and Arnelle said to come. I think I might have checked

it  then.



Q: Okay. No messages from your father --



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q:-- at any time on the 13th?



A: I don't believe so.



Q: Okay. When you saw your father on the  evening of the 13th, what

did you say to him and what did he say to you?



A: I think the first thing I said was, "I love you," and held him, and

we -- he was in the  living room, and we went into the kitchen, and we

just held each other.



Q: Just the two of you?



A: There were a couple people walking in and  out. I don't remember --



Q: What did he say to you?



A: He couldn't really say anything. And I started to talk about --

because I had talked to Justin, I started to talk about my

conversation with  Justin.



Q: What was your conversation with Justin?



A: I wanted to know what he knew, what his state of mind was and what

his -- how he was.



Q: When did you talk to Justin?



A: I talked to Justin from my apartment some point in the afternoon of

that day, the 13th.



Q: By telephone?



A: Yeah.



Q: They were at the Brown residence?



A: Yeah, they were in Laguna.



Q: You also spoke to Sydney?



A: I didn't speak to Sydney. I don't think  she wanted to talk on the

phone or something.



MR. LEONARD: You have to speak up.



THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Sorry.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You said you did not speak to Syndey --



A: I don't feel like talking loud about all this.



Q: -- because why?



A: Sorry. I didn't talk to -- I'm sorry.



A: What did you just say?



Q: I said, did you also talk to Sydney?



A: No, I didn't talk to Sydney.



Q: You spoke to Justin on the telephone, and  tell us what that --

tell us what was said in that  conversation.



A: I wanted to know how he was doing, how he was, what he was doing. I

was kinda stuck because I didn't know what to say to him, but I wanted

to talk to him. You know, I mean, I found myself talking to him, but

then I was like, you know, Christ, what just happened, you know. I

didn't -- and then I was stuck. I didn't know what the hell to say to

him.



And then he just told me, "Mommy's dead," and then I just collapsed,

told him I couldn't talk to him and that I'd talk to him later and

that I loved him.



Q: You called him back -- oh, you said you would talk to him later.



A: Yeah.



Q: Did he tell you anything about what had  happened that evening?



A: No. I didn't ask him.



Q: And have you ever?



A: No.



Q: And you haven't asked Sydney. Right?



A: No.



Q: Do you know anybody who has?



A: Not to my knowledge.



Q: Do you know of anyone who has told you  what Sydney has said about

that evening?



A: No.



Q: You told your father on the evening of the 13th when you were in

the kitchen with him what transpired in your call with Justin?



A: Yeah. Yes.



Q: By this time did you have any information or knowledge that the

police viewed him as a suspect,  the evening of the 13th?



A: Yeah it was all over the news.



Q: Okay. Did you talk to him about that  circumstance?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: And did he mention anything to you?



A: Quickly, I think.



Q: What did he say?



A: I think the words were just about how bad  everything was, and then

quickly he said-and then -- I think he said, "I think I've got a big 

target on my chest," is what he said. Actually, that's exactly what he

said.



Q: What exactly did he say?



A: "I feel like I have a big target on my  chest."



Q: Meaning people were aiming at him?



A: Yeah.



Q: Is that all that he said?



A: About that, yes.



Q: How long were you there that evening?



A: I might have spent the night. I'm not quite sure. It was a weekday.



Q: And who was there that evening at the house?



A: Felt like everybody I know was there.



Q: Do you remember who was there?



A: Yeah.



Q: Who?



A: Some people. My sister Arnelle, my Uncle Benny, my Aunt Shirley, my

cousins Tony, Tracy  and Terry came, my girlfriend had come --



Q: [Name Deleted]?



A: [Name Deleted]. Cathy Randa, Gigi I believe was there -- I'm

assuming was there.



Q: Mark Slotkin?



A: Yeah, I remember he came. I can't remember if he came that day or

if he came later that  week.



Q: Skip Taft?



A: Skip, yeah, was there.



Q: Kato Kaelin?



A: Kato was there, yeah.



Q: Ron Shipp?



A: Yeah, Ron was there.



Q: Ron was a friend of yours. Right?



A: Friend of mine?



Q: Yeah.



A: No, I wouldn't call him a friend of mine.



Q: Prior to the murders.



A: No.



Q: Not a friend of yours?



A: Not mine, no.



Q: Friend of your father's?



A: I call him an acquaintance.



Q: Not a friend?



A: No. I'd fit A.C. more in the category of  friend. Ron's more like

an acquaintance.



Q: The next level down, you mean?



A: Next level down? No, I don't know. I mean, people you hang out with

kinda, and there's  people you're really like tight with.



Q: Did you ever have a falling-out with  Ron Shipp?



A: Never.



Q: Okay. Any argument with him or dispute  with him of any kind?



A: No, I never had any dispute with him.



Q: Okay. Did you ever confide in him about any problems you were

having with your father?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you ever take a baseball bat, by the way, and beat up a

bronze statue of your father in the yard?



A: Yeah, when I was a kid. I was hitting everything, though. The

statue was one of the things I hit. I hit a tree.



Q: Did you ever beat that in anger about  your father?



A: It wasn't about my father, no. I wanted  a party, and I was gonna

throw a party, and I got  busted. My dad found out that I was going to

have a party that night. He said I couldn't have a party.



Q: And what did you do?



A: I got mad, and I had a bat and I started hitting a tree outside,

and I think I hit a couple  other things, bushes and stuff like that,

and I hit the statue. I also hit -- there's another statue of a 

tennis player.



Q: You hit them both?



A: Yeah. And don't forget the tree.



Q: You hit the tree and the statues. Right?



A: And a couple of plants, I think.



Q: And a couple of plants.



A: Yeah, I think.



Q: Did you damage the statue of your father?



A: Slightly.



Q: Did you hit it a lot of times?



A: No. Just once.



Q: Just one shot.



A: Yeah.



Q: Is that right?



A: Yes, sir.



Q: Okay. Do you recall any conversation between Kato Kaelin and your

father on the evening of  June 13?



A: No.



Q: Okay. When you first saw your father,  did you notice if he had a

cut on his finger?



A: No. I actually looked at his hands, and  I didn't notice anything.



Q: No cuts?



A: Uh-uh.



Q: Why did you look?



A: Curiosity.



Q: To see if he was the murderer?



A: Just curiosity. I mean, just -- I couldn't believe this, and I

looked -- I was looking at his whole person.



Q: You couldn't believe that he might be the killer. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: Yeah.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You wanted to see if he had any signs of being in a struggle.

Right?



A: Or anything like that, yeah. I mean, I was -- yeah, curiosity, I

gotta say, did get me.



Q: Did you know that evening that Nicole had  been killed by a knife?



A: No, I didn't. I assumed that, though.



Q: And you saw no bruises, marks or cuts of any kind on your father.

Right?



A: No.



Q: And did you see --



MS. ROIT: Which night are we talking about?



MR.PETROCELLI: The night of June 13th when he first saw O.J. Simpson.



Q: Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: And you didn't see any bandages or Band-Aids or dressings for a

wound?



A: No, I don't remember seeing anything like that.



Q: Why did you assume that Nicole had been killed by a knife?



A: That's what's in the movies usually. I don't know. If someone says

if their throat was cut, I just assumed --



Q: You had heard her throat was cut by this time?



A: I think so.



Q: And then you assumed then it was by a knife. Right?



A: Yeah. I mean, it wasn't a spoon or a sword. I just -- I don't know.



Q: Did your father collect knives?



A: Not that I knew of.



Q: Before Nicole's death, did you have any knowledge of your father

having collected or saved or  bought knives?



A: Never. It didn't --



Q: You ever see any knives around the house  other than in the

kitchen?



A: Only knives he ever had were Swiss Army knives, and that's because

he had something to do with the company, I think.



Q: And were those knives of different sizes and shapes?



A: No. There was a -- utility pocket knives and knives that go on a

key chain.



Q: Small knives?



A: Small ones that you would like use to clean your nails.



Q: That's the only knives you've ever seen --



A: Yeah.



Q: -- him have?



A: Yeah.



Q: Other than kitchen knives.



A: Yes.



Q: What about camping knives?



A: No, I never seen --



Q: Fishing knives?



A: I've never seen any.



Q: You ever go camping or fishing with your father?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever go camping or fishing with  Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Your father collect guns?



A: As a hobby, you mean? I don't know. I don't know. I know he had

some.



Q: He had guns?



A: Yeah, but I don't know if he got more than one for a hobby or if he

literally thought he  might need it. I don't know.



Q: You're aware your father had filmed a pilot called FROGMAN?



A: Yeah.



Q: And you're aware that he had used a knife  in the FROGMAN footage?



A: I am now, yes.



Q: At the time you were not?



A: No.



Q: Were you aware that he bought a knife in  early May of 1994 at a

Los Angeles cutlery shop?



A: Now I am, yes.



Q: But not at the time?



A: No.



Q: And you never saw the knife that he bought at the cutlery shop?



A: Have I ever seen it?



Q: Prior to Nicole's death.



A: I think.



Q: Where did you see it?



A: It was in my dad's bathroom.



Q: When did you see it there?



A: When the judge came by to pick it up.



Q: You were there at the time?



A: Yeah.



Q: And you saw the judge find the knife?



A: I saw the judge, yeah.



Q: Where did he find it in your dad's bathroom?



A: There's a vanity and two mirrors this way  (Indicating) and a

mirror that way (Indicating). You know, you open the mirror and that's

where you put  medicines.



Q: Surprise you to see a knife in there?



A: Sort of, yeah.



Q: Is that the first time you had seen that  knife?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. Did you see any cut on your  father's hands or fingers the

rest of that week of June 13?



A: After that, no, I didn't. No.



Q: Not at all. Right?



A: No.



Q: Okay. And you saw any marks on his body  that week?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Previously on the record when I was talking about Nicole's

notes of incidents of  abuse, I had referred to Exhibit 86 and that

was  Exhibit 88 I meant to say. Exhibit 86 is the document that I

showed you that had her account of the June 3  conversation.



After the evening of June 13, when did you next see your father?



A: That would be the viewing, I think. The viewing.



Q: And between the Monday, the 13th, and the  viewing on the 15th, did

you talk to your father at  all?



A: I think I talked to him a couple times on  the phone.



Q: Okay. And do you know where he was staying?



A: At Bob Kardashian's house.



Q: And you called him there from time to  time?



A: I didn't call him. I think he called.



Q: And what did he tell you in those conversations?



A: He wanted to know how we were. We wanted to know how he was. I

wanted to see him, you know.



Q: Did you go see him?



A: No.



Q: Why not?



A: Because I was there to take care of the family. I guess he thought

it was a better idea I stayed at the house.



Q: That you stay where?



A: At the house.



Q: At whose house?



A: Rockingham. I guess. I guess.



Q: What family was at Rockingham? The aunts  and uncles?



A: My sister.



Q: And Sydney and Justin were where?



A: In Laguna.



Q: You didn't see Sydney and Justin until when?



A: I didn't see them until five days later or something like that.



Q: At the funeral?



A: Not the funeral. The wake. The wake.  That's what it's called.

Right?



Q: The viewing?



A: The viewing.



Q: So that's when you first saw Sydney and  Justin?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay.  And that's the next time you also saw your father. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: Did you drive down there with him?



A: We all drove down I think together, but -- no. He was there when we

got there.



Q: You got there with whom?



A: With my sister Arnelle and my cousin  Tracy and my cousin Tony and

I think my cousin  Tracy -- I mean Terry.



Q: Did your father tell you at any time in  these conversations before

the viewing that he was  contemplating killing himself?



A: No.



Q: Did he at any time make you think that he might kill himself?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. You can answer.



A: Did he ever tell me if he felt like killing himself?



Q: Yeah. Did he ever cause you to be concerned that he might kill

himself?



A: No. I didn't think about it. He didn't  seem like it to me.



Q: You didn't get that sense from him?



A: No.



Q: Okay. Did you quit your job that week,  by the way?



A: I didn't quit, no. They gave me some time off.



Q: Did you have a set of cooking knives?



A: Yeah.



Q: And did you ever take those knives off  of, you know, your work

premises?



A: All the time.



Q: And where did you keep those cooking knives?



A: In a bag, chef's bag.



Q: In where?



A: What do you mean?



Q: The bag.



A: The bag, I'll take it home with me.



Q: Okay. On the evening of June 12 where  was the bag with your

cooking knives?



A: With me.



Q: Has your dad ever seen those knives?



A: Probably. Yeah, I think he has.



Q: Okay. Have you ever had any missing?



A: Never.



Q: When you left the restaurant on the evening of June 12, did you

wait for your girlfriend there at the restaurant?



A: Yeah. She had my car.



Q: So your girlfriend picked you up.



A: In my car, yes.



Q: From the restaurant.



A: Yes.



Q: And drove you where?



A: To her apartment.



Q: And what did you do there?



A: Dropped her off.



Q: And then went to your apartment?



A: Yes.



Q: Did you go into her apartment at all?



A: I don't think so. No, I didn't. I just kissed her in the car, and

she went home.



Q: When was the -- did you -- during the  week of the 13th, did there

ever come a time when you  thought your father was suicidal?



A: During the whole week? Maybe toward the  latter part. I felt he was

really unstable. I mean, he just seemed -- I think I felt he needed to

be more -- maybe around us more.



Q: Did he say anything to you to indicate that he might take his life?



A: No.



Q: Did he say anything to you about arrangements for your future?



A: No.



Q: Did he tell you that he had contacted  people who would help take

care of you?



A: No.



Q: Did he tell you that he had changed his  will?



A: No.



Q: Did he tell you that he had left money  with persons for your use?



A: No.



Q: Did he tell you that he had given money  to Al Cowlings for you?



A: No.



Q: Did he tell you that he had contacted  Louis Marx?



A: No.



Q: And Wayne Hughes?



A: No.



Q: And asked these people to help them care  for you?



A: No.



Q: You knew none of that?



A: No, he never said anything like that to me.



Q: Okay. Did you learn at some point that week that he was going to be

arrested?



A: Yeah. When he was, when they were  looking for him.



Q: Were you at the Kardashian home on Friday  morning when your father

was to surrender to the  police?



A: No.



Q: Did you know that he was to surrender on  Friday morning?



A: Yeah. Yeah.



Q: When did you find that out?



A: Friday.



Q: From whom?



A: A news station.



Q: Nobody called you?



A: No. Not me. There was a lot of people  in my dad's house, so the

phone was ringing off the  hook.



Q: You were living at your dad's house that week. Right?



A: Yeah, I was staying there. I mean --



Q: And you learned on Friday morning in your  dad's house that he was

to surrender that day to the police?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Is that what you're saying?



A: No. I found out that they went to the house. It was on the news. By

the time I found out  on the news, they had said that he's supposed to

be here and he's not.



Q: So you found out the information from the  news on the television.



A: Yeah.



Q: Not from persons in the house or in the  family.



A: No. I didn't know. I didn't even know he was going to get arrested

until the news said that  they were looking for him.



A: Okay. So your dad didn't call you on the morning of the 17th to

inform you that a decision had been made --



A: Oh, no.



Q: -- by the LAPD to arrest him.



A: No.



Q: Okay. So when you last saw your dad, let's say Thursday at the

funeral, you didn't know  whether or not he was going to be arrested

the next day. Right?



A: No, I didn't know that.



Q: Did you then see on the news what  transpired with your father

taking off with  Mr. Cowlings in the Bronco?



A: Some of it.



Q: Did you sit there and watch it the whole  time?



A: No. I mean, we were in the house. The  police came. We had to leave

the house.



Q: Where did you go?



A: We started to walk down towards my friend's house, who lives about

a block away, and -- so I wasn't watching any TV, but the street was

packed full of people and cameras and everything, and we went to my

friend Steve's house, his front yard. We were all standing outside of

his front yard.



Q: At some point in the day the police had you evacuate the house?



A: Yes.



Q: When was that?



A: That was when I guess they confirmed or  A.C. had confirmed that he

was bringing my father back  to the house.



Q: Did you talk to your father while he was in the car at all?



A: No.



Q: Did it become apparent to you from watching the news accounts that

he might kill himself?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I didn't know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you know why he had fled the police?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I didn't know why, no.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You had no clue as to why he had failed to surrender himself?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Okay. Did you know that he had a gun in  the back seat of the car

with him?



A: I found out.



Q: From watching television?



A: Yeah.



Q: Okay. You never spoke to him in that Bronco?



A: No.



Q: No calls between him and you?



A: No.



Q: Okay. You spent the rest of that day until he arrived where? On the

front lawn of your  friends?



A: No. Only partly. I think we were there  for 20 minutes.



Q: Then where did you go?



A: We all went outside because he was getting closer to home.



Q: So you left the house when he was close to home.



A: Yeah, we all went outside 'cause --



Q: I see.



A: We all went outside.



Q: And you were on the outside for 20 minutes or so; then he returned

to Rockingham, Is  that what you're saying?



A: No. The total amount of time we were at  the house might have been

about 20 minutes. We might have spent --we spent -- as soon as we got

to the house, we were standing outside, my sister, we were all in a

circle praying, and then we went inside to find out what was going on,

looked at the TV. This is all in the time of maybe 20 minutes. Right?



We were looking at the TV and my sister was still saying some more

prayers, and then as he had gotten -- he had gotten off the freeway,

and I just -- we kinda thought that maybe he was going to be coming 

up Bristol, and my friend lives right there at the  corner of Bristol

and Ashford, so we went outside.



So everybody was outside, out on the corner on the street. Sure

enough, they came rolling up the street.



Q: Who is "they"?



A: My dad and Allen.



Q: And they drove in the property?



A: They drove in the property.



Q: And where were you when this was taking  place?



A: I was right in front of the car -- on the  side of the car.



Q: Did you run to the car?



A: Yeah.



Q: For what reason?



A: Desperation.



Q: To do what? To stop your father from killing himself?



A: To stop --



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: To stop him, to talk to him.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you get to him?



A: I didn't physically really get to him.



Q: Why not?



A: 'Cause the car was separated. The window  was rolled up and A.C.

was between us.



Q: Okay. Did you -- did the door open?



A: No. A.C.'s big, man. I couldn't get by him.



Q: What did you do?



A: I was so -- I was so full of energy, I tried to reach through

A.C.'s window, and A.C. stopped  me and pushed me back, and I guess it

kinda shocked me  and brought me back down to reality. And those cars,

 the back window's tinted, so I never really even saw  my dad.



And I had the police behind me yelling,  and then A.C. yelling, and it

was -- I just turned  around and just said, "Jesus  just get back in

the house and let these guys handle it,"



Q: So you never did make contact with your  father?



A: No.



Q: And you went into the house to -- and he came into the house

shortly thereafter?



A: A Little bit a while after, yeah.



Q: Did you talk to him in the house?



A: No. There was like a whole police department in the house.



Q: You never got a chance to talk to him at all?



A: No. I saw him for a quick second from a  distance, from a far

distance. That was it. That was  it. I was like handcuffed in the

corner of the house.



Q: You were handcuffed?



A: Yeah.



Q: Why were you handcuffed?



A: Well, this nut-head, me, just ran out  after the car and jumped

over two police cars, and they didn't want to let me go. I think it

was pretty wise on their part.



Q: Before Nicole's murder, what was your father's relationship like

with the LAPD?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Calls for speculation, lack of

foundation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: The whole police department?



Q: Yeah. To your knowledge it was generally positive and favorable.

Correct?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objections.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



A: Correct?



A: For the police officers he knew, yeah.



Q: You are not aware of any trouble that he  had with the police

department prior to June 12 of 1994. Correct?



A: I am not aware of any.



Q: In fact, you are seen in some photographs with an LAPD cap. Right?



A: Yeah. I like that cap.



Q: And you got that cap from whom?



A: I don't remember. I'm assuming it was  from Ron because Ron Shipp

was a police officer, I  think, so... I think I got it from him.



Q: So as far as you knew, your father's  dealings with the LAPD were

favorable and positive.  Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: As far as I knew.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: Are you aware of any information to the effect that the police

department framed your father for the murder of Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: Am I aware of it?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yes. Do you have any information to that effect?



A: No.



MR. LEONARD: Same objection.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Excuse me?



A: No.



Q: No? Okay.  Do you know whether or not your father ever took a lie

detector test?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I heard that.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: On the news?



A: Yeah.



Q: Recently?



A: I heard it a long time ago, but then I heard it like about three

months ago or something like  that.



Q: When you heard it a long time ago, from whom did you hear it?



A: It was TV. It was the media.



Q: Did you ever ask your father whether or not he took a lie detector

test?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: You heard that he failed the test?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: I think they did say he failed the test, or one person

said he failed the test.  Another person said he didn't score highly

on some -- on some questions.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Have you ever asked anyone about that?



A: No I didn't.



Q: At no time?



A: No.



Q: At the wake you came in end then abruptly left and went into the

car. Right?



A: Yeah.



Q: And you were hyperventilating?



A: Yeah, I couldn't breathe.



Q And you went into a limousine.



A. Right.



Q: Yeah. There was cameras outside. It was he only way -- place I

could get away from them.



Q: Judy Brown and your father then came into the car. Right?



A: I guess. I don't remember who it was. I think -- yeah, I remember

my dad was there.



Q: You heard Judy ask your father whether he  was responsible for

killing Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: I don't know. I just remember  them consoling me. I don't

remember them talking to each other.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you remember Judy asking O.J., "Did you do this to my daughter?"



A: No, I don't.



Q: Do you remember your father saying, "I loved her too much"?



A: I remember hearing my dad say that once,  but I couldn't tell you

when it was.



When did you hear your dad say, "I loved her too much"?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: I just answered. I just said I couldn't tell you when.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: But it was sometime after her death.  Right?



A: I don't know. I guess.



Q: At the funeral or at the wake?



A: I don't recall. Honestly.



Q: Well, everything is supposed to be honestly.



A: I'm not supposed to be sarcastic.



Q: Do you know that your father on Tuesday, the 14th, went to retrieve

his golf bag from the airport?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: Not till you just said that.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you know that when he left the house at Rockingham on the

morning of the 14th, he went to  his office with Skip Taft and Robert

Kardashian? Did you know that?



A: No, I didn't.



Q: What did you do on the morning of the 14th, Tuesday morning?



A: I got no clue. I have no idea. I was in a haze, a haze that whole

week. I don't remember. Probably cried all morning, sat on the bed.



Q: Have you ever talked to any members of he Brown family as to the

circumstances of Nicole's death?



A: No.



Q Your dad ever tell you that he had dropped blood or deposited blood

at Nicole's condo  when he was visiting her or the children?



A: No, he never said that.



Q: Did you ever talk to Kato Kaelin about  his interaction with your

father on the night of June 12?



A: No.



Q: At no time?



A: No. He had told me that he went to McDonald's, but that was it.

That's all he said.



Q: Okay. Do you play golf?



A: No. It's too boring.



Q: Do you have golf clubs?



A: No, sir.



Q: Were you familiar with your father's luggage as of June of 1994?



A: No, I wasn't.



Q: Would you have recognized his golf bag or his travel -- his golf

bag?



A: I gotta tell you, the whole garage is lined up with golf bags. I

don't know which one is his -- his favorite or something. I'm telling

you, he's got like 20, 30 golf bags in his garage, so I really

couldn't -- I couldn't even answer that.



Q: Prior to Nicole's murder, did you ever see your dad hit golf balls

at night at Rockingham?



A: I've never seen that.



Q: Do you have any people who are like your  mentors or close

advisors?



A: Close advisors? Yeah, a couple. I mean...



Q: Who is that?



A: I call my mom someone I talk to and console, talk to a lot.



Q: Do you have a godparent?



A: A.C.



Q: He's your godparent --



A: He's my godfather, yeah.



Q: Did you attack the restaurant owner with a knife?



MR. LEONARD: Objection.



THE WITNESS: No.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you have a knife in your hand when you had the fight with Paul?



A: Absolutely not.



Q: Did you not use a knife?



A: Did I use a knife to what?



Q: Did you use a knife?



A: No.



Q: Okay.



MR. LEONARD: Dan, are you going to pursue this with him, I mean, what

possible relevance does that have? Seriously. I thought we wanted to

get this  thing over with.



THE WITNESS: Go ahead. I don't care. Paul will tell you I didn't.



MR. PETROCELLI: Goes to --



MR. LEONARD: Oh, yeah, sure. Don't even say it.



THE WITNESS: Paul would tell you there was no damn knife involved.



MR. PETROCELLI: I guess that's all I have for now.



EXAMINATION BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Mr. Simpson, I just have a couple of questions. I should be done

within a few minutes. Okay?



A: Okay.



Q: I want to go back to January 4, 1989, when you indicated you had an

opportunity to be with  Nicole after the fight with your father. Do

you recall testifying to that?



A: January 4, 1989. Okay, yeah.



Q: Do you recall that?



A: Yeah.



Q And do you recall testifying about the  fact that you were talking

to her and she was about  15 to 20 feet away?



A: Probably, yeah.



Q: All right. Have you ever seen any photographs of the injuries that

she sustained as a result of the 1989 incident?



A: No.



Q: At no time during the criminal trial did  you see those

photographs?



A: I'm not sure which ones. I saw photographs of her, but she looked

really, really young. I mean, she looked like the way she did when I

first met her. She looked like she was like 20-something.



Q: Are you -- is it your testimony that you -- that she did not have

any injuries on her, or is it your testimony that you did not get en

opportunity to observe any injuries on her?



A: It's my testimony that I didn't get the opportunity to observe any.



Q: Okay. So she could have had injuries on her face; you just didn't

get a chance to see them.  Is that correct?



A: Correct.



Q: All right. She could have had injuries on her arms; you just didn't

get a chance to see them. Is that correct?



A: Correct.



Q: Now, on that day was she -- what was she  wearing, do you recall,

in terms of her top?



In other words, was she wearing something  sleeveless, or was she

wearing something with sleeves?



A: I'd be guessing, and I don't want to give you an answer --



Q: You don't recall.



A: No.



Q: You testified also that you did not discuss with your father really

any of the evidence that has come forth in the criminal trial.

Correct?



A: Right. Right.



Q: You never asked him and he never told you. Correct?



A: Right.



Q: Other than what you've testified to, did you ever overhear your

father make any comments about  the evidence that were presented --

that was presented  in the criminal trial?



A: Anything at all?



Q: Anything at all.



A: No. Other than the tape and stuff that  like -- other than the

tape, no.



Q: Well, what did you overhear him say about  the tape?



And you are talking about the 911 tape?



A: No. I'm saying what I heard him say on  the tape.



Q: Other than what you've already testified  to --



A: Yes.



Q: -- and other than what you heard on the tape, at any time did you

overhear your father make any remarks about the evidence in the

criminal case?



A: No, I've never heard anything he's talked about.



Q: Did you ever hear him make comments like, "Oh, that's all bogus" or

"baloney" or  "I can't believe they're trying to pin it on me"?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that. Lack of foundation.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Anything to that effect?



A: Maybe a sigh, but not -- you know, like if the news was on and

something came on real quick and (Sound). That's about it.



Q: Well, are you indicating that there was -- that you had occasion to

watch the news with your father where they were discussing the

criminal the evidence in the criminal case?



MR. LEONARD: I am just going to object now because it's vague as to

time. Are you asking him at  any time or during the week? I mean, what

are you talking about? Any time?



MS. ROIT: Asking any time.



MR.LEONARD: Up until today's date?



MS. ROIT: Up until today's date.



THE WITNESS: Maybe.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Well, as you sit here today --



A: Yes.



Q: -- and, you know, how we talk about memories, we can take ourselves

back --



A: Right.



Q: -- and visualize?



A: Right.



Q: As you sit here today, can you visualize yourself watching the news

--



A: Right.



Q: -- with your father --



A: Right.



Q: -- where any of the pieces of evidence  were discussed?



A: Never sit and watch the news. The TV  being on and everybody doing

something in, say, the room and me walking through the room and him

reacting  to something being said about him on the news.



Q: Okay. On how many occasions has that  occurred?



A: Jeez, in the last five months, six months, I don't know. Maybe five

times, a handful of times.



Q: What evidence do you recall being discussed on TV to which your

father reacted?



A: I don't think it was so much the evidence. That maybe like the end

of the day, what  you hear like, say, about what we just did today, 

something like that. You guys outside talking.



Q: So there would be occasions when on TV they would be broadcasting

something that occurred in  this, the civil case?



A: Yeah, but I'm not paying -- like I said, if the TV was on, I wasn't

sitting there watching the  TV. I'd just see that they're talking

about the case  and I'm seeing his reaction. I'm not seeing what his 

reaction is to specifically.



Q: All right. And what do you recall about  his reaction to news

stories about the civil case?



A: Disagreement. That's all I know.



Q: Such as?



A: I don't know. Like I said, I don't know what he's disagreeing with.



Q: Okay. Well, how did you determine from  his reaction that he was

disagreeing with whatever it  was that was being broadcasted on the

news about the  civil case?



A: 'Cause he had a look of distaste. Sometimes it might just be -- I

mean, don't take it personally (Indicating), because he's talking on

TV.



Q: You are pointing to Mr. Petrocelli.



A: Yes.



Q: And your father's reacting with distaste.



A: Yeah. He's just -- yeah.



Q: Well, is he grunting? Is he making any noises when he's reacting to

this?



A: Yeah, I guess.



Q: Is he making any comment when he's  reacting to it?



MR. LEONARD: You know, I am going to -- this  is now vague. You are

saying, "Is he." I mean, if  you -- you know, it's compound and vague.



But you can try to answer if you can.



MS. ROIT: Well, the witness has testified that  he has seen his father

react in a certain fashion to broadcasts about the civil case and the

evidence in the civil case.



Q: Correct?



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. I am trying to understand what  that reaction was.



MR. LEONARD: Well, just in general or...



THE WITNESS: Let's see. One time he was  happy -- I'm gonna guess,

though. I'm not going to  sit there and spread out guesses to you.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: You can take yourself back to those occasions, and you can actually

see your father reacting. Right?



A: Right.



Q: Okay. I want to know if during any of  those occasions he said

anything out loud when he was  so reacting.



A: Not that I recall.



Q: So on those approximate five or six occasions when the news was

broadcasting something  about evidence in the civil case, all you

recall is  your father reacting without saying anything. Is that

correct?



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. I think that mischaracterizes his

testimony. I don't think he  said on all occasions they were

describing evidence in  the civil case.



But go ahead. If you can answer it, go ahead.



THE WITNESS: I also said that he would be  reacting, but I don't

recall what it was he said. You're saying I don't remember. You're

saying I'm not saying what it was he said. No, I don't remember what

it was he said. I wasn't paying attention.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Other than what you've testified to now, have you ever heard your

father make any comments about the evidence either in the criminal

case or the civil case? And by "evidence," I am including testimony of

any of the witnesses.



MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as that's very -- that's overbroad

vague, lacks foundation.



You can answer the question.



MS. ROIT: I am trying to lay a foundation for any further questioning.



THE WITNESS: Have I ever heard him speak about either trial's

evidence?



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Yeah.



A: None of the evidence, no.



Q: Any testimony of any of the witnesses in the civil case, such as,

"That person's lying" or  "That person's telling the truth," or

anything to that  effect?



A: Yeah. Yeah, I guess.



Q: Okay. What comments have you heard him say?



A: Maybe something about Faye.



Q: What did he say about Faye?



A: I don't remember. I just know that he disagreed with something she

-- something about her, I don't think it had to do with the actual

case. It had to do with her book or something and what she's doing in

her book.



Q: I am focusing on the testimony of the  witnesses in the case.



A: Well, I don't know. Have you questioned  her? I don't know if he

was talking about her and  what she did her day in court or --



Q: Mr. Simpson, I am simply asking you what  you heard your father

say.



A: I don't remember. I just know he was talking about it.



Q: So as you sit here today, you cannot give me any specifics about

what your father may have said  with respect to the testimony of any

of the witnesses  in this case. Is that correct?



A: Yeah, basically.



Q: All right. He has said things. You just can't recall them. Is that

correct?



A: Basically, yeah.



Q: You testified earlier that at some point you had at least a

suspicion that your father could have committed these murders. Is that

correct?



MR. LEONARD: I am going on object. I think that mischaracterizes his

testimony.



But go ahead. You can answer.



THE WITNESS: I said at one point I was a -- you know, the thought

crossed my mind, yeah.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: And on what was that thought based?



A: I'd have to say just the evidence, what  the evidence -- but it

didn't seem -- I mean, he  didn't have any motive, to me. In my mind

he didn't have any motive. All these people in this room seem  to

know. I mean, I lived with Nicole and my dad for 17 years.



Q: What evidence were you aware of at the  time that you formed that

suspicion in your mind?



MR.LEONARD: Objection. Overbroad.



THE WITNESS: The evidence in the case that he  was just acquitted

from.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Okay. So the suspicion that you formed  in your mind was during the

criminal trial. Correct?



A: It was a while ago, yeah.



Q: Was it during the criminal trial?



A: Yes.



Q: Was there something in particular that occurred during the criminal

trial that formed or  assisted in forming that suspicion in your mind?



MR. LEONARD: You know, I am going to object to this line of

questioning. It has absolutely no relevance, it can't lead to any

relevant evidence, and I am going to instruct him not to answer at

this  point. He has gone over this several times.



So don't answer the question.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: Did you ever share your suspicion with  your father?



A: No.



Q: Why not?



A: He wasn't there at the moment.



Q: Did you visit your father in jail?



A: Yes.



Q: On how many times?



A: I don't remember exactly.



Q: Many times?



A: What's "many" to you?



Q: More than 10?



A: Yeah, I think.



Q: Any time during those visits did you discuss the criminal case with

your father?



A: No, I tried not to. It's all he talked about, so when I got there,

I tried to talk about anything else.



Q: I want to make sure I understand your answer.



A: No.



Q: During any of the visits to jail when you  went to visit your

father, did you ever discuss the criminal case or any of the evidence

in the criminal case?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Overbroad, vague,  compound.



BY MS. ROIT:



Q: At any time during any of the visits with  your father in jail.



A: Maybe.



Q: Maybe?



A: Maybe.



Q: Okay. As you sit here today, do you  recall such discussions?



A: I recall -- yeah.



Q: What did you discuss with him?



A: The actual situation.



Q: What was said?



A: Reaction to what -- reaction to the situation. Reaction to the fact

that "there's a piece of glass dividing you and me right now and that

you're handcuffed," but not about the actual case, the actual

situation.



Q: Situation with him being jail.



A: Yes.



Q: Okay. Not about the evidence in the  case.



A: No, not about the evidence.



Q: Not about whether or not he killed Nicole  and Ron.



A: No.



Q: Have you ever seen Bruno Magli shoes in your father's closet?



A: I don't remember ever seeing any in his  closet.



Q: Did you ever see him wear Bruno Magli  shoes?



A: I don't remember ever seeing him wear  Bruno Magli shoes.



MS. ROIT: Okay, I have no further questions.



EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Prior to June of '94, you wouldn't have been able to tell if he was

wearing Bruno Magli shoes. Correct? Correct?



A: Correct.



Q: And you wouldn't have been able to tell by merely taking a look in

his closet whether any of  them were Bruno Maglis. Correct?



A: Incorrect.



Q: Why is that incorrect?



A: Because, I mean, I'd have to agree with my dad. By looking -- I

mean, when I saw him and saw  the picture in the Enquirer, I was

surprised to see him wearing the shoes because I don't necessarily 

think they're very nice-looking shoes either, to be  perfectly honest,

and I was kinda surprised to see the  picture.



Q: You did not look in his closet in the  last three or four months

before Nicole's death to  inventory his shoes. Right?



A: Not to inventory, but believe me, I don't  mind, you know, snagging

a T-shirt from my dad.



Q: But you didn't survey his shoes --



A: Sometimes.



Q: -- prior to Nicole's death. Correct?



A: Sometimes I do, yeah.



Q: When was the last time up went into his closet to look at his shoes

--



A: I don't remember.



Q: -- prior to Nicole's death?



A: I don't remember exactly.



Q: So you don't know as of Nicole's death  what shoes he had and what

shoes he did not have. Correct?



A: No. Correct.



Q: Do you  know if your father's writing a  book now?



A: No, I don't know.



Q: Are you?



A: No.



Q: Do you know if he has any plans to write  a book now?



A: No, I don't.



Q: Do you know whether Nicole had a  relationship with Marcus Allen?



A: I do now.



Q: And how do you know that?



A: I found out like everybody else did -- like almost everybody else

did.



Q: How?



A: Media.



Q: Did you ever talk to your father about Nicole's relationship with

Marcus Allen?



A: No. Never.



Q: Did you ever talk to Marcus Allen about it?



A: No.



Q: Did you ever talk to Al Cowlings about it?



A: Yeah.



Q: Tell me about that conversation.



A: I asked him if it was true.



Q: If what was true?



A: If the -- if what I was hearing was true.



Q: What is it that you asked Mr. Cowlings?



A: Did Nicole and Marcus have an affair.



Q: What did Al say?



A: He said he thinks so.



Q: Did you ask him anything else?



A: About the affair?



Q: Yes.



A: No.



Q: Did you ask him when it occurred?



A: No. I had a feeling when it occurred.



Q: When did it occur?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. That calls for speculation.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: When did it occur?



A: I didn't know exactly the time frame, but I just -- there was a

time -- I don't remember when it was, but there was a time I had been

there and I had  seen something that I thought was going on, but I

dismissed it, later to find out that what I thought  was true.



Q: And what is it that you saw?



A: Saw Marcus coming out of Nicole's house.



Q: Okay. And what house was that?



A: Gretna Green.



Q: And when was that?



A: I don't remember.



Q: Did you see where Marcus went when he  left the house?



A: No.



Q: Did you tell your father about that?



A: No. I didn't think too much of it. They  were friends.



Q: Is that the only thing that you ever saw that, looking back now,

confirms this affair in your mind?



A: Yeah.



Q: You sure it was Gretna Green and not Bundy?



A: I'm positive.



Q: And why are you positive about that?



A: Just I'm positive. I knew where I was.



Q: Okay. Did you ever see Marcus' car  parked outside of Nicole's

Bundy condo?



A: No.



Q: Or parked outside of the Gretna Green  condo?



A: Just that one time when I saw him.



Q: You saw him go to his car?



A: Yeah. He was coming outside. I was  going in.



Q: Do you know whether Al Cowlings drove your father's white Bronco?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: Ever?



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Within a month before Nicole's death.



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of foundation.



THE WITNESS: I don't know.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Cowlings whether he was involved with the

murder of Nicole?



A: No.



Q: Whether he helped your father?



A: No.



Q: You ever ask him any questions about his whereabouts and activities

--



A: No.



Q: -- on the night of June 12?



A: No, I don't think I asked him.



Q: Never discussed it with him?



A: No.



Q: He ever talk to you about it?



A: I don't think so. I don't think he told me what he was doing that

night.



Q: Excuse me?



A: I don't think he told me what he was  doing that evening.



Q: You said you would know better than all  of us about whether your

father had a motive to kill Nicole.



MR. LEONARD: No, I object. That  mischaracterizes what he said. That's

not what he said.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You said you lived with her for 17 years.



A: I said I lived with them for 17 years, and in my opinion there's no

way either of them could have killed each other.



Q: Well, you didn't live with them after 1988.



A: Neither did you.



Q: True?



A: So what's the question?



Q: It wasn't 17 years, in other words --



A: Oh, okay.



Q: -- that you lived with them.



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is

approximately 4:42.



(Pause in the proceedings.)



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record and the time is

approximately 4:43.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Your father was -- is a jealous man, is  he not?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation,  calls for speculation.

It's vague.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: I don't think he's any more jealous than the next guy.



Q: He is a jealous guy -- he was a jealous guy when it came to Nicole.

Is that a fair statement?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation,

argumentative.



THE WITNESS: Like I said, I don't think he' more jealous than the next

guy.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Yeah, but I'm not asking you that.



A: Well, I've never seen him do anything that --



Q: Did you regard him as a jealous man when  it came towards Nicole?



MR. LEONARD: Objection --



THE WITNESS: No, I wouldn't regard him as a  jealous man.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: A controlling guy --



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: -- when it came to Nicole?



A: Maybe a little controlling.



Q: He's a controlling person in general. Is that a fair statement.'



A: Not in general.



Q: Towards Nicole he was. Right?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague as to "controlling."



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: You can answer.



A: Toward Nicole, no, I wouldn't -- toward a couple things. I mean...



Q: Like what?



A: Conversations. Talk to him, he likes to -- you know, he likes to

head the conversation usually.



Q: What else?



A: What else. Let's see. He's an opinionated guy. And that's all I

could think about right now. And, yeah, with Nicole sometimes.



Q: How did Nicole treat your father when she  was alive?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



THE WITNESS: She treated him well.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Your father wrote in his so-called suicide note that he was a

battered spouse or he was  the battered one in the relationship, words

to that effect. Do you recall that?



A: I recall it, yes.



Q: Did you see any evidence of that?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.



THE WITNESS: Battered, no. I wouldn't call it battered.



BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q: Do you know what he meant by that?



A: Yeah, I do.



Q: What did he mean?



A: I think he felt that -- in my opinion, I  think he felt that he

also sustained some abuse, but whether it be mental or even physical,

but it doesn't matter. I mean, he's bigger than her, so it -- like I

-- it doesn't matter.



You know, I mean, Nicole is a smaller white woman. He is a bigger

black man. You will  never, ever, no matter what, no matter in what

court,  in what country, in what land, if these two people  fight,

there's no way that he will ever, you know, be  looked at with any

kind of sympathy. I think that's  what he might have thought when he

wrote that.



Q: How was he abused by Nicole?



A: Abused? I don't know. You'd have to ask him that.



Q: You said you think that what he was referring to is that he had

sustained some abuse.



A: Nicole, I mean -- Nicole -- Nicole, I mean, she was a great person

and everything like that, she wasn't just a flower. I mean, you can

get into arguments with Nicole. I mean, Nicole was a pretty

hard-headed person herself.



Q: Did you see her abuse your father?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.



THE WITNESS: No, I never saw her abuse my dad.



MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions.



We will have a stipulation that the original of the transcript will be

sent to Mr. Baker's  firm?



MR. LEONARD: (Nods head.)



MR. PETROCELLI: And that you will have 30 days  thereafter within

which to inform us of any changes or  corrections and whether the

witness has signed it, and  if it's not signed within 30 days after

receipt by  Baker's firm, then the transcript can be used for all 

purposes -- a copy of the transcript can be used for  all purposes as

though signed.



MR. LEONARD: Agreed.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.



THE WITNESS: Thanks.



THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This concludes the deposition of Jason Simpson. The

number of videotapes used was three. We are going off the record, and

the  time is approximately 4:48.



(ENDING TIME: 4:48 P.M.) I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE

FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT.



SUBSCRIBED AT



CALIFORNIA, THIS _ DAY OF 19 ___.
