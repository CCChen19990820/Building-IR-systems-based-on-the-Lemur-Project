much more data is available, including occupation, education, churches, mortality,
and property and wealth, among others.  After year selection, users query the
database for state(s) and variable(s).  Data returned can then be sorted by
variable.  Data are available at the state and county level, although county
querying is not possible.  There is no facility at this time for downloading data to
statistical programs; however, this is a small price to pay for a virtual treasure
house of U.S. historical information."</i>

The site can be browsed by election, president, vice president, the electoral process, and presidential documents (nearly 140, including 7 sound files).  Text articles are taken from the encyclopedia, and there are many cross-referenced hypertext topics within these articles.  But, the highlights of the site are electoral maps of each election and memorabilia that includes over 45 pins, cards, and ribbons.  Since the site permits a free peek into the fee-based online encyclopedia, it is, in a sense, a subtle advertisement.  That, however, in no way diminishes the usefulness of the site, which is an excellent introduction to American history in general, as well as American political history in particular."</i>

'Why America Needs a Tax Cut,' authored by Heritage Foundation taxperts, is a nine-part monograph presenting the view that government deficits can be lowered while tax rates are dropped and the tax system reformed (the flat tax is championed).  The Twentieth Century Fund, a nonpartisan foundation that researches and writes about progressive public policy, has recently released five state studies under the general title of 'What Would a Balanced Budget Mean For...?' (California, Ohio, Wisconsin, Washington, and Oregon).  Prepared by state budget experts in those states, these studies conclude that a balanced federal budget would hinder states' abilities to 'keep up with demands for services, especially in the important areas of education and criminal justice.'

<h3>Oxford-GW Summer Program in International Human Rights Law</h3>

<br>
The Program in International Human Rights Law is offered jointly by the University 
of Oxford and The George Washington University Law School, and is held in Oxford in July.  It is intended to prepare students to contribute to the improvement of human rights conditions in their homelands and around the world.

<p>During the program's four week session, an internationally recognized faculty offers courses on the philosophy, history, doctrine, and practice of international human rights law.  The program emphasizes advocacy and dissemination skills, as well as formal knowledge of human rights law, 
the means of its enforcement, and its status 
in a contentious world.  Professor Ralph G. Steinhardt of the Law School faculty is co-director of the program.

<p>Applications are accepted from law students, graduate students in related fields, lawyers, and other professionals with a demonstrated interest in human rights.  
For more information, contact Summer 
and Experimental Programs, The George Washington University, 2121 Eye Street, N.W., Washington, DC, 20052.  Telephone (202) 994-6360; facsimile (202) 994-9133 or e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:sumprogs@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu">sumprogs@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu</A>.

Division Briefs</font>
<p>
Occupational therapy is a human service profession that uses everyday activities (occupations) associated with work, self-care and play to help people whose lives have been disrupted by illness, deficits in development, the aging process and social or emotional problems to lead independent, productive and satisfying lives.  A few examples of the range of services an occupational therapist may perform include evaluating children with developmental disabilities and planning treatment activities to help them grow mentally and physically; designing and constructing splints for people with physical disabilities; helping people with physical disabilities learn how to carry out daily tasks at home, on the job and in the community; conducting group or individual treatment to help patients in a mental health center learn to cope with daily activities and prepare for return to their communities; helping the elderly adjust to the special problems of aging and remain physically and mentally active; and suggesting changes in the layout of design of home, school and place of work to give greater independence to people with disabilities and to prevent such disabilities. 
<p>
The Daisy Marquis Jones Program in Occupational Therapy offers a comprehensive course of classroom, laboratory and clinical study.  After four years of academic study with an emphasis on liberal arts and professional courses, the student is eligible to participate in the professional internships required for certification to practice.  These internships include two required three months, full-time field work experiences with the option of a third experience in an area of special interest.  Upon successful completion of the internships, the student receives a bachelor of science degree.
<p>
The Occupational Therapy Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA).  Graduates of the program are able to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT).  After successful completion of this exam, the individual is an occupational therapist, registered  (OTR).  Most states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the AOTCB Certification Examination.

Lorenzetti's Field Period Earns a Gold Medal</font></center><p>

Occupational therapy major John Lorenzetti helped train a potential gold medalist for the 1995 State Special Olympics. Lorenzetti spent his Field Period assisting the Newark Developmental Center and its olympic hopefuls as a recreational therapist aide. 
<p>
"I assisted the members of several different units with perfecting their bowling, swimming and skiing techniques," Lorenzetti said.
<p>
Lorenzetti assisted a senior occupational therapist with 65-75 patients throughout Wayne County. He not only worked with the patients on their sports, he also helped them through the tasks of daily life. 
<p>
"We spent one half of the day working on sports and the other half talking to patients, eating with them and assisting them with their program," Lorenzetti said. 
<p>
Lorenzetti learned many things about his field working with special olympians including how to become a better therapist. 
<p>
"This Field Period helped me learn how to open up to each individual. As I watched the patients go through their daily struggles, I also learned that all goals are achievable," Lorenzetti said. 
<p>
Lorenzetti, a senior at Keuka, found his Field Period both challenging and satisfying. The challenge was not knowing what was going to happen next. His satisfaction was knowing that he helped people achieve. 
<p>
"Watching clients' faces and seeing their expressions of excitement when they reach a goal gives me great satisfaction," Lorenzetti said. 
 <p>
The education of an occupational therapist requires classroom and clinical forms of instruction. The clinical aspect does not begin within an occupational therapy clinic until January of the senior year. It is at this time that the student has the knowledge base to benefit from a clinical practice experience without producing an adverse effect on patient care. The senior year January experience is solidified with two full-time subsequent clinical experiences in specified practice arenas. Occupational therapy clinics are used throughout the United States. 
<p>
Prior to the above clinical experiences, students spend each January within a faculty-guided work experience:  Field Period. As stated above, these experiences for the freshman through the junior years are considered essential for the development of an occupational therapy student. It is recommended that students complete one Field Period experience in an organization that provides occupational therapy services. Students are not assigned to occupational therapy, but can rotate through several departments to help confirm their career decision to become an occupational therapist. 
<p>
The junior year Field Period experience is completed within a human service organization. This experience is a practical application of the concepts and principles that students learned in the fall occupational therapy courses. 
<p>
All experiential learning is designed by the student with guidance and evaluation by their academic advisor.

<p><font size=+1>
<b>Organizations</b><br>
Professional student organizations are affiliated with the Occupational Therapy Division. Membership is optional and open to all interested students. The activities of these groups often reinforce classroom learning experiences while bringing together students with common career goals. 
<ul>
<li> OTTERS (Occupational Therapy Towards Excellence in Rahabilitation Services)
</ul>
The honorary societies at Keuka College recognize academic excellence and achievement as well as potential for success in specific career fields. Their activities are often instrumental in promoting student interest in particular fields of study. Each society maintains specific criteria for membership. 
<ul>
<li>  Pi Theta Epsilon 
</ul><b>
Student Activities</b><br>
Members of the OTTERS Club learned the value of community service last semester.  In October, they sponsored a car wash and donated the proceeds to the Yates County ARC.
<p>
In November 1996, Keuka students majoring in occupational therapy will attend the New York State Occupational Therapy conference in Rochester, NY.  Students will see the latest in technology, adaptive equipment and gain insight into their profession.

<p><font size=+1>
<b>Career Opportunities</b><br>
Currently, there is a national shortage of occupational therapists. 100 percent of Keuka's graduates are employed immediately upon completion of their degree requirements. Many work in school systems with children with learning disabilities or developmental disabilities. Rehabilitation of people of all ages with orthopedic or neurological deficits continues to present opportunities in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes and home care. Many are working in the community with people who were previously institutionalized with psychiatric conditions or birth defects but now live in group homes or other community settings. Private practice is also emerging as an employment opportunity often with emphasis on hand therapy.

Gliding gracefully through the water, Aurora watches for signs of her caretaker for the day. Sneaking silently up behind her, Aurora greets her with a mouthful of water and smiles, and waits expectantly for Megan Cope, a Keuka College senior majoring in biology, to rub her tongue. Aurora is a 1,365 pound, 10'6" Beluga whale. She calls the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium in Mystic, Ct., home. Cope calls the organization her Field Period sponsor and affectionately refers to Aurora as a "pill." <br>
"Each animal has its own personality," Cope said.<br>
And Cope can prove this statement from hands-on experience. With three Keuka College Field Periods each devoted to marine mammals' care and research jumping from her College transcript, Cope knows the direction her life will go.<br> 
"I have found my passion," Cope, daughter of Rochester, N.Y., residents James and Ellie Cope, said.<br>
As a Keuka freshman, Cope completed her first Field Period as a volunteer for a dolphin research center, working with trainers and in a dolphin child therapy program. For her junior year Field Period, she completed a behavioral study on a stranded, rare dolphin in Clearwater, Fl. Cope's senior year found her gaining experience in the research and veterinary services department of the Connecticut aquarium.<br>
<img align=right src="dolphin.gif">"Each one has been a sequential learning experience. I am learning my field step-by-step, progressively assuming more responsibilities," Cope said.<br>
In addition to taking care of creatures of the deep, Cope assisted a graduate student complete a section of her doctorate research project. This is a perfect fit with Cope's ultimate professional objectives:  behavioral and ecological research.<br>
"Through Field Periods, I have found a flood of research and projects to explore," Cope said, adding that she aslo has developed a list of professional contacts and mentors. <br>
"My supervisor is Dr. David St. Aubin. He is well-known and respected in the scientific community and has devoted a lot of attention to helping me succeed," Cope said.<br>
Cope earned three academic credits for each of these Field Periods. Following the philosophy of the Keuka College program, she researched, applied for and developed learning objectives for each of the annually-required placements.<br>
Field Period was created in 1942 and was Keuka's response to the war effort. Keukonians volunteered their time and talent for the good of the community, while applying classroom theories to real world situations.

<b>Major Briefs</b><br>
Psychology is the scientific and systematic study of behavior from a variety of perspectives. Through examination of the interaction among environmental and internal forces acting on human development and functioning, students gain a better appreciation of themselves and others. Courses are oriented to theoretical, research and applied considerations. The introductory course surveys the major areas. Advanced courses and seminars provide more detailed examination of behavioral and developmental issues. Independent studies, Field Periods and special courses facilitate the application of theoretical knowledge to practical concerns. Emphasis is placed on research methodology and formal communication skills consistent with the scientific basis of the field. Majors are encouraged to develop independent thought by participating in research projects and other investigatory work.
<p>
The psychology major allows considerable flexibility to develop a sequence of study which reflects the student's personal interests, abilities and plans for the future. By working closely with faculty advisors, other faculty members and the Experiential Programs office, students can effectively prepare for employment or for further education or training. 


<p>
<b>
Career Options</b><br>
The program provides a solid background for graduate study leading to careers in such applied areas as clinical, school and counseling psychology and teaching and research.

<p>
<center><b>From Student To Teacher in Eight Days</center></b>
<p>
Debra Rusinko, a graduate of the Class of 1995, breezed through her first day of teaching just eight days after graduating from Keuka. Thanks to the knowledge she gained through her Field Periods and special education classes, fresh-out-of-college Rusinko successfully taught in the Resource Room at Horseheads Elementary School without a hitch. 
<p>
"It was a great day," Rusinko said. "I worked with 19 fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders on math and reading." 
<p>
Rusinko knew what to expect because of the solid background of work experiences she gained at Keuka. Through Keuka's Field Periods, Rusinko worked in three different classrooms while she was still a student. 
<p>
"My Field Periods were beneficial because I had a variety of placements. I learned a lot from observing teachers. I also knew how to help the children in the Resource Room because of techniques I had remembered from special education class discussions," Rusinko said.

<font size=+3><b>Sociology</b></font> <br>
<font size=+2>at Keuka College</font><p>
<font size=+1>
<b>Major Briefs</b><br>
The sociology program stresses both traditional liberal arts and career education through emphases on applied sociology/sociological practice and criminal justice. The program provides an understanding of the nature and process of stability and change in human social life and an understanding of the workings of social groups, from the macro-level of the society as a whole, through the intermediate institutional and organizational levels, to the micro-level of the small, informal group. Designed to develop independence of thought, clarity of understanding and an ability to apply knowledge to analysis of real-life situations, the program offers students substantive knowledge of social life, as well as theoretical and methodological orientations in sociology. Field Period placements in applied settings of interest to the student are an important part of the sociology program.
       <p>
The sociology major may be completed with either a concentration in applied sociology/sociological practice or criminal justice. A sociology minor is also available.
<p>
<p>

<b>
Career Options</b><br>
Career opportunities are available in virtually any vocation that involves working with people. Representative examples include the areas of juvenile services, social planning and policy-making, personnel management, public and industrial relations, probation, law enforcement, community action and social research. The program also prepares students for graduate study in sociology and such related fields as counseling, administration, law, applied social research and program development.

<font size=+3>Experiential Education<br>
At Keuka College</font><p><font size=+1>
Keuka students describe their College as an environment where classrooms have no back rows; where doing is as much a part of their learning process as listening or reading; and where the world and the classroom are closely integrated.<p>
Field Period, established in 1942, is central to Keuka's instructional climate. Every year, each student must complete a self-directed, self-initiated 3-credit hour learning experience. During the 4-5 week annual placements, students transform classroom theory into practical experience. They immerse themselves in new cultures and gain a realistic understanding of the real world as they test career choices and build a resume of experience.<p>

<p>

<li>The Division of Business and Management prepares its students for success in a wide range of business environments or graduate school. Each major in the program provides a solid foundation in management, computer systems, accounting, human resources, financial analysis, marketing and strategic planning. Our aim is to provide students with marketable skills that make their transition into the "real world" as efficient and successful as possible. Field Periods add particular value to the Business and Management graduate by integrating four hands-on work experiences into their educational development. Students put into practice what they have learned in the classroom while they create a network of useful contacts. 

<li>For students considering advanced degrees, Keuka College is developing special relationships with graduate schools. An agreement already in place with Clarkson University allows graduates from the Management program to earn a Clarkson M.B.A. with just one year of additional study. Similar relationships with other schools are in process. 

<li>More than 10 percent of Keuka's student body are enrolled in the Division of Business of Management. 

<li>574 graduates shape our future as accountants, resort managers, caterers, human resource managers and marketing professionals.

As a group field period, students traveled to Costa Rica where they participated in a variety of hands-on experiences. They helped with the construction of a "hogar de paso," a "home for those passing through in the Methodist Church of Ciudad Quesada. The home would provide outpatient hospital services for Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans who could not afford lodging. Students had the opportunity to learn more about the lives and work of common Costa Ricans, as well as the role of the church and it service in that community.

Basic and Applied Social Sciences is an interdisciplinary division consisting of criminal justice, history, political science, psychology, social work and sociology. Each discipline retains autonomy, although interdisciplinary interaction both inside and outside the division is encouraged. Courses within each discipline are intended to provide a basic foundation in each major and to complement offerings in the various disciplines.
<p>
New tools and techniques are propelling the Division of Basic and Applied Social Science into the twenty-first century.
<p>
Keuka students can study behaviors, attitudes and reactions in the new observation room that has full-color video taping capabilities. 
<p>
The newly created socialization area allows social work students to identify with their profession. In addition to the abnormal psychology courses taught at Keuka, psychology majors now study clinical psychology. 
<p>
New interactive study guides provide students with immediate feedback. These guides accompany textbooks and direct students to the textbook chapter detailing the concept for further study. Students are trained for research professions with the statistical software package which allows them to analyze data and test hypothesis. 
<ul>
<li>Political science and history majors can speak directly with the White House while utilizing the Internet.

<li>The recent approval of the criminal justice major by the State Department of Education will train Keuka students to disarm the growing rate of teen crime.

<li>1,036 graduates shape Keuka's future as professors, lawyers, researchers, psychologists and social workers.

Keuka College: Nursing Division Briefs

Nursing<br></font>
<font size=+3>
Division Briefs</font><p>
The Keuka College nursing program is designed for students who are preparing for RN licensure and for registered nurses returning to school to obtain a bachelor of science in nursing (B.S.N.). The purpose of baccalaureate nursing education is to provide knowledge of the theory and practice of professional nursing. In addition to focusing on the care of individual clients in acute care settings, baccalaureate programs expand this preparation to include the care of the family, groups and community. Students practice in a variety of health care settings, initiate and coordinate health care and learn to think critically. Comprehensive health care is emphasized, which includes prevention, maintenance, health promotion, rehabilitation, counseling and education for clients and families across the life span. 
<p>
Clinical practice becomes increasingly self-directed as the student progresses through the program. Clinical affiliations are numerous and take place in a variety of urban and rural health care settings. Graduates of the Keuka College baccalaureate nursing program are able to assume a wide range of care roles in institutional and community settings.
<p>
A special characteristic of the program is the senior level Field Period in nursing when the student has an opportunity to practice in a variety of health care environments. During this Field Period, the student must integrate previous course work, receiving intensive preparation for postgraduate employment. 
<p>
1,355 graduates shape our future as registered nurses, home health care providers, wellness and nurse educators. 
<p>
Keuka's Step II program puts registered nurses boasting a two-year degree or nursing diploma on track to a bachelor of science degree. The flexible program, tailored to each student's needs and schedule, prepares graduates for supervisory and upper level administration positions in traditional health care systems and emerging community health care environments. 
<p>
The program is accredited by the Council of Baccalaureate and Higher Degree Programs of the National League for Nursing. Following completion of the program and the awarding of the baccalaureate degree, the graduate is eligible to apply for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) for professional nursing and to apply for a license to practice as a registered nurse (RN).

<font size=+3>
Division Briefs</font><p>
The humanities: English, modern languages, organizational communication, philosophy and religion, explore those enduring values of our heritage that have sustained and enriched human life in times of crises and doubt, prosperity and peace. Firmly rooted in human experience, the humanities examine, define and relate that experience to the contemporary age. Humanities involve the individual in the varied experiences of life. Course work in the humanities encourages students to express their individual ideas and personalities and to determine how they may succeed creatively in their chosen careers. 
<p>
The fine arts: art, dance, music and theater, emphasize the role of creativity in our lives. Course work in art, music, dance and theater gives students the opportunity to explore the varied ways in which individuals express themselves artistically. Courses offer historical and theoretical perspectives, as well as practice in artistic techniques and training in particular disciplines, giving students an appreciation of aesthetics. 
<p>
The Division of Humanities and Fine Arts offers a major in English with options for concentrations in writing/communication and creative writing and in organizational communication, as well as minor programs in art, creative writing, English, organizational communication and Spanish. Students also may receive certification to teach English in grades 7-12 by completing the requirements for teacher certification.

Keuka College: Experiential Learning Opportunities

Experiential Learning Opportunities</font>
<p>
A Keuka Field Period is the height of career exploration. It can, also, provide insight into entirely new lifestyles, immersing you in cultures miles away from your own, in philosophy and distance. 
<p>
11 students traveled to Mexico this year, thanks to the leadership of Michaela Cosgrove, assistant professor of Spanish. 
<p>
"Career exploration allows students to 'try on' a profession; a cultural immersion experience teaches students to observe a totally new environment with appropriate cultural perspective," Cosgrove said. 
<p>
Cosgrove led the Keuka students through present day Mexico City and the Yucatan after spending months preparing students with Mexico's past and insights regarding its social history. The student-travelers had two common learning objectives, understanding the important aspects of Mexico's social and cultural history from European and indigenous perspectives and how this history is reflected in contemporary Mexican society. In addition, each student selected a third, personal learning objective. 
<p>
Jane McMillan, a junior from Lowville, N.Y., studied myths surrounding the Quetzalcoatl and how they affected the people of Mexico. 
<p>
Although it is easy to become consumed by personal routines and daily life, there is a world full of experiences, adventures and memories. Traveling expands a person's horizons and enhances Keuka's liberal arts education!

<b>Organizations</b><br>
Professional student organizations are affiliated with the Nursing Division. Membership is optional and open to all interested students. The activities of these groups often reinforce classroom learning experiences while bringing together students with common career goals. 

<ul><li>  Nursing students can elect to become involved with the Keuka College Student Nurses Association. This organization offers students opportunities to develop professional social skills for advancing the concept of nursing in the community. 
</ul>
<b>Recent Activities</b><br>
Senior nursing students consulted for deputies in the Yates County Sheriff's Office this past year. The students provided individualized information on nutrition, exercise, fitness strategies and stress management. 
<p>
Members of Keuka's Student Nurses Association showed their community spirit and educated parade spectators by entering a hand-decorated float depicting a variety of nursing roles in Penn Yan's Buckwheat Harvest Festival Parade. 
<p>
These same students sponsor annual health fairs in the Penn Yan and surrounding areas in order to advance general concepts of wellness and health practices for residents in the area.  The series incorporates general messages of wellness and health teaching. 
<p>
Interests in international health care led two Keukonians abroad for Field Periods. In-depth studies uncovered the role of the Austrian nurse and Austria's health care system and nursing theories learned from a well-known nursing theorist in Japan.

Keuka College: Experiential Learning Opportunities

Experiential Learning Opportunities</font>
<p>
The Spring 1996 semester at Keuka College marked the first semester of a three-year service learning project funded by the Foundation for Long Term Care, in Albany, NY. Through this project Keuka College students volunteer in the gerontology field, gaining hands-on experience. In  the course, Perspectives on the Aging, students spend much of the semester learning in nursing homes, community-based agencies and long term care facilities. 
<p>
The course enhances the student's knowledge of the aging population related to service learning. Students volunteer their time and talents as they gain practical experience in the field. A dozen Keuka students are working and learning in area organizations. 
<p>
"This generation of students is the most effected by the rising costs associated with a growing aging population, smaller families and growth of the female work force. Participation in service learning courses focusing on the issues and policies governing practices can only help raise awareness levels, interest and civic responsibility for meeting the needs fo the elderly. This course serves as a backdrop for anticipated future contributions students will make as concerned members of their communities," Keuka College Associate Professor Nursing Kay Viggiani said.

Keuka College President Resigns Post
</font><p>
Keuka College President Arthur F. Kirk Jr. has resigned as president of Keuka College to accept the presidency of Saint Leo College outside of Tampa, Fla., effective January 1, 1997. In November, the Keuka College Board of Trustees will retain a search firm to help in the selection of a new president for Keuka College. 
<p>
Kirk leaves at a time when Keuka College is experiencing record growth, Chairman of the Board Frank P. Strong, Jr. said. Keuka's student body has more than doubled in the last 10 years. Students bring with them superior academic talents, boasting SAT scores above the national average. The College's endowment has skyrocketed, increasing eleven-fold. Millions of dollars of campus-wide renovations have rejuvenated the College's physical plant, modernizing facilities, providing handicapped accessibility and restoring Keuka's campus. For the first time in nearly 20 years, all of the College's facilities are in use for their intended purposes.
<p>
This growth, prosperity and stability follow on the heels of successful execution of the IDEAL 2000, the College's strategic plan. 
<p>
Keuka's success is due, in part, to the multi-year strategic plan, the IDEAL 2000, Strong said. The College has a plan and works that plan effectively. The Board of Trustees expects that the IDEAL 2000 will catapult the College well into the 21st century, establishing Keuka as a model in academic excellence and experiential learning. But the College's success is also due in large measure to the leadership and vision of Arthur Kirk. His insight, guidance and strategic planning abilities have guided Keuka for more than a decade. The College is fortunate that his wisdom and vision, his legacy, has permeated every aspect of the College.
<p>
It has been an honor and a privilege to lead Keuka College, Kirk said. Keuka continues to educate more students and educate them better, preparing them for a life of service to their communities, their professions and themselves. 
<p>
Accepting the presidency of St. Leo's College was one of the most difficult decisions I have made in my professional career. It was possible only because I am confident that Keukonians are united by the College's mission and vision and guided by a strong strategic plan that produces remarkable accomplishments year in and year out.
<p>
The IDEAL 2000 was implemented in the Spring 1994. Guided by a vision of the ideal Keuka for the 21st century, the strategic plan focuses on dynamic key result areas and is a process of continuous improvement. The plan is systematically renewed biannually and extends what is and has been the best of Keuka, allowing the College to realize its true potential. 
<p>
The IDEAL 2000 builds on the College's core strengths and charts a new course for Keuka, Marilyn Baader, a member of the Class of 1963 and Board of Trustees vice chair, said. It establishes this College as one of a handful of colleges in America with a comprehensive program to demonstrate the value of its educational experience, using the results to improve student learning. Keuka's integrated use of experience as a teacher and the synergistic interweaving of academic and student life programs into a seamless educational experience create a national model for educating students for a lifetime of learning.

Strong Appointed Interim President; Others Assume New Responsibilities
</font><p>
The Keuka College Board of Trustees has appointed Frank P. Strong, Jr., Board of Trustees chair, as the College's interim president, effective January 1, 1997. Keuka President Arthur F. Kirk Jr. announced his resignation from the College last month, to assume the presidency of St. Leo College outside of Tampa, Fla.  Strong served as Keuka's acting president from February to August 1995 while Kirk completed a six-month sabbatical.  
<p>
Marilyn Baader, Keuka College Board of Trustees vice chair and a member of the College's Class of 1963, steps up to acting chair of the College's governing board. Baader is a resident of Cayuga, N.Y.  A Board-appointed committee, chaired by Richard Rosett, of Rochester, N.Y., will conduct a national search for Keuka's 18th president.  
<p>
"Frank Strong is an experienced executive," Baader said. "His professional and volunteer experience, coupled with his years of service as a Trustee and former experience in our president's office, offer Keuka a knowledgeable, seasoned and strong leader. "
<p>
Strong, who retired from Eastman Kodak in 1991 after a 34-year career, is a resident of Fairport, N.Y. He is a veteran engineer, senior executive and group vice president. His current business pursuits concentrate on corporate governance. He has been a member of Keuka's Board of Trustees since 1987 and has worked closely with Kirk to realize Keuka College's goals and plan for its future. In July 1994, Strong assumed board chairmanship after serving for three years as vice chair. 
<p>
"It is with enthusiasm that I begin my tenure as interim president of Keuka College, knowing first-hand, what a tremendous experience it is to steer the course of an institution that has made such remarkable strides in the last decade," Strong, who holds a master's degree in engineering and business administration from Dartmouth College, said. "My priority will be to see that Keuka's strategic and operating plans remain on track, ensuring continued growth and quality."
<p>
In addition to his involvement with Keuka, Strong is a member of Governor Pataki's Privatization Commission and serves Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering, the Otetiana Council, Boy Scouts of America and the Rochester-Monroe County Visiting Nurse Service. 
<p>
Reporters:  Strong will be available for personal interviews at your convenience. Please call Stephanie  at (315) 536-4411 ext. 5241 to schedule an appointment.

<h2>TAMPERE</h2>
<a href="http://www.uta.fi/cgi-bin/yleiskartta-loc?379,249,TTKK">The map of Tampere</a>
<p>

<a href="http://www.tampere.fi/english.htm">Overview of the city</a>
<p>

Founded in the year 1779 on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids, about 170 km up north from
Helsinki, the city of Tampere is today a vigorous center of the greater economic area of Tampere
region with a total population of 400 000. Tampere combines material and intellectual resources
with impressive natural beauty in a most dynamic way. Tampere is the third-largest city in  and the largest inland city in Scandinavia, with its population of 170 000. Tampere is the major
industrial, marketing, and communication center for all of South-Central Finland and also a clean
and vibrant cultural center, located between two large lakes, Lake Pyh&auml;j&auml;rvi and Lake N&auml;sij&auml;rvi. <p>

<p>

The city's festival year begins with the Tampere film festival, which brings the world's best short
films to the silver screen. There are many cinemas in town which present a variety of films all
through the year. Tampere has two theatres, Tampereen Teatteri and Ty&ouml;v&auml;enteatteri where plays
and musicals are staged throughout the year. Tampere Jazz Happening and Tampere Illuminations
are held every autumn. In the summertime there is an open-air theatre at a beautifull site at the
Pyynikki-hill. <p>

<p>

In S&auml;rk&auml;nniemi recreation area you can find an amusement park, dolphinarium, aquarium,
planetarium, small children's zoo and Sara Hild&eacute;n art museum.<p>

There are excellent indoor and outdoor sports-facilities in Tampere and surrounding areas.<p>

<p>

<p>

<h3>Travel information</h3>
<p>

If flying to Helsinki on Finnair, you are eligible to get the connecting flight to Tampere free of
charge if you have requested this before your ticket has been written. This is not available on
charter or discount flights.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

From Helsinki to Tampere you can connect by plane, train or bus. The bus is the most convenient,
since there are direct buses (e.g.the bus company called "Paunu") from Helsinki airport to
Tampere almost every hour. The ride takes less than 3 hours.<p>

<a href="http://www.tut.fi/ttkk.koti/aikataulut.html">Timetables</a><p>

You can also take the Finnair bus from the airport directly to the railway station in Helsinki and
then the train to Tampere. Trains run nearly every hour during the daytime. If arriving in Finland
by boat, direct train service is available from both Helsinki and Turku (In Swedisth &Aring;BO !!). The
cost is less than FIM 100 one-way. The ride takes about two hours from both cities.<p>

<h2>Finland</a></h2>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a href="http://www.tpo.fi/gif/finland.gif"> The map of  Finland</a>. <br>
<a href="http://www.vn.fi/vn/um/">Virtual Finland </a><p>


Finland is the fifth largest country in Europe in terms of area. Of the total land area 70 % is
covered by forests. Finland is also famous for its 188 000 lakes and the 30 000 islands dotting its
coastline of 1 100 kilometres. The population is about 5 million. After Iceland and Norway,
Finland is the most sparsely populated country in Europe with 16 inhabitants perkm2.<p>

<p>

Finland has a mild continental climate and it is more favored than most countries at similar
latitudes because of the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. Winters in Tampere are rather
cold, with some snow. Summers are usually relatively warm. In fall and spring there is occasional
rain. Average temperature in Tampere in winter is about -5C and in summer about +15C. <p>

<p>

The short but spectacular spring and autumn seasons help to counterbalance the effect of the
winter. During the summer it never gets completely dark, and in the north sthe sun does not set at
all for some time. During the darkest weeks of winter there are six hours of full day-light. <p>

<p>

Since the weather is very cold in winter you should bring supplies of warm clothing such as coats,
hats, sweaters, warm socks, long underwear, etc. You will also need at least onepair of sturdy,
comfortable and warm boots or walking shoes as well as casual shoes. There are good
opportunities for winter sports so if you ice-skate, play ice hockey of ski cross-country, you may
wish to bring your equipment along.<p>

<title>Puhelinnumerouudistus </title>

<br>

Tänä vuonna tulee voimaan kaksi puhelinnumeroihin liittyvää uudistusta, TTKK:n vaihteen numero muuttuu 1.3.96 ja valtakunnalliset suuntanumerot muuttuvat 12.10.96.

<br>
<hr>
<br>

<ul>
  <img src="http://www.tut.fi/images/redball.gif">
 <b> TTKK:n vaihde 1.3.1996 alkaen 365 2111</b><br><br>
  Vanha kutsunumero toimii rinnakkaiskäytössä 31.3.1997 saakka. Samalla  muuttuvat myös kaikki 1-alkuiset alanumerot 3-alkuisiksi. TPO on ohjelmoinut ulkoa tulevat 1-alkuiset numerot 3-alkuisiksi, joten vanhoilla numeroilla soitettaessa puhelut tulevat perille.
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="http://www.tut.fi/images/redball.gif">
 <b>Suuntanumerot muuttuvat 12.10.1996</b><br><br> 
  Valtakunnallisessa suuntanumeromuutoksessa kaikki Hämeen suuntanumerot vaihtuvat numeroksi <b>03</b>. Tampereen verkkoryhmän nykyinen suuntanumero <b>931</b> vaihtuu siis numeroksi <b>03</b>. Tämä on syytä huomioida esim. kaikissa painotuotteissa.<br>
Rinnakkainen kaukoliikenne uusilla suuntanumeroilla aloitetaan jo 15.8.1996.
<p>
Yleiseuroopplainen <b>ulkomaantunnus</b> 00 otetaan käyttöön 12.10.1996 kello 00.00.
<br>Lisäksi käytössä ovat edelleen telelaitosten ulkomaantunnukset (999, 994, 990). 
<p>
Myös <b>matkaviestinten</b> numerot muuttuvat:<br>
<dd> 949 -> 049, 
<dd> 940 -> 040, 
<dd> 950 -> 050, 
<dd>9400 -> 0400, 
<dd>9500 -> 0500.
<p>
Palvelunumerot 9600, 9700 ja 9800 säilyvät ennallaan.

<H1>TUT in general</H1>
<P>
<B>TUT offers enterprises a wide diversity of research, product-development and consulting 
services.</B><P><B>
</B>The University  is responsible for scientific research, education in engineering and architecture 
based on this research, and the taining of researchers in the fields of engineering and architecture.<P>
Tampere University of Technology has grown rapidly  since it was founded in 1965. The student body 
numbers ca. 7000. In addition to basic-degree students, there are 800 postgraduate students at the 
University.  To date a total of over 5300 engineers and architects have qualified here. The University 
has over 900 staff members. <P>
Students may choose between 10 distinct degree programs, which are:<P>
  - Architecture<P>
  - Automation<P>
  - Civil Engineering<P>
  - Information Technology <P>
  - Electrical Engineering<P>
  - Environmental Engineering<P>
  - Fiber, Textile, and Clothing Science<P>
  - Industrial Management and Engineering<P>
  - Materials  Engineering<P>
  - Mechanical Engineering<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.tut.fi/ttkk.koti/units.html">Departments and Institutions  in TUT</A> <P>
English has already been  introduced as the language of tuition in Signal Processing, Materials 
Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering and is due to be introduced in Architecture, Environmental 
Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. In addition to agreements inside the Nordic Countries, 
there are also cooperation and axhange agreements with ca. 30 foreign univerisities.<P>
<P>
<H3>Close Involment with Industrial and Commercial 
World</H3>
Right from the outset the University has emphasized the value of  good  relations with industrial and  
commercial life.  The Universitys<B> </B> expertise and equipment have been utilized by 
enterprises, e.g. in their product development. The University has also provided access for enterprises 
to national and international research cooperation.<P>
The Universitys institutes are active in e.g. many research programs financed by the EU, such as 
COST, ESPRIT, RACE, EUREKA, and COMET II.<P>
<H3>Center of Knowledge and Skill</H3>
Technology results are often the fruit of combining results from many disciplines. The University is 
able to link up expertise in different areas of engineering in a flexible manner. Tampere Tecnology 
Centre, Hermia , with its various enterprises, together with the Tampere laboratories of the Technical 
Research Center of Finland (VTT), are both neighbors and partners of the University. <P>

Approximately 200 international students attend Tampere University of
Technology. International Office staff members help these students
with their initial adjustment to the University, assist them throughout
their entire stay by  answering questions and giving advice about personal
concerns, social and cultural differences  and finances. International Office

international students and  scholars have the greatest opportunity to
achieve their academic and personal goals.
<P>
Prior to coming to campus, international students receive the "Guide for
Foreign Students". Among the subjects covered in the guide are housing,
health, insurance, expenses, immigration regulations and transportation.
All course descriptions in English are published in "ECTS Information
Packages"which are available at the International Office  or  they can be
found in the Internet World Wide Web.
<P>
An orientation course will be held prior to the beginning of studies at
theend of  August. The program is designed to help students and scholars
become involved in the  campus and life in Finland.           
<P>
Students are encouraged to visit the International Office to obtain program
specific information and to meet with the International Office staff.
The International Office is open Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 15:00
pm. An international student advisor and  a study abroad advisor are available
on a walk-in basis every day.

<h1>Course guide</h1>

Most of the courses are taught in Finnish but they are mainly based on literature written in
English. If the course is not taught in English, foreign students are encouraged to study the
subject concerned, for instance from books written in English. Examinations can also be arranged
individually, preferably in English.<p>

<b>All the credit units are given in the ECTS credit system.</b> (1
credit unit at TUT corresponds to 1,5 ECTS credits)<p>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H1>OPISKELU ULKOMAILLA</H1></FONT>
<DD>Opiskelu ulkomailla kiinnostaa yh&auml; useampia opiskelijoita ja mahdollisuudet ulkomaiseen
opiskeluun ovat viime vuosien aikana lis&auml;&auml;ntyneet huomattavasti. Tampereen teknillinen
korkeakoulu tulee jatkossakin edist&auml;m&auml;&auml;n opiskelijavaihtoa ulkomaisten korkeakoulujen kanssa
ja se on asettanut tavoitteekseen, ett&auml; 25 %:lla TTKK:n l&auml;sn&auml;olevista opiskelijoista olisi
mahdollisuus opiskella tai ty&ouml;skennell&auml; ulkomailla opiskelunsa aikana.<p>

Ulkomailla opiskellessaan opiskelijat voivat t&auml;ydent&auml;&auml; opintojaan ja joskus he pystyv&auml;t
perehtym&auml;&auml;n johonkin erikoisalaan, jota ei ehk&auml; Suomessa opeteta lainkaan tai ei ainakaan siin&auml;
laajuudessa kuin ulkomailla.<p>

Ulkomailla vietetty vuosi antaa opiskelijalle itselleen my&ouml;s paljon lis&auml;p&auml;&auml;omaa tulevaisuuden
ty&ouml;el&auml;m&auml;&auml; varten varsinaisten opintojen lis&auml;ksi. Kielitaito karttuu sek&auml; el&auml;m&auml;n- ja maailmankatsomus
avartuvat. Pitempiaikainen oleskelu vieraassa maassa perehdytt&auml;&auml; ja tutustuttaa
yksityiskohtaisesti kyseisen maan kulttuuriin ja tapoihin ts. opiskelijat oppivat toimimaan
"maassa maan tavalla", mik&auml; my&ouml;hemmin auttaa huomattavasti suhteiden solmimista ko. maan
yrityksiin ja/tai muihin tahoihin. Kaiken lis&auml;ksi muiden maiden korkeakouluissa on huomattavan
suuri m&auml;&auml;r&auml; ulkomaalaisia opiskelijoita monista eri maista, joten opiskelijat voivat tutustua ja
luoda kontakteja monien eri maiden opiskelijoihin ja mahdollisesti my&ouml;s tutkijoihin ja professoreihin.<p>

Palatessaan takaisin omaan korkeakouluunsa opiskelijat voivat "tuoda mukanaan" uusia ja
erilaisia ideoita opetustoiminnan ja tutkimust&ouml;iden kehitt&auml;miseksi TTKK:ssa sek&auml; omien
kiltojensa ja kerhojensa toiminnan pirist&auml;miseksi. <p>

Students should bring an E-111 form with them for the local health care.
<P>
The Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS) [in Finnish : YTHS] provides medical care for students enrolled at the universities or at other institutions of higher education in 16 towns throughout Finland. A medical care fee is included in the Student Union membership fee which is FIM 464,-. After paying the fee, students are entitled to use the medical care services. FSHS sevices are either free of charge or reasonably priced.
<P>
If a student becomes acutely ill and needs immediate attention and the Student Health Service is not open, he/she can contact one of the local communal health centers to get an appointment. In Tampere it costs about FIM 50 per appointment.
<P>
The main principle of the EC agreement is that a citizen of any EC country will get same benefits of the social security system as the citizents of the EC country where he or she is studying or working (for example hospital services). Students must have an E-111 form with them from their own local Social Security Office in order to be covered by the scheme.

period if you have any problems.
<P>
The housing is usually arranged in student apartments near the University of
Technology in the buildings called "Mikontalo", "Wäinölä" and "Paavola".
<P>
Student apartments are composed of several two- or three-bedroom apartments
in which every student has one private room and shares a kitchen and a
bathroom. Laundry facilities are located in the basement of each building.
Students should bring their own towels, bed linen and kitchenware. All the
student apartments are equipped with basic furniture. The rents range from

</P>
<P><DT>
<DD>
<P>Tampere University of technology is located in the Hervanta suburb
which is about 7km from Tampere downtown. Hervanta was established in
1970's and has now grown to be the biggest suburb in Tampere with a
population of approximately 30000 inhabitants. This quite large
population base guarantees good services in Hervanta, such as several
supermarkets, banks and all other basic conveniences as well as
some special services. The student union of TUT has it's own movie
theatre and disco/restaurant that are like most other services
located in the Hervanta center which is about 0.5km from TUT. To
reach the services not available in Hervanta, there're very good bus
connections to downtown. Several of the dormitories in Tampere are
located very near to TUT.
<P>Hervanta, often also called Herwood, is a growing suburb, and one
of the reasons for this is TUT residing there. Technology Centre
Hermia is located in the immediate vicinity of TUT as well as is VTT,
the Technical Research Centre of Finland. Both have tight connections
with TUT. Another reason might be the nature which is very close as
Hervanta is surrounded by forests.

The University Library offers library and information services as well as training in how to
research for information to the University community and others in the area close to Tampere
requiring technical information. The library's collections may be used on the premises or taken on
loan. To maintain the quality of its collections, new literature and materials are continuously being
added and connections with international organizations are developed. Interlibrary loans are
arranged with almost a hundred cooperating libraries. <p>

Tampere Technical Information Service (TATTI) assists enterprises with a variety of problems in
information management. TATTI offers information searches and current awareness services via
international systems. In addition, other services are offered, such as travelling information
specialist services and three-party searching.<p>

The Library at Tampere University of Technology has about 140 000 volumes, 1500  periodicals
and a variety of CD-ROM databases. Borrowing is free. The library has books, journals,
magazines and study desks. Catalogues and borrowing are partly computerized. Library catalog is
called TUTCAT and the research language is multilingual. <p>

Most of the institutes and laboratories have small-scale libraries of their own (or some collections
of professional literature: books and periodicals).<p>

An introduction to the library and borrowing is given during the orientation course in the
beginning of the fall term.<p>

<!-- Using a table makes it easier to construct -->
<dd>Tampere University of Technology provides highest level education in technical science
and architecture,   engages in research and  product development and furthers technical
and scientific development in Finland.

<P>In addition, TUT serves public institutions as well as industry  by means of shared
projects, commissioned research and  diploma projects.

<P>TUT offers three one-year International University Programs, whose language
of instruction is English. The programs are in the
following fields: <a href="laaketek.htm">Biomedical Engineering</a>,
<a href="signal.htm">Digital Signal Processing</a> and <a href="material.htm">Materials Science</a>.
English is due to be introduced in
Architecture,  Environmental Engineering and  Mechanical Engineering as the language of tuition.

<P>Usually the language of Instruction at TUT is Finnish, but individual studies for
non-Finnish-speaking exchange students are
arranged in English. A good oral and written command of English is
therefore necessary for all exchange students. TOEFL may
be used to certify English skills.

<P>TUT offers programs covering a wide spectrum of technological knowledge and skills.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>Structure of undergraduate studies</H2></FONT>
<DD>
Students wishing to study at Tampere University of Technology (TUT) for M.Sc. -degrees
must apply for admission to a degree program. There are ten degree programs to choose from.
<p>
Studies are pursued at three levels: general level, subject-related level and advanced
specialized level. General studies (about 2 years) are at the beginning of the studies and
are composed of e.g. mathematics, physics and data processing. General studies in
architecture include courses in arts, social science and mathematics and natural science.
All the courses at general level are given only in Finnish.
<p>
After ca. two years the studies become more subject-related. Students can choose specific
study options within his/her degree program. A Master's thesis is written at the advanced level.
<p>
The degree program of M.Sc. in Engineering requires ca. 6 years and the M.Sc. in
Architec-ture ca. 8 years to be completed.

<!-- sisennys tapahtuu DD-tagilla -->

<P><DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>A Common Language of Academic Recognition</H2></FONT>

<DD>
ECTS, The European Community Course Credit Transfer System, was developed by the
Commission of the European Communities in order to provide common procedures to guarantee
academic recognition of studies abroad. It provides a way of measuring and comparing learning
achievements, and transferring them from one institution to another. This is achieved through the
use of a common ECTS credit unit and a common ECTS grading scale. ECTS also improves
access to information on foreign curricula.<p>

The ECTS system is based on the principle of mutual trust and confidence between the
participating higher education institutions. <i>The information package</i> provides general information
of the host institution and descriptions of the available courses. <i>The transcript of records</i> shows
every course taken and completed by the student and <i>the ECTS credits</i> and the grades according
to the local grading scale. <p>

These documents are used by the institutional and departmental coordinators, appointed by each
institution to deal with the administrative and academic aspects of ECTS. It is their role to advise
and counsel students who wish to participate in ECTS. <p>

<DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>The origins of ECTS- the pilot scheme</H2></FONT>
<DD>
<p>
ECTS was tested as a pilot scheme in 1989-1995. It operated in five subject areas: Business
Administration, Chemistry, History, Mechanical Engineering and Medicine, and involved 145
higher education institutions in all EC Member States and EFTA countries, each of them with one
faculty or department. From Tampere University of Technology the Department of Mechanical
Engineering took part in the pilot scheme.<p>

Starting from 1995 ECTS extends to new areas. At Tampere University of Technology all nine
departments will begin applying ECTS-principles in their student exchange:<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The Department of Architecture
<li>The Department of Automation
<li>The Department of Civil Engineering
<li>The Department of Electrical Engineering
<li>The Department of Environmental Engineering
<li>The Department of Materials Engineering
<li>The Department of Mechanical Engineering
<li>The Department of Industrial Engineering and Management
<li>The Department of Information Technology
</ul>
<P><DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>ECTS credits</H2></FONT>
<DD>
<p>
ECTS credits are a value allocated to course units to describe the student workload required to
complete them. They reflect the quantity of work each course requires in relation to the total
quantity of work required to complete a full year of academic study at the institution (lectures,
practical work, seminars, private work - in library or at home - and examinations or other
assessment activities). ECTS credits express a relative value.<p>

In ECTS, 60 credits represent the workload of a year of study. Normally 30 credits are given for a
semester and 20 credits for a term. Credits are awarded only when the course has been completed
and all required examinations have been succesfully taken. <p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>The ECTS grading scale</H2></FONT>
<DD>
<p>

Examination and assessment results are expressed in many different grading systems in Europe.
To help institutions interpret the grades awarded to ECTS students the ECTS grading scale has
been developed by the institutions participating in the pilot scheme. The ECTS grade gives more
information of the student's achievements than the institutional grade but does not replace the
local grade.<p>
<pre>
ECTS grading scale             percentage of students

A            Excellent         10 %
B            Very Good         25 %
C            Good              30 %
D            Fair              25 %
E            Passed            10 %
FX and F     Fail
</pre>
<P><DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>ECTS Students</H2></FONT>
<DD>
<p>

The students participating in ECTS will receive full credit for all academic work succfessfully
carried out at any of the ECTS partner institutions and they will be able to transfer these academic
credits from one participating institution to another on the basis of prior agreement on the content
of study programmes abroad between students and the institutions involved.<p>

When the student has successfully completed the study programme <i>previously agreed</i> between
the home and host institutions and returns to the home institution, credit transfer will take place,
and the student will continue the study course at the home institution without any loss of time or
credit.<p>

Most students participating in ECTS will go to one single host institution, study there for a
limited period of time and then return to their home institution. Some may decide to stay at the
host institution, possibly to gain a degree. Some may also decide to proceed to a third institution
to continue their studies. In each of these three cases, students will be required to comply with the
legal and institutional requirements of the country and institution where thet take their degree. <p>

Students selected by each institution to participate in ECTS may only be awarded a student
mobility grant if they fulfill the general conditions of eligibility for the ERASMUS grant. These
are:<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Students must be citizens of one of the EC Member States or citizens of one of the EFTA
countries (or recognized by one Member State or one EFTA country as having an official status
of refugee or stateless person or permanent resident). Students from EFTA countries will be
eligible within the ERASMUS exchange programme to study in an EC Member State. EFTA
nationals registrered as students in ECTS participating institutions in other EFTA countries or in
Community Member States are only eligible for participation in ECTS if they have established a
right of permanent residence.
<li>Students shall not be required to pay tuition fees at the host intitution. The student may,
however, be required to continue to pay his/her normal tuition fees to the home institution during
the study period abroad.
<li>The national grant/loan to which a student may be entitled for study at his/her institution may
not be discontinued, interrupted or reduced while the student is studying in another Member State
and is receiving an ERASMUS grant.
<li>One study period abroad should not last less than three months or more than twelve
months. Students in the first year of their studies are not eligible for receiving
ERASMUS grants.<p>

All exchange students, should be registered at a university in their home
country and the courses taken at Tampere University of Technology should be part of their main
degree. Two years of university studies are required for all exchange students before attending
TUT. Every student studying at TUT must register every academic year. Depending on his / her
academic status, every student has to register either as an exchange student, a degree student, a
postgraduate student, or a non-degree student.<p>

Students should register at the Student Office (or at the International Office) at the end of August
or the beginning of September for the whole year or the fall term and at the beginning of January
for the spring term.<p>

In order to register, students have to fill in a registration form and pay a membership fee of ca.
FIM 500 to the Student Union.<p>

<DD>
Higher education in Finland is free, i.e. there are no tuition fees to be paid to the institutions
of higher education (International University Courses in English are an exception).
However, the membership fee for the Student Union is compulsory for all undergraduate
students; postgraduate students may join the Union if they wish. The membership fee,
which also entitles students to use the services of the student health center, is about FIM 500
per year. In addition to this, a foreign student must be able to pay for his food, lodgings, clothes,
study material, social life, etc. The average living expenses of a single student are at least
FIM 3000 per month.
<p>
According to the Aliens Act every foreign student (except Scandinavians) is required to present
a financial statement which is FIM 30 000 for one academic year. The financial statement must
be in order when applying for a student visa from Finnish Embassies.

<P><DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>Financial Support</H2></FONT>
<DD>
<b>Please notice that Tampere University of Technology cannot offer any financial support to
foreign students.</b> You must be able to finance your studies yourself or have a scholarship
from your home country or from other sources. And please notice that at the present situation
it is very difficult to find part-time work in Finland.
<p>
The Finnish Center for International Mobility and Exchange Programs (CIMO) under the Ministry
of Education offers scholarships to foreign students both under reciprocal scholarship programs
based on bilateral cultural agreements and under specialist research programs. These
scholarships should be applied through the educational authorities of your own country.
The scholarships are announced anually to the governments of the recipient countries,
who will propose the candidates to CIMO for final approval. For more information please
contact the educational authorities in your country.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H1>Student Union and Free Time Activities</H1></FONT>
<!-- sisennys tapahtuu DD-tagilla -->
<DD>
All students at the University belong to the Student Union after paying its membership fee. The
membership provides various discounts e.g. in bookstores, theatres and from buss and trains
tickets.<p>

The Student Union organizes a lot of leisure activities such as concerts, film screenings,
excursions, parties etc. The biggest event is on May Day when the academic year of Technology
students culminates and freshmen become fully-fledged students. The most important insignia for
them is the tasselled cap, which unites the students of technology. Also the foreign
students are able to order the tasseled cap from the Student Union. The cap costs
a couple of hundreds of marks depending on the time when it is ordered.<p>

Each department has a student guild which looks after their student's interest at department level
and provides cultural and other free-time activities. Every autumn the guilds organize a project of
getting overalls. Students wear overalls for most of the informal university excursions, "overall
parties", etc.<p>

Into the Student Union belong some 60 associations which offer students a lot of activities, from
fishing and sailing to profession-specific clubs. These include tennis, ice-hockey, football, "s&auml;hly"
and many others. There is also an athletic club room in the Main Building for students and
university staff.<p>

International tutors and their friends organize lots of fun, get-togethers once a week in different
pubs, caf&eacute;s or bars in Tampere to have a drink and to discuss current topics.<p>

When being in a foreign country people usually want to see more than just the place where they
are living, so travelling within and outside Finland will propably be one leisure activity for the
foreign students. Travelling in Finland is easy, the bus and the train networks are good, and
students will get tickets at a reduced rate (usually 50% of the normal price). Helsinki and Turku
are only two hours away from Tampere. If you want to see Lapland you can easily travel by plane
or train to the north.<p>

The capital of Sweden, Stockholm is across the Baltic sea from Turku. You can go there by a
huge luxury ferry at a reduced student price. The voyage takes about 10 hours. St. Petersburg in
Russia and Tallinn in Estonia are also within easy reach from Finland. Coach and train excursions
are organized by several travel agents to St. Petersburg and they have frequent boat connections
to Tallinn from Helsinki.<p>

<h2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their
Activities in the Department of Mechanical Engineering</h2>

<p>

<b>Machine Design</b><p>

<p>

The institute possesses the research staff and laboratory equipment of
suitable versaitility for important model and prototype experiments in
the field of product development. It is at the peak of international
competence in vibration measurements, those supporting product
development at W&auml;rtsil&auml; Diesel a case in point.<p>

<p>

Vibration analyses are fundamental in the development of condition
monitoring systems. For measurements connected with power
transmission, the Institute has test stands of which particular use
has been made by gear manufacturers in their product
development. Product development addresses the total life-cycle of a
product, starting with customer needs and ending with recycling.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Engineering Mechanics</b><p>

<p>

The Institute of Engineering Mechanics teaches and researches the
behavior of structures and machines from the strength of materials
point of view. Another focus of intrest is machine vibrations.<p>

<p>

Teaching aims to develop ability in calculation methods and
measurement techniques for design and research related to product
development.<p>

<p>

The research areas currently receiving emphasis are optimization,
application of the finite-element method, and the analysis of
vibrations in structures. An example of the last mentioned is
vibration research on big diesel engine, carried out in cooperation
with W&auml;rtsil&auml; Diesel Oy.<p>

<p>

<b>Production Engineering</b><p>

<p>

Within the field of manufacturing industry the Institute gives
education in the areas of manufacturing methods and their
automatization and quality-assurance techniques, including
measurements and calibrations. Many of the skills imparted are
applicable also in more widely in the discrete manufacturing
industry.<p>

<p>

On the foundation of these basic techniques, productivity design for
production systems is developed in order to support product-design
activities.<p>

<p>

Education is supported by research, part of which consists of
industrial applications. The other part is carried out within the
Institute. Research is used to deepen the level of knowledge and to
develop new design and planning tools, e.g. software. The Institute is
participating in 1994-95 in the international project EUREKA
MAINE-EU744 (FMSMAINT SYSTEM).<p>

<h2>Institutes of Department of Information Technology</h2>

<p>

<b>General information</b><p>

<p>

Data processing -the combination of compouter and information technology - has made information technology into a discrete whole, which is required both as a separate area  of expertise in
technology and as a provider of indispensible basic skills for other areas in technology. This
development is reflected by the differentiation in 1993 of the Faculty of Information Technology
from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.<p>

<p>

<b>Mathematics</b><p>

<p>

In addition to teaching, the Institute of Mathematics is actively engaged in research on coding
theory, hypermedia, mathematical control theory, fuzzy mathematics, optimization, computability
theory, and other areas of mathematics.<p>

<p>

Computer-aided hypermedia based teaching methods are being developed at the institute. This
hypermedia teaching material can be reached at a variety of levels and facilitates studying significantly.<p>

<p>

<b>Signal Processing</b><p>

<p>

The Institute is the leading recearch unit in Finland in the field of signal and image processing,
offering teaching of the highest order in many subareas of information technology.<p>

<p>

The most central research areas are signal processing algorithms and applications, digital image-processing methods, speech coding and processing, digital audio, digital processing circuit design,
and VLSI implementation. The Institute is participating on the EU research projects RACE,
COST, EUREKA, and ESPRIT.<p>

<p>

<b>Software Systems</b><p>

<p>

The importanceof software systems is based onthe central role of software engineering in the
applications of information technology and in product development. Central areas of strength in
teaching  and research are modern software methods  and tools, design of embedded and
distributed systems, forkmal methods, and compute networks. Activities, which have veen
developed to serve domestic industry, have achieved international recognition.<p>

<p>

<p>

The laboratories cooperate closely in both education and research.  This<p>

cooperation involves also Electronics Laboratory in the Department of<p>

Electrical Engineering.<p>

<p>

Software Systems Laboratory has currently two professors and three associate<p>

professors, and the other laboratories of the Department are roughly of the<p>

same size.  The basic degree offered by the Department is that of Diploma<p>

Engineer (MSc), the postgraduate degrees being Lic.Tech. and Dr. Tech.  The<p>

annual educational output of the laboratory is some 50 Diploma Engineers, 2<p>

Lic. Tech., and 1 Dr. Tech.<p>

<p>

The main language of teaching is Finnish.  Signal Processing has an<p>

international programme, where all courses are given in English.  In<p>

Software Systems, seminars are held in English, when needed, and this has<p>

also been the case with advanced courses.<p>

<p>

The basic structure of Diploma Engineer&AElig;s degree in the department,<p>

comprising 180 credit units, is the following:<p>

<h2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their Activities in the Department of Electrical Engineering</h2>

<p>

<b><i>Physics</i></b><p>

<p>

The central areas of teaching and research in Physics are experimental
physics and semiconductor engineering. The Institute has five research
laboratories, namely the Laboratories of Semiconductor Engineering,
Surface Physics, Physics of Aerosols (Environmental Physics), Plasma
Engineering, and Fur and Leather Technology.<p>

<p>

In the vast majority of cases, research is conducted jointly with, and
financed by, some outside party. Central research projects are in
optical electronics directed by Professor Markus Pessa and several
others connected with combustion mechanisms, emissions, and the
quantification and clean-up of the latter.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Semiconductor and Surface Science Laboratories</i></b><p>

<p>

The laboratories directed by Professor Markus Pessa focus on the
development of compound-semiconductor and optoelectronic components,
research on reactions between catalytically active surfaces and gases,
and theoretical and experimental research on surface atomic
structure. The unit is active e.g. in three EU technology programs
(RACE WELCOME 2006, ESPRIT SUPERDEV 7227, ESPRIT SMILES 8447). <p>

<p>

The semiconductor group manufactures, anomgst other things,
client-specific epitaxial semiconductor discs, lasers ussed in fiber
reinforcers in optical telecommunication, lasers transmitting
brightred light, photo, X-ray, and particle detectors, optical power
transformers, and solar cells.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><i>Electronics</i></b><p>

<p>

The microelectronics and Industrial Electronics Laboratories of the
Institute of Electronics together cover quite a wide spectrum of
pompetence within electronics. The Institute's computer equipment and
design tools are of top class. There is total command of design from
microcircuits right up to the final completed circuit
card. Information technology at the Institute has attained top
international standards in neural and fuzzy research.<p>

Other emphasis areas are advanced user interfaces and control of
embedded device structures ranging from sensors to
activators. Contacts with industry preserve wideness in the range of
activities, closeness to practice, and vital connections with
students' future workplaces.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><i>Biomedical Engineering</i></b><p>

<p>

The most central research area at the Ragnar Granit Institute is
research on the bioelectric and biomagnetic phenomena occurring in
biological tissue. The aim is to apply these phenomena in practice
over broad areas in clinical diagnosis and medical therapy. The
outcome of theoretical and experimental research has been the
development of diagnostic instrumentation and methods for the
diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the nervous system. <p>

The Institute has wide international contacts and <u>all its tuition
is in English</u>. The knowledge gained can be widely utilizsed in the
fields of electronics and computer science.<p>

<p>

<p>

<i><b>Power Engineering</i></b><p>

<p>

The Institute is one of the leading electrixcal power research units
in Finland. Currently several research projects are underway, the aims
of which have been defined in line with the needs of electric
utilities, power companies, and the manufacturing industry. Wider
research projects relate to the prevention of disturbances in an
electricity transmission network, distribution network design and
fault diagnosis of its components, and the evaluation and attenuation
of the environmental impact of 50 Hz electrical and magnetic
fields.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><i>Power Electronics</b></i>   <p>

 <p>

The Institute of Power Electonics concentrates on teaching and
research in power electronics, electric drives, and illumination
technology. The novel technical solutions for motor drives made
available by new power semiconductors have been central topics for
dissertations. <p>

<p>

In addition to questions relating to converter command and control
implemented by new power semiconductors, the Institute has special
competence e.g. in optics design for lamps and in power electronics
applications in lighting control. Results of research in these fields
are to be seen in industrial plants and at many airports round the
world. <p>

<p>

<b><i>Electricity and Magnetism</b></i><p>

<p>

For a decade now the Institute has conducted research on exploiting
the phenomenon of superconductibity in electromagnets, particularly
for energy engineering applications. The Institute is participating in
a joint project of the Northern Countries to develop high-temperature
superconductors for industrisal applications. The practical commercial
breakthrough of superconductivity may be only some years
away. Electric motors will increase in power thanks to enhanced
efficiency and decreased size. <p>

<p>

The cryogenic measuring station must be further developed along lines
enabling it to fulfill the wishes of industry.<p>

<h2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their Activities in the Department of Automation Engineering</h2>

<p>

<b><i>Automation and Control Engineering</i></b><p>

<p>

Work at the Institute of Control Engineering is concerned with modeling, measurements,
simulation, control design, and the creation of control systems. Control Engineering's systems-oriented way of thinking is currently applied also outside actual engineering areas, e.g. in
bionedical engineering, environment protection, and economics. Some of the central teaching
areas at the Institute are systems engineering, process control, and robot automation. The
Institute has been paricularly active in commissioned research for over 15 years. <p>

<p>

Amongst the most important current application areas are wood processing, mechatronics, and
energy production. New areas in basic research are neural networks and automation applications
of fuzzy logic systems.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Measurement and Information Technology</b></i><p>

<p>

Activities at the Institute of Measurement Technology deal with automation and electrical
measurement. Also the Institute is developing measurement methods related to quality control
(TQM) and environmental engineering. Research is concerned with sensor technology and the
analysis and processing of measurement signals.<p>

<p>

Multivariate signal analysis has been applied, e.g. to the thermo-mecanical pulping process
(HIMA project), and the interaction model developed has made it possible to decrease process
disturbances. Research in sensor technology combines process models and sensor moderls in such
a way as to permit also questions of sensor location to be handled. Research in flow measurement
is tops in the world.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><i>Hydraulics and Automation</b></i><p>

<p>

The Institute of Hydraulics and Automation (IHA) is the second-largest institute in the field in
Europe. The activities of the Institute include, e.g. Hydraulics, pneumatics, machine automation
and robotics. In addition to teaching, IHA is engaged in several research and product-development projects serving both large and small mechanical engineering enterprises and
requiring the expertise of the Institute. Importantly also, basic research activities at IHA ensure
the long-term development of technologies.<p>

<p>

Water Hydraulics replaces oil, the conventional medium with pure water or HFA liquid. This is a
significant advantage, e.g. from the vantage point of environment friendliness. In a water
hydraulics development project conducted jointly with industry, water hydraulics components on
the market were investigated and new commercial components were developed.<p>

<H2>Description of the Department of Materials Engineering</H2>

The Department of Materials Science is founded on the 1st of August,
1993 and it consists of five institutes: Materials Science, Chemistry,
Electron Microscopy, Plastic Technology and Fibre, Textile and
Clothing Science. At present the amount of teaching staff is 19 (8
professors and associate professors, 7 assistants and 4 lecturers) and
the amount of students 370.

<H2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their Activities</H2>

<H4>Materials Science</H4>

The development of new materials and applications of modern materials
engineering, in cooperation with industry, underpins activities in the
Institute of Materials Science. The Institute has many active research
fields such as mechanical alloying, ceramic materials, coatings and
coating techniques, high temperature superconductors, ceramic filters
and membranes etc. Generally the four main fileds are represented in
the Institute: physical metallurgy, process metallurgy, ceramic
materials and new materials. The research is mainly based on the
cooperation with the industry and from the beginning the Institute has
been the largest unit in TUT engaging in contract research. The
Institute is presently involved also in several international research
projects belonging to the COST- and BRITE/EURAM-programme.<p>

The student exchange is increased since 1990 and at the present the
Institute offers almost all the courses also in English. The students
have different possibilities to study in the Institute: participate in
projects, take courses or do the Master of Science-degree after B.Sc.
The most popular is the one year visiting status in which the student
participate in courses or in a project.

<H4>Chemistry</H4>

The Institute of Materials Chemistry is responsible for basic teaching
in chemistry on all degree programs of the University and conducts
commissioned research both inside and outside the University. Research
in the immediate future will focus on investigations of the molecular
properties of materials with a view to elucidating the cooperative
functions of naturally occurring and synthetic molecules, which will
be modified to desired form. A particular subject of research will be
the organized molecular films of organic and bioorganic compounds
which form sensor system, transmit energy or a charge and which could
be utilized e.g. for information storage or processing. Since the
central focus of research here is on phenomena caused by light, the
research could be termed supramolecular photochemistry which is
closely coupled to electronics.

<H4>Electron Microscopy</H4>

The Centre for Electron Microscopy is a institute specializing in
cross-disciplinary materials characterization and failure analysis; it
is responsible for professional , post-graduate studies, and
continuing education in these areas. The Centre has at its disposal
versaitile electron-optical equipment which makes possible e.g., the
chemical analysis of very small areas and characterization of
materials even at atomic level. The Centre is in close research
cooperation not only with the different Institutes at TUT but also
with other research institutes in Finland and abroad as well as with
industry.<p>

<H4>Plastics Technology</H4>

Teaching centres round the structure and techniques of manufacturing
polymer materials (plastics, rubbers, and plastic composites). The
Institute boasts the greatest number of publications and patents at
the University. The four words best describing the materials research
which ranges from the molecular level to applications are: structure,
processing, properities, and utilization.<p>

The Institute's internationally best known area is biodegradable
surgical products. The polymers which dissolve in the living body
developed by proferssor T&ouml;rm&auml;l&auml;'s research group are
already bywords under the name of Biofix amongst both surgeons and
patients.<p>

The ceramic core material used in the manufacture of hollow products
is an example of composite and multilayer structures which are
expanding the application areas of materials.<p>

<H4>Fiber, Textile, and Clothing Science</H4>

The Institute of Fiber, Textile, and Clothing Science has expertise in
fiber raw materials from polymers to fibers as well as in the
manufacture of finished textile products and controlling process.
Research plays an important role in the function on the Institute,
subjects of research are e.g. biotechnology in fiber and textile
treatment and surface chemistry phenomena. The Institute has carried
out research on the laundering of fabrics for jeans. Stone washing can
be replaced by cellulase enzyme treatment, which does not harm washing
machines.<p>

Dyeing and other chemical treatments and the control of static
electricity are textile and surface-chemistry phenomena that the
Institute has studied. The Institute has also worked on the recycling
and practical applications of textile waste. Recycled materials made
from textile waste are used e.g. as base mats under parquet and as
cleaning cloths.<p>

<h2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their
Activities in the Department of Environmental Engineering</h2>

<p>

<b>Thermal Engineering</b><p>

<p>

Our society requires energy in many forms. Energy must be produced
with ever increasing efficiency and environment friendliness. It must
also be used wisely and economically. It is precisely with energy
production and its efficient use that the institute of Thermal
Engineering is involved. From amongst the wide range of activities,
the principal emphasis rests on combustion processes, computer
calculation of fluid flow measurement, pumps and blowers, energy use
in buildings, air conditioning, and refrigeration engineering.<p>

<p>

One example of the Institute's multifarious research activities is the
joint developement with industry of a heavy-oil burner.<p>

The institute is well equipped to participate in research and
development work on energy production, emissions reduction, economical
operation and the development of new products and methods.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Paper Converting</b><p>

<p>

The Institute of Paper Converting gives education in the fields of paper and paper converting
technologies. In paper converting technology is especially concentrated on packaging materials of
which flexible and liquid packaging products form the lion's share in paper and paper board
converting. Ever stricter legislation in different countries, and particularly in EU directives,
stipulates that packaging be recyclable. The Institute of Paper Converting is responding to this
equally technological and economic challenge by researching and developing environmentally friendly paper, paper board and plastic packaging solutions.<p>

<p>

Pilot lines at the Institute are helping in the development of manufacturing processes and different
webs for flexible and liquid packaging.<p>

<p>

<h2>Degree Program in Environmental Engineering</h2>

<p>

Since the beginning of 1970's water and sanitary engineering education
has been given within the Civil Engineering programme. A Master`s
programme in environmental engineering was started in 1991 and
includes water and environmental engineering, chemistry, thermal
engineering and safety engineering. The basic degree awarded by TUT
after completition of studies is the M.Sc. in Engineering.<p>

<p>

<b>Objectives and professional orientation</b><p>

<p>

Environmental issues have gained a lot of attention and the need for
managing them have widely been admitted. Thus it is essential to train
specialists to meet new challenges. Prevention and management are key
words in solving environmental problems. Environmental engineering is
needed to steer practices towards clean technologies, environmentally
sound products and management of natural resources. Environmental
specialists must be able to work in the context of economic, social
and ecological issues.<p>

<p>

The programme provides the competence for students to work for
consultants, contractors, public authorities, commercial and

industrial enterprises, incurance companies, national and
international organizations, and research and training institutes.<p>

<b>Participation of International Students</b><p>

<p>

The programme provides a limited number of courses in English for
MSc-studies. These courses are shown in the presentation part of the
information package. The teaching in English is in process and will in
future provide more opportunities for international students to study
in the programme.<p>

<p>

However, within the degree programme it is possible to have teaching
(no lectures) in different topics by agreement with the
professors. The study books in English will be selected. The professor
provides guidance on reading and gives written or oral
examination. BSc-degree or equivalent in Environmental Engineering or
related studies is a prereguirement. International student applicants
must prepare a proposal of a study plan based on this information
package and send it to TUT for review.<p>

<h2>Description of the Institutes and Laboratories and Their
Activities in the Department of Industrial Management and
Engineering</h2>

<p>

<p>

<b>Industrial Management and Engineering</b><p>

<p>

Internationalization and disappearing restrictions on trade make demands on the ability of
enterprises to react quickly. Increasing complexity of the operating environment requires that
engineers have ever broader knowledge and skills and the ability to visualize in matters of business
economics.<p>

<p>

The Institute of Industrial Management and Engineering develops abilities needed in entrepreneurial life. Central teaching areas are business economics and accounting, production
management, quality management, international marketing, and speech communication and
negotiation skills. The institute operates in close connection with industry and is participating e.g.
in the 1994 national research project "Into Future with Productivity".<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Safety Engineering</b><p>

<p>

The Institute of Safety Engineering is responsible for teaching and research in the areas of safety
science, risk management, and ergonomics. In safety engineering notable research includes work
on e.g. the safety of FM systems as well as improvements in workplace design from the viewpoint
of a good work environment.<p>

<p>

Amongst other subjects, the Institute has researched emissions to the environment from
machinery. It was found that diesel-powered machines are a risk to the environment of such
significance as was not appreciated before. Further research showed how adaptation of the load
on machine motors can reduce emission and fuel consumption.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H1>TTKK:n tarjoamat mahdollisuudet</h1></FONT>
<DD>Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu on aktiivisesti solminut suhteita ulkomaisten korkeakoulujen
ja yliopistojen kanssa myös opiskelijavaihdon alueella. Vuoden 1996 alussa
opiskelijavaihtokiintiöistä oli sovittu kaikkiaan yli sadan ulkomaisen korkeakoulun kanssa
esim. Iso-Britanniassa, Australiassa, Ranskassa, Saksassa ja USA:ssa. Lisäksi TTKK on
osallistunut kokeiluluonteiseen ECTS-vaihtoon (European Community Course Credit
Transfer System) konetekniikan alalla, mikä on avannut TTKK:n konetekniikan opiskeli
joille mahdollisuudet opiskella 26 EU-maan korkeakoulussa ja yliopistossa. ECTS-vaihto
jatkuu, mutta se muuttuu tavalliseksi ERASMUS-ICP-vaihtorenkaaksi lukuvuonna 1997-98.
Lisäksi muutamien ECTS-vaihtokorkeakoulujen kanssa on sovittu, että myös muut kuin
konetekniikan opiskelijat voivat päästä opiskelemaan tämän ERASMUS-ICP-vaihdon
puitteissa. <p>

Pohjoismaihin on mahdollisuus hakeutua opiskelemaan NORDPLUS/NORDTEK-
vaihto-ohjelman puitteissa. Pohjoismaiden opiskelijavaihdosta ja sen tarjoamista korkeakoulu
vaihtoehdoista on TTKK:ssa julkaistu oma informaatiokirjanen "NORDEN-INFO", jota on
saatavilla KV-toimistosta sekä KV-toimiston vieressä olevan välikön infotelineestä.<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H2>Valinta TTKK:n vaihto-ohjelmiin</h2></FONT>
<DD>TTKK:n KV-osaston valintatoimikunta tekee hakemusten perusteella opiskelijoiden alustavan
valinnan kuhunkin kohteeseen. Rehtori vahvistaa tämän valinnan. Valintaan vaikuttavat
ensisijaisesti opintojen painotettu keskiarvo, opintomenestys suhteutettuna opiskeluaikaan
sekä suoritettujen opintoviikkojen määrä. TTKK lähettää esityksensä vastaanottavalle
korkeakoululle, joka tekee lopullisen päätöksen hyväksymisestä.<p>

Yleensä sekä TTKK että vastaanottavat korkeakoulut asettavat etusijalle opinnoissaan hyvin
menestyneet ylempien vuosikurssien opiskelijat. Käytännössä vaihto-opiskeluvuosi ajoittuukin
kolmannen tai neljännen opiskeluvuoden jälkeiseen jaksoon. Heti ensimmäisen
opiskeluvuoden jälkeinen ulkomaille lähtö ei ole edes mahdollista.  Samoin valmistuneet/juuri
valmistumassa olevat opiskelijat ja jatko-opiskelijat eivät kuulu näiden vaihto-ohjelmien piiriin.<p>

Valittaessa vaihto-opiskelijoita ulkomaisiin korkeakouluihin etusija annetaan normaaleja
opintojaan suorittaville hakijoille, mutta diplomityön tekeminenkään tänä aikana ei ole aivan
mahdotonta. Se vain vaatii paljon erityisjärjestelyjä: asiasta pitää etukäteen sopia sekä
vastaanottavan korkeakoulun jonkun professorin kanssa että tehtävän diplomityön
hyväksymisestä TTKK:ssa.<p>

<DD>TTKK:n kansainvälisten asiain toimisto tiedottaa syyslukukauden aikana haettavina olevista
ulkomaisista opiskelijapaikoista sekä niihin liittyvistä stipendeistä korkeakoulun eri osastojen,
päärakennuksen sekä KV-toimiston ilmoitustauluilla sekä Anturi-lehdessä. Lisäksi
syyslukukaudella (yleensä lokakuussa) järjestetään yleisinfotilaisuus, jossa kerrotaan
yhteistyökorkeakouluista, haku-ajoista ja tavoista. Tilaisuuteen pyritään kutsumaan myös
opiskelijoita, jotka ovat olleet ulkomailla, kertomaan kokemuksistaan sekä
korkeakouluista.<p>

TTKK:n ulkomaisiin yhteistyökorkeakouluihin voi hakea kuka tahansa TTKK:ssa DI- tai
arkkitehtitutkintoa opiskeleva, jolla on opintoja vähintään 60-70 ov. <p>

Jos USA:han hakeva opiskelija haluaa suorittaa graduate-tason opintoja hänellä tulee olla 120
ov suoritettuna USA:han lähtiessään. Opintotoimistosta saa pyynnöstä erillisen todistuksen
(BSc -opintoja vastaava todistus, jonka hinta on 100 mk), joka tulee pyytää hyvissä ajoin
ennen lähtöä USA:han.<p>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><H1>Opiskelun rahoitus ja kustannukset</H1></FONT>
<DD>Opiskelukustannukset vaihtelevat paljonkin kohdemaasta ja korkeakoulusta riippuen.
T&auml;rkeimm&auml;t v&auml;ltt&auml;m&auml;tt&ouml;m&auml;t kustannukset ovat matkat, lukukausimaksut, asumis- ja
ruokailukustannukset sek&auml; vakuutukset. Usein huomattava osa tarvittavista varoista on yleens&auml;
oltava k&auml;ytett&auml;viss&auml; jo lukukauden alussa. Mik&auml;li opiskelija aikoo matkustella lukukausien
loma-aikoina tai opintojen p&auml;&auml;tytty&auml;, voi h&auml;n jo etuk&auml;teen laatia matkoja varten erillisen
budjetin. Lis&auml;ksi olisi hyv&auml;, jos opiskelija voisi budjetoida tietyn summan ennakoimattomiin
yll&auml;tt&auml;viin kustannuksiin.<br>

Valitettavasti suurin osa TTKK:n my&ouml;nt&auml;mist&auml; apurahoista ja stipendeist&auml; kattaa vain pienen
osan kaikista kustannuksista - yleens&auml; vain edestakaiset matkakustannukset. Opiskelija joutuu
n&auml;in ollen itse hankkimaan rahoituksen yhdistelm&auml;n&auml; eri l&auml;hteist&auml;, joihin kuuluu my&ouml;s
omarahoitusosuus.<br>

Oleskelukustannuksiin on mahdollista hakea erikseen valtion opintotukea ja -lainaa.
Ulkomaille l&auml;htev&auml;lle opintoraha on 1540 mk, asumislis&auml; 900 mk sek&auml; lainan takaus 2100
mk/kk (v. 1996-97). Neuvottele asiasta Maila J&auml;rvisen kanssa opintotoimistossa.<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>TTKK:n Euroopan vaihto-ohjelmiin hyv&auml;ksytyille opiskelijoille:
	my&ouml;nnet&auml;&auml;n TTKK:n stipendi, joka oli 4000 mk lukuvuodelle 1996-97 ja
joka kattaa p&auml;&auml;asiassa edestakaisen matkan.
	poikkeuksena Unkari, jonne hyv&auml;ksytyt saavat perill&auml; ilmaisen asunnon ja
ateriat.<br>

<li>Osa vaihto-ohjelmien piiriin kuuluvista korkeakouluista kuuluu ERASMUS-ICP-vaihto-
ohjelmaan, jolloin ERASMUS-apurahan suuruus riippuu TTKK:lle my&ouml;nnett&auml;v&auml;st&auml; E
RASMUS-rahasta.
	Lukuvuonna 1996-97 ERASMUS-apuraha oli 4000 mk.<br>

<li>ERASMUS-apurahojen kutistuessa TTKK pyrkii maksamaan my&ouml;s ERASMUS-opis
kelijoilli pient&auml; tukea, jotta matka-apurahat olisivat samansuuruisia ERASMUSlaisille ja ei-
ERASMUSlaisille.<br>
</ul><p>
HUOM! Ulkomaille l&auml;htev&auml;t opiskelijat saavat <B>JOKO</B> TTKK:n matkastipendin <B>TAI</B> ERASMUS-apurahan. Molempia stipendej&auml; ei makseta samalle henkil&ouml;lle.<br>

</H2>
</FONT>
The program of  Materials Science gives a detailed view into structure and properties of
materials, including metals, ceramics and  polymers and their composites and provides a
solid basis for studies in materials  science.  <P>

Facilities and equipment are available for  structural characterization and for  studies of
properties and applications  of materials.<P>

Research at the Institute of  Materials  Science focuses on the development of materials
and materials combinations for a variety of different applications ranging from human
implants to advanced materials    for power engineering. It includes  fundamental as well
as applied research carried out mainly as combinations of these works for different
academic degrees, but partially also as discrete work by itself. International collaboration
covers most of the industrialized countries.<P>

The Institute of Fiber, Textile and Clothing Science (IFTCS) is under the Department of
Material Technology, which also includes general materials technology, plastics technology,
chemistry and electron microscopy. The IFTCS educates, trains and conducts research. The
research and service areas in brief: fiber research, mechanical production of textiles, chemical
treatment of textile materials, textile recycling and reuse, biotechnology in textile processes,
standard tests on fibers, yarns and fabrics, CAD, technical and economic aspects of the textile
and clothing industry, manufacture of trial lots. The training for the M.Sc (Eng) takes 5 to 7
years and the course consists of general studies, textile specialist studies and a Master's thesis. It
is possible to continue with postgraduate academic studies leading to the Licentiate and the
Doctorate in Technology. The prerequisite for a student applying as a visiting student is a
minimum of three year's academic studies or a Bachelor's degree in the field.

Tampereen teknillisen korkeakoulun ylioppilaskunta (TTKY) on jokaisen tamperelaisen teekkarin oma etuj&auml;rjest&ouml; ja siihen kuuluu jokainen DI- tai arkkitehtitutkintoa suorittava. Ylioppilaskunnan teht&auml;v&auml;n&auml; on toimia teekkareiden yhdy

Ylioppilaskunta on virallisesti perustettu 3.11.1972. T&auml;t&auml; ennen, vuosina 1965-72 Tampereella toimi Tampereen Teekkarit -niminen j&auml;rjest&ouml;, joka oli Teknillisen korkeakoulun ylioppilaskunnan alainen.<P>

Jäynäkisat 1996, YKI</TITLE>

<H1>YKI 1996</H1><P><P>
Koko seuraava teksti on suoraan prujattu dokumentoinnista. Näin loistavaan kertomukseen ei ole juuri lisättävää, eli YKI, olkaa hyvä :
<P>
"Ympäristöteekkarikillan fuksit proudly present: vuoden 1996 jäynäkisan fuksisarjan voittajaehdokas<P>
<CENTER><H2>Boy meets ... boy</H2></CENTER>
<P><P>
YKIn jäynän teemana tänä vuonna oli seksuaalinen tasa-arvo ja suvaitsevaisuus. Tarkoituksena oli ottaa kantaa koko edeltävän vuoden kestäneeseen keskusteluun siitä, pitäisikö homoseksuaaleille antaa oikeus mennä virallisesti naimisiin ja adoptoida lapsia. Vaikka spektaakkelin yhtenä tapahtumapaikkana olivat kirkon rappuset, ei tarkoitus ollut ottaa kantaa kirkon suhtautumiseen. Paikan valinta oli käytännön pakko, sillä viikonloppuna eivät virastot ole auki.
<P>
Toteutimme jäynäämme lauantaina 27.4.1996 klo 11.30 alkaen. Keräännyimme Vanhaan kirkkoon, jonka rappusilla odoteltiin "nuorta paria", heiteltiin riisit ja lopulta lähetettiin pari matkaan asianmukaisesti koristellussa autossa. Jo tämä herätti hämmästystä ihmisissä torilla, tulipa kirkon suntiokin aluksi kysymään, pitikö meillä todella olla häät, kun ei niistä löytynyt mitään merkintää kalenterista. Eniten huomiota kuitenkin herätti ympäri kaupunkia cruisaileva auto, josta onnellinen pari vilkutteli ihmisille. Päivä päätettiin asiaankuuluvasti hääkahvilla ja bestmanin juhlapuheella.
<P>
Yleisön reaktiot olivat monenlaisia. Osa kauhisteli ja pyöritteli päätään, osa nauroi epäuskoisena, osa vain tuijotti. Aika moni ihasteli ensin nuorta rakkautta, mutta heidän huomattuaan, että autossa istui kaksi poikaa, ilmeet muuttuivat. Jotkut pelkäsivät ilmeisesti leimautuvansa, koska ottivat etäisyyttä poikaparin nähdessään.
<P>
Vaikka jäynän toteuttaminen oli erittäin työlästä, vaati monen ihmisen aikaa ja energiaa ja päätähdiltämme melkoista vittuilukestävyyttä, oli se kaikkien mielestä sitäkin hauskempaa. Tulipa samalla jäynättyä vähän omiakin: järjestimme pojille yllätyspolttarit Riverissä perjantai-iltana"

lisättäköön vielä, että kaksisivuisessa tiedotteessa kerrottiin Hervannan tulleen valituksi uuden yhteispohjoismaisen ydintekniikan tutkimuslaitoksen (NNRC) sijoituskohteeksi ja että näkyvin rakennusprojekteista tulee olemaan lineaarikiihdytin, joka sijoitetaan osittain uuden Hervannan valtaväylän loppuosalle tulevan kävelykadun alle. Lisäksi pahoiteltiin myöhäistä tiedottamista. Allekirjoittajana projektipäällikkö Mik Sundqvist. Liitesivulla oli tiivistelmä projektin kulusta ja tietoja hiukkaskiihdyttimestä sekä sen ympäristövaikutuksista varsin hienoin sanankääntein ja asianmukaisen termistön avulla muotoiltuna. <P>
<P>
Aihe oli keväällä -96 ajankohtainen keskustelun käydessä joskus kaukaisessa tulevaisuudessa mahdollisesti rakennettavan CERNin mahdollisesti lineaarisen kiihdyttimen mahdollisesta sijaintipaikkakunnasta, mikäli ko. vekotin mahdollisesti sitten päätyisi juuri Suomeen. <P>

<H1>Opastettu bussiajelu Hervannasta Keskustaan</H1>

MIK kertoo omin sanoin vuoden '95 fuksijäynästään:<P>

<I>"MIK:n jäynäteam toteutti ideoimansa jäynän torstaina 27. Huhtikuuta 1995. Silloin kokeiltiin uutta palvelumuotoa Liikennelaitoksen paikallisvuoroilla.<p>

Etelä-Hervannasta kello 14.31 lähtenyt paikallisbussi nro 30 sai "asiantuntevat" kaupunkioppaat Irene Juutisen ja Sinikka Yrpäksen SOO-Opastus Oy:stä kyytiinsä opastamaan matkustajia näkemään Tampereen uusin silmin. Nämä Suomen Onnettomien Oppaiden alayhdistyksen oppaat latelivat sujuvasti ulkomuististaan matkan varrella näkyneiden rakennusten ja muiden kohteiden historiaa sekä tämän päivän faktoja. Samanlaisen opastuksen saivat myös vuoron 23 matkustajat samana päivänä klo 15.13 Keskustorilta lähteneessä bussissa."<P></I>

Jos kilpailut ja tulosluettelot ovat intohimosi, kannattaa tutkailla vappuina -95 ja -96 järjestettyjen jäynäkisojen tuloksia (on kisoja muulloinkin järjestetty, mutta toistaiseksi tulokset on ainoastaan kahden viimevuoden ajalta).Tarkoituksena on, jotta ymmärtäisitte ottaa oppia vanhoista jäynistä. Saa siis lukea ajatuksella.<P>

Syksyllä 1996 järjestettiin ensi kertaa Jäynien Yö -merkkinen tapahtuma, jossa Valtakunnallisten kisojen tapaan tehdään kilpailukutsussa annettuja esitehtäviä, kisan alkaessa annettava pääjäynä sekä tietenkin vapaavalintaisia jäyniä. Arvostelussa otetaan kaikki em. kohdat huomioon sopivalla painotuksella. Tällä kerralla vaadittavat esitehtävät olivat eloisa muumio, kalan koulureppu ja nesteen vajain sekä vapaaehtoisena bonustehtävänä karjala takaisin, pääjäynänä oli toteuttaa Liehuva Liekinvarsi. Kisan voittajalle luvattiin pääsy edustamaan TTKY:tä valtakunnan skaboihin, ja voiton makuun päässyt TiTen kakkosjoukkue jatkoikin mallikkaasti voittaen koko hoidon. Tähän kohtaan tulevan linkin takana he itse kertovat uroteostaan.<P>

Tämäkin jäynä herätti pientä liikehdintää ohikulkijoissa (varsinkin naispuolisissa, toim.huom.). Ihmiset siis menivät ilmeisen retkuun, idean hauskuudesta tuntui olevan asian valjettua hieman ristiriitaisia mielipiteitä

AuTeK ilmoittautui kisaan yhden isomman sijasta kolmella pienellä jäynällä. Toteutukseen oli kuitenkin panostettu huolellisesti, ja esim. videota kuvattiin normaalin videokameran lisäksi myös salkussa olevalla piilokameralla.<p>

Mainitut kolme jäynää olivat:

</font>
<h2>Iso kolmonen</h2>

Ideana oli luvata pahaa-aavistamattomille siviileille iso kolmonen pienen aiheeltaan olueisiin liittyvän kyselylomakkeen täyttämistä vastaan. Vitsi piili juuri isoon kolmoseen, joka oli A4:lle printattu jumalattoman iso numero kolmonen (3).<p>

<I>"Pystytimme kaupungille toimipisteen pakettiautoon kirjaston viereen. Jaoimme liitteenä olevia kyselykaavakkeita ihmisille, jotka he palauttivat pakuun. Ihmisten ilmeet olivat ainakin muikeita, kun vastineeksi saivatkin paperisen ISOn-kolmosen. Jotkut eivät sitten millään uskoneet, että kyseessä oli jäynä. Taisivat olla yliopiston väkeä. Ilmeet ovat osaksi videoituja."</I><P>

<h2>Nykytaidetta taidemuseoihin</h2>

<I>"Veimme Sara Hildenin ja pääkirjaston taidenäyttelyyn vastajulkaistut Tampin "Moonis"-taulut. Tarkoituksena oli aiheuttaa yleistä hilpeyttä ihmisten keskuudessa nykytaidetta kohtaan. (vrt. Ars-95 ja pers-95)"</I><P>

Eli siis kyseinen Tamppi vm.-95 oli ulkoisilta muodoiltaan hyvin pätevästi Ranskan suunnalla vaikuttavaan Mona-Lisaan päin vivahtava, ja valmiiksi kehyksissä olevana pakettina sopi oikein hyvin laitettavaksi seinälle hymyilemään.<P>

<h2>Transvestiittinen piilokameraotos</h2>

<I>"Jäynän tarkoituksena oli katsoa ihmisten ensireaktioita poikkeavia ihmisiä kohtaan ja parantaa vähemmistöryhmien kohtelua maassamme. Puimme Teemu-"Teekkarin" naiseksi ja laitoimme hänet toimittamaan arkisia asioita Tampereelle. Valitettavasti kuva on osaksi liiankin elävää ja huojuvaa salkun takia."</I>

Ensimmäisen vuosikurssin arkkitehtiopiskelijat lähtivät liikkeelle ajatuksella "ei kahta ilman kolmatta". Ja kolmannen peräkkäisen voiton varmistamiseksi otettiin myös hyväksi havaitut keinot ja vanhat aseet käyttöön. Piti siis vain tehdä jotain spektaakkelinomaista.<p>

Jälleen kerran oltiin ajan hermolla, eduskuntavaalit olivat vielä hyvinkin tuoreessa muistissa. Ja lisäksi vielä nostatettiin kotiseutuhenkeä ! <p><p>


<h1>TamArk esittää: Veltto !</h1>

Arkkarit siis kyhäsivät Tillikan katolle "patsaan", joka juhlallisesti paljastettiin paikallistelkkarin ja lehtikuvaajien kameratulessa. Paikalle oli myös raahattu itse Veltto Virtanen, joka muikeana antoi haastatteluja puoleen jos toiseenkin. Patsas sinällään esitti "velttoa" ( kanaverkosta ja vaaleanpunaisesta kankaasta kasattu jorma-imitaatio ) ja vieressä oli iso kyltti tekstillä:<p>

<center>
<strong>
<font size=+2>
 "VAIN HÄMÄLÄISET SEN OSAAVAT  -  SAAVAT VELTONKIN SISÄÄN"
</font>
</strong>
</center>
<p>

Kyseisen jäynän videokasettimuodossa ollut dokumentointi on ehdottomasti tyylikkäin aikaansaannos, mitä fuksijäynäkisan muutaman ensimmääisen vuoden aikana on nähty. Ja julkisuutta tuli kyllä kuten jo aiemmasta kävi ilmi.<p>

Mutta: se mikä toimi aikaisempina vuosina, ei toiminutkaan enää 1995. Arviot vaihtelivat "loistavasta jäynästä" "taas yhteen patsaaseen". Tosiasia on, että tällä kerralla ei hommassa ollut sitä punaista lankaa, millä aikaisemmin oltiin oltu huipulla. Kyllähän toki saatiin näkyvyyttä ja vitsikin siinä oli ihan kiva, mutta useimpien mieliin kai jäi lopulta kysymys: "mikä tässä oli se jäynä ?"<p>

Hiukkanen yllätti osallistumalla omalla joukkueellaan kisaan mukaan. Koskeenhan Hiukkanen kuitenkin meni yhdessä Sähkökillan kanssa, vaikkakin kai huonomman sijoituksensa vuoksi "sinisten" perässä, mutta tämän häiritsemättä he antoivat oman panoksensa kaikkien ihasteltavaksi. Toivottavasti intoa riittää tulevaisuudessakin.

<H1>Tullattavaa / ei-tullattavaa</H1>

Vapun alla, yllättäen yön hämärissä, ilmestyi koulumme pääkulkuväylille ulko-ovilta alkaen lattiaan teipatut punainen ja vihreä linja asianmukaisesti merkittynä tekstein tullattavaa / ei-tullattavaa. Riippuen valitsemastaan linjasta saattoi aamuinen kulkija päätyä umpikujaan, naisten vessaan, siivouskomeroon, tai vaikkapa roskakoriin. Mahtoikohan konetalon lipan alta ylioppilaskunnan tiloja kohti lähtenyt kovasti kurvikas vihreä linja olla piikki hallitusväkeä kohtaan, vaiko alkoikohan jäynääjille itselleen olla suoran viivan veto jo olla ylivoimaista?

KoRKin fuksit pitivät eräänä yönä keskenään hauskaa kiertelemällä lähialueen huoltamoiden pihoja. Ratkiriemukkaan asiasta teki valomainosten polttonestehintojen sekoittaminen näyttämään melko kummallisia lukemia. Ja koko homman kruunasivat dokumentiksi toimitetut valokuvat sankareista itse työssä. (ne kuvat nyt kuitenkin jäivät tällä kertaa virkavallan sijasta ylioppilaskunnan haltuun)<P>

<body text=#000000 link=#000000 vlink=#000000 alink=#000000 bgcolor=#FFFFFF>


Indecsin fuksijäynä vuonna 1995 olikin sitten taas semmoinen, joka puhutti paljon ja varmasti muistetaan pitkään. Annetaanpa ensin asianosaisten purkaa mieltään:

<h1>LUONTOA SÄÄSTÄVÄÄ JÄYNÄYSTÄ</h1>

<IMG SRC="95ind.jpg" ALIGN="left" border=10 ><br>

<i>"Jäyniä on tehty teekkarihistorian aikana satoja, jotain aivan uutta meidän on keksittävä", todettiin yksimielisesti Tuotantotalouden koulutusohjelman jäynäpalaverissa TTKK:lla (Tampereen Teknillisestä korkeakoulusta) tiistai-iltana 25.4.95.<p>

Suunnitteluoluiden virittelemänä kerhohuoneen tiloissa 25 tutalaista fuksia ylikuumentelivat aivosolujaan. Sitten keksittiin: kehoitetaan opiskelijoita säästämään energiaa aivan käänteentekevällä tavalla. Idean isä toteaa ideastaan: "Tämähän on kaikille kiva juttu: TOAS säästää sähköä, TPO tienaa kerätessään maksut sadoista jäynän pohjalta tehdyistä puheluista, TiTekilta saa maksut 1600 kopiosta ja meilläkin on hyvät mahdollisuudet selvitä teekkarikasteeseen ja vappukulkueeseen ensimmäiseltä paikalta!"<p>

Keskiviikkoaamun hetkinä 1600 opiskelijataloutta (pääasiassa 2 ja 3 hengen soluja) saivat postinsa mukana kehoituksen asentaa WC-istuimiensa huuhtelusäiliöön ½ l muovisen pullon. Tällä tavalla TOAS säästäisi tuhansia litroja vettä päivässä sekä säästäisi myös sähkönkulutuksesta, joka on seurausta vesipumppujen tekemästä työstä.<p>

Mikäli pulloa ei olisi asennettu perjantaihin klo 15 mennessä ja ilmoitettu tiedotteessa mukana olleeseen puhelinnumeroon asian olevan hoidossa TOAS perisi automaattisesti 40 mk tarkastusmaksun sekä lisäksi 100 mk pullon asentamisesta, jos se vielä mahdollisena tarkastushetkenä uupuisi.<p>

Puhelinnumerot olivat tietysti Teknisen Korkeakoulun muiden kiltojen puhelinnumeroita, sekä yliopistolta kauppatieteilijöiden, BOOMI ry:n, puhelinnumero. Noin 800 kirjeessä olleessa puhelinnumerossa vastasi tutalaisten oma asianmukaista tarinaa sepittävä puhelinvastaaja. Näin voitaisiin dokumentoida osa tehdyistä soitoista jäynäkilpailun tuomaristoa varten.</i><p>

No niin, ideahan oli tietysti aivan hyvä, useimpien kohteeksi joutuneidenkin mielestä - teekkarit ovat keskimäärin kuitenkin melko huumorintajuista porukkaa ja ainahan ei minkään voi, jos toisilla on lyhyempi pinna kuin toisilla. Kaikki tämä käy ilmi varsin perusteellisesti laaditusta jäynädokumentoinnista, johon sisältyy mm. soittolistoja reagointitietoineen puhelinvastaajan purusta, tilastotietoja jäynättyjen asuntokohteiden luuriintarttumisaktiivisuudesta sekä pullojakauma (kossupullo ylivoimainen ykkönen 35 %:lla). Kyseiset puhelinnumerot soivat varsin vauhdikkaasti, mutta kumman tyynesti muiden kiltojen puhelinpäivystäjät homman kuitenkin ottivat.<p>

<B>MUTTA:</B> Toisen nimellä esiintyminen on aina ja kaikkialla tuomittava teko, ja tässä tapauksessa oli kyllä huomattu jättää tiedotteesta nimi TOAS pois, mutta logo oli oikea ! Ja lisäksi vielä allekirjoittaneeksi laitettu nimi oli vahingossa (?) harmittavan yhteneväinen kyseisessä firmassa oikeasti työskentelevän henkilön nimen kanssa. Näin tuli aiheutettua kovasti paljon harmia "omalle" luukunvuokraajallemme, mikä ei tietenkään ole tarkoitus ja mitä ei missään tapauksessa tulisi päästä koskaan tapahtumaan. Toinen asia sitten on ne hajonneet pöntönkannet, kun kaikki eivät osanneet ko. toimenpidettä oikein suorittaa<P>

<B>Summa Summarum:</B> Jälleen kerran hyvä ja kehityskelpoinen idea jätti hieman pahan maun; kaikki olisi mennyt paljon paremmin kun asia vaan olisi ajateltu ja suunniteltu ihan loppuun asti.<P>

Sähkökillan joukkueen voittajajäynä oli hauska, harmiton, kantaaottava, hyvin dokumentoitu ja positiivista julkisuuttakin nauttinut  -  eli kasassa oli kaikki tarvittavat elementit tuomariston sydänten heltymiseen. Idea oli tosiaan loistava ja erilainen, mutta kuitenkin hyvin teekkarimaisesti pilke silmäkulmassa toteutettu. Tarkempi selostus alla on saksittu suoraan dokumentoinnista, olkaa hyvä:

ja idea oli: Tehdä "tutkimus" tamperelaisten suhtautumisesta eri väestöryhmiin ja tehdä pilaa heidän kustannuksellaan loukkaamatta silti heidän tunteitaan. Ajatuksena oli saada ihmiset auttamaan avutonta autoilijaa. Testiryhmään kuului kaunis nainen, transvestiitti ja kaksi "normaalia" miestä.

"Tutkimuksessa" kysyttiin apua yli sadalta ihmiseltä, joista reilu kolmekymmentä suostui auttamaan työntämisessä. Transulla oli huonoin onni auttajien saamisen suhteen, mutta hän sai aikaan eniten hämmennystä jo pelkällä ulkomuodollaan saati käyttäytymisellään. Työntöyrityksiä oli kuvausryhmän laskujen mukaan kuusitoista ja autoa työnnettiin yhteensä noin 8-9 korttelinväliä eli reilu kilometri yrittäen saada autoa käyntiin kuitenkaan siinä onnistumatta (johtui varmaan "irronneesta" puolanjohdosta). <P>

Titen pojat olivat siis Kuninkaankadulla kaupittelemassa uutta matkakorttia, "älyvapaakorttia".
<P>
Uniformut olivat hämäävän aidon kaltaisia, aihe oli kuuma ja pinnalla, ja luotettava esiintyminen antoi uskottavuutta. Jopa siinä määrin, että lankaan menivät myös paikalle osuneet Liikennelaitoksen bussikuskit ! <B>Hieno  jäynä !</B>

<H2>HERWOOD</H2>
<P>
Autekin joukkue sai varmasti eniten näkyvyyttä jäynällään, silminnäkijät on laskettava tuhansissa. Hieman kuulumpaa "kaimaa" mukaillen ilmestyi yön pimeinä hetkinä Hervannan valtatien ja ohikulkutien leikkauksen kohdalla sijaitsevan kallion päälle asianmukaiset kirjaimet ilmoittamaan saapumisesta HERWOODiin.
<P><P>
Idea oli ehkä jo joskus käytetty, mutta toteutus aivan loistava. Vielä kun ne olisivat saaneet jäädä paikalleen, ilman että jotkut synkät tahot kävivät rukkaamassa kirjaimia uuteen, vähemmän mairittelevaan järjestykseen...

Arkkarijoukkue vaihtoi taktiikkaa edellisvuosista ja siirtyi perinteisempien jäynien piiriin. 
Vanha juttu Keskustorin alle tulevasta parkkihallista sai ylleen loistavan tyylikkään teknisen toteutuksen  -  kuten vain arkkarit osaavat ! Hommaan oli paneuduttu, asiassa oli käytetty opinnoista saatua asiantuntemusta ja vakuuttavuus näkyikin ihmisten aitona huolena haastattelutilanteessa. Harmiton ja mukava pikku kannanotto riitti tällä kertaa pistesijoille.

<H2>Dopinghaastattelu</H2>
<P>
KoRK osallistui pienimuotoisella jäynällään edellisistä kerroista saadut opit mielessä. Dokumentointi seuraavassa:
<P><I>
Konekillan fuksisarjan jäynän 1996 lyhyt selostus<P>
<P>
Ideamme oli, että pari hemmoa esiintyy jonkun lehden toimittajina ja kyselee ihmisiltä, mitä mieltä he ovat tästä Suomea kohdanneesta jääkiekkoskandaalista. Skandaali oli seuraavanlainen: "Kahden Suomen pelaajan dopingtesti on ollut positiivinen. Nimiä ei ole vielä julkistettu." <P>
<P>
Jäynä toteutettiin Tampereen asematunnelissa sunnuntaina 28.4.1996 iltapäivällä noin kello 16-18 (kellonajasta ei ole tarkkaa muistikuvaa). <P>
<P>
Dokumentointiin on käytetty c-kasettia, johon haastattelut äänitettiin sekä itse haastattelutapahtumaa kuvattiin hieman kauempaa videokameralla. <P>
<P></I>
Ja jos ei joku vielä honannut, niin jäkiksen ämmämkirmailut osuivat juuri tuohon maailman aikaan. <P>
<P>
Haastattelutapahtuma oli erittäin asiallisesti toteutettu ja varsin autenttisen oloinen. Tästä pisteet asiansa osanneille "toimittajille". Nauhalle tuli aivan kunnon haastatteluja, kelpoisia vaikka radioon mikäli kyseisenlainen onnettomuus olisi tuolloin leijoniamme sattunutkin kohtaamaan. <P>

Tarakin pojat mittailivat varsin asiantuntevan oloisina keskustan katuja samalla herättäen huomiota Tammetro -haalareillaan. Samanaikaisesti toinen porukka keräsi nimiä Tampereen Kaupunginhallitukselle menevään vetoomukseen, jossa vaadittiin ko. instanssia keskeyttämään jo aloitetut Tampereen Metron suunnittelutyöt.
<P>
Nimiä kertyi ihan kivasti, ja eiköhän taas saatu höynäytettyä melkoisen montaa pahaa-aavistamatonta siviiliä... <P>

Nesteenvajaimena toimi vanhasta teesiivilästä tieteellisellä tarkkuudella tehty Aquafalx. Se poisti ravintonesteestä siihen syntyneen sähkömagneettisen katalyytti-implikaation eli sähkövarauksen. Laite toimi siten, että se upotettiin nestevarauksen sisältävään nesteeseen, jolloin sen päässä oleva lamppu syttyi merkiksi toiminnasta ja hetken kuluttua nestevajaus oli suoritettu ja katalyytti-implikaatio poistettu.

<H1>Teekkareiden, jäynäämisen ja kaiken muun maanpäällisen historiaa</H1>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
Teknillisten Reaalikoulujen (Hantverkki- ja fabriikkikoulujen) perustamisesta vuonna 1847 l&auml;htien on maamme kamaraa tallannut suomalaisia teekkareita. Hetikohta alkoi oppilaiden keskuudessa virit&auml; kiinte&auml;mp&auml;&auml;kin yhdistystoimintaa jonka puitteissa pidettiin kokouksia, yll&auml;pidettiin kirjastoa, vippilainarahastoa, lehte&auml; ja muita yhdistyksille luonteenomaisia toimintoja sek&auml; harrastettiin kulttuuria, keskustelua ja riehakkaampaakin vapaa-ajan vietett&auml;. Jo t&auml;ll&ouml;in erilaisten j&auml;rjestettyjen tapahtumien kautta alkoivat teekkarit saavuttaa mainetta, joka on my&ouml;hemm&auml;n ajan saatossa saavuttanut v&auml;lill&auml; melkoisetkin mittasuhteet.
<P>

Teekkareiden historiaan liittyy monia kirjaviakin vaiheita maailmanmullistuksineen, mutta aina ovat teekkarit pystyneet pit&auml;m&auml;&auml;n oman linjansa pilke silm&auml;kulmassa, vuosien saatossa muotoutunut teekkarihenki s&auml;ilytt&auml;en.

Teekkarikulttuurilla voi siis katsoa olevan hyvinkin pitk&auml;t perinteet vaalittavanaan.

Onpa jotkin ajattelemattomat j&auml;yn&auml;t lehtien palstoille p&auml;&auml;semisen ohella saaneet aikaan melkoisia poliisitoimia ja sen seurauksena jopa vapausrangaistuksia tekij&ouml;illeen. Viimeisimpi&auml; isoja juttuja on tainnut olla Helsingiss&auml; tapahtunut liikennemerkkien (eik&ouml;s niist&auml; ole muka varoitettu?) muuttamisjupakka. Idea oli tietysti kiva: Protestoidaan voimaan astuvaa yleist&auml; nopeusaluetta asettamalla kyseisen&auml; y&ouml;n&auml; uusien taulujen p&auml;&auml;lle itse tehdyt vastineet. Laillisuus oli vaan nollassa ja yhdyskuntapalvelua taisi rapsahtaa...<P>

Ei vaan, kyll&auml; Tampereellakin ollaan oltu vuosien saatossa ajattelemattomia ja rikosilmoituksiltakaan ei t&auml;ysin olla v&auml;ltytty. Saldoa EI tarvitse kasvattaa.<P>

Pari vuosisataa merenpohjassa Tukholman edustalla maanneen Vaasa-laivan nostoon tuli hieman yll&auml;tt&auml;en lis&auml;v&auml;ri&auml;, kun er&auml;&auml;t teekkarit Tukholman matkallaan sukeltivat edelt&auml;v&auml;n&auml; y&ouml;n&auml; n&auml;pp&auml;r&auml;sti <A HREF="vasapic.gif">Paavo Nurmi -patsaan</A> muiden rojujen joukkoon hylyn kannelle. Kun kunnianarvoisa Vaasa sitten arvokkaasti nousi pintaan kansan heja-huutojen saattelemana, niin olipa pienoinen yll&auml;tys, kun Paavokin nosti p&auml;&auml;ns&auml; vedenpinnan yl&auml;puolelle. Tapaus aiheutti Ruotsissa meriarkeologisen sensaation ja sittemmin valtaisan kohun lehdist&ouml;ss&auml; tapahtuman osoittauduttua teekkarij&auml;yn&auml;ksi.

<H3>J&auml;yn&auml;&auml;minen</H3><P><P>

<EM>Kaksi laatusanaa ilment&auml;&auml; parhaiten teekkariutta ja teekkarihenke&auml;: teekkaritempaus ja teekkarij&auml;yn&auml;.</EM><P><P>

T&auml;m&auml; kunniateekkari Ossi T&ouml;rr&ouml;sen lausuma totuus kertoo, kuinka olennaista tempaaminen ja j&auml;yn&auml;&auml;minen on teekkareille. Samalla kun teekkarikulttuurin arwo teekkareitten keskuudessa on laskenut, on my&ouml;s j&auml;yn&auml;&auml;misen aate unohtunut, ja siksi t&auml;m&auml; aihe waatii hieman walottamista.<P>

J&auml;yni&auml; on kautta aikojen tehty p&auml;&auml;asiassa kahdesta syyst&auml;. N&auml;ist&auml; ihmisten hauskuuttaminen on ehdottomasti useammin k&auml;ytetty syy. Toinen, tosin huomattawasti harwemmin k&auml;ytetty syy on yhteiskunnassa olewien ep&auml;kohtien esilletuonti. J&auml;lkimm&auml;isten tekeminen waatii yleens&auml; enemm&auml;n suunnittelua ja walmistelua, mutta onnistuessaan saattaa aiheuttaa todellisia parannuksia.<P><P>


<H3>Mink&auml;lainen on hyw&auml; ja onnistunut j&auml;yn&auml; ?</H3><P>

Hyw&auml; j&auml;yn&auml; on ehdottomasti hauska. Sen tulee olla hauska jopa j&auml;yn&auml;n mahdollisen kohteen mielest&auml;. Se osoittaa hyw&auml;&auml; makua eik&auml; aiheuta kenellek&auml;&auml;n harmeja, mutta pienet itsetunnon kolaukset owat hyw&auml;ksytt&auml;wi&auml;. On erityisesti huomattawa, ett&auml; yrityksiin kohdistuwilla j&auml;ynill&auml; saattaa olla taloudellisia waikutuksia.<P>

Hyw&auml; j&auml;yn&auml; on aina hywin suunniteltu, ja sen aiheuttamat seuraukset on mietitty tarkkaan. T&auml;m&auml; l&auml;hinn&auml; sen takia, ettei j&auml;yn&auml;st&auml; aiheudu negatiiwista mainosta teekkareille. Arweluttawissa tapauksissa kannattaa yritt&auml;&auml; sopia asiasta etuk&auml;teen mahdollisten osapuolten kanssa. T&auml;st&auml; hyw&auml;n&auml; esimerkkin&auml; on arkkitehtifuksien Wapun '94 j&auml;yn&auml;, johon hankittiin asianmukaiset luwat. <P>

Parhaimmillaan j&auml;yn&auml; on hywin suunniteltu, hywin organisoitu ja suuremman joukon salassa toteuttama h&auml;mment&auml;w&auml; spektaakkeli, joka hauskuuttaa ihmisi&auml; ja saa aikaan ep&auml;kohtia korjaawia toimia.Lis&auml;ksi hyw&auml;n j&auml;yn&auml;n aiheuttamat sotkut, rakenteet tai muut wastaawat siiwotaan sopiwan ajan kuluessa, eik&auml; j&auml;tet&auml; muiden siiwottawaksi.<P><P>


<H3>Mink&auml;laisia j&auml;yni&auml; on tehty?</H3><P>

Kuten jo t&auml;m&auml;n kirjoituksen alussa mainitsin, on j&auml;yn&auml;&auml;miskulttuuri p&auml;&auml;ssyt hieman hiipumaan tamperelaisten teekkarien keskuudessa. Tilannetta parantamaan otettiin Wappuna '93 fuksij&auml;yn&auml;kisa, jolla saatiin ainakin kulloinenkin fuxiwuosikerta kilpailemaan kertaalleen tosissaan koskeenp&auml;&auml;syj&auml;rjestyksest&auml;. Fuxij&auml;yn&auml;kisa onkin tuottanut muutamia hywi&auml; j&auml;yni&auml; ja saanut j&auml;yn&auml;&auml;miskulttuurin ainakin jonkin werran paranemaan.<P>

T&auml;h&auml;n asti siis kaksi kertaa j&auml;rjestetyn Fuxij&auml;yn&auml;kisan on molemmilla kerroilla woittanut Arkkitehtikillan joukkue. Wuonna '93 he woittiwat j&auml;yn&auml;ll&auml; Pinnin kortsu, jossa Tampereen yliopiston taloudellis-hallintotieteellisen tiedekunnan p&auml;&auml;sis&auml;&auml;nk&auml;ynnin edess&auml; olewista "fallossymboleista" toinen oli peitetty wiisimetrisell&auml; punaisella kortsulla. Wuonna '94 he woittiwat j&auml;yn&auml;ll&auml; Leningrad cowboys go manse, jossa H&auml;meensillan patsaat oliwat saaneet kaunistuksekseen Leningrad Cowboys -tyyppiset hiust&ouml;tter&ouml;t, aurinkolasit sek&auml; pitk&auml;k&auml;rkiset bootsit.<P>

Muita fuksij&auml;yn&auml;kisassa ansioituneita j&auml;yni&auml; owat olleet Hakamets&auml;n j&auml;&auml;hallin nimen muuttaminen Tamphooniksi Turun uuden (entisen) Typhoonin mukaan, Telen Herwannan waltaw&auml;yl&auml;ll&auml; sijaitsewan mainoksen (muistatte kai ne tele-p&auml;&auml;tteiset) modifioiminen JUOPOTTELE- tekstill&auml;.<P>

Hywin sijoittui my&ouml;s j&auml;yn&auml;, jossa Herwannan waltaw&auml;yl&auml;lle sijoitettiin waroituskyltti Automaattisesta tutkawalwonnasta ja sit&auml; seurannut p&ouml;mpeli, joka erehdytt&auml;w&auml;sti muistutti Turku-Helsinki -w&auml;yl&auml;ll&auml; sijaitsewia automaattitutkia.<P>

Muista Tampereella tehdyist&auml; j&auml;ynist&auml; on mainittawa 80-luwulla j&auml;rjestetty Tutkapartio-j&auml;yn&auml;, jossa sinihaalariset s&auml;hk&ouml;l&auml;iset "mittailiwat" hiustenkuiwaajalla illan pimeydess&auml; nopeuksia ja pys&auml;ytteliw&auml;t autoja pingismailalla kysellen: "Ootteko n&auml;hnyt meid&auml;n pingispalloa ?" Homma toimi niin kauan, kunnes porukka pys&auml;ytti siwiilimallisen poliisiauton.<P>

Wappuna '91 j&auml;yn&auml;kisan woitti Wiinahuutokauppa-j&auml;yn&auml;. T&auml;ss&auml; silloisten s&auml;hk&ouml;fuksien tekem&auml;ss&auml; j&auml;yn&auml;ss&auml; oli Herwannan sanomissa ilmoitus korttelipoliisin tiloissa j&auml;rjestett&auml;w&auml;st&auml; takawarikoitujen wiinojen huutokaupasta. Paikalle ilmestyi kymmeni&auml; janoisia.<P><P>


<H3>Mit&auml; j&auml;yn&auml; ei ole ?</H3><P>

En malta olla lainaamatta j&auml;lleen Ossi T&ouml;rr&ouml;sen wiisaita sanoja, joten:<P>

<EM>"Mit&auml; oikea teekkarij&auml;yn&auml; ei koskaan saa olla. Se ei koskaan solwaa, rienaa, iwaile, turmele, warasta, tuhoa. Se ei aiheuta kenellek&auml;&auml;n taloudellisia, henkisi&auml; tai fyysisi&auml; waikeuksia."</EM><P>

Kuten jo aikaisemmin mainitsin, huono j&auml;yn&auml; wahingoittaa teekkareitten mainetta pitk&auml;ksi aikaa. Mainitsen seuraawassa muutamia j&auml;yni&auml;, joiden tulos on ollut ei-toiwottu.<P>

Er&auml;&auml;n&auml; wuonna ylioppilaskunnan faksilla onnistuttiin l&auml;hett&auml;m&auml;&auml;n tiedote TTKK:n 4. waiheen rakentamisen aloittamisesta. T&auml;m&auml; oli noin kolme wuotta ennen kuin rakennusta alettiin todella rakentamaan. Seurauksena oli se, ettei Aamulehti suostunut julkaisemaan mit&auml;&auml;n ylioppilaskunnalta tulewaa tiedotetta pariin wuoteen. Itse asiassa wasta nyt owat w&auml;lit Aamulehteen normalisoituneet.<P>

Toinen "ei ihan loppuun asti ajateltu" j&auml;yn&auml; oli tuntemattomien tekij&ouml;iden tekem&auml; j&auml;yn&auml; TPO:lle. Keskustan asuntoihin jaettiin kirjeit&auml;, jossa "keskuslaitteiden muuttumisen takia" tulisi puhelinkojeet waihtaa uusiin TPO:n konttorissa. Lis&auml;tietoja kirjeen mukaan sai numeroista, jotka itse asiassa oliwat S&auml;hk&ouml;killan ja Blebeiji-kerhon puhelinnumerot. Oikeustoimilta j&auml;lkien selwittelyss&auml; w&auml;ltyttiin wain hiuksenhienosti.<P><P>


<H3>Otaniemel&auml;iset aloittiwat</H3><P>

Kuten kaikki muukin teekkariuteen liittyw&auml;, on j&auml;yn&auml;&auml;minenkin per&auml;isin Otaniemen teekkareilta. T&auml;m&auml;n tosiseikan huomioon ottaen ei ole mik&auml;&auml;n ihme, ett&auml; toistaiseksi parhaan teekkarij&auml;yn&auml;n on tehnyt 60-luwulla Otaniemen teekkarit. Hyw&auml;t naiset ja herrat: Paawo Nurmi ja Wasa-laiwa!<P>

T&auml;ss&auml; legendaarisessa j&auml;yn&auml;ss&auml; muutamat teekkarit kuuliwat, ett&auml; Tukholmassa ollaan nostamassa parisataa wuotta sitten neitsytmatkallaan uponnutta Wasa-laiwaa. Samoihin aikoihin Otaniemen urheiluhallin rakentamiseksi myytiin pronssisia Paawo Nurmi-pienoispatsaita. Muutama teekkari matkusti nostamista edelt&auml;win&auml; p&auml;iwin&auml; Tukholmaan ja he sukelsiwat patsaan hylkyyn. Kun laiwa nostettiin, niin patsaasta tuli waltawa meriarkeologinen sensaatio ja wiel&auml; suurempi kohu nousi kun selwisi, ett&auml; kyseess&auml; oli teekkarij&auml;yn&auml;.<P>

Muita melko huikeita j&auml;yni&auml; owat olleet N&auml;kym&auml;t&ouml;n mies ja s&auml;hk&ouml;n suunnan k&auml;&auml;ntyminen -j&auml;yn&auml;t. Edellisess&auml; Helsinkiin j&auml;rjestettiin suuri tapahtuma, kun N&auml;kym&auml;t&ouml;n mies-elokuwan t&auml;hden kerrottiin saapuwan kaupunkiin. Satamassa teekkarit oliwat j&auml;rjest&auml;neet punaisen maton, torwisoittokunnan, terwetulojaispuheen ja limusiinin paikalle wastaanottamaan wierasta. Paikalla oli waltaisa m&auml;&auml;r&auml; ihmisi&auml; ja j&auml;rjest&auml;j&auml;t toteuttiwat seremoniat, kuten wieras olisi todella saapunut. Todellisuudessa ket&auml;&auml;n ei ollut paikalla, mutta kansa todella uskoi, ett&auml; N&auml;kym&auml;t&ouml;n mies todella saapui maahamme.<P>

S&auml;hk&ouml;n suunta k&auml;&auml;ntyy -j&auml;yn&auml;ss&auml; lewitettiin Helsingiss&auml; tietoa, ett&auml; tiettyn&auml; p&auml;iw&auml;n&auml; keskiy&ouml;ll&auml; s&auml;hk&ouml;wirran suunta k&auml;&auml;ntyy. Uskollisesti ihmiset sitten k&auml;&auml;nteliw&auml;t juuri oikella hetkell&auml; s&auml;hk&ouml;laitteiden pistokkeita asunnoissaan.<P><P>


<H3>Muualla maailmassa ?</H3><P>

My&ouml;s teekkarit muualla maailmassa harrastawat j&auml;yni&auml;. Esimerkkein&auml; t&auml;st&auml; mainitsen pari j&auml;yn&auml;&auml; Ruotsista ja Yhdyswalloista:<P>

Tukholman Kuninkaallisessa teknillisess&auml; korkeakoulussa paikalliset teekkarit polttiwat p&auml;reens&auml; er&auml;&auml;seen raitiowaunukuljettajaan, joka jaksoi jatkuwasti pottuilla ja t&auml;rkeill&auml; teekkareille. Er&auml;&auml;n&auml; p&auml;iw&auml;n&auml; teekkarit hankkiwat k&auml;ytt&ouml;&ouml;ns&auml; useammat hitsusw&auml;lineet ja pari autoa. Autot he ajoiwat siten, ettei raitiowaunu pystynyt liikkumaan eteen- eik&auml; taaksep&auml;in. Samalla raitiowaunun py&ouml;r&auml;t hitsattiin kiskoihin kiinni. Tarina ei kerro, kuinka teekkareitten ja kuljettajan suhde edistyi j&auml;yn&auml;n j&auml;lkeen.<P>

Massachusettsin teknillisess&auml; korkeakoulussa (MIT) owat paikalliset teekkarit toteuttaneet muutamia melko huikeita j&auml;yni&auml;. N&auml;ist&auml; paras on ollut j&auml;yn&auml;, jossa korkeakoulun hallintorakennuksen kupolin p&auml;&auml;lle rakennettiin t&auml;ysikokoinen poliisiauton tarkka malli. Autossa oli aidot wilkut katolla ja se oli useita p&auml;iwi&auml; paikallaan. Lis&auml;tietoja MIT:ssa tehdyist&auml; j&auml;ynist&auml; saa TKY:n WWW-siwuilta osoitteella http://www.tky.hut.fi/teekkarikulttuuri/jaynat.<P><P>


<H3>Kansallinen j&auml;yn&auml;kisa</H3><P>

Tekniikan akateemisten liitto TEK j&auml;rjest&auml;&auml; wuosittain kansallisen j&auml;yn&auml;kisan. T&auml;ss&auml; kisassa, joka j&auml;rjestet&auml;&auml;n syksyisin, mittelew&auml;t kaikista Suomen teknillist&auml; korkeakoulutusta antawista yksik&ouml;ist&auml; (Otaniemi, Tampere, lappeen Ranta, Oulu ja Turku) tulewat joukkueet kiertopalkinnosta. Kisassa tuomaristona toimii TEK:n Teekkariwaliokunta, joka muodostuu edell&auml;mainittujen teekkariyhteis&ouml;jen hallitusten puheenjohtajista.<P>

Kisa j&auml;rjestet&auml;&auml;n jossain Suomen maaper&auml;ll&auml; sijaitsewassa kaupungissa t&auml;ysin ennalta ilmoittamatta. Kisan j&auml;rjestelyt hoitaa edelliswuonna woittanut teekkariyhteis&ouml;, joten ensi syksyn kisan j&auml;rjest&auml;&auml; jo toista kertaa per&auml;kk&auml;in Oulun Teekkariyhdistys. Itse kisa muodostuu ennakkoteht&auml;w&auml;st&auml;, pakollisesta ja wapaawalintaisista j&auml;ynist&auml;.<P><P>


<H3>Mit&auml; teen, kun saan hyw&auml;n j&auml;yn&auml;idean ?</H3><P>

Warminta on ottaa yhteytt&auml; johonkuhun wanhempaan tieteenharjottajaan, esimerkiksi fuksikapteeniisi tai ylioppilaskunnan teekkariwastaawaan. My&ouml;s Wappusihteerit osaawat neuwoa. Heille kannattaa wihjaista my&ouml;s jo tehdyist&auml; j&auml;ynist&auml;, jos on todenn&auml;k&ouml;ist&auml;, ett&auml; todisteet katoawat nopeasti N&auml;in tuomaristollakin on mahdollisuus k&auml;yd&auml; paikan p&auml;&auml;ll&auml;.<P>

Mik&auml;li ette ole aiwan warmoja, wahingoittaako j&auml;yn&auml;nne mahdollista kohdetta, konsultoikaa edell&auml;mainittujen ihmisten kanssa tai ottakaa yhteytt&auml; kohteeseen ja pyrkik&auml;&auml; neuwottelemalla saamaan lupa. &Auml;lk&auml;&auml; j&auml;yn&auml;tk&ouml; a)Aamulehte&auml;, b)TPO:ta tai c) Poliisia, ellette ole sopineet asiasta etuk&auml;teen. Joka tapauksessa muistakaa siiwota j&auml;yn&auml;nne mahdollisesti aiheuttamat j&auml;ljet.<P>

Dokumentoikaa tekem&auml;nne j&auml;yn&auml; hywin, koskapa dokumentointi on yksi palkitsemisperuste. Ehdottomasti paras tapa on editoitu (koululla on editointiw&auml;lineet) VHS-wideonauha.<P>

Olisi hauska n&auml;hd&auml; erityisesti suuria, paljon w&auml;ke&auml;, suunnittelua ja organisointia waatiwia j&auml;yni&auml;. Onnea kisaan.<P>

Rouva Tellervo Koiviston ehdottoman loistavasti asetellut sanat h&auml;nen ottaessaan vastaan teekkareiden kukanp&auml;iv&auml;nviestin vuonna 1982 kuuluivat seuraavasti: "Teekkarit ovat oivaltaneet, ett&auml; vakaviakaan asioita ei tarvitse ajaa hampaat irvess&auml;, vaan pikemminkin irvi hampaassa."<P>

TTKK:n  4.s rakennusvaihe
</H3>Kevättalvella 1992 pari vekkulia teekkaria lisättynä yhdellä yhtä kierolla arkkarilla ainaiseen tilanpuutteeseen ja koulun lisätiloista vatvomiseen kyllästyttyään, alkoivat hahmotella pientä vauhdittajaa uusien tilojen valmistumiselle. Arkkari piirsi ja laski ja teekkarit toteuttivat melkoisen näkyvän jäynän, jossa kerrottiin TTKK:lle tulevasta uudesta rakennuksesta. Laskelmat olivat harvinaisen lähellä myöhemmin oikeaksi osoittautuneita kustannuksia, eikä itse talokaan vaikuttanut yhtään hullummalta. Uutinen meni läpi valtakunnan merkittävimpiin sanomalehtiin, läpäisten siis STT:n tarkistukset yms. Aamulehti ehätti ensimmäisenä painamaan suuren uutisen ja seuraavana päivänä muidenkin uutisoidessa aihetta oli Aamulehdessä jo luettavissa korjaus sekä pieni ripitys teekkareiden kolttosista. Tämän takia Aamulehti suhtautuikin usean vuoden ajan melko nuivasti meihin teekkareihin ja meidän tempauksiimme. Siinä mielessä siis hieman epäonnistunut, mutta muuten kyllä erittäin hyvin toteutettu ja komeasti onnistunut jäynä, josta puhuttiin vielä pitkään... <P>

"Julkaisimme Hervannan Sanomissa ilmoituksen viinahuuto-kaupasta korttelipoliisin tiloissa ja t&auml;rp&auml;tin toivossa olikin sitten saapunut useita kymmeni&auml; janoisia Hervannan korttelipoliisin tiloihin ilmoitettuna aikana. Mediacoverage t&auml;ll&auml; j&auml;yn&auml;ll&auml; oli tamperelaisittain melkoinen. Hervannan Sanomissa juttua puitiin ihan tosissaan ja t&auml;ss&auml; yhteydess&auml; totesimmekin sarvikuonon olevan eritt&auml;in seksik&auml;s el&auml;in.

Pingispallon etsint&auml;<P>
</H3>

Er&auml;&auml;n&auml; kev&auml;&auml;n&auml; kauan kauan sitten muutama kappale teekkareita tempaisi kuulijoita viel&auml;kin varsin hyvin naurattavalla tempulla. <P>

Pojat olivat varustautuneet tummilla (raksan?) haalareilla, hiustenkuivaajalla, pingismailalla ja Lada-merkkisell&auml; liikkumisv&auml;lineell&auml;. Siviilimallin Lada ajettiin Hervannan valtav&auml;yl&auml;lle Kesoilin paikkeille, vieress&auml; yksi hemmo tummissa haalareissaan heilui muina miehin&auml; osoitellen hiustenkuivaajalla suurinpiirtein vastaantulevan liikenteen suuntaan. Yll&auml;tt&auml;en ajonopeudet kohdalla laskivat silminhavaittavasti. Hieman my&ouml;hemp&auml;n&auml;, kauppojen kohdalla, olivat seuraavat tyypit haalareissaan. Yhdell&auml; oli k&auml;dess&auml;&auml;n punainen pingismaila, jolla h&auml;n kovasti huitoi ohimeneville autoille. Kun autoilija sitten harmistuneena ylinopeudestaan pys&auml;htyi, tallusteli kyseinen tyyppi pys&auml;htyneen auton luo ja jo valmiiksi ojennettuihin ajokorttiin ja rekisteriotteeseen kuului hemmoltamme vastaus "Oletteks' te n&auml;hneet meid&auml;n pingispalloo...?"<P>

Tarina kertoo leikin loppuneen siihen, kun yksi pys&auml;htynyt auto osoittautui liikkuvan poliisin siviilik&auml;rryksi...<P>

Ja sitten pari suoraa lainausta TTKY:n 20-vuotishistoriikist&auml; :<P><P></h1>
<h3>Legendaariset vuosijuhlalahjat<P>
</H3>

Blebeijit viettiv&auml;t kev&auml;&auml;ll&auml; 20-vuotisjuhliaan ja ylioppilaskunta muisti heit&auml; suurella lekalla ja sanoin "saatatte tarvita sit&auml; viel&auml;". Blebeijien h&auml;mmennys oli suuri mutta kaikki selvisi illan my&ouml;t&auml;. Daamit l&auml;hetettiin B-kerhotilalle jo etuk&auml;teen ja pian tuli kimmastunut soitto Teekkarisaunalle: "Ei sinne p&auml;&auml;se sis&auml;lle kun siell&auml; on tiilisein&auml;." Kun herrat itse saapuvat ep&auml;uskoisina paikalle tilannetta selvitt&auml;m&auml;&auml;n paljastuu liki iloinen yll&auml;tys: ylioppilaskunnan edustajat, tarkemmin sanoen J.Teerim&auml;ki, oli muurannut kerhon eteiseen vankan tiilisein&auml;n. Nyt l&ouml;ytyi lekallekin k&auml;ytt&ouml;&auml;. <P>

<h3>
Blebiilimossen odottamaton koukkaus yo-kunnan kahvihuoneeseen 1987, Ari H&auml;mysen k&auml;sialalla kerrottuna<P>
</H3>

Tuona pime&auml;n&auml; syysiltana tuolloinen ylioppilaskunnan hallituksen puheenjohtaja ei saattanut aavistaa tulevaa kohtaloaan. Ei sit&auml; tosin aavistanut moni muukaan. Mietteiss&auml;&auml;n ja pahaa aavistamatta h&auml;n ajaa huruutti autollaan pitkin ylen tummaa asfalttitiet&auml;. Autoradiossa lauloi Kirka enteellisesti jotakin.<P>

Tuona katalana ja pime&auml;n&auml; iltana oli joukko Blebeiji-ilkimyksi&auml; kokoontunut Konetalon taakse odottamaan rakennuksen tyhjentymist&auml;; j&auml;rjestettiinh&auml;n samana iltana ylioppilaskunnan 15-vuotisjuhlat TTKK:n kirjastorakennuksessa. Yll&auml;&auml;n heill&auml; oli vain v&auml;ltt&auml;m&auml;tt&ouml;min eli l&auml;hinn&auml; vaatteet, maastossa ymp&auml;rill&auml;&auml;n oli joukko Blebiilimossen osia.<P>

Kun hetki oli sopiva eli kun Teekkarikuorokin oli poistunut pois tielt&auml; todistamasta tulevaa &auml;ll&ouml;tt&auml;vyytt&auml;, alkoi tavarain kiivas kantelo kohden ylioppilaskunnan kahvitushuonetta. Pian huoneen lattialla lojui yksi paloiteltu henkil&ouml;auto, s&auml;kki pikasementti&auml;, sopivaksi katsottu m&auml;&auml;r&auml; harjater&auml;st&auml;, TTMK:n parempi MIG-hitsauskone, palanen suojamuovia, kottik&auml;rryt, aimo palanen vaneria sek&auml; joukko kantosuoritukseensa tyytyv&auml;isi&auml; teekkariheitti&ouml;it&auml;. Varmuuden vuoksi yo-kunnan k&auml;yt&auml;v&auml;t teljettiin, sill&auml; kahvihuoneen j&auml;&auml;kaapissa oli koko joukko kuohuviinipulloja; joukkio ei vastuuntuntoisena suinkaan halunnut juomien haaskaantuvan uteliaiden suihin.<P>

Pian alkoi osien kiivas hitsaaminen kutakuinkin alkuper&auml;isen muotoiseksi ajokiksi. Auton sis&auml;&auml;n ikkunoiden alareunan tasolle sovitettiin vanerilevy, joka kuorrutettiin harjater&auml;ksen ja pikasementin sopivalla seoksella. Kun ohjauspy&ouml;r&auml;n puoliskokin t&ouml;rr&ouml;tti sopivasti laastista oli lopputulos hyvinkin tukevan tuntuinen. Kevennykseksi tuoreeseen sementtiin kirjailtiin vilpitt&ouml;m&auml;t onnittelut 15-vuotiaalle.<P>

Kun huone oli saatu kutakuinkin siivottua ja lattiat vahattua oli aika poistua itse juhliin, joissa l&auml;hes kaikki sy&ouml;t&auml;v&auml; (mustamakkara) ja juotava oli jo nautittu. Kaikesta huolimatta juhlat p&auml;&auml;ttyiv&auml;t ajallaan, jolloin yo-kunnan hallituksen puheenjohtaja kutsuttiin ottamaan vastaan rehtorin ja hallintojohtajan l&auml;sn&auml;ollessa juhlakalulle tarkoitettua lahjaa. Jonossa k&auml;vi kolmikko kohden kahvihuoneessa lojuvaa yll&auml;tyst&auml;. Punnitsevia olivat lahjansaajien ilmeet lahjak&auml;&auml;r&ouml;n avauduttua. Yksiss&auml; tuumin mittailtiin silm&auml;m&auml;&auml;r&auml;isesti oviaukon laveutta ja ikkunan ulottuvuuksia; kummastus oli mit&auml; todenn&auml;k&ouml;isin. Vaan pianpas ylioppilaskunnan pelimannipuheenjohtaja laukaisi kummastuneen tilanteen esitt&auml;m&auml;ll&auml; iskelm&auml;n "Napoleonin mopo" Mosseraasun katolta k&auml;sin. Esitys sai arvoisensa aplodit. Takajoukossa seisseet ylioppilaskunnan pahaa aavistavat puuhamiehet saattoivat mieliss&auml;&auml;n jo haistaa r&auml;ll&auml;k&ouml;idyn ruostepellin hajun ja kuulla purkuty&ouml;n aiheuttaman metelin. Saatoivatpa jopa mietti&auml; jonkinmoista vastinetta lahjalle...<P>

<H1>Millainen hyvä ja oikea teekkarijäynä oikein on?</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
"Oikean teekkarij&auml;yn&auml;n olemus on ilkikurinen mutta hyv&auml;ntahtoinen, usein sopivaisuuden &auml;&auml;rirajoilla liikkuva tapahtuma, laite, oivallus, happening tai performance, jonka ainoana tarkoituksena on tuottaa hupia itselle, j&auml;yn&auml;n kohteelle tai suurelle yleis&ouml;lle. Se ei tosimieless&auml; ota kantaa uskontoon tai politiikkaan. Se on yll&auml;tyksellinen, tekniikan keinoja hyv&auml;ksik&auml;ytt&auml;v&auml; ep&auml;sovinnainen esitys, jossa usein n&auml;hd&auml;&auml;n suurikin vaiva ehk&auml; hyvinkin pienen tapahtuman aikaansaamiseksi."
<P>

"Mit&auml; oikea teekkarij&auml;yn&auml; ei koskaan saa olla. Se ei koskaan solvaa, rienaa, ivaile, turmele, varasta, tuhoa. Se ei aiheuta kenellek&auml;&auml;n taloudellisia, henkisi&auml; tai fyysisi&auml; vaikeuksia. Mutta sit&auml; enemm&auml;n hauskuutta, iloa, toteuttamisen riemua ja onnistumisen mielihyv&auml;&auml;."

<P><IMG WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=276 HSPACE=4 SRC="/Images/wedding.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>Since October 1986, Captain Ron Arad, a navigator in the Israeli Air Force, has been held prisoner of war in Lebanon.

<P>Although Ron was known to be in good physical condition when he was taken prisoner, there has been no news of him since October 1987. Until the present day, he has not been accorded the fundamental right of any prisoner - visits by a representative of the International Red Cross.

<P>Since there has been no word from Ron Arad himself or any reliable information about his condition or whereabouts, his family is appealing to anyone who can assist in obtaining information about him or establishing contact with him, so that he may return to his home and family as soon as possible.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Capture</H2>
<P><IMG WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=202 SRC="/Images/bday.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>
On October 16, 1986, an Israeli Air Force Phantom aircraft flying over Sidon in Southern Lebanon blew up due to mechanical problems. The pilot and the navigator, Rod Arad, bailed out and landed safely. After the two had landed, the area was surrounded by members of Palestinian and Shi'ite organizations operating in the area. The pilot of the aircraft was rescued by an l.D.F. Cobra helicopter in a daring operation. The navigator, Captain Ron Arad, however, was taken prisoner by the Lebanese Shi'ite organization Arnal.

<P>Ron Arad was transferred by Amal to Beirut, where the organization's leader, Nabi Berri, announced that he was holding Ron and later even proposed an exchange for Shi'ite Lebanese detainees.

<P>The man responsible for Ron Arad's welfare and safety during his detention by Amal was Mustafa D'orani, the head of the organization's security service, a Shi'ite religious fanatic with links to Iran. At the beginning of 1988, he left Amal because of ideological differences, taking the navigator with him.

<TITLE>Free Ron Arad:  1986-7</TITLE>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1986</H1>
<P>Much has occured since 1986 when Ron fell into captivity.  1986 brought Elie Weisel the Nobel Peace Prize, Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos left the Philippines bringing on the era of Corazon Aquino.  In Eastern Eurpope at Chernobyl nuclear power plant an accident occurred whose effects were felt as far away as Finland. 1986 was also the year in which the Challenger space shuttle exploded killing all seven astronauts, the Iran-Contra affair stole the headlines and U.S. President Ronald Reagan order US planes to bomb the Libyan city of Tripoli.

<P>On October 16 of this year Ron Arad fell into captivity.  Ron hasn't seen his family or friends since.  

<P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1987</H1>
<P>During 1987 the world heard some South African musicians and singers backing up Paul Simon's on his album Graceland and the Dow Jones broke the 2000 mark and reached 2722 before crashing.  Rashid Karami, premeir of Lebanon, was assassinated and Margaret Thatcher was elected to her third term of office as Prime Minister of Great Britain.  On the Israeli front we saw a rotation of the premiership between Shimon Peres and Yitzchak Shamir and the beginning of a Palestinian uprising, the Intifada.

<P>October 16, 1987 marked Ron's first year in captivity.

<IMG SRC="/Images/young.jpg" HEIGHT=272 WIDTH=220 HSPACE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>During 1988, Ron Arad was held by a group called "The Resistance of the Believers" formed by D'orani, which advocated an ideology similar to that of Iran and the Hizballah extremist Shi'ite organization in Lebanon.

<P>D'orani's group, being small and weak, was subject to pressures from various quarters (the Syrians, Amal, and others) concerning the navigator. As a result, in the first half of 1989, D'orani transferred Ron Arad or handed him over to the Iranians in Lebanon.

<P>Ron has been held by the Iranians ever since at an unknown location, probably in Lebanon. The Iranians have never officially admitted that they are holding him, or know his whereabouts.

        FAMILIES OF MIAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER MEETING WITH HURD


FAMILIES of the IDF soldiers missing in action in Lebanon came
out of a meeting yesterday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
"disappointed," according to the father of one of the boys.

"We have to try everything," said Yona Baumel, father of Zacharya
Baumel, missing since the battle of Sultan Ya'acoub, "so we requested
[Secretary Douglas] Hurd's good offices.  But we had the feeling that
both sides were merely going through the motions.

"There was no real interest on the part of the secretary," Baumel
said, adding that Hurd had "failed to follow up on commitments to
British Jewry [on this subject] on previous occasions."

The meeting with Hurd, held at the Foreign Ministry, was also
attended by the parents of Yossi Fink, Rahamim Alsheik and Zvi
Feldman.

Hurd then met separately with the mother and brother of missing
Air Force navigator Ron Arad.

For his part, the secretary twice referred to the plight of the
Israeli MiAs yesterday at news conferences with the media.

In reply to a question before his meeting with the families, Hurd
said: "I have raised the issue from time to time, in confidence, with
people whom I thought might be of help." He added that he had noted
Prime Minister's Rabin's statement that there was nothing to say about
the subject "unless it was definite."

Speaking later in the day, Hurd added that he had met with many
human tragedies in the Middle East.  "Only today I spoke with the
families of the MiAs.  One can imagine what they have gone through ...
I shall continue to speak of them whenever possible and sensible."

        RABIN: ARAD BEING HELD BY IRAN OR ITS SURROGATES


DOWNED IAF navigator Ron Arad is being held either by Iran or by
its supporters in Lebanon, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said yesterday
at a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

Rabin also told the Russian premier that PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat had promised him more information about Israeli MiAs, but has
not been forthcoming, apparently fearing it would complicate his
relations with Syria, said Rabin advisers who attended the meeting.

Yesterday's remarks by Rabin contradict a statement by Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres last week that Arafat had done everything
possible to obtain information on Israel's missing soldiers.  Several
months ago, Arafat handed Israeli officials half a dog-tag belonging
to Zacharia Baumel, who went missing in Lebanon during the 1982 battle
at Sultan Yakoub.

Rabin's statements about Arad come just days after Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told an Army Radio correspondent
in Bucharest that Arad is not being held on Iranian soil.

According to an adviser to Rabin, the premier told Chernomyrdin
that "Arad is being held by Iran or Iranian elements in Lebanon." He
refused to reveal whether Rabin had referred to the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards still deployed in the Bekaa valley, or the
Hizbullah in southern Lebanon.

When asked to use his influence with Iran and Syria, Chernomyrdin
issued a personal pledge of support, participants said.

Members of the more than 1,500 Hadassah branches in Israel and
the US have begun a massive letter-writing campaign urging US
President George Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and UN
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to give top priority to
getting information about Israeli navigator Ron Arad and the other
missing Israeli soldiers.  Hadassah members are also wearing
blue-and-white ribbons as a sign of solidarity with the missing men.

        UN CHIEF VOWS TO 'DO HIS UTMOST' FOR MISSING ISRAELIS


UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
last night gave his commitment to the families of Israeli missing
soldiers that he would "do his utmost" to bring about the release of
their captured relatives, and would continue his involvement beyond
the end of his term of office, if necessary.

"I received massive support from the Secretary-General that Ron
is alive," said Tami Arad, the wife of missing airman Captain Ron
Arad, following the meeting.

While Perez de Cuellar could provide her with no proof of her
husband's whereabouts or condition, "the secretary-general told me
that he believes Ron is alive," Arad said.

Perez de Cuellar told her that he had "received a specific
promise" from Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani "that he
will help him to search for Ron and help him to find him," she told
the Jerusalem Post.  "He talked with Mr. Rafsanjani about Ron
specifically."

Earlier this week, Perez de Cuellar sent his envoy Giandomenico
Picco back to the region in an effort to bring about the release of
the missing Israelis.

Arad said the UN chief gave the families no new information as a
result of the Picco mission, but that he would share with them any
details as soon as they became available.  "I expect something in a
matter of days from Mr. Picco," she added.

Arad said she had received no information to substantiate news
reports earlier in the day that her husband, who was shot down in
October 1986, was in Syrian hands.

There has been no word about airman Arad for the past two years.
He was originally held by the Shi'ite Amal militia, but later
transferred to Iranian Revolutionary Guards, although Iran has never
officially admitted to holding him.

The other three Israelis, First Sgt.  Zvi Feldman, Sgt.  Zachary
Baumel and Cpl.  Yehuda Katz disappeared after a 1982 tank battle in
Sultan Yakoub, in eastern Lebanon.

Despite his own previous statements that he had information that
the three tank crew members were dead, Perez de Cuellar told their
relatives not to give up hope.

        BASSIOUNY SURE BOUTROS GHALI WILL ACHIEVE ARAD'S RELEASE


HAIFA - The Egyptian ambassador, Mohammed Bassiouny, said
yesterday he was convinced newly elected UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros Ghali will be more successful in his efforts to gain the
release of Israeli MiAs, including airman Ron Arad, than the outgoing
secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar.

Bassiouny said he expected Boutros Ghali to succeed where Perez
de Cuellar had failed so far because "he is aware of the problems of
the region.  As a result, I am full of hope that the problem will be
solved quickly."

Bassiouny, who was visiting Nesher, near Haifa, said the venue
for peace talks between Israel and the Arabs was unimportant, and that
efforts should be made to focus on substance in the talks.

"The Middle East will be a paradise and other countries will sign
a peace agreement with Israel" if talks succeed, he said, adding:
"Future generations will not forgive us if we miss this golden
opportunity for peace.  The peace between Israel and Egypt will also
grow 'warm up' when the talks become fruitful."

        CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT CAPTURED AIRMAN IS ALIVE.
UN CHIEF 'HAS PLAN' FOR ARAD'S RELEASE.


UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
"has a plan" for the release of captured Israeli airman Ron Arad, "and
he is moving on it," Israel's chief hostage negotiator, Uri Lubrani,
told reporters Monday night.  Perez de Cuellar told The Jerusalem Post
he "was not in a position to know" if Arad was indeed alive, but said
it was his "very sincere hope" he was.

The disclosure followed a 45-minute meeting with the
secretary-general, in which Lubrani appealed to him to continue his
efforts to locate and free the Israeli navigator and arrange for the
return of the bodies of other missing Israeli servicemen.

"The secretary-general has been extremely clear about his
commitment to do whatever he can in order to exhaust all possibilities
by the time he leaves his office" at the end of this month, Lubrani
said.  "He will see to it that Mr. Arad is included in the completion
of his initiative."

Israel is still trying to ascertain the fate of four Israeli
soldiers, three of whom disappeared after a 1982 tank battle in
eastern Lebanon.  The fourth, airman Arad shot down in 1986, is still
thought to be alive, although Israel has not received any reliable
information about his condition.

Despite having no new information on Arad, Perez de Cuellar
confirmed that the other three soldiers were dead, and their bodies
were being held by "groups, but I don't know which groups.

"I have information that they have the bodies and they will be
eventually prepared to release them to the families," Perez de Cuellar
told the Post.

Lubrani said he had no additional knowledge of the fate and
whereabouts of Arad, and that while Israel has "no concrete, hard
intelligence" that he is still alive, "we have reason to believe that
he is."

The secretary-general said the two had discussed "ways and means
of accelerating the information we need about Mr. Arad and the other
missing Israelis," adding, "I feel personally committed to their
freedom.  I intend to end up this very sad experience before the end
of my mandate; that means I have still 22 days for completing my
work."

Perez de Cuellar provided no details about any plan or specific
course of action, however.

Speculation has centered over a possible upcoming trip to Iran or
elsewhere in the region by Perez de Cuellar's envoy, Giandomenico
Picco, to try to win Arad's release.  Asked specifically if he were
sending Picco to Teheran, the secretary-general responded, "It is not
yet decided, but if it is needed he will certainly go.  I am fully
committed to the government and people of Israel in helping in this
particular case."

        HIZBULLAH SAYS IT NEVER HELD RON ARAD


Israeli officials expressed "surprise" at a Hizbullah leader's
statement that IAF navigator Ron Arad is not now in its hands, nor was
he ever.

Naim Kassem said yesterday that the Hizbullah organization "never
arrested or held Ron Arad."

But he did say say Hizbullah is holding two missing IDF soldiers.
It is believed he was referring to the bodies of Yossi Fink and
Rahamim Alsheikh, whose death was confirmed over a month ago.

His remarks apparently dispersed any optimism still maintained by
Israeli negotiators, who had been led to believe that the Shi'ite
group was holding Arad, or knows his whereabouts.

Last night, a Defense Ministry official said the optimism
exhibited by chief hostage negotiator Uri Lubrani had been unfounded.
"He gave the impression we had new information, but today I'm less
sure we had anything at all," the official said.

In a possible attempt to reignite MiA negotiations, the ministry
released an interview with abducted Shi'ite cleric Sheik Abed Karim
Obeid, held since July 1989, videotaped two weeks ago.

Obeid said his situation and that of Arad should not be separated
from the broader Western hostage issue.  Obeid said that he did not
create the link between his fate and that of Arad, but that the link
was natural and made sense.  He said he knew of "the brothers holding
the pilot," thus contradicting Kassem's statement.

Obeid explicitly criticized "brothers who pledged not to release
Western hostages before my situation is resolved, but did not live up
to their commitment and let my situation be disconnected from the
hostage issue."

He acknowledged that from what he understood, "my situation is
frozen and nothing is being done to resolve it."

Jonathan Schachter adds:

Lubrani flew from Washington to New York for a meeting late last
night with UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar at UN
headquarters.  Sources said they were to discuss the the four MiAs
thought to still be alive.

"This is not a courtesy call, it is about the hostage story," an
Israeli official stressed.

The meeting followed contacts over the weekend between Lubrani
and UN hostage negotiator Giandomenico Picco, and earlier meetings in
Germany with other UN officials, a UN spokesman said.

        ARENS: NO NEW INFORMATION ON RON ARAD


Israel has no new information on the whereabouts or fate of
missing air force navigator Ron Arad, Defense Minister Moshe Arens
said yesterday.

Arens was answering reporters' questions at a ceremony at the
Irgun Zvai Leumi (IZL) museum in Tel Aviv.  He refuted persistent
rumors, the last coming from the British "Sky" television network,
according to which Arad was held by Syria.

Arad was reportedly originally captured by the Shi'ite militia
Amal, then sold to Hizbullah, which transferred him to the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon.  However, there have been conflicting
reports on his whereabouts ever since his plane was shot down over
Lebanon in July 1986.  According to some reports, he was transferred
to Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command and eventually to Syria.

Israel has consistently contended that Arad is alive.

Following a week of cautious optimism - Arad's wife Tami
reportedly flew to Europe last Tuesday - the first signs of renewed
Israeli frustration surfaced yesterday.  "At this point, it is
essential to say out loud to the UN secretary-general and to all those
holding [the missing] and to those who have already welcomed their
captive sons back home that Israel must see an end to this episode as
well," hostage negotiator Ori Slonim said.

He was expressing anxiety concerning Israel's hopes that its MiAs
be returned or new information be provided before the term of UN
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expires at the end of
December.

Meanwhile, a Lebanese Shi'ite leader said that Arad is being held
by Syria, which "puts him out of any exchange deal.  The Israelis said
they wanted information on Arad, and the problem now is only how to
tell them he is with the Syrians."

That argument was rejected by UN assistant secretary-general
Giandomenico Picco, who said that "we do not know where the Israeli
navigator is, who holds him.  This is something which has yet to be
discovered."

        OFFICIALS SAY RELEASE PART OF A WIDER DEAL


Israeli officials said yesterday's release of hostages Terry
Waite and Thomas Sutherland were part of a wider deal being brokered
for months by UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.  One
senior official voiced hope that the complex negotiations, involving
Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Hizbullah, and Israel and would conclude by the
end of next month.

Yohanan Bein, a senior Foreign Ministry official dealing with the
hostage issue, said last night that the release of Waite and
Sutherland showed that the overall deal was "on track."

"We knew it was coming," he said.  "Today's step can be described
as one wheel in the machine.

"We welcome the releases and are happy for the families.  Perez
de Cuellar has kept up his efforts and has overcome obstacles put in
his way.  I hope the entire deal is completed by the end of December,
when he completes his tenure at the UN."

Bein said the next step was up to Hizbullah, but refused to
detail what it would be.  "They know exactly what we are waiting for."

He denied reports that Israel would release the approximately 300
Shi'ite prisoners being held by the South Lebanon Army, as well as
Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, being held in Israel, if Hizbullah or its
Iranian patrons releases IAF navigator Ron Arad and the bodies of
Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, irrespective of Syrian accounting for
the other three IDF soldiers missing in Lebanon.

Bein admitted that the fate of the three is "separate" from the
PoWs, such as Arad, believed held by Hizbullah.  "It is true the fate
of those three taken by Syria is a separate affair from those taken by
the Hizbullah, but at the same time, we seem them as somehow being
tied together." He refused to elaborate.

        INFORMATION OF MIAS, RETURN OF BODIES NOT PART OF THE DEAL


Information on the fate of the four Israeli MiAs and the return
of the bodies of Yossef Fink and Rahamim Alshiekh are at this stage
not part of the hostage deal which took place yesterday, according to
sources involved in the negotiations.

The sources expressed their frustration, stressing that the issue
of the Western hostages vis-a-vis the Shi'ite organizations is moving
at a far greater pace than that of the Israeli MiAs.

Ori Slonim, a lawyer working with Uri Lubrani on the negotiations
concerning the Israeli MiAs, was quoted last night by the BBC World
Service as saying that Israel would return all Lebanese Shi'ites it is
holding in exchange for the bodies of Fink and Alsheikh and the return
of IAF navigator Ron Arad.

Israel welcomed the release of Thomas Sutherland and Terry Waite
in Lebanon yesterday saying that it hopes that the efforts of the UN
Secretary General will result in obtaining information on the
whereabouts of its own MiAs.

The short statement, attributed to "security sources," made no
reference to any release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel or its
Lebanese allies in south Lebanon.

Israel is now concentrating its efforts in three directions:
obtaining information on Arad's whereabouts, believed to be held by
Iranian proxies or by Iran itself, although the possibilty of Syrian
custody is not discounted; retrieving the bodies of Fink and Alsheikh;
and ascertaining the fate of Armor Corps soldiers Yehuda Katz,
Zecharia Baumel and Zvi Feldman, missing since the battle of Sultan
Yaacub in June 1982.

Sources close to the hostage issues said last night Israel hopes
that the information it is seeking will become available before Javier
Perez de-Cuellar's term as UN Secretary General expires.

          Lebanon.

        ISRAEL, SLA FREE 15 LEBANESE.
REPORTS OF HOSTAGE RELEASE SQUASHED.


Reports here that an American hostage had been released were
squashed yesterday in the Syrian capital of Damascus, where a senior
Syrian official said no release was imminent.

"I assure you that you can go home to sleep tonight.  Come back
for tea tomorrow," said Nasser Kaddour, minister of state for foreign
affairs, addressing the mob of reporters outside the Foreign Ministry
in Damascus.

"I hope that a hostage will be released soon," he said.

The Beirut bureau of Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency earlier
reported that American professor Jesse Turner had been released.

An editor in the Beirut office of the Islamic Republic News
Agency said Turner was set free at 8 p.m. The editor, who refused to
be named, said he had no further details.

But the report appeared false immediately because it did not
follow the usual pattern--there was no statement from the kidnap group
announcing the specific time and location of the release and Syrian
security forces were not given custody.

Kaddour, who appeared assured that the process was continuing,
did not comment on why a 24-hour deadline set by the kidnappers
themselves at midnight Sunday would pass.

But numerous events in Lebanon could have delayed the
process--including fierce fighting around Hizbullah headquarters in
the Bekaa valley capital of Baalbek, where many of the hostages are
believed held.  Eight people were killed and 15 wounded in the
fighting.

The Organization of Islamic Jihad also warned that renewed IAF
raids on south Lebanon could hamper U.N. efforts to win freedom for
the Western hostages.

Earlier yesterday, 15 Lebanese detainees were released by Israel
and the South Lebanon Army.

Fourteen Lebanese, including two women, were released from the
el-Khiyam jail inside the security zone in south Lebanon.  They had
all been detained for periods of between one to four years terrorist
activities or belonging to terrorist organizations.

Nine of them, including the women, decided to return to their
home villages inside the security zone.  The other five were handed
over to Red Cross officials and transferred north of the zone.

The single detainee who had been held inside Israel was brought
to the Rosh Hanikra border crossing in car with army plates.  When
photographers tried to snap a picture of him, the bearded Hizbullah
activist ducked between the seats in a vain attempt to keep out of
sight.

The man was later named as Ali Abbas Fawaz, who was captured by
IDF troops after being wounded trying to plant an explosive device in
the eastern sector of the security zone about five years ago.

Fawaz told Lebanese reporters afterwards that following his
recuperation he had been kept in Ramle jail, where regional Hizbullah
chief Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid is also being held.

He was handed over to Red Cross officials who escorted him out of
the zone towards Beirut.  When they reached Tyre, however, Fawaz's
brother, now serving in the Lebanese army tried to prevent them going
on to Beirut.

According to reports from Lebanon, the brother said he wanted to
take Fawaz back to his family who live in a village in south Lebanon,
rather than let him go on to Beirut and be used for propaganda
purposes.

The release of the 15 followed the Saturday night receipt of
irrefutable evidence that missing Givati Brigade soldier Yossi Fink,
like his comrade-in-arms Rahamim Alsheikh, was dead.

The UN-brokered negotiations to conclude an exchange deal that
would secure the release of all foreign hostages and the return of
missing IDF servicemen and PoWs, including IAF navigator Ron Arad, for
the freeing of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel and the SLA had
become stalled recently.  Israel had accused Iran and Hizbullah of
reneging on its promises to supply conclusive information about the
fate of Fink and Arad.

The information on Fink and the release of the 15 Lebanese
detainees appeared to have broken the deadlock.

Israel, however, tried to play down the release because of
Hizbullah's roadside bomb attack against an IDF patrol inside the
security zone on Sunday in which three IDF soldiers were killed and
two others wounded.

Dr. Yossi Olmert, director of the government press office, said
the release of the detainees was part of the "continuing support for
the initiative of UN Secretary-General [Javier] Perez de Cuellar."

"It is hoped that the process of resolving this humanitarian
problem will continue and will soon come to a successful conclusion,"
said Dr. Olmert.

        DISINFORMATION CONTINUES ON ARAD'S FATE, SAYS OFFICIAL


Israeli officials yesterday decried the latest statement by an
unnamed Lebanese Moslem fundamentalist that the fate of missing IAF
navigator Ron Arad was unknown.

The officials said the announcement was "yet another piece of
disinformation in the Hizbullah's war of nerves" over the hostages and
MiA's affair.

"From Israel's point of view nothing has changed.  We have many
reasons to believe that Ron Arad was transferred to the hands of the
Iranians, alive and well, and we would like to have information
concerning him as soon as possible," said a well-informed government
source.

A pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalist said in Beirut that the fate
of Arad was the main stumbling block to a settlement of the hostages
affair.

"The fate and whereabouts of Ron Arad are still shrouded in
mystery.  Apparently he is not in the hands of pro-Iranian Moslem
activists.  We don't know where he is," the fundamentalist leader was
quoted as saying.

Arad ejected from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986.  He was
reported to have been captured by the then security chief of the Amal
Shi'ite organization Mustafa Dirani, who later allegedly sold Arad to
Iranian Revolutionary Guards stationed in Lebanon.

The pro-Iranian leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that despite the apparent hiatus in negotiations, progress was being
made in efforts to secure the release of foreign hostages held by
Hizbullah extremists in Lebanon.

"Breakthroughs can be expected, but closing this file totally
will depend on how much Israel is willing to bypass the issue of its
pilot," the fundamentalist was quoted as saying.

        DIRANI ABDUCTION TO GET DATA ON ARAD - RABIN


IDF commandos kidnapped Mustafa Dirani in the Bekaa Valley early
yesterday morning, not as a bargaining chip to trade for the release
of missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad, but to extract information
about the soldier's whereabouts, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
last night.

The prime minister told a Tel Aviv press conference Israel is
willing to take further actions to free Israeli soldiers missing in
action, but at the same time he admitted he had no definitive proof
that Arad was either alive or dead.

It remains unclear what information Dirani could provide Israel
about Arad's whereabouts, since officials say Dirani, head of the
"Believers Resistance," an organization linked to Hizbullah, has
probably not held the airman since 1988.

Other senior officials said last night that Dirani would
constitute decisive proof that a "pro-Iranian group" has held Arad,
and thereby aid Jerusalem in eliciting international pressure on
Teheran.  Israeli sources said the IDF commandos searched Dirani's
home for a videotape showing his group turning Arad over to Iran.

Rabin said he hoped Dirani "would provide information definitely
on the period Ron Arad was in his hands, and possibly also on his
situation in the future."

Rabin added: "We have no definitive proof that he is alive and no
definitive proof that he is dead.  Until proven otherwise, missing
soldiers are assumed to be alive."

The inner cabinet unanimously approved the IDF commando operation
on Thursday.  Sources say the operation was approved after Rabin
pledged that "it would be clean," i.e., without civilian casualties.
Ministers wanted these assurances since family members were killed
when IDF helicopters used rockets to kill Hizbullah leader Sheikh
Abbas Musawi in February 1992.  Shortly thereafter, a pro-Iranian
group claimed responsibility for bombing the Israeli Embassy in Buenos
Aires.

Speaking to reporters last night, Rabin candidly admitted he
personally learned a lesson when, as defense minister, he ordered the
kidnapping of Shi'ite Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid in 1989, saying at the
time he mistakenly thought the Lebanese cleric could be traded for
Israeli MiAs.

"I hoped the kidnapping of Sheikh Obeid could be a bargaining
chip in negotiations.  I have no more delusions thinking that anyone
could be a bargaining chip in those negotiations, certainly not
Mustafa Dirani.  The goal is to find out what has happened and what is
happening to Ron Arad, as well as to deal with Lebanese terror against
southern Lebanon," he said.

Rabin declared more operations will take place if they will help
find Israel's missing soldiers.  "I can promise that we will also
conduct operations like this in the future if there is a need for them
...  we are responsible for all the missing and captured whose fate
has not yet been determined."

When asked privately if the kidnapping was timed to improve the
government and the IDF's standing among the public at the time of IDF
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, he answered: "This is negligible."

Rabin said the operation to kidnap Dirani was actually supposed
to take place a few months ago, but was canceled for unspecified
"intelligence reasons." The prime minister said the operation was
resumed when another chance to obtain information about Arad was
scotched.

Efforts to elicit information about the missing soldiers from
Syria, which controls the Bekaa Valley where Israeli soldiers were at
least once held, had failed, Rabin indicated.

The premier said that he did not think the operation would hurt
the peace process, noting that while it took place in a
Syrian-controlled area, it did not happen on Syrian soil.

        ISRAELI OFFICIAL: NO PRISONER SWAP IN THE WORKS


Israel will not make any more goodwill gestures to Hizbullah
until credible information is received on the whereabouts of Israeli
MIA's, a high level Defense Ministry official said last night.

Iran's official news agency reported yesterday that Israel will
soon release a group of Arab detainees in exchange for a Western
hostage, possibly an American.

It quoted sources in the southern port city of Sidon as saying
Israel will also return the bodies of Lebanese fighters who had been
killed in battles with Israeli troops and what the report termed their
militia allies.

"Both the Iranian information agency's reports and [Hizbullah
leader] Abbas Mussawi's statements regarding a further Israeli gesture
in the form of freeing Lebanese prisoners are unsubstantiated.  In
short, there is nothing going on today that is new," said the
official, who is close to the negotiations on freeing Israeli MiAs
held in Lebanon last night.

The official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that Uri
Lubrani, Israel's top negotiator and coordinator of activities in
Lebanon, made it clear in a weekend interview he gave in New York that
Hizbullah is not living up to its commitments to provide Israel with
information on the whereabouts of the five IDF MiAs still missing.

The information received so far, said the official, is clearly
inadequate.  "We are stil waiting for information on Yossi Fink and on
[IAF Navigator] Ron Arad.  Before we get reliable and confirmable
information on the two, Israel is not likely to free more detainees or
return more bodies of Shi'ite militiamen ", emphasized the official.

Israel freed 51 Shi'ite detainees and returned the bodies of 9
Hizbullah men last month.  In exchange Israel was to get information
on Fink, who disappeared with Rahamim Alsheik in 1986 and on Ron Arad.
Alsheik's death was confirmed last month, based on information
supplied by Hizbullah.

        HOSTAGE RETURN 'COULD TAKE 20 YEARS'


ROSH HANIKRA - A solution to the hostage and MIAs issue could
take 10 to 20 years to be reached, Hizbullah's leader said yesterday.
He also told a Beirut news conference his organization was not yet
ready to return "even one corpse" of missing IDF servicemen to Israel.

Abbas Musawi, general secretary of the radical fundamentalist
Moslem group, said the issue was still at the stage of exchanging
information.

"The issue of the hostages and the prisoners is heading toward a
solution, but things are in the initial stage.  There are
complications and counter-complications, conditions and
counter-conditions," Musawi said at Hizbullah's headquarters in
Beirut's southern slum suburb of Bir el-Abed.

"It is a real battle and all the means of a real battle will be
deployed in it until we manage to close this file, even after 10 or 20
years," the black-turbaned Musawi added.

He told news agency reporters that the factions holding hostages
and prisoners had to set conditions and ensure that a "price" was paid
for every stage in the process, even for the release of "minor
information."

He reportedly charged that the recent release of 51 Lebanese
prisoners from the El-Khiyam jail inside the security zone in south
Lebanon and the return by Israel of the bodies of nine Hizbullah
gunmen was insufficient.

The detainees were freed and the bodies returned to Lebanon in
exchange for information relayed to Israel via UN Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar which provided conculsive proof that one of
the missing servicemen Rahamim Alsheikh was dead.

Israel has accused Iran of reneging on commitments to de-Cuellar,
who is heading the international efforts to solve the hostages and
MIA's affair, to supply irrefutable details regarding the fate of
another soldier Yossi Fink.  He was captured along with Alsheikh in a
Hizbullah ambush inside the security zone in 1986.

Israel is also still awaiting information about the fate of IAF
navigator Ron Arad who ejected from his plane over Lebanon later the
same year (1986).

Musawi's comments yesterday appeared to be in response to
Israel's charge that the ball was in the Iranian/Hizbullah court and
that Israel, although ready and willing, would not make any further
gestures until it received the promised information about Fink, as
well as missing South Lebanese Army soldiers.

Musawi was asked by reporters at the Beirut press conference
yesterday whether Fink was still alive.  The leader of the pro-Iranian
fundamentalist Shi'ite organization replied that he was not prepared
to disclose any information via the media.

Musawi also indicated that the Hizbullah wanted hundreds of
Palestinians and pro-Syrian Palestinians detained by Israel for
intifada offences to be included in any future package deal.

        HIZBULLAH: RED CROSS MAY PROBE FINK CASE


Hizbullah council member Hussein Musawi yesterday hinted the Red
Cross could soon investigate the fate of missing IDF soldier Yossi
Fink, whom he said was probably dead, several Lebanese radio reports
said.

Israel has been pressing for irrefutable facts on the fate of
Fink who was captured in an Hizbullah ambush inside the security zone
in south Lebanon in February 1986, along with Rahamim Alsheikh,
another Givati Brigade soldier.

Earlier information relayed by Hizbullah via UN Secretary-General
Javier Perez de-Cuellar, who is leading efforts to solve the hostages,
MIA's and prisoners affair, provided conclusive proof that Alsheikh is
dead.

Partly in return for that information, 51 Lebanese prisoners were
freed from El-Khiyam jail in south Lebanon and the bodies of nine
Hizbullah men were returned.

Musawi said he expected International Red Cross officials to be
allowed to inspect Fink and pass the relevant information to the UN,
the radio reports said.

Musawi, echoing other Moslem sources, said he expected another
foreign hostage to be freed by Sunday.  He was apparently referring to
American Joseph Cicippio, the last hostage held by the Revolutionary
Justice Organization which on Tuesday freed the 77-year-old British
World War II fighter ace, Jack Mann.

In Iran, the English-language daily Teheran Times reported again
yesterday that an American hostage would be freed "by the end of the
western weekend."

Cicippio, the deputy comptroller at the American University of
Beirut was kidnapped in September 1986.

Several Moslem spokesmen said they expected Israel to release a
fresh batch of prisoners from El-Khiyam after the freeing of the
American.

But Jerusalem has accused Iran of failing to honour its
commitments to provide Perez de Cueller with conclusive evidence on
Fink.  Officials said the details relayed previously were
insufficient.

Musawi's comments yesterday, if reported accurately, mark the
first time a Hizbullah leader has hinted publicly that the Red Cross
would be allowed to inspect a missing IDF serviceman.

Allison Kaplan adds from Washington:

Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said this week his
government had no information about missing IAF navigator Ron Arad.

"We don't know anything" about Arad," Velayati told the
Washington Post.

He said that he could "categorically deny" reports that the
missing Israeli transferred to Iran or kept at the Iranian embassy in
Lebanon.

Velayati also pointed the finger at Israel as a source of
information on Iranians who vanished in Beirut in 1982.

He said that Lebanese sources alleged the men were being held in
Israel.

He told the newspaper these "hostages" - four employees of the
Iranian embassy in Beirut and an Iran News photographer - were
important to Iran.

Velayati strongly denied allegations surrounding the so-called
"October surprise" - charges that the Reagan-Bush presidential
campaign negotiated with Iran in 1980 to keep U.S. Embassy hostages
from being freed before the election.

It was the first public comment on the issue from a senior
Iranian official since former Carter administration official Gary Sick
made the allegations.

        ISRAEL AWAITING WORD ON MIAS BEFORE ANY ADDITIONAL RELEASES


Israeli officials yesterday rejected reports of the pending
release of a fresh batch of Lebanese prisoners from the El-Khiyam jail
in the security zone in south Lebanon, following the freeing by
Lebanese Shi'ite extremists of British captive Jack Mann.

"We are waiting to receive information about Yossi Fink and
missing South Lebanese Army soldiers, and as long as we don't get this
information there won't be any move on our part," Uri Lubrani, the
government's coordinator on Lebanon, told The Jerusalem Post last
night.

"To the best of my knowledge there is no intention to release any
[Lebanese] prisoners [from El-Khiyam] at this point in time, unless
the conditions mentioned earlier are fulfilled," said Lubrani, who is
heading Israel's negotiating team on the hostages, prisoners and MIAs
issue.

He noted that Israel had been promised irrefutable information
regarding the fate of Givati Brigade soldier Yossi Fink, who was
captured along with Rahamim Alsheikh by Hizbullah gunmen in an ambush
inside the security zone over five years ago.

Previous information relayed by the Hizbullah via UN
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is leading the efforts
to solve the affair, provided conclusive proof that Alsheikh was dead.

In return for that information, 51 Lebanese prisoners were
released from the El-Khiyam jail, and the bodies of nine Hizbullah
gunmen were returned to Lebanon.

Danny Naveh, media adviser to Defense Minister Moshe Arens, in a
statement issued yesterday, said Iran had pledged to provide
conclusive proof to de Cuellar regarding the fate of both Fink and
Alsheikh.

Iran, however, had failed to honor its commitments and the
details regarding Fink were insufficient.  Israel had also expressed
to de Cuellar its willingness to release more prisoners, provided it
received, via the secreatry-general, conclusive evidence over the fate
of IAF navigator Ron Arad.  So far such information had not been
forthcoming.

Naveh said Israel utterly rejected recent allegations made by a
Hizbullah leader that the release of Jack Mann was delayed because of
Israel's refusal to release 80 prisoners from the El-Khiyam jail.

He said Israel hoped that the release of Mann would lead to the
freeing of Israel's missing servicemen, as well as the remaining
foreign hostages in Lebanon.

Naveh stressed that Israel fully supported the initiative taken
by de Cuellar and saw his efforts as the only channel through which a
solution to the overall problem could be achieved.

Lubrani expressed optimism that a solution would eventually be
reached, despite the allegations, which he described as "standard
procedure," that had been leveled at Israel by the hostage-holders.

He was highly skeptical of reports in a London newspaper that
Arad was being held by a Palestinian terrorist group and not as
believed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

Lubrani said he was confident that Arad was alive, adding that
Israel expected to receive information on him from de Cuellar.

The English language Iranian daily, the Tehran Times, reported
yesterday that another foreign hostage, probably American Joseph
Ciccipo, is expected to be released by the end of this week.

Similar comments have been made by Hizbullah leader Abbas Musawi,
giving credence to the report.  Israeli officials, however, said they
had no information on the matter.

"We would welcome the release of another foreign hostage very
much, should it transpire.  At the same time, we believe that hostage
holders should also make some gesture towards us," lawyer Ory Slonim,
another member of Israel's negotiating team told the Post.

"There is momentum and I believe that all the sides want to solve
the problem.  The other side, however, also wants to squeeze Israel at
every stage in the process," said Slonim, adviser to the Defense
Ministry on the missing servicemen.

The other three MIA's are First Sgt.  Zvi Feldman, Sgt.  Zacharia
Baumel and Cprl.  Yehuda Katz, who have been missing since the Sultan
Yacoub tank battle with a Syrian armored unit in June 1982, in the
early days of the Lebanon War.

Slonim noted that the "address" in the case of these three was
different to that of Fink and Arad.

Israel has always held Syria responsible for the safety and
well-being of the three.

Slonim revealed that de Cuellar was also working on this matter
and was in touch with the Syrian authorities.

        ARENS: NO NEW DATA ON MIAS


The negotiations on the five Israeli MiA's still missing are
stalled, Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Israel Television last
night.

Arens said in a Mabat interview that chief negotiator Uri
Lubrani's meetings with UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
did not produce new information on the whereabouts of IAF navigator
Ron Arad, believed to be alive and held by a pro-Iranian group in
Lebanon.

Israel is also seeking information on the three missing Armor
Corps soldiers - Zacharia Baumel, Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman - who
disappeared in the battle of Sultan Yacoub in June 1982.

Arens reiterated Israel's position on Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid,
the Shi'ite cleric from Lebanon, saying he is the strongest bargaining
chip Israel now has vis-a-vis the Shi'ite groups.

        HOPES RAISED FOR END TO HOSTAGE SAGA


The release of 51 Lebanese prisoners from El-Khiyam jail inside
south Lebanon's security zone and the return of the bodies of nine
Hizbullah gunmen on Wednesday may seem a high price to pay for
reliable information on the sad fate of one missing Israeli
serviceman.

Nevertheless, the very fact that the Hizbullah released such
conclusive evidence about the death of Givati Brigade soldier Rahamim
Alsheikh is a major breakthrough after five-and-a-half years of
silence.

For the Hizbullah to relay credible, corroborative details to
Israel, albeit via intermediaries, is seen by veteran Lebanon watchers
as a crucial step in overcoming the first and most difficult of the
obstacles towards resolving the hostage, prisoners, and MIAs affair
once and for all.

The apparently imminent return to Israel of the body of another
slain IDF serviceman, Druse Sgt.  Samir Assad, in exchange for
allowing a leading Palestinian who was deported from the territories
to return, is likely to further boost hopes for an early end to the
whole issue.

Government sources noted that, although Assad's case was not
directly linked to the hostage/prisoners issue, it was another
positive link in the chain.

Meanwhile, the crux of the hostages and MIA's problem continues
to focus on the Iranians and their Islamic surrogates in Lebanon.

It may well be that at least one of the remaining foreign
hostages will be released in the near future in response to Israel's
gesture on Wednesday.

More tough bargaining, however, confronts the negotiators, led by
UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, before a package deal that
would result in the release of all the foreign hostages and the return
of Israel's MIAs is likely to be consummated.

Israel has outlined its general terms for such a deal in
behind-the-scenes meetings with de Cuellar and his chief aide on the
hostage issue, Giandomenico Picco.  The latter reportedly visited
Israel before joining de Cuellar in Teheran, where the
secretary-general is holding talks on the hostage issue with Iranian
leaders.

It is also uncertain whether the three Israeli servicemen missing
since the June 1982 Sultan Yacub battle with Syrian armoured forces -
Yehuda Katz, Zacharia Baumel, and Zvi Feldman - would be included in
any package deal involving the Hizbullah.

The three were reported to have been captured and later handed
over to the pro-Syrian E-Saika Palestinian terrorist organization.
Nothing officially has been heard of them since, while the Syrians
have consistently denied any knowledge of their wherabouts, despite
repeated requests from international bodies.

Israeli officials stressed that, despite the difficulties,
strenuous efforts are continuing to ascertain the fate of the three
soldiers.

In the meantime, Israel's efforts are concentrating on clarifying
the fate of IDF soldier Yossi Fink, who was captured with Alsheikh in
a Hizbullah ambush in the Beit Yahoun region of the security zone in
February 1986, as well as the whereabouts and wellbeing of Israel Air
Force navigator Ron Arad.

Arad was reportedly handed over to Iranian Revolutionary Guards
stationed in Lebanon by Amal renegade Mustafa Dirani, whose Believers
Resistance group captured him after he ejected from his plane over
Lebanon in October 1986.

Officially, nothing has been heard about Arad's fate since the
first few months after he was taken prisoner.

Despite the complexities and prospects of further tough
negotiations, Israeli officials are optimistic that a deal will be
achieved in the not-too-distant future.

"There's a lot more to be done, but two things have happened
which, hopefully, will help speed-up the process," said a government
source.  "On the one hand, a framework for a solution has been
established, while on the other it has become clear, without a shadow
of doubt, that the Iranians and their proxies in Lebanon, as well as
the Syrians and ourselves, are very keen to solve this problem once
and for all.

"In this context, we could expect to see one or more of the
western hostages released in the near future, perhaps even in the next
few days.  Overall there are real signs of an end to the whole affair,
provided the Iranians don't suddenly change the rules," the source
added.

        'ALL WE WANT TO DO IS BRING BACK OUR POWS'.
LUBRANI CONFIRMS ALSHEIKH DEAD;  SLA FREES 51 IN GOODWILL GESTURE.


UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he would
redouble his efforts to arrange an exchange of Western hostages in
Lebanon and other captives after Israel freed 51 Arab prisoners
yesterday.

The prisoners, and the bodies of nine Hizbullah terrorists killed
in clashes with the IDF, were released after the Defense Ministry
received information that soldier Rahamim Alsheikh, missing in action
since 1986, was dead.

"The release of the 51 prisoners held by [South Lebanese Army]
Col.  Antoine Lahad in El-Khiam Prison is a gesture of goodwill, the
kind we said would be made in exchange for hard and reliable
information," Uri Lubrani, government coordinator of activities in
Lebanon, said at a Tel Aviv press conference yesterday.

Sources in the Defense Ministry indicated yesterday that they
hoped that the remains of IDF fallen Rachamim Alsheikh would be handed
to Israel in a few days, if not hours.

Information about the fate of Yosef Fink, the second soldier
believed taken prisoner with Alsheikh, was not conclusive, Lubrani
said.

"We do not know that he is not alive," said Lubrani.  "The
information on Alsheikh was conclusive enough to determine that he is
unfortunately dead, but that is not the case in regard to Fink."

He added that he hoped the fate of Samir Assad would be clarified
in a matter of days.

Lubrani also said he had no firm news concerning missing IAF
navigator Ron Arad.

"In this game we have no rules and no regulations," said Lubrani.
"All we want to do is bring back our POWs and MIAs."

The new information received regarding the fate of IDF MIA
Rachamim Alsheikh, and Israel's reciprocal release of 51 Shiites held
by the South Lebanese Army and repatriation of niine bodies of
Hizbullah men killed is a step in the right direction, said Lubrani.

"It is a first step and a result of laborious efforts on our and
UN Secretary General de-Cuellar's part," said Lubrani.

Nevertheless, he added, his public announcement was not a new way
of conducting business.  "We will continue using quiet and cautious
diplomacy in our efforts to reveal the whereabouts of the other six
MIAs," Lubrani emphasized.

Asked whether Israel would allow the International Red Cross to
visit Sheikh Karim Obeid, snatched and held by Israel since 1989,
Lubrani said that "Yes.  But only when the Red Cross will be allowed
to visit our remaining POW's".

Meanwhile in Tehran, the UN chief's spokesman, Francois Giuliani,
said in a statement: "The secretary-general is very happy with this
news and very encouraged by this further step."

Sources close to the negotiations for the release of the
Westerners voiced optimism over a possible end to the hostage affair
after Israel broke a stalemate by freeing the 51 Lebanese and handing
over the bodies of nine guerrillas.

"There is movement," said one non-Iranian source just before
Israel completed the handover in what it said was a goodwill gesture
to help UN efforts to end the hostage saga.  The SLA still holds more
than 300 Arabs captured in Lebanon.

"We are not speaking about six weeks or six months," he added,
apparently referring to a solution to the entire hostage affair.  The
source was speaking on condition he was not named.

UN officials said the hostages were one of the issues discussed
with Iranian leaders yesterday by Perez de Cuellar on the first full
day of a visit to Tehran.

There was no immediate comment on the Israeli move from Iran,
which has been seen as a key player because it commands the allegiance
of Shi'ite Moslem Lebanese guerrillas holding up to 10 Westerners.

Iran and Shi'ite Lebanese leaders had demanded that Israel make a
move since kidnappers released a British and an American hostage last
month and asked Perez de Cuellar to arrange an overall swap.

One signal that something was in the air was the fact that Perez
de Cuellar's hostage trouble-shooter, Giandomenico Picco, arrived in
Tehran yesterday, a day after the UN chief.  He would not say where he
had been.

The secretary-general held more than four hours of talks with
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati on hostages, Afghanistan, Gulf security and the
aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war.

Leading members of the radical pro-Iranian Hizbullah indicated
yesterday that some foreign hostages may be released in the near
future in the wake of the release.

Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the
fundamentalist Shi'ite organization, told news agency reporters that
the release created "an atmosphere conducive to positive results."

Moslem cleric Hussein Musawi, a member of the Hizbullah ruling
council, went a step further, saying he expected some of the Western
hostages to be freed soon.

The Amal renegade said, however, he did not know when such a
release was likely to take place, saying it could be "next week, next
month or more."

Twenty nine of those released yesterday were taken to a crossing
point on the northern border of the security zone, near Tibnin village
and released.  Several returned to the market town of Nabatiya.

        INFORMATION SCARCE ON THOSE STILL MISSING


The five other IDF servicemen missing or believed held as
prisoners in Lebanon include Zacharia Baumel, Yehuda Katz and Zvi
Feldman.

The three have been missing since the June 1982 confrontation
with Syrian armored units in what came to be known as the Sultan Yacub
battle.

They were reported to have been seen in a "victory" parade in
Damascus a short time later aboard a captured IDF tank.  They were
then believed to have been handed over to the Syrian-backed A-Saiqa
Palestinian terrorist organization.  Since then nothing has been heard
or seen of them.

A year later, in April 1983, Druse soldier Sgt.  Samir Assad was
captured by members of Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) in the Sidon area of Lebanon.

The DFLP claimed that Assad was subsequently killed in an Israel
Air Force raid on Rabbit Island near Tripoli in northern Lebanon.
Israeli officials, however, maintained that the story was concocted to
cover up his murder by the terrorists.

Assad's family, from the Druse village of Beit Jann, on Mount
Meiron, still hope against hope that he is alive, although local
residents said yesterday that the chances of him returning home alive
are very slim.

There have been reports lately that a separate deal might soon be
worked out concerning Assad.  This was confirmed by Uri Lubrani, the
government's corodinator on Lebanon who is handling the issue of
Israel's MIA's.  Lubrani said yesterday that some progress had been
made in the case of the missing Druse soldier.

The seventh missing Israeli, IAF navigator Ron Arad, was captured
by the Amal Shi'ite organization after ejecting from his plane over
Lebanon in October 1986.

He was later reportedly handed over to a contingent of the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Lebanon by Amal's former security chief
Mustafa Dirani who defected from the organization.  Dirani reportedly
received a large sum of money for handing over Arad.

Apart from letters and photographs sent to Arad's family, nothing
had been heard about the fate of the other MIA's until yesterday.

There has been a plethora of reports from Amal and Arab sources
recently over the whereabouts and fate of Arad.  None of the reports,
however, has been officially confirmed.

        EX-AMAL OFFICIAL CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ARAD


Former Amal security head, Mustafa Deirani, said in a statement
broadcast by several Beirut radio station that he has no information
about Ron Arad, one of seven missing Israeli servicemen whose fate is
linked to the release of Western hostages in Lebanon.

Deirani was fired as Amal security chief in 1988.

The leadership of Amal claims Deirani took Arad with him to
Baalbek and later sold him for $500,000 to the Revolutionary Guards
who smuggled him to Iran via Syria.

"This claim is untrue and irresponsible," Deirani said in his
statement.  "I am not responsible for any misdeeds that occurred after
my dismissal."

UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said yesterday he is
awaiting developments in the hostage situation and hopes for a
prisoner exchange "in the next few weeks."

"I am waiting," he said, "I am in the role of broker, going from
one side to another."

In Teheran yesterday, a radical Lebanese Shi'ite Moslem leader
renewed demands for U.S. pressure on Israel to free Arab prisoners as
a step to gain release of Western hostages, Iran's Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.

The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Sheik Abbas Musavi as
saying in Teheran Wednesday that the U.S. is delaying the release of
hostages in Lebanon for political gain.

Hizbullah has said it is holding two of the Israelis, but has
refused to provide further information until some of the Arab
prisoners are freed.

In Jerusalem yesterday, Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh
urged the media to tone down their coverage of the hostage issue,
claiming they were becoming a channel for wrong information and
propaganda.

Naveh's comments followed statements this week by Amal that it
holds two of the seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon, and that
missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad was sold to the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards for $500,000.

Naveh said Israel has no news on Arad other than the Amal
announcement published in the press, and called on Teheran to admit
the Israeli is in Iran.

        ISRAEL DEMANDS IRAN FREE MISSING AIRMAN ARAD


Now that we have proof that navigator Ron Arad is alive and being
held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, it is up to Iran to publish
more details and free him, a Defense Ministry spokesman said
yesterday.

The statement came in response to new evidence indicating that
Arad is alive, and that he was sold by the Amal militia to the Iranian
Revolutionary guards.

Sources in the Defense Ministry say that although they are
cautiously optimistic on the hostage negotiating process, no deal will
be made until the whereabouts of the other six MiAs are made known to
Israel.  Chief of Staff Major-Gen. Ehud Barak said today in a meeeting
with military correspondents that he had nothing new to report on the
hostage issue.

AP adds:

Claims by Lebanese and Palestinian militias account for six of
the seven missing Israeli soldiers whose fate Israel wants to know
about before agreeing to a prisoner swap that could free Western
hostages.

But Israel says it wants proof of the soldiers' situations before
releasing Arab prisoners whose freedom has been demanded by Lebanese
factions in exchange for the 11 Westerners missing in Lebanon.

Here is what is known about the missing Israelis:

The Shi'ite Muslim faction Amal says it has the bodies of two
soldiers captured just after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.  These
could be Sgts.  Zachary Baumel and Zvi Feldman, who were taken
prisoner during a tank battle on June 11 that year.

There has been no word on the fate of Cpl.  Yehuda Katz, who was
captured in another tank in the same battle.

Amal also says Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator seized when his
plane was shot down in October 1986, was sold to Iran's Revolutionary
Guards and was believed alive in Teheran.  It said a former Amal
official sold Arad for $500,000.

Another Lebanese Shi'ite militia, Hezbollah, says it has two
Israelis but did not make clear whether they are alive.  These two are
believed to be Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, who were captured Feb.
17, 1986, during an ambush of an Israeli patrol in south Lebanon.

The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine has said it
has the body of Israeli Druse Sgt.  Samir Assad, who was captured near
Sidon in April 1983.  It says Assad was killed in a 1984 Israeli air
raid on Rabbit Island off the Lebanese coast.

        IDF KIDNAPS SHI'ITE LEADER DIRANI IN LEBANON.
'BELIEVERS RESISTANCE' HEAD HELD RON ARAD FROM 1986 TO 1988.


MUSTAFA Dirani, the head of a Hizbullah-affiliated group which
held missing air force navigator Ron Arad from 1986 to 1988, was
snatched by helicopter-borne IDF commandos from his home in Lebanon's
Bek'a Valley early yesterday morning.

Dirani heads the "Believers' Resistance," an organization linked
to Hizbullah.  He is being interrogated in an undisclosed location.
According to OC Military Intelligence Maj.  -Gen.  Uri Saguy, Dirani
has "already provided some answers to questions we asked for a long
time."

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated the operation grew out of
frustration that Syrian President Hafez Assad had spurned US President
Bill Clinton's appeal earlier this year to help determine the fate of
the missing Israeli solders.

Hizbullah vowed yesterday to step up actions against Israel in
response to Dirani's kidnapping.

"The enemy has resorted to the option of expanding the scope of
confrontation," the head of Hizbullah's politburo, Hussein Khalil,
told news agencies.  "This will put it [Israel] in a huge predicament
in the future because the resistance in return will respond  ...  in a
way that adopts expanding the scope of fighting."

Chief of General Staff Lt.  -Gen.  Ehud Barak told military
correspondents the operation was "meticulously planned, making full
and effective use of the element of surprise, and was executed
impeccably, with the highest professional standards conceivable."

Barak revealed that one soldier was slightly wounded in the hip
by shrapnel, when shots were fired from the adjacent home, belonging
to Dirani's brother.

At approximately 2 a.m., an IDF force entered the village of
Kasarnaba in the Syrian-controlled Bek'a Valley.  "The terrain is
hilly, tough, and the village itself is at the bottom of a very steep
hillside.  That made both the landing and advance extremely
difficult," Barak said.

The IDF unit was transported to the Bek'a in two CH-53
helicopters, which flew north along the Lebanese coast, then veered
east north of Beirut, and followed the Beirut-Damascus highway, along
the backbone of the central ridge of the Lebanese mountains.

The helicopters landed and discharged the ground force, which
advanced down the slope to the relatively large village of 5,000
residents.  Unconfirmed reports from Lebanon claim that the force used
4x4 vehicles.

"The force was in the area for several hours, but the actual
operation in the village lasted a few minutes," said Barak.  "We
ordered the force not to harm Dirani's family or any other civilians,
even when shot at."

The force then stormed the first-floor apartment and tied up
Dirani, his wife, and his brother.  Dirani's children, three boys and
two girls ages 2 to 11, were kept in another room.  One of Dirani's
sons told news agencies that the soldiers were in thhe house "for seven
minutes." Army sources confirmed that estimate.

Barak and Saguy both stressed that the force was ordered to
refrain from any contact with Syrian units deployed in the area.  The
village, which lies north of the old Riak airfield, is surrounded by
Syrian anti-aircraft batteries.  The two helicopters carried the force
and Dirani back to Israel, and were apparently shot at by Lebanese
anti-aircraft guns north of Beirut.

Barak said the operation serves as both "a contribution to
Israel's deterrent power and a moral debt we owe Ron Arad, about whose
whereabouts we may now learn some more."

Asked about the operation's timing, Barak revealed that in fact,
it was planned several months ago, but put off "because some
components necessary to insure success were missing."

Until 1988, Dirani, 46, headed the pro-Syrian Amal militia's
military arm, responsible for numerous operations against Israel and
the South Lebanese Army.  Dirani is believed to have held Arad since
he parachuted from his Phantom jet in October 1986.

In 1988, Dirani is believed to have "sold" Arad to the
Iranian-backed revolutionary guards for $300,000.  Since then, Arad's
whereabouts remain unknown, although Israel has indications that he
was alive well after 1988.

Saguy said that between 1986 and 1988, Dirani negotiated the
release of Arad, but when he broke with Amal's head, Nabih Berri, and
formed his own group, affiliated with Hizbullah, negotiations broke
down, and Arad was eventually handed over to the revolutionary guards.

The kidnapping of Dirani was almost a carbon copy of the
abduction of Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid in south Lebanon in July 1989,
though Obeid was taken to be used as a bargaining chip in the return
of the MIAs, and Barak denied that Dirani was taken for this purpose.
Obeid is still being held.

In February 1992, Israel also assassinated Hizbullah operations
leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi, when helicopter gunships ambushed his
motorcade in south Lebanon.  "This is a continuous and unrelenting war
against terrorism.  Any vacillation will result in paralysysis said
Barak.

"One of the lessons of Obeid's kidnapping is that we still lacked
vital intelligence data.  The primary purpose of getting Dirani was to
enhance our intelligence-gathering capability.  In this sense, we
already achieved partial success, although it will take time to
interrogate him and study the documents we found in his home," Saguy
said.  .

But the two previous operations also precipitated a violent
response from Hizbullah, which included Katyusha rocket barrages on
northern Israel.

"I expect Dirani's organization to respond, but I don't think
this will trigger a response from Hizbullah," said Barak.

On Friday, IDF helicopter gunships strafed Arab gunmen who had
attacked the security zone, Lebanese security sources told news
agencies.

The sources said unidentified gunmen raked four positions manned
by the South Lebanese Army with rocket-propelled grenade and automatic
rifle fire.

The attacks on the security zone provoked a four-hour clash with
SLA militiamen and Israeli soldiers.

The sources said the Israeli helicopters fired at least 10
rockets at the attackers.

        RED CROSS SAYS IT HASN'T HEARD ARAD IS ALIVE


TEL AVIV - A Red Cross spokesman here said yesterday that his
organization had received no information indicating Israeli airman Ron
Arad is alive.

The announcement contradicts the comment by "an official Lebanese
source" to a news agency in Beirut saying Arad is alive, and that the
Red Cross had been informed of this.

          Hizbullah.  Roger Auque.

        LUBRANI MET HIZBULLAH IN 1989, FRENCH NEWSPAPER CONFIRMS


PARIS - A French newspaper today confirms an earlier report that
Israel's government coordinator for activities in Lebanon Uri Lubrani
met a high official of Hizbullah in France in 1989.

The French weekly, Le Journal du Dimanche, writes about the first
encounter between the two, confirming report in The Jerusalem Post
last week.

According to the French weekly, French journalist and former
hostage in Lebanon Roger Auque was vacationing in Saint-Tropez, a
resort on the French Riviera, in the summer of 1989.

Auque was sitting on the terrace of a cafe with two friends - a
Lebanese businessman and a Palestinian - when he was approached by an
Israeli who introduced himself as a member of Israel's Defense
Ministry.  After chatting over drinks, the four went for a short ride
on a speed boat, laughing at the uncommon situation.

Auque met again with his new Israeli friend, this time in
September 1989 in Israel.  The Israeli officer told him then that Uri
Lubrani wanted to see him.

Lubrani already knew that Auque's friend, the Lebanese
businessman, had good connections with the Hizbullah, according to the
report.  Lubrani asked Auque to arrange a meeting for him with the
businessman.

In December 1989, Lubrani flew to Paris and met Auque's Lebanese
friend at a dinner organized by Auque.  Lubrani told the Lebanese
businessman that he was ready to meet with representatives of
Hizbullah, provided the Iran-supported group sent proof that it was
holding Israeli hostages.

A few weeks later, a photo of Israel Air Force navigator Ron
Arad, captured in Lebanon in 1986, reached Israel.  Obviously, the
connection was the right one.  But the negotiations dragged on before
the meetings, held last May and June in France, between Israelis and
the Hizbullah, under the auspices of former French ambassador to
Beirut Rene Ala.

Apparently, the negotiations stopped, because Hizbullah did not
come up with tangible proof that the Israelis missing in action were
still alive and detained by groups which Hizbullah could influence.

        ARAD BEING HELD BY IRANIAN RADICAL GROUP - 'SUNDAY TIMES'


LONDON - Hostage release negotiations are stuck over the case of
IAF navigator Ron Arad, according to the Sunday Times.

The paper reported that Arad, shot down over Lebanon in 1986, is
being held in the Bekaa Valley by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and
not by the Beirut kidnapers thought to be holding the remaining six
Israeli PoWs and MiAs and other Western hostages.

The Sunday Times said Israeli intelligence fears Iran will not
want to admit it holds a hostage directly and that, as a result, no
deal involving Arad will be possible.  It is thought Arad was handed
to the Iranians during a split in the pro-Syrian faction that
originally captured him.

Israel is reportedly hoping that the Revolutionary Guards - who
were sent to Lebanon to fight against Israel in the 1982 war - will
turn Arad over to Hizbullah, the pro-Iranian group wihich is holding
most of the hostages.  That way he could become part of the exchange
deal that Uri Lubrani is thought to have been negotiating in Geneva
last week with UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

Any more hostage releases are unlikely for at least another few
weeks, as the "real business" of dealing has only just begun,
according to the paper.

        ISRAELI HOSTAGES' FAMILIES KEEPING HOPE IN CHECK


The families of seven Israeli servicemen captured or missing in
Lebanon have a fresh sliver of hope for their release, but that
optimism is guarded.

British journalist John McCarthy was freed by the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad on Thursday after five years of captivity in Lebanon,
and an American hostage is reportedly to be released this week.

"We have had enough disappointments.  We have to be realistic,"
Uri Lubrani, government coordinator for Lebanese affairs, said on
Israel Television on Friday night.  I want to see our soldiers freed,
and as long as this does not happen we will have to be tense and
expectant."

"We don't allow ourselves to be carried away by newspaper
headlines," said Merton Fink, the father of captured soldier Yosef
Fink.  Nothing has been heard from the younger Fink or fellow Givati
Brigade member Rahamim Alsheikh since their capture in February 1986.

"We believe that our boy is alive, but until we have something
concrete, until we have proof, we won't allow ourselves to be carried
away," Fink said in a telephone interview.  "If we did, we'd end up in
an asylum."

Fink was not sure what to make of the events surrounding
McCarthy's release.  "We hope that it will be the beginning of a
process which will include the Israelis," he said.  "We're just taking
it day by day."

"There's always hope," said Pnina Feldman, the mother of Staff
Sgt.  Zvi Feldman who, with Sgt.  Zacharia Baumel and Cpl.  Yehuda
Katz, was reported missing in action in the early stages of the war in
Lebanon.  The three Israelis had been engaged in a tank battle with a
Syrian armoured unit in the Beka'a Valley.

Feldman is encouraged by the fact that nothing was heard of
McCarthy for some time before it became known that he had been taken
hostage.  "As a mother, I wish that maybe this time the Hizbullah will
keep its word  ...  but I won't be jumping for joy until I see [Zvi]
on Israeli soil.  Perhaps, at last, things will turn out well."

Whenever a hostage is allowed to leave Lebanon, the families of
remaining hostages are put under intense emotional and psychological
stress.  They are subjected to a barrage of phone calls day and night
from all over the world, mostly from the news media, pressuring them
with the same old questions, seeking to add another dimension to a
story with an endlessly elusive final chapter.

"It's bothersome, but we're used to it," said Baumel's father,
Yona.  Like the other parents, he is not on the verge of euphoria.
"The ball is still in the Arab court." Even if the the message carried
by McCarthy to UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar does
advance negotiations for the release of all the hostages, Baumel
predicted that it would be a long and painful process.

The Hizbullah, he noted, was playing true to form, by indicating
that someone else would soon be released.  "It's part of their
psychological warfare program."

Baumel and his wife have not always agreed with government policy
on measures to secure the freedom of the missing Israeli servicemen.
"They've made some terrible mistakes," he said, "but today we see eye
to eye with the government.  Our contention is that they're doing more
than any other country would."

If Baumel and the other parents have from time to time, been
angry and impatient with the government, they have been more upset by
new reporting about their situation.

Fink said he was annoyed by some things he had read in Friday's
Hebrew newspapers.

Baumel cited a Sky Channel report Thursday saying the only
missing Israeli thought to be alive was Israel Air Force navigator Ron
Arad, who ejected over southern Lebanon in October 1986.

"I think I can say that the report is patently false," said
Baumel, who has never faltered in his faith that his son is alive.  He
has eyewitness evidence to make that belief more than just wishful
thinking.

        THREAT TO KILL KIDNAPED FRENCHMAN COULD BLOCK RELEASE OF U.S.
HOSTAGE


United Nations and U.S. officials were hopeful yesterday that
pro-Iranian Lebanese kidnapers holding two U.S. hostages would release
one in the next two or three days.

UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said his envoy in
the region had confirmed a statement released to a news agency
yesterday that a group holding Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy
since 1986 would release one within 72 hours.

President George Bush said yesterday "there is an expectation"
that Lebanese kidnapers could free a second Western hostage soon and
the White House urged governments with influence on the captors to
work to free the hostages.

But the kidnapers of French aid worker Jerome Leyrand again
threatened to kill him to try to block the reported release.

Meanwhile Uri Lubrani, the government's coordinator of activities
in Lebanon, said last night negotiations to release the hostages are
stalled because of the kidnaped Frenchman.

Perez de Cuellar said he had spoken to UN envoy Giandomenico
Picco, who is in Lebanon, and that Picco had confirmed news reports of
an imminent release.

"I had confirmation that they have exactly the same information
that we have - that at least one will be released within three days,"
the UN chief said.  "After what I have heard, I am rather hopeful."

Perez de Cuellar was speaking to reporters in New York just
before leaving for Britain, where today he is to meet former hostage
John McCarthy.

McCarthy, who was freed by his Islamic Jihad captors on Thursday,
will deliver a sealed letter from them to the secretary-general.

The counter-claims appeared to escalate a growing fight among
Iranian-backed kidnap factions on whether to participate in a deal.

Senior military sources also said last night Israel would not bow
to British government pressure to release the Lebanese prisoners it
holds in order to facilitate the freeing of the western hostages in
Lebanon.

The sources reiterated Israel's position that it is only willing
to release the prisoners in a deal which would include the seven IDF
soldiers believed to be held as prisoners or missing in Lebanon.

Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab from Taibe, came back from
meetings with PLO officials in Geneva yesterday, saying he had
information concerning two of the missing soldiers.  He said that the
PLO is holding the body of First Sgt.  Samir Assad and has indications
that IAF navigator Ron Arad is alive and well.  There was no
independent confirmation of Tibi's claims.

The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organisation (RJO), which
holds two 60-year-old American hostages, said in a statement sent to
an international news agency yesterday it would release one within 72
hours.

"Generally speaking, we think there is an expectation" a hostage
could be freed, Bush said, speaking from his holiday home at
Kennebunkport, Maine, adding that the United States wants to "run down
every lead we can, but not raise the hopes of the hostage families".

A White House statement, issued earlier by presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, stressed that the administration had no direct
information from the captors on any pending release.

"We reiterate that now is the time for all hostages and others
held outside of the legal system in the region to be released
immediately, unconditionally and safely for humanitarian reasons,"
Fitzwater's statement said.  "We call on all governments with
influence to make this happen," said the statement.

Fitzwater said a U.S. medical team remained on standby at a U.S.
base in Wiesbaden, Germany, in case any Americans were released.
Previous freed U.S. hostages have been taken there.

Hours after McCarthy was freed, a rival Lebanese group that is
opposed to freeing the hostages seized Frenchman Jerome Leyraud.

The group, calling itself the Organisation for Defending
Prisoners' and Hostages' Rights, said it would kill Leyraud if any
other captives were released.

With Leyraud, Lebanese extremist groups are now holding 12
Western hostages as part of their attempts to put pressure on
governments to persuade Israel to free hundreds of Arab prisoners.

The remaining Western hostages in Lebanon include six Americans,
two Britons, two Germans, and an Italian.  One of them, U.S.
journalist Terry Anderson, has been held for more than six years.

Britain on Friday publicly urged Israel to release some of the
more than 300 mostly Shi'ite prisoners held by Israel and its allies
in south Lebanon.

British Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg on Friday summoned
Israeli Ambassador Yoav Biran to press Israel to secure the release of
Arabs prisoners and a kidnaped sheik held by Israeli allies in south
Lebanon, officials said.

The RJO stressed that a final settlement to the ordeal of Western
hostages hinged on the release of prisoners held by Israel and its
allies, notably Sheik Abdel-Karim Obeid, a Shi'ite Muslim activist
kidnaped by Israel in 1989.

Statements released last month demanded their freedom, but no
deal has ever been mentioned.

The stance taken repeatedly by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
Hezbollah's main cleric in Lebanon, as well as the governments of Iran
and Syria who helped spring hostages in the past, is that they want
the hostage file closed.

Fadlallah met with Iran's hardline interior minister, Abdollah
Nouri, in Damascus on Saturday.  Nouri is a key figure in the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards who maintain camps in Lebanon and are the main
link between Iran and the hostage takers.

The abduction of Leyraud, a 26-year-old relief worker with the
Paris-based Medecins du Monde or Doctors of the World, has angered and
embarrassed Syria, which is largely responsible for security in the
city.

Lebanese riot policemen backed by Syrian troops started a series
of quiet house raids in Beirut to locate Leyraud.

"We've raided at least a dozen suspected hideouts.  The outcome
is encouraging," the operation's commander, Lebanese police Maj.
Mohammed Qassem, told The Associated Press.  He would give no details.

The state-run national news agency said security forces were
"expected to secure Leyraud's release in 48 hours." It did not
elaborate.

Longest held is American journalist Terry Anderson, 43, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.  He was kidnaped
March 16, 1985.

Anderson's sister said yesterday that Israeli willingness to free
Obeid could trigger the release of all the captured Westerners.

"Right now if Israel took that leap of faith and released perhaps
Sheikh Obeid, that would be the catalyst that would allow everything
else to fall into place," Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, told
reporters.

        ISRAEL WELCOMES RELEASE, HOPES FOR FURTHER EXCHANGE


Israel yesterday welcomed the release of British hostage John
McCarthy and expressed its willingness to participate in a prisoner
exchange provided Israelis believed held in Lebanon were included.

Danny Naveh, media adviser to Defense Minister Moshe Arens,
issued a statement saying that Israel welcomed McCarthy's release and
extended warm wishes to him and his family.

The government wanted to see, it said, the release of more
hostages and the beginning of a process that would speedily lead to
the release of all prisoners and hostages held by various factions in
Lebanon.

The statement said the government would continue to make every
effort to bring about the release of all the hostages, including
Israeli servicemen believed to be held as prisoners or missing in
Lebanon.

Naveh reiterated previous calls to the organizations believed to
be holding the IDF soldiers to allow the Red Cross to visit them, or
to provide proof they are alive.

In such circumstances, Israel would be willing to conduct
negotiations for the release of Lebanese detained by Israel in
exchange for the hostages, prisoners and those missing in Lebanon.

There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that the note given to
McCarthy by his kidnappers, the Islamic Jihad, to pass to UN
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, contained a message
relating to IAF navigator Ron Arad.

Arad was captured by the Shi'ite organization Amal after ejecting
from his plane over south Lebanon in October 1986, but was later
handed over to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Lebanon.  Apart from
documents and photographs sent to Arad's family at the time he was in
Amal's hands, nothing has been heard of him.

A few months earlier, in February 1986, the pro-Iranian Hizbullah
fundamentalists kidnapped Givati Brigade soldiers Yosef Fink and
Rahamim Alsheikh inside the security zone in south Lebanon.  Nothing
has been heard of their fate since.

The four other IDF soldiers missing in Lebanon are First Sgt.
Zvi Feldman, Sgt.  Zacharia Baumel and Cpl.  Yehuda Katz.  They went
missing after a tank battle with a Syrian armored unit in Lebanon's
Beka'a Valley in the early days of the Lebanon War.

They were subsequently reported to have been taken by the
pro-Syrian Saika Palestinian organization.  Israel has said it holds
Syria responsible for the safety and well being of the three.

The seventh missing soldier, Druse Sgt.  Samir Assad, was
kidnapped by Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine in the Sidon area in April 1983.  The organization reported
that Assad had been killed in an IAF raid on Rabbit Island near
Tripoli the following year.  Officials here, however, maintained they
had information that Assad was not killed in the raid.

Baumel's father Yona told Israel Radio yesterday that he believed
his son was still alive and well after nine years in captivity.

Yona Baumel, who also holds an American passport, revealed that
he had traveled extensively in Arab countries and had received
information about his son, including from somebody who had seen and
spoken with him.

Baumel said he had implicit faith in the government and its
handling of the prisoner situation.

He maintained that families who, in previous prisoner exchange
deals, had pressed the government to pay any price to secure the
release of their sons had damaged Israel's interests.  "We have tried
to be responsible and will continue to act responsibly, and we won't
put pressure on the government publicly do do anything unacceptable,"
Baumel said.

Government coordinator on Lebanon Uri Lubrani expressed cautious
optimism yesterday, while warning against building up too much hope.
"I have learned to see what I see and not raise my level of
expectation too much," he told The Jerusalem Post.

Lubrani, who was also interviewed on Israel and Army radio, said
that "unfortunately" there was no indication at this stage that the
Hizbullah was ready to release Israeli servicemen.

Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that the release of McCarthy
heralded the start of a process that would terminate in the release of
all the hostages and prisoners held and missing in Lebanon.

Lubrani stressed that Israel would want to contribute to any such
release, but only if it included the freeing of the missing Israeli
servicemen.

Lubrani said the release of McCarthy seemed to indicate that
Hizbullah and its Iranian mentors had come to the realization that the
holding of hostages and prisoners of war was no longer and asset but a
liability.

(Box) Wife renews hope

The wife of IAF navigator Ron Arad, captured by Lebanese
militiamen four years ago, said moves on Western hostages gave her "a
good feeling, hope for a prisoner exchange."

"I hope our story will finish soon," Tami Arad said yesterday on
the Mabat TV news.  She has heard nothing from him except for one
letter and photo, but she is sure he is alive.

She appealed to Arad's captors to "allow the Red Cross to meet
you and take a letter and photo from him, so his daughter, who doesn't
know him at all, can see what he looks like."

          Jihad.  Islam.  Israel.  Missing Person.

        OFFICIALS DUBIOUS OVER PRISONER EXCHANGE BID


A militant Palestinian group of Moslem fundamentalists yesterday
offered to help arrange an exchange of Israeli prisoners for
Palestinians and Lebanese, but the Defense Ministry in Jerusalem said
the offer was vague and dubious.

"The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine expresses its
willingness to facilitate the process of exchanging Israeli prisoners
held by the Islamic resistance in return for the release of
Palestinian and Lebanese mujahideen held in Israeli jails," the
organisation said.

The group, in a statement handed to an international news agency
in Amman, said it could also help arrange for the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Israeli prisoners in
Lebanon.

But Israel must first set free four Moslem leaders and give a
public commitment that it would release all the other Arab detainees,
it said in the one-page statement signed by spokesman Fathi
al-Shuqaqi.

The Defense Ministry spokesman here said in a statement: "The
announcement made by the body called Islamic Jihad is vague.

"[It] does not clarify the identity of the Israeli captives in
question and we have no proof which lends truth to the claim of the
organization that it holds, or that an element called the Islamic
Opposition holds, Israeli captives."

"This is an attempt to try and extract some questionable benefit
by taking advantage of this painful humanitarian problem," the
statement said.

But it added that Israel would consider "any proposal or demand
for the release of prisoners" if it was given proof that its captives
were alive and "in the hands of those elements raising proposals."

The four "Moslem leaders" cited in Islamic Jihad's statement are
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Moslem fundamentalist movement
Hamas; Nidal Zaloum, sentenced for stabbing dead two elderly Israelis
in Jerusalem; Abdel-Hadi Ghneim, who killed 14 people in 1989 by
forcing Bus 405 off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road; and Eitaf Uleyyan.

The group said it was making its offer "after coordination and
consultation with our brothers in the Lebanese Islamic resistance
movement".

But it did not spell out what it could do to help secure the
release of the Israelis or say how many Arab prisoners it wanted the
Israeli authorities to set free.

The Hizbullah, and its affiliated groups, is believed to be
holding Yosef Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, who were both kidnapped by
Islamic fundamentalists near Beit Yahoun in February 1986.

Navigator Ron Arad was captured originally by the Shi'ite Amal
organization after ejecting form his plane over Lebanon in October
1986.  He was later reported to have been handed over to Iranian
Revolutionary Guard by Mustafa Durani, who defected from Amal.

Apart from documents and photographs sent to Arad's family,
nothing has been heard of him.

The four other IDF men missing in Lebanon are First Sergeant Zvi
Feldman, Sergeant Zechariah Boumel, and Corporal Yehuda Katz who went
missing after the Sultan Yacoub tank battle with a Syrian armoured
unit in Lebanon's Beka valley in the early days of the Lebanese war.

They were subsdequently reported to have been captured by a
pro-Syrian Palestinian organization Esaika organization.  Israel has
said it holds Syria responsible for the safety and well-being of these
three missing soldiers.

The other missing soldier, Druse Sergeant Samir Assad, was
kidnapped by Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine in the Sidon area in April 1983.

The organiztion later reported he had been killed in an Israeli
air raid on Rabbit Island near Tripoli the following year.  But
officials here maintain they have official information that Assad was
not killed in that raid.

The Defense Ministry statement here, "using this opportunity,"
expressed satisfaction that "an SLA company commander held by Mustafa
Sa'ad, head of the Nasserist organization in Sidon, was freed released
in exchange for two terrorists who were detained in Al-Hiram prison.

"In this case," it added, "a humanitarian approach and common
sense were victorious.  "

        PRISONER DEAL SAID SUNK BY LEAKS


A prisoner exchange planned for last week was called off because
of leaks to the press, according to news agency reports, quoting Red
Cross officials in Geneva.

A Red Cross source was quoted as saying that it appeared to have
been a major operation that would have involved foreign hostages,
believed to be held by Shi'ite extremists affiliated to the Hizbullah,
IDF servicemen missing in Lebanon, and prisoners and detainees held by
Israel.

According to the reports, the planned exchange had been agreed in
secret talks in which representatives from Israel, Iran, the U.S. and
the Soviet Union participated.

There have been several signs in the past month that a "package
deal" might be in the offing, despite the complexities of the
situation.

The first indication occurred at the end of last month when
Sheikh Abbas Musawi, newly-elected leader of the pro-Iranian
Hizbullah, offered to exchange Israelis held by his organization in
return for Lebanese held by Israel.

He later clarified the terms, saying the Hizbullah also expected
Israel to free Palestinian prisoners, as well as Lebanese.

Meanwhile the Hizbullah's mentor, Iran, has reiterated its
willingness to act as a "mediator" to facilitate an exchange of
prisoners.

Iran is anxious to re-establish ties with western countries, and
to seek the release of billions of dollars worth of assets which have
been frozen by the U.S., pending a soltuion to the hostage crisis.

Recently, a number of large U.S. companies were given government
approval to purchase Iranian oil, a sign that the freeze might be
coming to an end.

The Hizullah and its affiliated groups are believed to be holding
12 foreign hostages in Lebanon: six Americans, three Britons, two
Germans and an Italian.  Seven Israeli soldiers are missing in Lebanon
or believed to be held as prisoners.  Three went missing during the
Sultan Ya'acub tank battle with Syrian troops in the early days of the
Lebanon War.  A year later, in 1983, Druse soldier Samir Assad was
captured in Lebanon by members of Naif Hawatmeh's Palestinian terror
group.

Two Givati brigade soldiers were captured by Hizbullah terrorist
in an ambush inside the security zone in south Lebanon in February
1986.  The seventh missing Israeli, IAF navigator Ron Arad, was
captured by members of the Amal Shi'ite movement after ejecting from
his plane over Lebanon.  He was later reportedly handed over to
members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who work with the
Hizbullah in Lebanon.

With the exception of photographs and documents sent to the
family of Arad, nothing has been heard officially about the other
Israelis since they went missing, despite repeated requests by Israel
and international bodies to allow visits by Red Cross representatives.

In the meantime, the Hizbullah itself is being put under pressure
from the families of Shi'ites detained by Israel, including regional
Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, who was snatched from his
south Lebanese home by IDF paratroopers in July 1989.

Israel has offered to allow the Red Cross to visit Obeid if,
simultaneously, reciprocal visits were made by members of the
international organization to Israeli servicemen believed held by the
Hizbullah.

Significantly, no detainees were released from the El Khiyam jail
inside the security zone in south Lebanon this year, unlike "goodwill
gestures" in previous years to mark the Moslem Id al-Adha festival.

Bradley Burston adds:

Military sources refused to comment directly on the report,
stating that they had "heard of no such offers" of an imminent
prisoner exchange or release.

          Visit.  Hizbullah.  Abdel Karim Obeid.  Lebanon.

        VISITS MUST BE RECIPROCAL - OBEID AND IDF SOLDIERS


Israel would allow Red Cross representatives to visit captured
regional Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid if, simultaneously,
reciprocal visits were made by members of the international
organization to Israeli servicemen believed to be held by the
Hizbullah and other groups in Lebanon, The Jerusalem Post has learned.

Government officials have made it clear - in response to recent
offers by the Hizbullah to swap the Israeli servicemen for Lebanese
and Palestinians held by Israel - that Israel wants proof and "signs
of life" from the Israeli prisoners.

Only then would Israel be willing to negotiate the release of
Lebanese detainees, including Obeid, who was snatched by IDF
paratroopers from his home in Jibshit village in South Lebanon in July
1989.

Israel has repeatedly called for Red Cross officials to be
allowed to visit the servicemen.

Of the seven Israelis missing in Lebanon, two, Yossi Fink and
Rahamim Alsheikh, who were kidnapped near Beit Yahoun in South Lebanon
in 1986, are believed to be held by the Hizbullah.

Navigator Ron Arad was captured by the Amal Shi'ite movement
later the same year after ejecting from his plane over Lebanon.  He
was taken by former Amal security chief Mustafa Dirani, who
subsequently defected from Amal and reportedly transferred Arad,
apparently in good health, to members of the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard, a group controlled by Iran, in Lebanon.

Three other soldiers, Zacharia Baumel, Yehuda Katz and Zvi
Feldman, have been missing since the June 1982 tank battle with Syrian
forces in the Sultan Ya'acub region of eastern Lebanon.  A year later,
Druse soldier Samir Assad was kidnapped in Lebanon by members of Naif
Hawatmeh's Palestinian terror group.

With the exception of letters and photographs sent to the family
of Arad, nothing has been heard, officially, about the fate of the
other soldiers since they were missing.

Government sources have announced in the past that visits by the
Red Cross to Israelis believed to be held as prisoners in Lebanon
would be reciprocated.  The policy, laid down by former defense
minister Yitzhak Rabin, has apparently not changed in this respect.

The Hizbullah, for its part, is demanding the release of around
400 Lebanese and Palestinians held by Israel in exchange for the
Israelis it is holding.

        HIZBULLAH ADMITS HOLDING IDF MEN, CLARIFIES SWAP TERMS


New Hizbullah leader Abbas Musawi confirmed yesterday for the
first time in three years that his group is holding two IDF servicemen
as prisoners.

In an interview broadcast on the leftist Voice of the People
radio station, Musawi said "We have two Israeli prisoners and a few
soldiers of [South Lebanese Army commander Gen. Antoine] Lahad's
force."

Musawi also clarified his terms for a possible prisoner exchange,
saying that the Hizbullah wanted to secure the release of all the
captives held by Israel and Lahad.

The Lebanese press said that Musawi was not satisfied with the
public response from Israel so far that it would be willing to
negotiate the release of Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the
freedom of Israelis held by the Hizbullah.

Musawi was quoted as saying that this response did not meet the
Hizbullah's conditions, which included the release of Palestinians as
well as Lebanese prisoners.

Musawi also intimated that foreign hostages believed held by
groups affiliated or directly allied to his pro-Iranian organization
would not necessarily be included in any deal with Israel.

Musawi did not give the names or ranks of the Israeli servicemen
held captive, but they were believed to be Yossi Fink and Rahamim
Alsheikh, who were captured on February 17, 1986, in a terrorist
ambush in the security zone.

A third missing serviceman, Air Force navigator Ron Arad, was
captured after his jet was shot down in Lebanon the same year, but he
is believed held by another Shi'ite faction.

The last time Hizbullah publicly mentioned two missing Israeli
servicemen was in a communique in February 1988.

There has been speculation that if a swap of Israeli prisoners
could be worked out with Lebanese Shi'ite groups, it would clear the
way for release of 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.

Musawi, in his radio interview, suggested that efforts to arrange
a deal with Israel were not going well and repeated the traditional
Hizbullah line that the group has no control over the Westerners.

The 13 Westerners include six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans and an Italian.  The longest held is American journalist Terry
Anderson, who was kidnapped in West Beirut on March 16, 1985.

Israeli officials have stated that Israel would only enter
negotiations once it received "signs of life" or other proofs about
the prisoners held by the Hizbullah.

Until last week, the fundamentalist organization had not even
admitted publicly that it was holding any Israelis.  It has not
allowed visits to them by any outside organizations, not even the Red
Cross.

Israel television quoted senior military sources last night as
denying an American newspaper report that Israel and the Hizbullah had
already started negotiations over a prisoner swop.

          Kidnapping.  Mustafa Dirani.

        PERES: WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN RON ARAD


FOREIGN Minister Shimon Peres said the operation in Lebanon
yesterday proved that Israel was intent on securing the release of
navigator Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over a Syrian-controlled
area in Lebanon.

"First of all, we will hear who he [Dirani] gave Ron to, because
it is clear he held Ron for a long period," Peres told Army Radio.
"Our problem is how to reach an address.  Where is he, in whose hands
is he?  This is one of the road signs that lead to this address.

Peres said the operation "shows that we don't forget for a moment
the issue of the fate of Ron Arad in all meanings.  There is hardly
one outside diplomatic meeting in which we don't raise this issue
directly or indirectly.

"I think the IDF deserves all congratulations for a very daring
and exact operation that took out one of the most dangerous people
from the place from which he initiated many operations," he added.

Ministers and MKs from across the political spectrum also
expressed approval for the operation.  Environment Minister Yossi
Sarid called the kidnapping "another link in the chain of supreme
efforts to free Ron Arad from captivity and learn the fate of the
other MiAs."

Ephraim Sneh (Labor) told Israel Radio: "I hope that this
splendid, wonderful, meticulous operation would try to bring Ron Arad
to his family.

MK Michael Eitan (Likud), said the successful operation proved
that when the IDF is given the right orders, it can carry out daring
feats.  "The tragedy of the Jewish people is that this government's
policy usually ties the IDF's hands in its battle against Arab
terror," he said.

Batya Arad, the mother of the missing airman, said, "The Arad
family welcomes the operation, and we're very happy that all the
Israeli soldiers returned safely.  We are waiting for the results."

The action was also applauded by the International Coalition for
Missing Israeli Soldiers, a non-profit organization that works in
conjunction with the families of the MiAS.

        ISRAEL SET TO AID HOSTAGES' RELEASE IF POWS INCLUDED


The government is prepared to contribute to the release of
Western hostages in Lebanon if IDF PoWs are among those released, the
Defense Ministry announced last night.

Responding to media pressure on Israel to take some action to aid
the Western hostages' release, Defense Ministry spokesman Danny Naveh
said that the government has in the past expressed its willingness to
help with their release and has even made gestures towards that end on
the condition that Israeli PoWs and MIAs be included among the
released.

Israel has seven PoWs and MIAs in Lebanon, including Ron Arad who
is in Iranian hands and Yosef Fink and Rahamim Levi Alshech who are
being held by the Iranian-sponsored Hizbullah.

"The Israelis' captors refuse to act according to elementary
rules of human behavior and the international conventions requiring
that information about them and proof that they are alive be provided
and that the captors give the Red Cross access to them," Naveh said.
"Israel repeats its call to all those elements holding its prisoners
and Western hostages to allow the Red Cross access to them and to
enter negotiations to bring about their immediate release.  In this
framework, Israel will be ready to negotiate the release of Lebanese
detainees being held in Israel."

        ISRAEL SHOULD FREE ARABS FOR HOSTAGES, SAYS HIZBULLAH


A Lebanese fundamentalist leader has said that Western hostages
would be freed if Israel released all Arabs it has captured in
Lebanon.

"What is required is a general pardon on all Lebanese and
Palestinian prisoners captured by Israel on Lebanese soil," Hussein
Musawi, a leader of Hizbullah, said in a speech late on Wednesday in
the eastern town of Mashgara.

The South Lebanese Army - together with Israel, according to some
reports - is said to be holding hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians
from Lebanon prisoner.  In July 1989, Israeli snatched Hizbullah
leader Shekh Abdel Karim Obeid from his base in South Lebanon and
transported him to an Israeli prison.  Obeid has featured prominently
in reports of possible tradeoffs involving the Hizbullah and Israel.

Israel has reportedly indicated willingness to trade prisoners
for captives, but wants at least three missing Israel servicemen
included in any deal: Nahal soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahmin Alsheikh as
well as IAF navigator Ron Arad, who have been held since 1986.  Arad
is reportedly in the hands of Amal, a rival Shi'ite group.  At least
four other Israeli servicemen have been mentioned in reports as being
held in Lebanon.

        TALK OF DEAL ON HOSTAGES AS BUSH AIDE ENDS SECRET VISIT TO ME


WASHINGTON - A quick secret visit to the Middle East by President
Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has led to
speculation that his mission concerned not only the post-war situation
in Iraq, but also a possible deal for the release of Western hostages
held by Moslem terrorists.

In announcing the trip on Friday, White House spokesman Bill
Harlow declined to say where Scowcroft had been, with whom he had
talked or what he had talked about, how long he had been gone or when
he returned.  He did confirm that Scowcroft was back.  The White House
comment came after CBS News broke the story early Friday.

"At the president's request, Scowcroft made a trip to the Middle
East for discussions on the situation," Harlow's statement said.  He
was accompanied by the National Security Council's top Middle East
specialist, Richard Haass.

Scowcroft arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday and returned to
Washington on Thursday night, according to one official.

The trip took place at a time of growing uncertainty over the
future of Iraq and U.S. policy toward that country.

But Iraq is not the only topic of concern.  The Iranians are
signalling that they want closer relations with the U.S., and they
know that a sine qua non for a thaw with Washington is release of the
remaining hostages held by the pro-Iranian Hizbullah in Lebanon.

There are 13 western hostages still believed held in Beirut, of
whom six are Americans.

CBS reported that a deal to free the hostages would be based on
the payment of cash ransom, not political concessions.  The network
said the terrorists understand there will be no political deals.

The possibility of a deal to free the hostages has implications
for Israel.  Six Israelis are believed held in Lebanon.  All were
captured while serving there with the IDF.

They are Zacharia Baumel and Yosef Katz, captured during the
early days of Operation Peace for Galilee; Samir Assad, taken in
April, 1983 and believed held by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine; Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured in
February, 1986 and believed held by by Hizbullah; and IAF navigator
Ron Arad, shot down in October, 1986.

One key bargaining chip in Israel's hands is Shi'ite Sheikh Abdel
Karim Obeid, kidnapped from his village in southern Lebanon by an IDF
commando unit in July 1989.  Obeid is considered a central Hizbullah
leader with ties to numerous terror operations.  He has been held in
Israel since the commando raid.

In London, meanwhile, a committee of Arab journalists on Friday
called for the release of Associated Press correspondent Terry
Anderson, the longest-held of all the Western hostages, and British
television reporter John McCarthy.

The International Committee for the Defense of Journalists and
Correspondents, set up by the Federation of Arab News Agencies, said
the kidnapping and detention "goes against all human values and divine
teachings."

In a statement, they said the kidnappings hamper the objective
reporting of Arab and Islamic news.

Anderson, AP's chief Middle East correspondent, began his seventh
year in captivity last Saturday.  McCarthy was kidnapped on his way to
Beirut airport on April 17, 1986.

        ARENS: IRAN'S HINTS A GOOD OMEN FOR ISRAELI CAPTIVES


Iran's reported offer to help free six American hostages held by
Lebanese Shi'ites may be a good sign for Israeli captives too, Defense
Minister Moshe Arens said yesterday.

ABC news reported that Iran had notified Secretary of State James
Baker that any help from Teheran to free hostages would be tied to the
release of Shi'ite Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, whom an IDF commando unit
kidnapped in 1989 from his village in Southern Lebanon in July.

Obeid, considered a central Hizbullah leader with ties to
numerous terror operations, has been held in Israel since the commando
raid, and is seen as a potentially valuable "bargaining chip" in
dealings with captors of IDF soldiers in Lebanon.

Arens refrained from responding directly to the ABC report.

"We don't know to what extent the report is accurate," he said in
a broadcast interview.

"The subject of our missing (soldiers) is a subject of such
importance and such sensitivity that it doesn't pay to say anything
that might damage the process."

The missing IDF soldiers include Zaharia Baumel, Zvika Feldman,
and Yehuda Katz, all of whom disappeared during the first week of the
Lebanon War in June, 1982.

Samir Assad, a Druze IDF soldier, was reported missing near Sidon
in April, 1983, and is believed held by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.

Soldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink were apparently abducted
by Hizbullah in February, 1986.

The last to be captured was Ron Arad, an IAF navigator whose
Phantom was shot down in October, 1986.

"If there is even a hint in the report that Iran is prepared to
become involved in the process of freeing missing and captured
soldiers, this may be a good sign."

The kidnapping of Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid by IDF commandos on
July 29 1989 was denounced by the international community.

Washington was among those critics, suggesting that it could
endanger the lives of foreign hostages held in Lebanon.

Obeid, then aged 36, was snatched from his home in Jibchit
village, near Nabatiyeh township, some eight kilometers north of the
security zone.

He was educated and trained in Iran and had taken over religious
affairs in the village from Sheikh Ragheb Harb, assassinated in 1984.

IDF sources said at the time that Obeid had played a central role
in planning attacks against IDF and SLA targets in the security zone,
and in ordering Katyusha rocket attacks on Israel.

          Yosef Katz.

        PARENTS GET NEWS OF CAPTIVE SONS


As Secretary of State Baker and Syrian officials began talks in
Damascus yesterday, parents of Israeli soldiers held captive in
Lebanon disclosed that they had recently received evidence that their
sons were still alive.

Yona Baumel, father of Zacharia Baumel, captured in June, 1982,
said that some of the missing soldiers' families had received word a
month ago.

The information came from "private channels unavailable to the
IDF and the government," Baumel said in a broadcast interview.

Yosef Katz, father of Yehuda Katz, captured on the sixth day of
the war, revealed that he had received messages from three separate
sources regarding his son.

Zacharia Baumel disappeared in the first week of Operation Peace
for Galilee.  He was a member of a tank crew with Zvika Feldman, Hezi
Shai and Ariel Liberman.

Held by the Ahmed Jibril terror organization, Shai and two other
IDF soldiers, Yossi Groff and Nissim Salem, were returned in a May,
1985 exchange for 1,500 Arab security prisoners.  Liberman had been
released the year before.

Baumel praised the efforts of Prime Minister Shamir and Defense
Minister Moshe Arens on behalf of the prisoners.  "After 8 years, I
cannot be totally satisfied, but the government's efforts have been
over and above those that any other country would have made."

Katz, Baumel and other members of the missing soldiers' families
met with State Department officials to discuss U.S. efforts to mediate
the captives' release.

The other soldiers still missing are Samir Assad, who disappeared
near Sidon in April, 1983, and is believed held by the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi
Fink, by Hizbullah in February 1986; and IAF navigator Ron Arad, shot
down eight months later.

        ISRAEL KIDNAPPED TOP HIZBULLAH MAN BEFORE OBEID, SAYS UK PAPER


LONDON - Israel kidnapped a top-level Hizbullah official to
barter for the release of three Israeli servicemen in Lebanon before
launching the operation that led to the capture of Sheikh Abdel Karim
Obeid, the Observer weekly newspaper reported here yesterday.

The captured official, who is still being held in Israel, has
been named as Daud Qashfi, leader of the Believing Front, one of the
organizations operating under the Hizbullah umbrella.

Only when his capture evoked no reaction from Lebanon was the
decision taken to capture Obeid: "Judging from the outcry that
followed, Obeid's kidnapping was equivalent to hitting the
bull's-eye," noted the Observer.  According to the newspaper, Israeli
forces had also intended capturing a second man, Mustafa Dirani, when
they went after Qashfi.  However, Dirani, who is believed to have
personal custody of Ron Arad, the Israeli navigator shot down over
South Lebanon in 1986, managed to evade the Israeli snatch team.

When Arad was captured, Dirani was working in Beirut as
intelligence chief of the mainstream Shi'ite Amal movement.

Shortly afterwards, he defected to Hizbullah, taking Arad with
him.

        RABIN: FAMILIES OF MISSING MET PLO


Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin disclosed yesterday that he had
allowed the families of IDF soldiers listed as missing since the
Lebanon War to meet with PLO officials in an effort to learn of the
fate of the missing men.  In one instance, he said, family members
travelled to Tunis at government expense to meet with PLO officials.

Rabin, addressing students at Tel Aviv University, said there
were no "strictures" in the search for missing soldiers.

Israel, he said, has mobilized presidents, parliamentarians,
journalists and world public opinion in efforts to ascertain the fate
of its seven missing soldiers.  These efforts have been frustrated, he
said, because of the Arabs' policy of not allowing visits or providing
reliable information.

In the case of the three IDF soldiers missing since the June 1982
tank battle against the Syrians near Sultan Ya'acoub - Yehuda Katz,
Zacharia Baumel and Zvi Feldman - Rabin said he had given his
permission to the families to meet with PLO officials and anyone else
in order to obtain information on the men.

Israel television reported last night that it was the relatives
of Baumel who went twice to Tunis last January and met there with
Yasser Abed Rabbo and other PLO officials.

Rabin said it appeared that kidnapped soldier Samir Assad was
killed by his captors, as has been repeatedly claimed by sources in
Lebanon.  Defence officials disclosed yesterday that they believe IAF
navigator Ron Arad is being held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards
inside Lebanon.

Asked to comment on the recent reopening of the annual debate
over the defence budget, Rabin warned that further budget cuts would
result in more firings from defence industries, and criticized those
who publicized figures "which had no bearing on reality."

He put the current defence budget at NIS 10.5 billion, of which
NIS 3.6 b. is supplied by the U.S.

Menachem Shalev adds: Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin's statement
yesterday on contacts between the families of missing soldiers and the
PLO appeared to give the organization another bit of legitimacy, but
most officials were confident last night that the public would
differentiate between the humanitarian and political aspects of the
matter.

Rabin's statement, coming at this delicate diplomatic and
political juncture, is bound to be utilized by those advocating
negotiations with the PLO, the officials said.  But they did not
believe that it would have any immediate diplomatic or political
impact.

Sources close to Rabin pointed out that his mention of the PLO
came in the context of wide-ranging efforts to secure the release of
prisoners and learn the whereabouts of missing soldiers; immediately
following this reply, they noted, Rabin attacked the organization with
ferocity, reiterating that Israel would never negotiate with the PLO.

A Foreign Ministry source said that Rabin's statement was poorly
timed against the background of Jerusalem's stated diplomatic
offensive against talks with the PLO.  A supporter of negotiations
with the PLO said: "It's another brick in the building.  It's not the
arrival of the Messiah.  "

        IRANIAN GUARDS HOLDING ARAD IN LEBANON


Air Force navigator Ron Arad, missing since his F-4 Phantom was
shot down over Lebanon three years ago, is being held by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards inside Lebanon, defence officials said last
night.

The officials' comment followed the statement in Paris on
Saturday by Arad's wife Tamar that she believed he was being held by
Iranians, a claim confirmed earlier yesterday by lawyer Uri Slonim,
who is a special adviser to Defence Minister Rabin on missing IDF
soldiers.

Tamar Arad said she was not sure whether the Iranians had taken
her husband to Syria or Iran, but the officials said last night it was
known he was being held inside Lebanon.  The officials would not say
where or for how long he had been held by the Revolutionary Guards, or
how long the ministry had known the identity of his captors.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guards were sent to Lebanon to help arm
and train members of the radical Shi'ite militia Hizbullah, which has
declared its intention to help liberate Jerusalem.  There is an
estimated minimum of several hundred Revolutionary Guards now in
Lebanon.

The Revolutionary Guards' Lebanese stronghold is in the vicinity
of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, an area controlled by the Syrian army.
A number of the Guards are also said to be stationed with Hizbullah
forces in the southern sections of Moslem West Beirut.

Arad was first held by a faction of the Shi'ite militia Amal
headed by Mustafa Dirani.  Dirani eventually broke with Amal leader
Nabih Berri and reportedly moved to the Baalbek region near the
Hizbullah headquarters.  Both Dirani and Berri have denied to Red
Cross officials they are holding Arad.

        IRAN'S GOT MY HUSBAND, SAYS IAF AIRMAN'S WIFE


PARIS - Ron Arad, the Israeli Air Force navigator shot down in
Lebanon three years ago, is probably being held prisoner by the
Iranians, his wife Tamar told The Jerusalem Post yesterday.

Mrs. Arad said she has been assured by Israeli authorities that
her husband is alive.  "At first Ron was held by Mustafa Dirani, head
of a group attached to Amal headed by [Shiite leader] Nabih Berri.
Berri in fact held a press conference in Sidon the day after my
husband's plane was shot down, when he said Ron was his prisoner.  But
later, Dirani and Berri separated.  Dirani took my husband along with
him and after a while probably handed him over to the Iranians," she
said.

Tamar Arad stressed that "I do not know where he is now.  Maybe
the Iranians took him to Iran or to Syria.  We have no clue, but I
know that the Israeli government is doing whatever is possible to free
my husband," she added.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has been denied
access to Arad until now, she said.  "I know that the Red Cross has
not been allowed to meet Sheikh Abdel-Karim Obeid," the South Lebanese
Hizbullah leader captured by Israel in August, said Tamar Arad.  "I
have been told this situation will not change until the Red Cross is
allowed to meet my husband and all the other Israeli prisoners." Those
missing are Yehuda Katz, Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, Yosef Fink,
Rahamim Alsheikh and Samir Assad.

She has received only one letter from her husband since his
capture on October 16, 1986, through an unnamed third party, in the
first year of his captivity.  Sometime during his second year of
captivity, the Red Cross asked Dirani to pass to Arad a picture of his
then two-year-old daughter.  Dirani then answered that Arad was held
by Berri, while Berri claimed the opposite.

Mrs Arad is in Paris trying to convey a message to her husband
through the participants to an international symposium on Human Rights
in Arab Countries currently being held here under the auspices of
President Francois Mitterrand.  "I just hope that Ron and the other
Israeli prisoners are treated as well as Sheikh Obeid is in Israel.
Ron's daughter is now four, and she really hopes that her daddy will
soon be back home," she said.

        IRAN SAID READY FOR HOSTAGE DEAL


LONDON - Iran is reported to be prepared this week to propose a
hostage-exchange deal, offering the release of all Western hostages in
Lebanon and captured Israeli navigator Ron Arad in return for Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid and 500 Israeli-held prisoners, according to a press
report today.

The Sunday Times claims that Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani will pass details of the proposals to the Bush
administration this week.  Apart from Obeid and the 500 Lebanese and
Palestinian detainees, he is also reportedly seeking the unfreezing of
$6 billion in Iranian assets held in the U.S.

Rafsanjani is said to have decided on a policy of "opening up to
the West" - but today's report claims Islamic extremists are doing
their utmost to undermine him.

          South Lebanon.  Israel.  IDF.  Protest.

        DIRANI KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ARAD - DEPUTY


THE deputy of abducted Hizbullah terrorist leader Mustafa Dirani
yesterday denied Dirani had sold IAF navigator Ron Arad to the
Iranians and asserted Dirani knows nothing of value about Arad.

"Abu Ali Mustafa [Dirani] did not hand over the pilot.  He has
known nothing about this subject since the day his responsibility as
security chief for Amal ended in 1988," said deputy Zakariya Hamzeh,
who goes by the nom-de-guerre of Abu Yahya.

"We have no information on Arad since a long time  ...  They will
learn nothing new, because Abu Ali [Dirani] knows nothing about him
since 1988," Hamzeh said.

However, IDF sources said yesterday Dirani has revealed under
interrogation how he handed over Arad to the Iranian-backed
Revolutionary Guards in 1988 for a hefty sum of money, believed to be
around $300,000.

Dirani, said the sources, confessed that in 1988, while still in
the Amal militia, a Shi'ite organization opposed to Hizbullah, he
handed over Arad to the Revolutionary Guards alive and in good health.
Arad ejected from his Phantom jet over Lebanon in October 1986 and
has been missing since.

Dirani, 43, formed his own group after splitting from Amal six
years ago.  He is known in Shi'ite guerrilla circles as Abu Ali
Mustafa.

"We will not let Israel laugh for long," said Hamzeh.  He and
other Shi'ite leaders spoke at a news conference outside Dirani's
three-story house in the village of Ksarnaba, pledging revenge.

"It's an open war between us and the Israelis," said Hussein
Musawi, leader of Islamic Amal, one of several pro-Iranian Shi'ite
groups based in eastern Lebanon.

Sheikh Adib Haidar, a Shiite cleric and a senior official of the
Believers Resistance, said: "We say to the Zionists, 'We're going to
ambush you as you've ambushed us."'

Musawi, whose group also is an Amal splinter faction closely
allied with Dirani, said he, too, has no information on Arad or who
was holding him.

"If I had him, I would have killed him," said Musawi, who
acknowledged Dirani's capture was a "big blow" to guerrillas fighting
to evict Israeli troops from south Lebanon.

In Beirut, Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Dirani's abduction
was a violation of international law and warned that it could hurt the
Middle East peace process.

The state-run National News Agency said Lebanon is considering
lodging an official complaint with the United Nations Security
Council.

Haidar and Hamzeh lashed out at the Lebanese government for
delaying official comment on the operation and accused it of
"scandalous negligence."

"We can't find an explanation for the scandalous negligence by
the Lebanese state which stood by as a false witness for four hours
watching the Zionists breaching Lebanon's sovereignty," Haidar said.

Hamzeh called for an arrangement with the Lebanese Army, which
has recently banned the appearance of armed elements in the Bekaa
Valley, to allow commandos to protect themselves.

Information Minister Michel Samaha, in the first official
reaction to the kidnapping, denounced the operation as "international
piracy condemned by all laws and legislations and international
agreements.

"This is a new example of Israeli atrocities and its desire to
influence and exploit neighboring nations," Samaha told reporters
yesterday.

In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
said yesterday it had demanded the Israeli government allow its
representatives in Jerusalem to visit Dirani.

"We have demanded to be allowed to visit him because his seizure
is a clear breach of article 34 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which
forbids the taking of hostages," an ICRC spokesman said.

          War.

        QUOTES SOURCES IN BEIRUT.
CAPTURED SOLDIER YOSEF FINK 'MAY BE ALIVE,' SAYS UK PAPER.


LONDON - Less than three weeks after a British newspaper claimed
Israel had reached the conclusion two of its missing servicemen in
Lebanon were dead, another newspaper yesterday asserted that one of
them might still be alive.

The latest claim appeared in the Independent, in an article by
the paper's award-winning Beirut correspondent Robert Fisk.  Quoting
unnamed sources in West Beirut, the paper said Yosef Fink, one of two
soldiers ambushed near Beit Yahoun in south Lebanon in February 1986,
"may be alive." However, Fink's comrade, Rahamim Alsheikh, was "badly
wounded" and later died, said the Independent.

On August 13, the Sunday Times claimed Israel believed both Fink
and Alsheikh were dead - a report since vehemently denied by Israeli
ministers.  A week later, the paper reported that Israel was now
negotiating for the return of their bodies.

Conceding that imprisoned Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abdul Karim
Obeid told his interrogators both soldiers died soon after the ambush,
Israeli ministers have nevertheless made it clear that Obeid's
information is far from reliable, and that the two soldiers will
continue to be regarded as alive unless conclusive proof is obtained
to the contrary.

While the Sunday Times report originated in Jerusalem and was
based on Israeli sources, Fisk's sources come from the Lebanese
capital and presumably receive up-to-date information concerning
hostages and captives being held in the city.  Yesterday's report
added that a third missing Israeli, Air Force navigator Ron Arad, was
no longer in the hands of Nabih Berri's Amal militia.

Fisk's report, a lengthy piece examining numerous aspects of the
hostage crisis, included another bombshell - the assertion that the
Soviet Union provided "expertise" for the suicide attacks on American
marines and French paratroopers in October 1983.

The attacks, according to Fisk's Shi'ite sources, were planned
jointly by Syrian intelligence and former Iranian interior minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, with the Soviets providing "the information
necessary to pack the explosives in the suicide drivers' trucks in
such a way that they totally destroyed the two military bases."

        'IDF HOSTAGES MAY BE ALIVE'


LONDON - Minister Yitzhak Moda'i last night played down
suggestions that two of Israel's missing servicemen in Lebanon were
dead, insisting that "we don't know for sure how many of them are
alive."

Addressing an Israel Bonds gathering here, the Economic Affairs
Minister said that two months ago Israel "thought we had a sign of
life" concerning abducted IDF servicemen Yosef Fink and Rahamim
Alsheikh.

Defence sources in Israel said shortly after the abduction of
Hizbullah Sheikh Obeid last month that the action had been delayed -
after the cabinet had already approved it - precisely because of those
signs of life.

He added that the group holding air force navigator Ron Arad has
admitted that he is still alive.

Referring to British press reports claiming that Israel has
concluded that Fink and Alsheikh are dead, on the basis of information
obtained from Obeid, Moda'i said that Israel could not be sure that
Obeid was telling the truth.

He said Israel still hopes Obeid's capture will pay dividends.
He added that Obeid would not be released unless all Israeli captives
were freed in exchange, and that the process may take a very long
time.

        'HIZBULLAH OFFERS PROPOSALS FOR FREEING HOSTAGES'


Hizbullah spiritual leader Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah was
quoted yesterday as saying that his organization has indirectly
presented proposals to Washington for the release of Western hostages
in Lebanon.

A Hizbullah proxy, however, once again threatened the lives of
the American hostages it holds, warning that the presence off the
Lebanese coast of French warships could be "dangerous" for the
captives.

In a wide-ranging discussion on Lebanon at yesterday's weekly
cabinet meeting, security sources said that concerted international
lobbying had deterred Syria from pressing on with its offensive in
Lebanon.

The sources said that Damascus is seeking ways of renewing its
offensive in Beirut, which has been relatively tranquil since the end
of the week.  If the international community does not apply pressure
on Damascus, the sources said, Syria is likely to resume its attack at
once.

Relatively small forces have participated in the fighting in
Beirut, consisting of Syrian allies among the Druse, Sunnis and
Shi'ites, the sources said.  Damascus has been careful not to employ
its own ground troops or air force in attacks on the Christians, the
sources added.

They added that the Christians appear to have abandoned hope for
an alliance with any other Lebanese group, and have now resigned
themselves to taking on the Syrians by themselves.

Between 20,000 and 40,000 refugees have sought refuge in the
security zone in South Lebanon since the latest round of fighting
began, the sources added.

In Tel Aviv yesterday, the Defence Ministry issued a flat denial
of a Sunday Times report claiming that Israel was involved in
negotiations with Hizbullah for the return of navigator Ron Arad and
the bodies of kidnapped Givati soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamim
Alsheikh in exchange for Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid and 450 Shi'ites.

The ministry also announced the extension of the appointyment of
Tel Aviv attorney Ori Slonim as special adviser to the defence
minister on the captive IDF soldiers.  Slonim, a confidant of Rabin
first appointed to the post last September, was recently in Europe and
is said to be closely involved with the latest intense efforts to
establish a dialogue with Hizbullah.

In an interview with the United Arab Emirates newspaper
al-Ittihad yesterday, Fadlallah said: "What has taken place so far is
that mediators have presented ideas to the U.S. according to proposals
put forward by the kidnappers," He gave no details of the proposals,
however.

The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds two American
hostages, said their lives would be at stake if the French navy
intervenes in Lebanon.  The RJO is widely viewed as a cover used by
Hizbullah.

France has dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch and the destroyer
Duquesne to the eastern Mediterranean, ostensibly to evacuate some
7,000 French nationals from Lebanon if the need arises.

(Box) Pope John Paul II is determined to visit Beirut, a
spokesman for the Vatican said yesterday during the pope's visit to
the northern Spanish city of Oviedo, where he celebrated mass.

"As soon as he returns to Rome, the Pope intends to discuss the
question of his visit to the Lebanese capital with his advisers,"
spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.

Earlier yesterday, the pope, addressing a gathering in Santiago
de Compostela, implored the Syrians, and Lebanese Christians and
Moslems, to stop fighting and to accept an immediate cease-fire.

        PAPER SAYS ISRAEL NEGOTIATING FOR REMAINS OF TWO SOLDIERS


LONDON - Acting on the belief that missing soldiers Joseph Fink
and Rahamim Alshech are dead, Israel has entered into negotiations
intended to secure the return of their bodies, "The Sunday Times"
claimed today.

The British newspaper, which last week published the hotly-denied
report that Israel had "concluded" that the two died within hours of
their ambush in south Lebanon in February 1986, said that "a secret
channel of communications has been reactivated for the negotiations."

The Israelis, it added, were also demanding the release of air
force navigator Ron Arad, shot down over Sidon in October 1986.

Memo: ANALYSIS

          Hizbullah.

        NERVES OF STEEL NECESSARY FOR TRICKY NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIZBULLAH.


From the moment Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced two
weeks ago that Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid had been abducted in order to
force Hizbullah to negotiate a release of IDF hostages, government
officials have predicted the negotiation process would be long and
nerve-racking.

Their predictions have already come true.

For the past 10 days the picture appeared promising.  Hizbullah
backed off from its threat to kill U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio, hints
at possible negotiations began surfacing in Iran and Lebanon, and the
U.S. toned down its criticism of Israel.

But any euphoria was dissipated by the Sunday Times report that,
according to Obeid, IDF soldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink had
died in January 1986.

The report cited senior Israeli government sources, but the IDF
refused comment and issued its well-worn statement that it considered
all IDF prisoners alive until proven otherwise.

The contradiction raises the inevitable question of who told the
Sunday Times reporter what, and why.

The process of bringing the two sides to conduct negotiations
through responsible channels requires a complex series of feints and
counter-feints, threats, exaggerated demands and outright lies.

The real victims of this "game" are the families of the soldiers.
The report in the Sunday Times said the IDF had informed the families
of Obeid's claim that their sons were dead.  But both families denied
they had been told, while Alsheikh's father said he had been informed
just two weeks ago his son was alive.

The IDF, meanwhile, tried yesterday to comfort the worried
families, telling them not to pay attention to the foreign news
reports.  As far as the IDF is concerned, their sons are alive until
evidence proves otherwise.

This is a sound position.  Even if the newspaper's report is
correct, it doesn't rule out the possibility that Obeid was either
deliberately lying or simply did not know.  Concrete evidence is the
only proof.

Since Obeid's abduction, Hizbullah has faked one execution and
threatened another.

Lately, Hizbullah has hinted a trade was possible for the Western
hostages in return for the release of Shi'ite and Palestinian
prisoners held in Israel.

Despite the current "coordination" between the U.S. and Israel on
the hostage matter, the possibility exists the U.S. would put pressure
on Israel for Obeid's release in return for the Western hostages.

Complicating matters further is the unhappy fact that time is not
necessarily on Israel's side as far as trading Obeid is concerned.

Hizbullah's initial reaction to the abduction made it crystal
clear they feared what Obeid could tell Israel.  Hizbullah must assume
that Obeid will tell his interrogators all he knows.  When that
happens, his value will be appreciably diminished.

Considering that Hizbullah has let dozens of its men languish in
IDF and SLA prisons for months and years, it is not likely they would
seek Obeid's release for purely humanitarian considerations.

It is important, therefore, for the IDF to convince Hizbullah
that Obeid is still talking, that he has more to say, and that,
consequently, he is still worth trading for.

If it is eventually learned that Fink and Alsheikh are dead, the
question will inevitably be asked if Obeid's abduction was worth the
effort.

Putting aside for a moment the fate of Air Force navigator Ron
Arad, whose return would mark the operation as a success, it could
also be argued that the time had come to end, once and for all, the
anguished uncertainty of the soldiers' families.

If in the end, all that Israel receives are the bodies of its
soldiers, the IDF's actions will be vindicated.  If the Western
hostages are also released in the process, the IDF's actions may even
be praised.

        'OBEID TOLD OF SOLDIERS' DEATHS FROM WOUNDS.'
UK PAPER SAYS TWO IDF MEN DIED AFTER 1986 HIZBULLAH AMBUSH.


LONDON - The Israeli government has notified the families of two
soldiers captured by Hizbullah in February 1986 that the pair are
dead, senior Israeli officials are quoted as saying in a news report
published here today.

The Sunday Times, in a report from Jerusalem, said Israel has
"concluded" that the two - Joseph Fink and Rahamim Alshech - died from
wounds sustained during their capture by Hizbullah in an ambush near
Beit Yahoun in southern Lebanon.

In Jerusalem, official IDF sources said last night that the army
did not respond to questions concerning the prisoners.  "We regard
them as alive until proven otherwise," they said.

Prime Minister Shamir, according to the Sunday Times report, has
ordered ministers not to discuss the matter and has attempted to keep
the deaths secret from the Bush administration "for fear that
Washington will put heavy pressure on him to free [Sheikh Abdel Karim]
Obeid in exchange for western hostages in Beirut."

Prior to the abduction of Obeid, said The Sunday Times, Israeli
intelligence agents thought that at least one of the pair might still
be alive.  But Obeid has apparently confirmed to his interrogators
that both died from their wounds soon after capture.

The third missing Israeli serviceman, air force navigator Ron
Arad "is believed to be alive, but in the hands of a Lebanese militia
that has closer ties to Syria than to Iran," according to today's
report.

Israel's information as to the fate of the two soldiers, added
The Sunday Times, has been confirmed by Arab sources in West Beirut.

The Israeli government "now believes one of the missing men died
of wounds about 15 minutes after the ambush," according to the report,
while the second "died hours later."

Arab sources told the paper that the soldiers' captors "staged" a
photograph that appeared in a Beirut magazine showing the soldiers
lying in beds with intravenous drips three days after the ambush.  The
sources said "both were dead when the picture was taken." Israeli
sources, said The Sunday Times, have confirmed that Obeid told his
interrogators the same story.

Israel has sought to keep its information on the deaths secret
from the U.S. because it expects Bush to demand that Obeid be offered
as a bargaining chip in negotiations for western hostages, since
Israel no longer needs him.  The IDF abducted Obeid in the hope that
Hizbullah would release the Israelis to recover him.

While Israel is aware that a swap for Obeid would help ease the
strains in its relationship with the U.S., the government fears that
Obeid's release "would prompt criticism at home," said The Sunday
Times.  Israel would be seen by its electorate as having risked the
lives of its soldiers for an operation that solely benefited the U.S.

          Karim Obeid.  South Lebanon.

        RABIN: WE'LL TRADE OBEID FOR IDF MEN, FOREIGN HOSTAGES


Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday ended three days of
speculation when he stated that Israel is prepared to exchange
abducted Hizbullah leader Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid and all other
Shi'ites being held by the IDF in Israel or southern Lebanon, in
return for the release of all IDF soldiers and foreign nationals held
by the various Shi'ite organizations in Lebanon.

In Beirut, a senior Shi'ite security source said three IDF
prisoners captured in South Lebanon were still alive.

Rabin's dramatic announcement seemed timed to coincide with the
expiry of the 3 p.m. deadline for the execution of kidnapped U.S.
Marine Colonel William Higgins.

Observers said the timing of the announcement appeared to be part
of the war of nerves between Israel and Hizbullah, with Rabin
signalling that Israel would not give in to the Shi'ite demands.
Rabin emphasized that his announcement was made without knowledge of
Higgins's condition but expressed the hope he was still alive.

Within an hour the Oppressed of the Earth announced the alleged
execution of Higgins.

Rabin, speaking to reporters at an impromptu press conference at
the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv, said the proposed prisoner exchange should
be carried out through the normal channels of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.

Rabin said the decision to include the Western hostages in the
proposed exchange stemmed from the danger Israel perceived was caused
to their lives by Israeli actions.  He emphasized the decision was
taken by Israel alone, without consulting other countries, "just as
the decision to bring Sheikh Obeid back to Israel was an Israeli
decision aimed to help gain the return of Israeli prisoners."

Rabin stressed that when a military option existed to obtain the
return of hostages, it was preferred, as had been the case in the 1976
Entebbe rescue operation.

But by the same token, he said, when Israeli soldiers sent into
war fall into captivity, Israel is also willing to conduct
negotiations for their return, including the release of enemy - in
this case Shi'ite - prisoners "held by Israel or captured by Israel."

The latter reference appeared to be aimed at the approximately
150 Shi'ites held in the el-Khiam prison in the security zone in
southern Lebanon.  Israel is believed to be holding several dozen
Shi'ites in security prisons in Israel.

Hizbullah is believed to be holding Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi
Fink, two Nahal soldiers captured in February 1986 when their patrol
was ambushed in the security zone.  The navigator of an IAF Phantom
jet downed over Lebanon in October of that year, Ron Arad, was
originally held by Hizbullah's rivals Amal, but may now be under
Hizbullah's control after a split between Amal leader Nabih Berri and
the Amal officer responsible for holding Arad.

"The government of Israel," Rabin said, reading from notes,
"calls for the immediate release of all Israeli prisoners and missing
soldiers and all other hostages held by the Shi'ite organizations in
Lebanon.  Israel proposes an exchange of prisoners and hostages.
Included in this proposal are all the Israeli prisoners held by all
the Shi'ite organizations, and all the Shi'ites held by Israel, among
them Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi, and others.

"The exchange will be carried out under the auspices of the
International Red Cross according to the accepted practice for these
situations."

          Karim Obeid.

        A LANGUAGE HIZBULLAH UNDERSTANDS


While the IDF had several good reasons to attack Sheikh Abdel
Karim Obeid, the Iranian-educated leader of the Hizbullah in southern
Lebanon, the decision to abduct him indicates the IDF's readiness to
play hardball with the extremist Shi'ite organization which is
believed to be holding at least two IDF soldiers captive.

Hizbullah has become a difficult enemy for the IDF to combat.
Its members do not wear uniforms and fade easily into the Shi'ite
population.  Unlike the Palestinian terrorist organizations, it does
not have many concentrated training areas or headquarters in the
south.  Its power base is in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, where
the IAF is less apt to strike.

Recently the Hizbullah has joined forces with Palestinian
organizations in attempts to infiltrate Israel.  Forecasts for the
coming year see them entrenching themselves in a number of areas in
the south.

The IDF, meanwhile, appears to have a high appreciation of the
importance of individual leaders among the Shi'ite community in the
south.  Ever since Daoud Daoud, the commander of the Amal militia in
the south, was assassinated last September, his organization has been
weakened.  Among the outward signs of this are pacts that have been
concluded with the Palestinian organizations, and even a modus vivendi
with Hizbullah which Amal defeated last winter.

Sources in Lebanon have offered another motive for an attack on
Obeid, suggesting the IDF is aiming to torpedo the emerging
rapprochement between Amal and Hizbullah which has given Hizbullah
limited freedom of action.

For these reasons, a surgical attack against a single regional
leader could be considered both practical and effective.  The IDF is
convinced that Obeid is the key man for Hizbullah in the south.  But
instead of killing Obeid, the IDF abducted him.

Hizbullah is believed to be holding Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi
Fink, two Nahal soldiers capture in February 1986 when their patrol
was ambushed in the security zone.  The navigator of an IAF Phantom
jet downed over Lebanon in October of that year, Ron Arad, was last
known to be held by Amal, Hizbullah's rivals.  The Phantom pilot was
rescued by helicopter.

According to reports from London, individuals representing Israel
and Iran have met quietly in Europe over the past year to try to
arrange the soldiers' release.  Apparently these talks have been
fruitless.  The London Sunday Times writes today that the abduction
was intended as a bargaining chip in these stalled negotiations.

The IDF is hesitant to discuss the ultra-sensitive subject of its
soldiers being held prisoner, both to spare family members anguish and
to avoid harming delicate negotiations for their release.  But the IDF
makes it clear it is solemnly pledged to do everything possible to
bring home soldiers it sent into the field.

There are precedents for such an exchange.  On September 30,
1985, extremist Moslems kidnapped four Soviet diplomats in an attempt
to force Syria to halt an offensive against Moslem positions in
Tripoli.  Just 42 hours later, the body of one of the four, Arkady
Katkov, was found with a single bullet wound in his head.  Observers
noted in Jerusalem at the time: "The Soviets do things.  They don't
talk.  And this is the language Hizbullah understands."

Sources in southern Lebanon have tried to diminish the importance
of Obeid, calling him a "cheerleader, not a planner." Obeid, they say,
would certainly have granted sanctuary to Hizbullah fighters and tried
to arrange for arms transfers, but this is hardly unique in Lebanon.

        'MISSING ISRAELI SOLDIERS HELD IN PRO-IRANIAN HANDS IN LEBANON.'


LONDON - Six Israeli soldiers, who have been missing in Lebanon
for three years or more, are in the hands of pro-Iranian groups,
according to a document seized recently from the offices of Iran's
consulate in Geneva.

The document, dated September 30, 1988, was quoted by the
Independent newspaper here yesterday.  It was reportedly among a batch
of Iranian government papers stolen last month from the office of
consul Manuchehr Tale by left-wing opponents of Ayatollah Khomeini's
regime.

The soldiers are named as Sergeant Zacharia Baumel, Sergeant Zevi
Sergment, Corporal Yahuda Kat, Sergeant Samir Asad, Corporal Yussef
Sink and Corporal Rahamim Levy Alfriky.

The corporal named as Sink is thought to be Yosef Fink, while
Alfriky is believed to be Rahamim Levy Alsheikh.  The two were
captured together on February 17, 1986, in an ambush south of the Beit
Yahun junction in the South Lebanon security zone.

The document, signed by Tale, also mentions a certain "Moslem
Shaban," whom it describes as "a Mossad man living in Geneva."

It makes no mention, however, of air force navigator Ron Arad,
who was shot down in his Phantom jet over South Lebanon more than two
years ago.

Last October, the Observer quoted Lebanese sources as reporting
that Arad, Fink and Alsheikh were still alive.  Arad, it said, was
being held by former Amal militia security chief Mustapha Zirani.  And
Fink and Alsheikh were presumed to be alive since they had been
threatened with execution by Hizbullah extremists if Israel retaliated
for a car bomb attack on the northern border.

The Geneva documents were reportedly stolen by members of the
Mujahedin Khalq Iranian opposition group.

        IAF HITS HOME OF AMAL MAN WHO AIDED TERRORISTS


METULLA - Air Force helicopters yesterday attacked a house in
South Lebanon that had been visited by three Palestinian terrorists on
their way to attack this Galilee Panhandle town.  Eight Amal security
members were wounded, and the house was severely damaged.  The
helicopters returned safely to base.

Israeli military sources say that the house, near Sultaniya, was
used by Amal supporters who volunteered their assistance to the
terrorists.

The gang belonged to the Organization for the Liberation of
Palestine, a splinter of the Ahmed Jibril group operating in Lebanon
under Syrian auspices.

The three terrorists were killed Tuesday night by a patrol of
paratroopers as they tried to cross the border fence near Kibbutz
Manara.

IDF sources stressed that Israel would maintain its policy of
refraining from hitting Amal targets in South Lebanon.  Nevertheless,
they added, any persons or groups involved in attacks against Israel
would have no immunity from IDF retaliation.

OC Northern Command Aluf Yossi Peled yesterday told The Jerusaelm
Post that he suspected that the three Palestinians had been led to the
border by Amal guides. "We will not tolerate a situation like this,"
he said, "and we will have to find a military response."

UN sources in South Lebanon reported that at 9:00 a.m. yesterday
two Israeli Cobra helicopters flew over the village of Sultaniya and
shot five missiles into a house used by Amal's security unit.  The
house was badly damaged and eight Amal security force members who were
in the building at the time were injured.

They were taken to hospital in Tyre for treatment.

The Amal commander in South Lebanon, Abdul Majid Salah, told
reporters in Tyre that the Israeli attack on his headquarters would
not go unavenged.  He expressed his fury over "the savage attack" and
said that the agreement signed last week between Amal and the Fatah
organization demonstrates Amal's hegemony over South Lebanese
territory.

Sultaniya has been known as the stronghold of the extreme
Believers' Resistance, which split from Amal last year and has since
operated under the zealous wings of the Hizbullah.

The head of the Believers', Mustafa Dirani, is holding the
Israeli Air Force navigator, Ron Arad, who was captured two years ago.

Yesterday, SLA Christian soldiers in Jezzine opened fire on two
terrorists who were preparing to attack a position near Falous, on the
outskirts of the town.  One of the terrorists was killed in the clash
and the other managed to escape.  No SLA soldiers were hurt.

Memo: The capture of Shi'ite leader Mustafa Dirani may make little

        DIRANI CAPTURE POINTS TO PAST INTELLIGENCE FAILURES


IT was toward the end of a briefing this week when an official
began expressing concern about how Israelis would view the abduction
of Shi'ite militia commander Mustafa Dirani.

"Our way is not to look back," the official said.  "If we produce
an atmosphere of self-criticism, then this will have an effect on the
mission.  This could demoralize people at a time when we want to raise
morale."

The abduction of the 46-year-old former Amal security chief -
head of the Hizbullah-aligned Faithful Resistance Movement and a
suspected accomplice in the taking of Western hostages - might have
been a model commando operation.  The midnight raid may have shaken
the confidence of hardened Shi'ite terrorists around Lebanon.

But to many former and current IDF officers, the capture of
Dirani highlighted yet another attempt to compensate for what they say
has been the inept handling of the Ron Arad affair by several Israeli
governments.

Indeed, some intelligence sources doubt that Arad is even being
held in the Middle East, let alone in neighboring Lebanon.

"There has been a total intelligence failure and the one
responsible for this is the chief of military intelligence," said
Tsomet MK Moshe Peled, a reserve colonel and member of the Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

Peled charges that chief of military intelligence Maj.  -Gen.
Uri Saguy has been pressing for the Dirani abduction for two years to
make up for the total lack of knowledge as to Arad's whereabouts and
the identity of his captors.  Senior intelligence sources agree with
his premise, saying the search for Arad was bungled from October 16,
1986, the day the Air Force navigator bailed out of his Phantom jet
during a raid over south Lebanon.

Last week, the opportunity again arose to abduct Dirani.  As one
defense source recalls, the decision was taken quickly.  The
considerations were limited.

"It was a tactical decision," said the source, who did not want
to be named.  "There were no papers presented or strategy planned.  It
was simply, 'We know where he is.  He's a bad guy anyway.  So, what do
we have to lose?' It didn't go beyond that."

So far, Dirani has provided no surprises.  Nearly a week after he
arrived, the Shi'ite commander has been termed a "tough nut to crack."
Deputy chief of staff Maj.  -Gen.  Amnon Shahak told the Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Dirani, a sworn opponent of
Israel even during his Amal days, knows how to bear well under
interrogation and is convinced that his Israeli captors will not hurt
him.

The assessment is that it will take several months at least
before Dirani considers cooperating with Israel.

As with any mission of this sort, the Dirani abduction has
maximum and minimum goals.  The maximum is getting Dirani to announce
details of his handover of Arad to Iran - names, dates and so on.  Or
Israel might broadcast a video of Dirani handing over Arad to the
Revolutionary Guard, for which commandos searched in the operation.
This, officials hope, might result in international pressure on Iran,
which has consistently denied holding Arad.

The Israeli assessment is that Arad is being held somewhere in
Iran.  Israeli officials have asked Western governments to share
intelligence on Iran that might bolster the meager information it has
on the captured navigator.

Dirani could shed light on one theory regarding Arad's fate
bandied by some intelligence sources.  This view asserts that Arad was
held in Lebanon during the 1980s, but when the negotiations for the
release of Western hostages began in earnest in 1990, Arad was
smuggled out of the Middle East to another stronghold of Iran and
Hizbullah.  One suspected destination is Sudan.

BUT CLINTON BAILEY, an expert on Lebanese Shi'ites, is not
optimistic.  Iran and Hizbullah, he says, just don't play by the usual
rules of hostage-taking - not with Israel, that is.

They haven't been moved by the 1989 kidnapping of Hizbullah
commander Sheikh Abdul Kareem Obeid or that of relatives of Hizbullah
leaders.  There's little hope that they will feel differently in the
wake of Dirani's capture.

"It's a real zero-sum game," Bailey says.  "They [Iran and
Hizbullah] don't know what they're going to get for [Arad].  But they
know [he's] valuable.  In the meantime, the less they say, the higher
the price."

Intelligence sources, many of them senior officers who do not
want to be identified, say Israel wasted precious time in finding a
channel to a leader as accessible as Amal's Nabih Berri, who was not
contacted by Israel until February 1987.

Bailey, a former adviser to the Defense Ministry, says the
"original sin" was that Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 1985
without ensuring a channel to Amal, then a moderate militia movement.
The Israelis cold-shouldered Amal and Berri, believing they were
Syrian puppets.

"It was an enormous policy failure," says Bailey, who today
teaches at Tel Aviv University.  "So, when Ron Arad came up, they had
nobody to talk to."

Israeli officials acknowledge that the negotiations with Berri
were handled sloppily.  The Amal leader demanded the release of
thousands of prisoners for the return of Arad along with a hefty
ransom.  Later, he lowered his sights and spoke in terms of hundreds
of released prisoners.  Meanwhile, Arad was allowed to send a letter
and a picture back home.

"We got the impression that the talks were making progress and we
were getting closer," a senior official, who did not want to be named,
recalls.  "The talks, however, were halted."

The main reason, the official says, was the outbreak of the
Palestinian uprising.  Suddenly, the IDF brass and security services
had their hands full with massive, daily riots in Judea, Samaria and
Gaza.  Political leaders were preoccupied with the diplomatic fallout.

The main question officials asked was what effect a massive
prisoner release would have on the violence in the territories.  Some
IDF sources recall that Israeli leaders didn't respond quickly enough
to Amal's negotiating demands.  Others say the government believed it
should take a harder line than during previous talks on a prisoner
exchange.  One official made this public knowledge.

By late 1988, Arad was no longer in Amal's hands.  Dirani had
tried and failed to take over the militia, and he was ousted as
security chief.  He took Arad with him to Hizbullah and later, Israeli
officials say, sold Arad for $300,000 to the Iranian Revolutionary
Guards.

From 1987, Israel has not received any sign of life from Arad.
This, despite the Obeid abduction. Today, Obeid is still in an Israeli
prison and officials are no wiser regarding the fate of Arad.

"We had lousy intelligence all along," said a senior defense
source.  "What more can I say?"

Another opportunity to retrieve Arad arose during the 1990-91
negotiations for the return of Western hostages in Lebanon. The
Hizbullah captors demanded that Israel release Shi'ite prisoners for
the release of the Westerners.  Israeli officials wanted to ensure
that its soldiers missing in action would be freed as well.

Then UN secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar led the efforts
to free the hostages, aided by his negotiator Giandomenico Pico.
Perez de Cuellar kept promising that he would deal with the Israeli
MiAs once the Western hostages were freed.

"The problem was that some of the foreign countries and families
of the hostages saw them as a separate case," recalled Yohanan Bein, a
former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a member of the negotiating
team.  "We claimed the opposite was true.  That they were taken in
action but were being treated as hostages."

Israel was certain that Iran or Hizbullah was holding Arad but
had no details and no leads.  "It is clear that had we had information
on Ron Arad, we could have been more effective," said one official,
who did not want to be identified.  "If we had updated information to
give visiting foreign dignitaries, it would have given them more
incentive."

The result was that Israeli officials, who had sharp
disagreements over strategy, relied totally on Perez de Cuellar.  Some
of them, particularly chief Israeli negotiator Uri Lubrani, echoed the
optimism of the UN secretary-general about an imminent release of the
missing Israeli soldiers.

Israel freed 93 low-security risk detainees from the Al-Khiam


prison in south Lebanon.  By the time the last Western hostage was
released, Israeli negotiators realized they had been deceived.  Weeks
later, Perez de Cuellar's term expired and Pico resigned.

"I don't know if Perez de Cuellar was fooled by the Iranians or
fooled us," said a senior official, who did not want to be named.
"Later, Pico told us the Iranians wouldn't play the game.  I am sure
Pico really wanted the release.  Perez de Cuellar wanted the Western
hostages more."

Weeks after Perez de Cuellar left the UN, some Israeli officials
involved in the hostage negotiations drew their own conclusions.  Uri
Slonim was the first to resign.  Lubrani soon followed.  Neither
wanted to speak about the Arad affair.

Since the end of the hostage affair, defense sources say, Dirani
had a been an Israeli target.  Several months ago, they add, an
attempt to abduct Dirani was postponed to allow US President Bill
Clinton to appeal to the Iranians via Damascus for the release of
Arad.

        RABIN: RON ARAD STILL CONSIDERED PRISONER


PRIME Minister Yitzhak Rabin said yesterday that IAF navigator
Ron Arad is still considered to be missing in action and a prisoner.

"I cannot say with certainty that Ron Arad is not alive, and thus
his position is that of a prisoner who is missing in action.  And as
long as it is not proved otherwise, for me he is still alive," Rabin
said at Haifa University, where he received an honorary doctorate.

Rabin said abducted Shi'ite leader Mustafa Dirani is talking to
interrogators, but gave no details.  "There is now additional
information about Ron Arad's past and I hope that perhaps there will
be some about the future.  At this stage, one must be cautious and not
say too much," Rabin said.

        FAMILIES OF MIAS SEEKING TO CROSS INTO LEBANON


FAMILIES of missing servicemen and activists pressing for their
return are seeking permission from the Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese
authorities to enter Lebanon.

They intend to visit the Good Fence border crossing near Metulla
on Sunday in the hope that from there they will be allowed to cross
into Lebanon to seek information about the MIA's.

"We are prepared to take any risk even if it means endangering
ourselves.  After 12 years without our son, without knowing whether
he's alive or dead, our own lives are worth very little," said Pnina
Feldman, mother of Zvi Feldman.

"We want to know the truth, for better or for worse, and for that
we are prepared to do whatever if necessary," she added.

Joel Leyden, co-chairperson of the International Coalition for
Missing Israeli Soldiers, said the voluntary organization which has
offices in North America as well as Israel, had made contact with the
Syrian and Lebanese governments and was awaiting a response to their
request.

He said the association had information, believed to be reliable,
that at least two out of the four servicemen missing in Lebanon were
alive.  He declined to give any further details.

He was referring to IAF navigator Ron Arad and the three soldiers
missing from the Sultan Yakoub battle on June 12, 1982 - Yehuda Katz,
Zaharia Baumel and Zvi Feldman.

Two other MIA's, Yosef Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, who were
captured by Hizbullah in February 1986, have been confirmed as being
dead, although their bodies have not yet been returned to Israel.

Leyden said the group also intended to contact UNIFIL and the
International Committee of the Red Cross, and hoped the UN would
provide them with an escort if they were granted permission to cross
into Lebanon.

"At the very least we intend to stage a ceremony at the Good
Fence crossing, to mark the 12th anniversary since the three soldiers
from Sultan Yakoub went missing, and Arkia airlines has very kindly
offered to fly representatives of the group and the families to the
north," said Leyden.

Leyden said the families were ready to take nearly any measures
to try to obtain concrete evidence about the fate of their missing
boys - and were willing to sign documents absolving the government of
any responsibility for them if they were allowed to enter Lebanon.

        ARAD NOT BEING HELD BY SYRIA, MINISTRY SAYS


THE Defense Ministry last night discounted German reports that
missing air force navigator Ron Arad is being held by Syria, saying
the information is not new and calling it doubtful.

"Intelligence bodies in Israel base their evaluation on better
information than that in the Stasi [former East German intelligence]
files," said ministry spokesman Oded Ben-Ami.

He added that valuable, up-to-date information had recently been
gleaned from the interrogation of captured Shi'ite leader Mustafa
Dirani that contradicts the Stasi information quoted in a German
television documentary.

German sources said last night that Israel and Syria are
negotiating for Arad's release as part of a deal including Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights.

The sources helped research a documentary called Report,
broadcast by the ARD German television channel last night, which
described secret KGB documents on the fate of Israeli soldiers missing
in action in Lebanon.  They said Israel has known for several years
that Arad is being held by Syria.

"It looks like today Ron Arad is still in the hands of Syria, not
Iran," a German source said.  "The issue is being dealt with in the
peace negotiations.  The Israelis are asking that Arad be released as
part of a goodwill gesture."

A document marked "top secret" and dated March 3, 1989 said Arad
was captured by the Syrian-aligned Amal militia and transferred to
Syria.  "He is being held by the movement in west Beirut, under the
auspices of the Syrians," the document said.

Nevertheless, to the best of Israel's knowledge, Arad was not
held by Syria in the late 1980s, OC Air Force Maj.  -Gen.  Herzl
Bodinger said yesterday.

Bodinger, speaking to military correspondents on the eve of Air
Force Day, said that as one who is privy to information on Arad's
whereabouts, he can only say that "Ron Arad was not held by Syria  ...
Arad is alive and being held by Iranian surrogates."

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday refused to comment on the
German television report.  He put the blame for Arad's imprisonment on
Dirani, the Hizbullah, and Iran.  Asked whether he also blames Syria,
Rabin replied: "Syria could have done more [to release Arad]."

Rabin told Knesset reporters he does not react to media reports.
However, he added that, "We have significant information regarding
what happened to Arad until 1988-1989.  [However,] I will not go into
details."

Israel has made many efforts to bring the missing soldiers home,
said Rabin.  "Most of these efforts are unknown, and not everything
that is published is correct."

He said the government would continue making efforts to find out
about the fate of its soldiers.  "It was not for nothing that we
risked our soldiers and helicopter pilots to bring Dirani here in
order to establish certain facts about the past [and] to establish
facts about who is holding Arad now, even though we are not certain
about his fate," said Rabin.  "We will continue the efforts."

For years, Israel has maintained that Arad is being held by
Iranian elements.  Rabin has not denied that negotiations were held in
1989 to release Arad, but has repeatedly stated the government's
position that Arad was captured by Amal and handed over to Iran.

The German documentary makers dispute this.  "Syria is actually
the force that has Arad," said Report producer Richard Haim Schneider.
"We are more or less convinced that this story is correct."

Schneider said that in 1989 Israel, Syria, East Germany and the
Soviet Union participated in a prisoner exchange.  Under the proposal,
Arad and at least one other IDF soldier, along with the bodies of
other MIAs, would be exchanged for two Soviet spies, Marcus Klingberg
and Shabtai Kalmanovich.

The negotiations were conducted by Israeli attorney Amnon
Zichroni and German attorney Wolfgang Vogel.  Vogel had maintained
that Arad was dead.  Both men have refused to comment.

As a result, the KGB released documents to the East German Stasi
regarding the fate of the MIAs.  The documents said Arad was alive
along with either Yosef Fink or Rahamim Alsheikh, abducted in 1986 by
Hizbullah in southern Lebanon.

A KGB document dated March 3, 1989 also said that Zachary Baumel,
Zvi Feldman, and Yehuda Katz were killed in the 1982 Battle of Sultan
Yaakoub, when they tried to take over a Syrian T-72 tank.  The three
were buried in a suburb of west Beirut, it said.

The assertion disputes the assessment of US and Israeli sources,
who say the three MIAs were in separate tanks in the battle.  Baumel
and Feldman were last seen lying near their crippled tank.  Katz was
left wounded in a tank that was later hit by an enemy shell.

Baumel's father, Yona, last night also discounted the German
report.  "We examined files of the Stasi and the KGB and the
information that has now surfaced is inconsistent with the information
we have." Yona Baumel said he relies on the assurances by the prime
minister that Israel's information regarding the MIAs is the best
available.

The KGB document also reviewed Israel's efforts to bring back the
body of IDF soldier Samir Assad.  On Sept. 13, 1991 Assad was returned
to Israel in a deal with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.

The KGB documents were found translated in German in the archives
of the former East German intelligence service several weeks ago by
Israeli professor Michael Wolfson.  Wolfson, author of Eternal Guilt?
, 40 Years of German-Jewish Relations, said when he made this
discovery he telephoned Israeli diplomats in Bonn.

Wolfson said the Soviets pressured Syria to agree to negotiations
on Arad.  He said Moscow wanted the return of Klingberg and
Kalmanovich, particularly the former, one of Israel's biologists
sentenced to life in prison and who according to foreign press reports
was involved in chemical warfare research.

"Klingberg was much more important," Wolfson said.  "Kalmanovich
was secondary."

Wolfson said the talks lasted between November 1987 and September
1989.  East Germany's Vogel dealt with Israel and the Soviets.  Moscow
discussed a prisoner exchange with Syria.

East Germany's interest in the prisoner deal was to win US
support, Wolfson said.  "Like other antisemitic regimes, they first
turned to the Jewish lobby, thinking they could get the US to grant
East Germany most-favored-nation status," he said.  "So the East
Germans got involved in Ron Arad and the MIAs."

Wolfson and Schneider said the talks over a prisoner exchange
broke down soon after the IDF kidnapped Hizbullah Sheikh Abdul Karim
Obeid in July 1989.  The Syrians refused to consider an exchange until
the furor of the Obeid abduction subsided.

Months later, the communist regime in East Germany, along with
its Stasi, fell and Vogel's role ended.  "I still can't speak about
this," Vogel said in a telephone interview from Berlin yesterday.
"It's all still too fresh."

        TEHERAN DENIES HOLDING RON ARAD


NICOSIA - Teheran has denied IAF navigator Ron Arad is being held
in Iran, but made no mention of Israeli claims he may be in south
Lebanon.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said "allegations made by
the Zionist regime on the presence of an Israeli pilot in Iran" are a
"sheer lie," according to an Islamic Republic News Agency dispatch
issued yesterday and monitored in Cyprus.

Oded Ben-Ami, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, told
The Associated Press yesterday that "Israel holds Iran, or Iranian
officials in Lebanon, responsible for Ron Arad." However, he declined
to discuss Arad's precise whereabouts.

        PERES HOPEFUL US WILL GET NEW INFORMATION ON MIAS


A US congressional delegation will hopefully uncover new
information about the IDF soldiers missing in Lebanon, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres said yesterday.

"It is a very professional and dedicated mission," he said.  "I
expect it will do good work and find out what needs to be found out."

He was speaking as the four-person US team met in Tel Aviv with
the families of Yehuda Katz, Zvi Feldman, Zacharia Baumel, Yossi Fink,
Rahamim Alsheik, and Ron Arad.

No official comment was available from either the Israeli or the
American side, beyond an assurance from delegation head Michael van
Dusen that "everything possible" would be done to help the families.

The delegation listened patiently as each family told them of
information they had painstakingly managed to piece together, through
official and unofficial channels, during the long years their sons
have been missing.

"They seem to be very professional, very serious," said Yona
Baumel.  "We hope they'll bring results."

He said members of the delegation "would not be working with a
stopwatch and plan to go wherever they can get information."

"They did not bring us new information," Yosef Katz told Army
Radio after the meeting.  "They are extremely humane and serious but
there is no substantive breakthrough, only an emotional breakthrough.
When we see Yehuda  ...  that will be a breakthrough."

The delegation received a mandate to visit Damascus following
talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President
Hafez Assad.  The team is expected to go to Syria over the weekend.

        HIZBULLAH ACTIVISTS CRITICIZE THE HOLDING OF RON ARAD



VETERAN Hizbullah activists yesterday criticized the continued holding of
downed navigator Ron Arad, saying it had led to the  IAF bombing of their base
in Baalbek in Lebanon.

In an open letter published in the Lebanese newspaper Al-Shara, the "Young
Believers" said Hizbullah activities were not  being conducted in consultation
with Islamic spiritual leaders, and cited several attacks, demanding to know
which Islamic leader  had authorized them.

One of the incidents cited was "the kidnapping of the cursed Jew  ...  When
the pilot (sic) was not returned, Ain Kuchab in  Baalbek was bombed.  How do
they justify keeping the pilot, when believers are killed because of it?

        AIR SHOW TO HONOR RON ARAD



One hundred pilots will land on a special runway near Ron Arad's Hod Hasharon
home this morning as a part of an air show to  draw attention to the fate of
the missing air force navigator.

"It will be the largest and most impressive air show which will express the
feeling of the entire nation that Ron Arad must  not be forgotten," a pilot
participating in the event said yesterday.

The pilot who flew with Arad to Lebanon when their plane was shot down will
land the first plane at 8:30, with Knesset  Speaker Shevah Weiss as his
passenger.  A ceremony will be held at 10:30.

        HIZBULLAH: US GAVE ISRAEL OKAY TO ATTACK.      'AMERICAN-ZIONIST
AGGRESSION WILL NOT PASS WITHOUT A RESPONSE.'



HIZBULLAH yesterday claimed the US has given Israel the go-ahead to launch
major operations against the fundamentalist  Shi'ite organization in Lebanon.

The allegations, broadcast on Hizbullah Radio, followed an emergency meeting
of the organization's leadership at the end of  the week, apparently called to
coordinate strategy in the event of an IDF offensive.

"We stress that we will be faithful to the resistance, thus any
American-Zionist aggression that might take place will not be  a picnic and
will not pass without a response of an appropriate scale," Hizbullah said.
"The resistance has proven its  capabilities and thus it warns the enemy and
its backers from getting involved in any adventure," said the statement, read
by the  group's chief, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.

The claims that America had given Israel the go-ahead to attack Hizbullah
targets in Lebanon were first made in an editorial  article in the As-Safir
newspaper.

The paper said that from comments made by US Secretary of State Warren
Christoper, indirectly blaming Iran and Hizbullah for  the Argentina and
London bombings, it could be concluded that America had given its tacit
consent to IDF attacks against  Hizbullah.

"The American secretary of state threatens and declares war on the Islamic
movement in Lebanon as if America was the victim,"  said Sheikh Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah in his sermon at Friday prayers.

Taunting Israel, Fadlallah said: "We tell Israel, try again an act of
terrorism that will only increase the people's hatred  and their rejection of
it  ...  We tell you, try again to invade.  We will not be defeated
politically or militarily".

Meanwhile, Hizbullah hardliner Sheikh Subhi Toufeili - the man suspected of
being behind the murderous Buenos Aires car-bomb  attack - told a Lebanese
newspaper his supporters would "kill any Jews who set foot in Beirut".

His comments follow widespread reports in the Lebanese press that the IDF
might try to hit Hizbullah targets in its  stronghold in the southern suburbs
of Beirut, as well as bases in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.

Toufeili, interviewed in the French language L'Orient Le Jour newspaper, was
quoted as saying that the "war against the Jews"  would continue with all
available means, even if the entire world signed peace treaties with them.

He also repeated a comment he made earlier this year that IAF navigator Ron
Arad is no longer alive.  Toufeili, one of the  "founding fathers" of
Hizbullah, maintained that Iran and Syria had made concerted efforts to trace
Arad, but to no avail.

He stressed that he had no evidence to support his belief that Arad had been
killed in an accident or by his captors.  It was  incomprehensible, however,
that Arad's captors should not enter into negotiations for his release if the
navigator was indeed  alive, he told the newspaper.

Syrian newspapers yesterday also fueled fears of an IDF offensive in Lebanon,
maintaining that the alleged "impending"  attacks were aimed at putting
pressure on Lebanon to reach a separate peace deal with Israel.

The Syrian Times accused Israel of trying to forget that Syria supported
Lebanon and would not hesitate to come to its aid if  necessary.

Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri met at the end of the week with American
Ambassador Mark Hambley and later with  Fadlallah.  Afterwards, he flew to
Saudi Arabia, apparently as part of Lebanon's diplomatic efforts to put
pressure on Israel to  forestall any IDF offensive.

The government has already put Lebanon's army and emergency services on full
alert, fearing IDF attacks in response to the  Buenos Aires and London
bombings and last Monday's attacks by Hizbullah on IDF and South Lebanese Army
targets in the security  zone, in which a paratroop officer was killed and 13
other soldiers wounded.

Israel has pledged to respond to Hizbullah's attacks last Monday in its own
time and way, but no official has categorically  accused Hizbullah or any of
its members of being behind or involved in the bombings abroad.

Uri Lubrani, the government's coordinator on Lebanon, told Israel Radio on
Friday that Iran's "fingerprints" were on  international terrorism against
Jewish and Israeli targets, but said he could not elaborate.

Regarding Toufeili's alleged role in the bombings, Lubrani said Hizbullah's
former secretary-general had been involved in  terrorist attacks against
Israel and others in the past.

"I cannot, however, say that he is connected with the recent incidents.  He
might or might not be.  I don't have any precise  information about it," said
Lubrani.

The Lebanese press has been reporting almost daily about alleged IDF
reinforcements in the security zone and along the  northern border.  UNIFIL
officers, however, said they had seen "virtually nothing out of the ordinary"
and they described the  Lebanese reports of an IDF build-up as exaggerated.

The region remained tense but relatively quiet over the weekend, with only one
incident yesterday afternoon when gunmen  simultaneously attacked two SLA
positions in the western sector of the zone with mortar fire.

Nearly two dozen rounds fell near the Rashaf and Jab'l Hamed positions,
without causing any injuries or damage.  IDF and SLA  gunners briefly returned
fire.

        BODINGER: ARAD IS STILL ALIVE



Missing IAF navigator Ron Arad is apparently alive, OC Air Force Maj.  -Gen.
Herzl Bodinger said yesterday at a ceremony  welcoming the first six of 50
surplus American F-16 fighter planes to arrive.  He said information acquired
from captive Hizbullah  leader Mustafa Dirani has provided Israel with new
leads in the Arad case.

The F-16s are part of the US commitment to the peace process, Bodinger noted,
saying "They will help maintain Israel's  qualitative edge over other
countries in the Middle East". American pilots flew the planes to Israel from
Germany.

Carlos.  Israel.

        THE SACRIFICIAL OFFERING



WHEN Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos, was nabbed in Khartoum
last week, he was found with a young Palestinian  girl recruit from a Lebanese
training camp.  He had brought his new mistress with him from Syria, first
sending his wife and  daughter off to Venezuela "on holiday".

But there was something of greater importance to the French anti-terrorist
squad sent to grab the arch-terrorist than  evidence of his notorious
philandering.  It was the discovery that Ali Fallahian, Iranian "Special
Action" minister, had  personally sent Carlos on a mission to Khartoum.

Fallahian travels the world masterminding the international terror campaign
conducted from Teheran.  Recent results of his  efforts include the
destruction of the Jewish community's center in Buenos Aires and bomb attacks
in London.

A French source told us: "We were given the information about Carlos's
whereabouts by the CIA in January, after President  Clinton and Syria's Hafez
Assad met in Geneva.  Assad had offered Clinton Carlos's head as a gesture to
persuade the US to remove  Syria from the list of countries supporting
terrorism.  His second demand was US pressure on Israel to return the entire
Golan  Heights to Syria within 90 days".

Once Carlos realized that his "friends" Assad and Fallahian had sold him out,
he wanted vengeance.  He told his captors that  his job in Sudan was to
monitor training by a hitherto-unknown terrorist unit called Allahu Akhbar
(God is great) based in an old  fort outside Khartoum.

Carlos has refused to go into detail until his jailers are ready to make a
deal.  But Western intelligence agencies, aided by  satellite spy cameras,
have focused on this elite terrorist unit.

We were told by an intelligence expert in Paris: "It's no secret that the
Sudan, funded by Iran, is today's major center for  training Hamas, Hizbullah,
Islamic Jihad and Egyptian and Algerian fundamentalist recruits.  The most
intelligent, versatile and  fanatical candidates are creamed off to join
Allahu Akhbar.  We suspect that they assassinated Egypt's president Sadat and
Bashir  Jemayel, the Lebanese Christian leader.  They led the group which came
close to killing George Bush on a visit to Kuwait after the  Gulf war.

"Heading their hit list are Yasser Arafat and King Hussein, both condemned to
death for their 'treachery' in dealing with  Israel.  Targeted too are Jewish
and Western personalities considered infidel traitors to Islam (Iranian
style).  One such man is  French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, currently
cracking down on extremists among France's three million-strong Moslem
population.  The imams of Iran repeatedly condemn him in their Friday sermons,
in speeches and in the press".

The plot to offer Carlos up as a sacrificial lamb to the US was hatched by
Fallahian and Assad.  And Carlos, lulled into a  sense of security after being
offered the chance of carrying out the "greatest of all his exploits" as the
boss of Allahu Akhbar,  flew happily off to Khartoum from Damascus, his new
young mistress at his side.

In reality, he wasn't needed in Sudan.  He was sent to Africa to avoid the
appearance of Syria and Iran being involved in his  betrayal.

The Sudanese gave him a royal welcome.  Their subsequent claim that they were
unaware of his presence was a naive attempt to  persuade the world that they
have no truck with terrorists.

CLINTON WAS sufficiently swayed by Assad's offer to surrender Carlos to
declare that a "strategic change" had come about in  Syrian thinking.  He
overlooked the fact that Carlos had lived in Damascus for many years, training
terrorists.  He was linked to  at least 10 different Arab extremist groups,
including the men responsible for the Pan Am bomb explosion over Lockerbie in
Scotland.

Carlos was not involved in the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich in
1972, but the Mossad knew how committed he was  to Arab terrorists like Wadi
Haddad, whom he admired deeply.  Carlos and Haddad together planned and put
into action the hijacking  of the Air France plane to Entebbe.  The Israelis,
like other Western security services, had tried hard to track Carlos down,
with  no success.

We were told by an American security expert: "Clinton didn't want the hot
potato of Carlos to deal with.  He was offered to  the French as a goodwill
gesture in view of the dramatic change in Paris's traditional appeasement
policy toward terrorism,  exemplified by the tough policies of Pasqua".

Assad and Fallahian, knowing how desperately the French needed a major coup to
win back public confidence, drove a hard  bargain before delivering the goods.

Fallahian's first successful demand was that France reschedule Teheran's $800
million debt to Paris.  He also wanted the  release of several jailed Iranian
terrorists, including the assassins of Shahpur Baktiar, former Iranian prime
minister previously  granted "safe" asylum in France.

When Prime Minister Rabin learnt about this deal, he pleaded with Mitterrand,
asking him not to release these killers until  the Iranians freed missing
Israeli navigator Ron Arad.

There were bitter protests too from several European governments.  They and
Rabin were brushed aside by Mitterrand, who  declared: "This is a matter of
supreme national interest".

The "supreme matter" was Carlos's head delivered on a Sudanese cushion, and
the Iranian killers were released and flown back  to Teheran.

As the French balked at the endless Iranian demands, Fallahian showed that he
was not a man to be trifled with.  Several  French diplomats and civilians
were murdered by terrorists in Algeria.

The deal was hastily finalized - including a cash reward of $1 million to
smooth the way with Sudanese police and army  officers.  The French said they
would do their best to persuade the US to remove Syria, Iran and Sudan from
the list of official  supporters of terrorism.

To date, Clinton has resisted this demand firmly.
