<P>Morning Session</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I will call on the Chief Prosecutor for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS (Chief Prosecutor for the United Kingdom): May it please the Tribunal, on an occasion to which reference has and will be made, Hitler, the leader of the Nazi conspirators who are now on trial before you, is reported as having said, in reference to their warlike plans:</P>

<P>"I shall give a propagandist cause for starting the war, never mind whether it be true or not. The victor shall not be asked later on whether he told the truth or not. In starting and making a war, not the right is what matters, but victory the strongest has the right."</P>

<P>The British Empire with its Allies has twice, within the space of 25 years, been victorious in wars which have been forced upon it, but it is precisely because we realize that victory is not enough, that might is not necessarily right, that lasting peace and the rule of international law is not to be secured by the strong arm alone, that the British nation is taking part in this Trial. There are those who would perhaps say that these wretched men should have been dealt with summarily without trial by "executive action"; that their power for evil broken, they should have been swept aside into oblivion without this elaborate and careful investigation into the part which they played in bringing this war about: Vae Victis! Let them pay the penalty of defeat. But that was not the view of the British Government. Not so would the rule of law be raised and strengthened on the international as well as upon the municipal plane; not so would future generations realize that right is not always on the side of the big battalions; not so would the world be made aware that the waging of aggressive war is not only a dangerous venture but a criminal one.</P>

<P>Human memory is very short. Apologists for defeated nations are sometimes able to play upon the sympathy and magnanimity of their Victors, so that the true facts, never authoritatively recorded, become obscured and forgotten. One has only to recall the circumstances following upon the last World War to see the dangers to which, in the absence of any authoritative judicial pronouncement a tolerant or a credulous people is exposed. With the passage of time the former tend to discount, perhaps because of their very horror, the stories of aggression and atrocity that may be handed down; and the latter, the credulous, misled by perhaps fanatical and perhaps dishonest propagandists, come to believe that it was not they but their opponents who were guilty of that which they would themselves condemn. And so we believe that this Tribunal, acting, as we know it will act notwithstanding its appointment by the victorious powers, with complete and judicial objectivity, will provide a contemporary touchstone and an authoritative and impartial record to which future historians may turn for truth, and future politicians for warning. From this record shall future generations know not only what our generation suffered, but also that our suffering was the result of crimes, crimes against the laws of peoples which the peoples of the world upheld and will continue in the future to upholdto uphold by international co-operation, not based merely on military alliances, but grounded, and firmly grounded, in the rule of law.</P>

<P>Nor, though this procedure and this Indictment of individuals may be novel, is there anything new in the principles which by this prosecution we seek to enforce. Ineffective though, alas, the sanctions proved and showed to be, the nations of the world had, as it will be my purpose in addressing the Tribunal to show, sought to make aggressive war an international crime, and although previous tradition has sought to punish states rather than individuals, it is both logical and right that, if the act of waging war is itself an offense against international law, those individuals who shared personal responsibility for bringing such wars about should answer personally for the course into which they led their states. Again, individual war crimes have long been recognized by international law as triable by the courts of those states whose nationals have been outraged, at least so long as a state of war persists. It would be illogical in the extreme if those who, although they may not with their own hands have committed individual crimes, were responsible for systematic breaches of the laws of war affecting the nationals of many states should escape for that reason. So also in regard to Crimes against Humanity. The rights of humanitarian intervention on behalf of the rights of man, trampled upon by a state in a manner shocking the sense of mankind, has long been considered to form part of the recognized law of nations. Here too the Charter merely develops a pre-existing principle. If murder rapine, and robbery are indictable under the ordinary municipal laws of our countries, shall those who differ from the common criminal only by the extent and systematic nature of their offenses escape accusation?</P>

<P>It is, as I shall show, the view of the British Government that in these matters, this Tribunal will be applying to individuals, not the law of the victor, but the accepted principles of international usage in a way which will, if anything can, promote and fortify the rule of international law and safeguard the future peace and security of this war-stricken world.</P>

<P>By agreement between the chief prosecutors, it is my task, on behalf of the British Government and of the other states associated in this Prosecution, to present the case on Count Two of the Indictment and to show how these defendants, in conspiracy with each other, and with persons not now before this Tribunal, planned and waged a war of aggression in breach of the treaty obligations by which, under international law, Germany, as other states, has thought to make such wars impossible.</P>

<P>The task falls into two parts. The first is to demonstrate the nature and the basis of the Crime against Peace, which is constituted under the Charter of this Tribunal, by waging wars of aggression and in violation of treaties; and the second is to establish beyond all possibility of doubt that such wars were waged by these defendants.</P>

<P>As to the first, it would no doubt be sufficient just to say this. It is not incumbent upon the Prosecution to prove that wars of aggression and wars in violation of international treaties are, or ought to be, international crimes. The Charter of this Tribunal has prescribed that they are crimes and that the Charter is the statute and the law of this Court. Yet, though that is the clear and mandatory law governing the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, we feel that we should not be discharging our task in the abiding interest of international justice and morality unless we showed to the Tribunal, and indeed to the world, the position of this provision of the Charter against the general perspective of international law. For, just as in the experience of our country, some old English statutes were merely declaratory of the common law, so today this Charter merely declares and creates a jurisdiction in respect of what was already the law of nations.</P>

<P>Nor is it unimportant to emphasize that aspect of the matter lest there may be some, now or hereafter, who might allow their judgement to be warped by plausible catchwords or by an uninformed and distorted sense of justice towards these defendants. It is not difficult to be misled by such criticisms as that resort to war in the past has not been a crime; that the power to resort to war is one of the prerogatives of the sovereign state; even that this Charter, in constituting wars of aggression a crime, has imitated one of the most obnoxious doctrines of National Socialist jurisprudence, namely post factum legislationthat the Charter is in this respect reminiscent of bills of attainder-and that these proceedings are no more than a measure of vengeance, subtly concealed in the garb of judicial proceedings which the victor wreaks upon the vanquished These things may sound plausibleyet they are not true. It is indeed, not necessary to doubt that some aspects of the Charter bear upon them the imprint of significant and salutary novelty. But it is our submission and our conviction, which we affirm before this Tribunal and the world, that fundamentally the provision of the Charter which constitutes wars, such wars as these defendants joined in waging and in planning a crime, is not in any way an innovation. This provision of the Charter does no more than constitute a competent jurisdiction for the punishment of what not only the enlightened conscience of mankind but the law of nations itself had constituted an international crime before this Tribunal was established and this Charter became part of the public law of the world.

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>So first let this be said:</P>

<P>Whilst it may be quite true that there is no body of international rules amounting to law in the Austinian sense of a rule imposed by a sovereign upon a subject obliged to obey it under some definite sanction, yet for 50 years or more the people of the world, striving perhaps after that ideal of which the poet speaks:</P>

<P>"When the war drums throb no longer And the battle flags are furled, In the parliament of man, The federation of the world"</P>

<P>sought to create an operative system of rules based upon the consent of nations to stabilize international relations, to avoid war taking place at all and to mitigate the results of such wars as took place. The first treaty was of course the Hague Convention of 1899 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. That Convention was, indeed, of no more than precatory effect, and we attach no weight to it for the purposes of this case, but it did establish agreement that, in the event of serious disputes arising between the signatory powers, they would as far as possible submit to mediation. That Convention was followed in 1907 by another convention reaffirming and slightly strengthening what had previouSlY been agreed. These early conventions fell, indeed, very far short of outlawing war, or of creating any binding obligation to arbitrate I shall certainly not ask the Tribunal to say any crime was committed by disregarding those conventions.</P>

<P>But at least they established that the contracting powers accepted the general principle that, if at all possible, war should be resorted to only if mediation failed.</P>

<P>Although these conventions are mentioned in this Indictment, I am not relying on them save to show the historical development the law, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to argue about their precise effect, for the place which they once occupied has been taken by far more effective instruments. I mention them now merely for this, that they were the first steps towards that body of rules of law which we are seeking here to enforce.</P>

<P>There were, of course, other individual agreements between particular states, agreements which sought to preserve the neutrality of individual countries, as, for instance, that of Belgium, but those agreements were inadequate, in the absence of any real will to comply with them, to prevent the first WWIn 1914.</P>

<P>Shocked by the occurrence of that catastrophe, the nations of Europe, not excluding Germany, and of other parts of the world, came to the conclusion that, in the interests of all alike, a permanent organization of the nations should be established to maintain the peace. And so the Treaty of Versailles was prefaced by the Covenant of the League of Nations.</P>

<P>Now, I say nothing at this moment of the general merits of the various provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. They have been criticized, some of them perhaps justly criticized, and they were certainly made the subject of much bellicose propaganda in Germany. But it is unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the matter, for, however unjust one might for this purpose assume the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles to have been, they contained no kind of excuse for the waging of war to secure an alteration in their terms. Not only was that treaty a settlement, by agreement, of all the difficult territorial questions which had been left outstanding by the war itself, but it established the League of Nations which, if it had been loyally supported, could so well have resolved those international differences which might otherwise have led, as indeed they eventually did lead, to war. It set up in the Council of the League, in the Assembly and in the Permanent Court of International Justice, a machine not only for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, but also for the frank ventilation of all international questions by open and free discussion. At that time, in those years after the last war, the hopes of the world stood high. Millions of men in all countriesperhaps even in Germany itselfhad laid down their lives in what they hoped and believed was a war to end war. Germany herself entered the League of Nations and was given a permanent seat on the Council; and on that Council, as in the assembly of the League, German governments which preceded that of the Defendant Von Papen in 1932 played their full part. In the years from 1919 to that time in 1932, despite some comparatively minor incidents in the heated atmosphere which followed the end of the war, the peaceful operation of the League continued. Nor was it only the operation of the League which gave ground, and good ground, for hope that at long last the rule of law would replace anarchy in the international field.</P>

<P>The statesmen of the world deliberately set out to make wars of aggression an international crime. These are no new terms invented by the victors to embody in this Charter. They have figured, and they have figured prominently, in numerous treaties in governmental pronouncements, and in the declarations of states men in the period preceding the second World War. In treaties concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other states, such as Persia in 1927, France in 1935, China in 1937, the contracting parties undertook to refrain from any act of aggression whatever against the other party. In 1933 the Soviet Union became a party to a large number of treaties containing a detailed definition of aggression, and the same definition appeared in the same year in the authoritative report of the Committee on Questions of Security set up in connection with the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments. But at this time states were going beyond commitments to refrain from wars of aggression and to assist states which were victims of aggression. They were condemning aggression in unmistakable terms. Thus in the Anti-War Treaty of Non- Aggression and Conciliation, which was signed on the 10/10/1933, by a number of American states, subsequently joined by practically all the states of the American continents and a number of European countries as well, the contracting parties solemnly declared that "they condemn wars of aggression in their mutual relations or in those of other states." And that treaty was fully incorporated into the Buenos Aires convention of 12/1936, signed and ratified by a large number of American countries, including, of course, the United States. And previously, in 1928, the 6th Pan-American Conference had adopted a resolution declaring that, as "war of aggression constitutes a crime against the human species . . . all aggression is illicit and as such is declared prohibited." A year earlier, as long ago as 9/1927, the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted a resolution affirming the conviction that "a war of aggression can never serve as a means of settling international disputes and is, in consequence, an international crime" and going on to declare that "all wars of aggression are, and shall always be prohibited."</P>

<P>The first article of the draft Treaty for Mutual Assistance of 1923 read in these terms:</P>

<P>"The High Contracting Parties, affirming that aggressive war is an international crime, undertake the solemn engagement not to make themselves guilty of this crime against any other nation."</P>

<P>In the Preamble to the Geneva Protocol of 1924, it was stated that "offensive warfare constitutes an infraction of solidarity and international crime." These instruments that I have just last mentioned remained, it is true, unratified for various reasons, but they are not without significance or value. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>These repeated declarations, these repeated condemnations of wars of aggression testified to the fact that with the establishment of the League of Nations, with the legal developments which followed it, the place of war in international law had undergone a profound change. War was ceasing to be the unrestricted prerogative of sovereign states. The Covenant of the League of Nations did not totally abolish the right of war. It left, perhaps, certain gaps which were possibly larger in theory than in practice. But in effect it surrounded the right of war by procedural and substantive checks and delays, which, if the Covenant had been faithfully observed, would have amounted to an elimination of war, not only between members of the League, but also, by reason of certain provisions of the Covenant, in the relations of non- members as well. And thus the Covenant of the League restored the position as it existed at the dawn of international law, at the time when Grotius was laying down the foundations of the modern law of nations and established the distinction, a distinction accompanied by profound legal consequences in the sphere, for instance, of neutrality, between a just war and an unjust war.</P>

<P>Nor was that development arrested with the adoption of the Covenant of the League. The right of war was further circumscribed by a series of treaties, numberingit is an astonishing figure but it is rightnearly a thousand, of arbitration and conciliation embracing practically all the nations of the world. The called Optional Clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the clause which conferred upon the Court compulsory jurisdiction in regard to the most comprehensive categories of disputes, and which constituted in effect by far the most important compulsory treaty of arbitration in the postwar period, was widely signed and ratified. Germany herself signed it in 1927 and her signature was renewed, and renewed for a period of 5 years by the Nazi government in 7/1933. (Significantly, that ratification was not again renewed on the expiration of its 5 years validity in 3/1938 by Germany). Since 1928 a considerable number of states signed and ratified the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes which was designed to fill the gaps left by the Optional Clause and by the existing treaties of arbitration and conciliation.</P>

<P>And all this vast network of instruments of pacific settlement testified to the growing conviction throughout the civilized world that war was ceasing to be the normal or the legitimate means of settling international disputes. The express condemnation of wars of aggression, which I have already mentioned, supplies the same testimony. But there was, of course, more direct evidence pointing in the same direction. The Treaty of Locarno of the 10/16/1925, to which I shall have occasion to refer presently, and to which Germany was a party, was more than a treaty of arbitration and conciliation in which the parties undertook definite obligations with regard to the pacific settlement of disputes which might arise between them. It was, subject to clearly specified exceptions of self-defense in certain contingencies, a more general undertaking in which the parties to it agreed that "they would in no case attack or invade each other or resort to war against each other." And that constituted a general renunciation of war, and it was so considered to be in the eyes of international jurists and in the public opinion of the world. The Locarno Treaty was not just another of the great number of arbitration treaties which were being concluded at this time. It was regarded as a kind of cornerstone in the European settlement and in the new legal order in Europe in partial, just, and indeed, generous substitution for the rigors of the Treaty of Versailles. And with that treaty, the term "outlawry of war" left the province of mere pacifist propaganda. It became current in the writings on international law and in the official pronouncements of governments. No one could any longer say, after the Locarno Treatyno one could any longer associate himself with the plausible assertion that at all events, as between the parties to that treaty, war remained an unrestricted right of sovereign states.</P>

<P>But, although the effect of the Locarno Treaty was limited to the parties to it, it had wider influence in paving the way towards that most fundamental, that truly revolutionary enactment in modern international law, namely, the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War of 8/27/1928, the Pact of Paris, the Kellogg-Briand Pact. That treaty, a most deliberate and carefully prepared piece of international legislation, was binding in 1939 on more than 60 nations, including Germany. It was, and it has remained, the most widely signed and ratified international instrument. It contained no provision for its termination, and it was conceived, as I said, as the cornerstone of any future international order worthy of the name. It is fully part of international law as it stands today. and it has in no way been modified or replaced by the Charter of the United Nations. It is right, in this solemn hour in the history of the world, when the responsible leaders of a state stand accused of a premeditated breach of this great treaty which was, which remains, a source of hope and of faith for mankind, to set out in detail its two operative articles and its Preamble. Let me read them to the Tribunalfirst the Preamble, and it starts like this:</P>

<P>"The President of the German Reich"and the other states associated . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Shall we find it among the documents?</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: It will be put in. I don't think you have it at the moment.</P>

<P>"The President of the German Reich . . . deeply sensitive of their solemn duty to promote the welfare of mankind; persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of international policy should be made to the end that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing between their peoples may be perpetuated; convinced that all changes in their relations with one another should be sought only by pacific means and be the result of a peaceful and orderly progress, and that any signatory power which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war, should be denied the benefits furnished by this Treaty; hopeful that, encouraged by their example, all the other nations of the world will join in this humane endeavor and by adhering to the present treaty as soon as it comes into force bring their peoples within the scope of its beneficent provisions, thus uniting civilized nations of the world in a common renunciation of war as an instrument of their national policy . . . ."</P>

<P>Then, Article I:</P>

<P>"The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another."</P>

<P>And Article II:</P>

<P>"The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means."</P>

<P>In that treaty, that General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, practically the whole civilized world abolished war as a legally permissible means of enforcing the law or of changing it. The right of war was no longer of the essence of sovereignty. Whatever the position may have been at the time of the Hague Convention, whatever the position may have been in 1914, whatever it may have been in 1918and it is not necessary to discuss itno international lawyer of repute, no responsible statesman, no soldier concerned with the legal use of armed forces, no economist or industrialist concerned in his country's war economy could doubt that with the Pact of Paris on the statute book a war of aggression was contrary to international law. Nor have the repeated violations of the Pact by the Axis Powers in any way affected its validity. Let this be firmly and clearly stated. Those very breaches, except perhaps to the cynic and the malevolent, have added to the strength of the treaty; they provoked the sustained wrath of peoples angered by the contemptuous disregard of this great statute and determined to vindicate its provisions. The Pact of Paris is the law of nations. This Tribunal will declare it. The world must enforce it.</P>

<P>Let this also be said, that the Pact of Paris was not a clumsy instrument likely to become a kind of signpost for the guilty. It did not enable Germany to go to war against Poland and yet rely as against Great Britain and France, on any immunity from warlike action because of the very provisions of the pact. For the pact laid down expressly in its preamble that no state guilty of a violation of its provisions might invoke its benefits. And when, on the outbreak of the second World War, Great Britain and France communicated to the League of Nations that a state of war existed between them and Germany as from the 9/3/1939 they declared that by committing an act of aggression against Poland. Germany had violated her obligations assumed not only towards Poland but also towards the other signatories of the pact. A violation of the pact in relation to one signatory was an attack upon all the other signatories and they were entitled to treat it as such. I emphasize that point lest any of these defendants should seize upon the letter of the particulars of Count Two of the Indictment and seek to suggest that it was not Germany who initiated war with the United Kingdom and France on 9/3/1939. The declaration of war came from the United Kingdom and from France; the act of war and its commencement came from Germany in violation of the fundamental enactment to which she was a party.</P>

<P>The General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, this great constitutional instrument of an international society awakened to the deadly dangers of another Armageddon, did not remain an isolated effort soon to be forgotten in the turmoil of recurrent international crises. It became, in conjunction with the Covenant of the League of Nations or independently of it, the starting point for a new orientation of governments in matters of peace, war, and neutrality. It is of importance, I think, to quote just one or two of the statements which were being made by governments at that time in relation to the effect of the pact. In 1929 His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom said, in connection with the question of conferring upon the Permanent Court of International Justice jurisdiction with regard to the exercise of belligerent rights in relation to neutral statesand it illustrates the profound change which was being accepted as having taken place as a result of the Pact of Paris in international law:</P>

<P>"But the whole situation . . . . rests, and international law on the subject has been entirely built up, on the assumption that there is nothing illegitimate in the use of war as an instrument of national policy, and, as a necessary corollary, that the position and rights of neutrals are entirely independent of the circumstances of any war which may be in progress. Before the acceptance of the Covenant, the basis of the law of neutrality was that the rights and obligations of neutrals were identical as regards both belligerents, and were entirely independent of the rights and wrongs of the dispute which had led to the war, or the respective position of the belligerents at the bar of world opinion."</P>

<P>Then the Government went on:</P>

<P>"Now it is precisely this assumption which is no longer valid as regards states which are members of the League of Nations and parties to the Peace Pact. The effect of those instruments, taken together, is to deprive nations of the right to employ war as an instrument of national policy, and to forbid the states which have signed them to give aid or comfort to an offender."</P>

<P>This was being said in 1929, when there was no war upon the horizon.</P>

<P>"As between such states, there has been in consequence a fundamental change in the whole question of belligerent and neutral rights. The whole policy of His Majesty's present Government (and, it would appear, of any alternative government) is based upon a determination to comply with their obligations under the Covenant of the League and the Peace Pact. This being so, the situation which we have to envisage in the event of a war in which we were engaged is not one in which the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals will depend upon the old rules of war and neutrality, but one in which the position of the members of the League will be determined by the Covenant and by the Pact."</P>

<P>The Chief Prosecutor for the United States of America referred in his opening speech before this Tribunal to the weighty pronouncement of Mr. Stimson, the Secretary of War, in which, in 1932, he gave expression to the drastic change brought about in international law by the Pact of Paris, and it is perhaps convenient to quote the relevant passage in full:</P>

<P>"War between nations was renounced by the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This means that it has become illegal throughout practically the entire world. It is no longer to be the source and subject of rights. It is no longer to be the principle around which the duties, the conduct, and the rights of nations revolve. It is an illegal thing. Hereafter, when two nations engage in armed conflict, either one or both of them must be wrongdoersviolators of this general treaty law. We no longer draw a circle about them and treat them with the punctilios of the duelist's code. Instead we denounce them as law-breakers."</P>

<P>And nearly 10 years later, when numerous independent states lay prostrate, shattered or menaced in their very existence before the impact of the war machine of the Nazi State, the Attorney General of the United States, subsequently a distinguished member of the highest Tribunal of that great country, gave significant expression to the change which had been effected in the law as the result of the Pact of Paris in a speech for which the freedom-loving peoples of the world will always be grateful. On the 3/27/1941and I mention it now not as merely being the speech of a statesman, although it was certainly that, but as being the considered opinion of a distinguished lawyer,he said this:</P>

<P>"The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, in which Germany, Italy and Japan covenanted with us, as well as with other nations, to renounce war as an instrument of policy, made definite the outlawry of war and of necessity altered the dependent concept of neutral obligations.</P>

<P>"The Treaty for the Renunciation of War and the Argentine Anti-War Treaty deprived their signatories of the right of war as an instrument of national policy or aggression and rendered unlawful wars undertaken in violation of these provisions. In consequence these treaties destroyed the historical and juridical foundations of the doctrine of neutrality conceived as an attitude of absolute impartiality in relation to aggressive wars . . . .</P>

<P>"It follows that the state which has gone to war in violation of its obligations acquires no right to equality of treatment from other states, unless treaty obligations require different handling of affairs. It derives no rights from its illegality.</P>

<P>"In flagrant cases of aggression where the facts speak so unambiguously that world opinion takes what may be the equivalent of judicial notice, we may not stymie international law and allow these great treaties to become dead letters. The intelligent public opinion of the world which is not afraid to be vocal, and the action of the American States, has made a determination that the Axis Powers are the aggressors in the wars today, which is an appropriate basis in the present state of international organizations for our policy."</P>

<P>Thus, there is no doubt that by the time the National Socialist State of Germany had embarked upon the preparation of the war of aggression against the civilized world and by the time it had accomplished that design, aggressive war had become, in virtue of the Pact of Paris and the other treaties and declarations to which I have referred, illegal and a crime beyond all uncertainty and doubt And it is on that proposition, and fundamentally on that universal treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, that Count Two of this Indictment is principally based.

<P>The Prosecution has deemed it necessaryindeed, imperativeto establish beyond all possibility of question, at what I am afraid may appear to be excessive length, that only superficial learning or culpable sentimentality can assert that there is any significant element of retroactivity in the determination of the authors of this Charter to treat aggressive war as conduct which international law has prohibited and stigmatized as criminal. We have traced the progressive limitation of the rights of war, the renunciation and condemnation of wars of aggression, and above all, the total prohibition and condemnation of all wars conceived as an instrument of national policy. What statesman or politician in charge of the affairs of nations could doubt, from 1928 onwards, that aggressive war, or that all war, except in self- defense or for the collective enforcement of the law, or against a state which had itself violated the Pact of Paris, was unlawful and outlawed? What statesman or politician embarking upon such a war could reasonably and justifiably count upon an immunity other than that of a successful outcome of the criminal venture? What more decisive evidence of a prohibition laid down by positive international law could any lawyer desire than that which has been adduced before this Tribunal?</P>

<P>There are, it is true, some small town lawyers who deny the very existence of any international law; and indeed, as I have said, the rules of the law of nations may not satisfy the Austinian test of being imposed by a sovereign. But the legal regulation of international relations rests upon quite different juridical foundations. It depends upon consent, but upon a consent which, once given, cannot be withdrawn by unilateral action. In the international field the Source of law is not the command of a sovereign but the treaty agreement binding upon every state which has adhered to it. And it is indeed true, and the recognition of its truth today by all the great powers of the world is vital to our future peaceit is indeed true that, as M. Litvinov once said, and as Great Britain fully accepts:</P>

<P>"Absolute sovereignty and entire liberty of action only belong to such states as have not undertaken international obligations. Immediately a state accepts international obligations it limits its sovereignty."</P>

<P>In that way and that way alone lies the future peace of the world. Yet it may be argued that although war itself was outlawed and forbidden, it was not criminally outlawed and criminally forbidden. International law, it may be said, does not attribute criminality to states and still less to individuals. But can it really be said on behalf of these defendants that the offense of these aggressive wars, which plunged millions of people to their death, which by dint of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity brought about the torture and extermination of countless thousands of innocent civilians, which devastated cities, which destroyed the amenitiesnay the most rudimentary necessities of civilization in many countrieswhich has brought the world to the brink of ruin from which it will take generations to recoverwill it seriously be said by these defendants that such a war is only an offense, only an illegality, only a matter of condemnation perhaps sounding in damages, but not a crime justiciable by any Tribunal? No law worthy of the name can allow itself to be reduced to an absurdity in that way, and certainly the great powers responsible for this Charter were not prepared to admit it. They draw the inescapable conclusion from the renunciation, the prohibition, the condemnation of war which had become part of the law of nations, and they refuse to reduce justice to impotence by subscribing to the outworn doctrines that a sovereign state can commit no crime and that no crime can be committed on behalf of the sovereign state by individuals acting in its behalf. They refuse to stultify themselves, and their refusal and their decision has decisively shaped the law for this Tribunal.</P>

<P>If this be an innovation, it is an innovation long overduea desirable and beneficent innovation fully consistent with justice, fully consistent with common sense and with the abiding purposes of the law of nations. But is it indeed an innovation? Or is it no more than the logical development of the law? There was indeed a time when international lawyers used to maintain that the liability of the state, because of its sovereignty, was limited to a contractual responsibility. International tribunals have not accepted that view. They have repeatedly affirmed that a state can commit a tort; that it may be guilty of trespass, of nuisance, and of negligence. And they have gone further. They have held that a state may be bound to pay what are in effect penal damages. In a recent case decided in 1935 between the United States and Canada, an arbitral tribunal, with the concurrence of its American member, decided that the United States were bound to pay what amounted to penal damages for an affront to Canadian sovereignty. And on a wider plane, the Covenant of the League of Nations, in providing for sanctions, recognized the principle of enforcement of the law against collective units, such enforcement to be, if necessary, of a penal character. And so there is not anything startlingly new in the adoption of the principle that the state as such is responsible for its criminal acts. In fact, save for reliance on the unconvincing argument of sovereignty, there is in law no reason why a state should not be answerable for crimes committed on its behalf. A hundred years ago Dr. Lushington, a great English Admiralty judge, refused to admit that a state could not be a pirate. Historyvery recent historydoes not warrant the view that a state cannot be a criminal. On the other hand, the immeasurable potentialities for evil, inherent in the state in this age of science and organization would seem to demand, quite imperatively, means of repression of criminal conduct even more drastic and more effective than in the case of individuals. And insofar, therefore, as this Charter has put on record the principle of the criminal responsibility of the state, it must be applauded as a wise and far-seeing measure of international legislation.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: [Continuing.] I was saying before the recess that there could be no doubt about the principle of criminal responsibility on the part of the state which engaged in aggressive war.</P>

<P>Admittedly, the conscience shrinks from the rigors of collective punishment, which may fall upon the guilty and the innocent alike, although, it may be noted, most of these innocent victims would not have hesitated to reap the fruits of the criminal act if it had been successful. Humanity and justice will find means of mitigating any injustice in collective punishment. Above all, much hardship can be obviated by making the punishment fall upon the individuals who were themselves directly responsible for the criminal conduct of their state. It is here that the powers who framed this Charter took a step which justice, sound legal sense, and an enlightened appreciation of the good of mankind must acclaim without cavil or reserve. The Charter lays down expressly that there shall be individual responsibility for the crimes, including the crimes against the peace, committed on behalf of the state. The state is not an abstract entity. Its rights and duties are the rights and dUties of men. Its actions are the actions of men. It is a salutary principle, a principle of law, that politicians who embark upon a particular policyas hereof aggressive war should not be able to seek immunity behind the intangible personality of the state. It is a salutary legal rule that persons who, in violation of the law, plunge their own and other countries into an aggressive war should do so with a halter around their necks.</P>

<P>To say that those who aid and abet, who counsel and procure a crime are themselves criminals, is a commonplace in our own municipal law. Nor is the principle of individual international responsibility for offenses against the law of nations altogether new. It has been applied not only to pirates. The entire law relating to war crimes, as distinct from the crime of war, is based upon the principle of individual responsibility. The future of international law, and indeed, of the world itself, depends on its application in a much wider sphere, in particular, in that of safeguarding the peace of the world. There must be acknowledged not only, as in the Charter of the United Nations, fundamental human rights, but also, as in the Charter of this Tribunal, fundamental human duties and of these none is more vital, none is more fundamental, than the duty not to vex the peace of nations in violation of the clearest legal prohibitions and undertakings. If this be an innovation, it is an innovation which we are prepared to defend and to justify, but it is not an innovation which creates a new crime. International law had already, before the Charter was adopted, constituted aggressive war a criminal act.</P>

<P>There is thus no substantial retroactivity in the provisions of the Charter. It merely fixes the responsibility for a crime already clearly established as such by positive law upon its actual perpetrators. It fills a gap in international criminal procedure. There is all the difference between saying to a man, "You will now be punished for what was not a crime at all at the time you committed it," and in saying to him, "You will now pay the penalty for conduct which was contrary to law and a crime when you executed it, although, owing to the imperfection of the international machinery, there was at that time no court competent to pronounce judgment against you." It is that latter course which we adopt, and if that be retroactivity, we proclaim it to be most fully consistent with that higher justice which, in the practice of civilized states, has set a definite limit to the retroactive operation of laws. Let the defendants and their protagonists complain that the Charter is in this matter an ex parte fiat of the victors. These victors, composing, as they do, the overwhelming majority of the nations of the world, represent also the world's sense of justice, which would be outraged if the crime of war, after this second world conflict, were to remain unpunished. In thus interpreting, declaring, and supplementing the existing law, these states are content to be judged by the verdict of history. Securus judicat orbis terrarum. Insofar as the Charter of this Tribunal introduces new law, its authors have established a precedent for the futurea precedent operative against all, including themselves, but in essence that law, rendering recourse to aggressive war an international crime, had been well established when the Charter was adopted. It is only by way of corruption of language that it can be described as a retroactive law.</P>

<P>There remains the question, with which I shall not detain the Tribunal for long, whether these wars which were launched by Germany and her leaders in violation of treaties or agreements or assurances were also wars of aggression. A war of aggression is a war which is resorted to in violation of the international obligation not to have recourse to war, or, in cases in which war is not totally renounced, which is resorted to in disregard of the duty to utilize the procedure of pacific settlement which a state has bound itself to observe. There was, as a matter of fact, in the period between the two world wars, a divergence of opinion among jurists and statesmen whether it was preferable to attempt in advance a legal definition of aggression, or to leave to the states concerned and to the collective organs of the international community freedom of appreciation of the facts in any particular situation that might arise. Those holding the latter view argued that a rigid definition might be abused by an unscrupulous state to fit in with its aggressive design; they feared, and the British Government was for a time among those who took this view, that an automatic definition of aggression might become "a trap for the innocent and a signpost for the guilty." Others held that in the interest of certainty and security a definition of aggression, like a definition of any crime in municipal law, was proper and useful. They urged that the competent international organs, political and judicial, could be trusted to avoid in any particular case a definition of aggression which might lead to obstruction or to an absurdity. In 5/1933 the Committee on Security Questions of the Disarmament Conference proposed a definition of aggression on these lines:</P>

<P>"The aggressor in an international conflict shall, subject to the agreements in force between the parties to the dispute, be considered to be that state which is the first to commit any of the following actions:</P>

<P>"(1) Declaration of war upon another state;</P>

<P>"(2) Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another state;</P>

<P>"(3) Attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels, or aircraft of another state;</P>

<P>"(4) Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another state;</P>

<P>"(5) Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another state, or refusal notwithstanding the request of the invaded state, to take in its own territory all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection."</P>

<P>The various treaties concluded in 1933 by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other states followed closely that definition. So did the draft convention submitted in 1933 by His Majesty's Government to the Disarmament Conference.</P>

<P>However, it is unprofitable to elaborate here the details of the problem or of the definition of aggression. This Tribunal will not allow itself to be deflected from its purpose by attempts to ventilate in this Court what is an academic and, in the circumstances an utterly unreal controversy as to what is the nature of a war of aggression, for there is no definition of aggression, general or particular, which does not cover and cover abundantly and irresistibly in every detail, the premeditated onslaught by Germany on the territorial integrity and political independence of so many sovereign states.</P>

<P>This, then, being the law as we submit it to be to this Tribunal that the peoples of the world by the Pact of Paris had finally outlawed war and made it criminalI turn now to the facts to see how these defendants under their leader and with their associates destroyed the high hopes of mankind and sought to revert to international anarchy. First, let this be said, for it will be established beyond doubt by the documents which you will see, from the moment Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, with the Defendant Von Papen as Reich Chancellor, and with the Defendant Von Neurath as his Foreign Minister, the whole atmosphere of the world darkened. The hopes of the people began to recede. Treaties seemed no longer matters of solemn obligation but were entered into with complete cynicism as a means for deceiving other states of Germany's warlike intentions. International conferences were no longer to be used as a means for securing pacific settlements but as occasions for obtaining by blackmail demands which were eventually to be enlarged by war. The world came to know the "war of nerves", the diplomacy of the fait accompli, of blackmail and bullying. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>In 10/1933 Hitler told his Cabinet that as the proposed Disarmament Convention did not concede full equality to Germany, "It would be necessary to torpedo the Disarmament Conference. It was out of the question to negotiate: Germany would leave the Conference and the League". On the 10/21/1933 Germany did so, and by so doing struck a deadly blow at the fabric of security which had been built up on the basis of the League Covenant. From that time on the record of their foreign policy became one of complete disregard of international obligations, and indeed not least of those solemnly concluded by themselves. Hitler himself expressly avowed to his confederates, "Agreements are kept only so long as they serve a certain purpose." He might have added that again and again that purpose was only to lull an intended victim into a false sense of security. So patent, indeed, did this eventually become that to be invited by the Defendant Ribbentrop to enter a non-aggression pact with Germany was almost a sign that Germany intended to attack the state concerned. Nor was it only the formal treaty which they used and violated as circumstances seemed to make expedient. These defendants are charged, too, with breaches of the less formal assurances which, in accordance with diplomatic usage, Germany gave to neighboring states. You will hear the importance which Hitler himself publicly attached to assurances of that kind. Today, with the advance of science, the world has been led means of communication and intercourse hitherto unknown, and as Hitler himself expressly recognized in his public utterances, international relations no longer depend upon treaties alone. The methods of diplomacy change. The leader of one nation can speak directly to the government and peoples of another, and that course was not infrequently adopted by the Nazi conspirators. But, although the methods change, the principles of good faith and honesty, established as the fundamentals of civilized society, both in the national and international spheres, remain unaltered. It is a long time since it was said that we are part one of another, and if today the different states are more closely connected and thus part of a world society more than ever before, so also, more before, is there that need for good faith and honesty between them.</P>

<P>Let us see how these defendants, ministers and high officers of the Nazi Government, individually and collectively comported themselves in these matters.</P>

<P>On the 9/1/1939 in the early hours of the morning under manufactured and, in any event, inadequate pretexts, the Armed Forces of the German Reich invaded Poland along the whole length of her frontiers and thus launched the war which was to bring down so many of the pillars of our civilization.</P>

<P>It was a breach of the Hague Conventions. It was a breach of the Treaty of Versailles which had established the frontiers between Germany and Poland. And however much Germany disliked that treaty-although Hitler had expressly stated that he would respect its territorial provisionshowever much she disliked it, she was not free to break it by unilateral action: It was a breach of the Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Poland concluded at Locarno on 10/16/1925. By that treaty Germany and Poland expressly agreed to refer any matters of dispute not capable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic machinery to the decision of an arbitral tribunal or of the Permanent Court of International Justice. as a breach of the Pact of Paris. But that is not all. It was also a breach of a more recent and, in view of the repeated emphasis laid upon it by Hitler himself, in some ways a more important engagement into which Nazi Germany had entered with Poland. After the Nazi Government came into power, on the 1/2/1934 the German and Polish Governments had signed a 10 year pact of non-aggression. It was, as the signatories themselves stated, to introduce a new era into the political relations between Poland and Germany. It was said in the text of the pact itself that "the maintenance and guarantee of lasting peace between the two countries is an essential prerequisite for the general peace of Europe." The two governments therefore agreed to base their mutual relations on the principles laid down in the Pact of Paris and they solemnly declared that:</P>

<P>"In no circumstances ... will they proceed to the application of force for the purpose of reaching a decision in such disputes."</P>

<P>That declaration and agreement was to remain in force for at least 10 years and thereafter it was to remain valid unless it was denounced by either Government 6 months before the expiration of the 10 years, or subsequently by 6 months' notice. Both at the time of its signature and during the following 4 years Hitler spoke of the German-Polish agreement publicly as though it were a cornerstone of his foreign policy. By entering into it, he persuaded many people that his intentions were genuinely pacific, for the re-emergence of a new Poland and an independent Poland after the war had cost Germany much territory and had separated East Prussia from the Reich. And that Hitler should, of his own accord, enter into friendly relations with Polandthat in his speeches on foreign policy he should proclaim his recognition of Poland and of her right to an exit to the sea, and the necessity for Germans and Poles to live side by side in amitythese facts seemed to the world to be convincing proof that Hitler had no "revisionist" aims which would threaten the peace of Europe; that he was even genuinely anxious to put an end to the age- old hostility between the Teuton and the Slav. If his professions were, as embodied in the treaty and as contained in these declarations, genuine, his policy excluded a renewal of the "Drang nach Osten", as it had been called, and was thereby going to contribute to the peace and stability of Europe. That was what the people were led to think. We shall have occasion enough to see how little truth these pacific professions in fact contained.</P>

<P>The history of the fateful years from 1934-1939 shows quite clearly that the Germans used this treaty, as they used other treaties, merely as an instrument of policy for furthering their aggressive aims. It is clear from the documents which will be presented to the Tribunal that these 5 years fall into two distinct phases in the realization of the aggressive aims which always underlay the Nazi policy. There was first the period from the Nazi assumption of power in 1933 until the autumn of 1937. That was the preparatory period. During that time there occurred the breaches of the Versailles and Locarno Treaties, the feverish rearmament of Germany, the reintroduction of conscription, the reoccupation and remilitarization of the Rhineland, and all those other necessary preparatory measures for future aggression which my American colleagues have already so admirably put before the Tribunal.</P>

<P>During that periodthe preparatory periodGermany was lulling Poland into a false sense of security. Not only Hitler, but the Defendant Goering and the Defendant Ribbentrop made statements approbating the non-aggression pact. In 1935 Goering was saying that, "The pact was not planned for a period of 10 years forever; there need not be the slightest fear that it would not be continued " Even though Germany was steadily building up the greatest war machine that Europe had ever known, and although, by 1/1937, the German military position was so strong and secure that, in spite of the treaty breaches which it involved, Hitler could openly refer to his strong Army, he took pains, at the same time, to sayand again I quotethat:</P>

<P>"By a series of agreements we have eliminated existing tensions and thereby contributed considerably to an improvement in the European atmosphere. I merely recall the agreement with Poland which has worked out to the advantage of both sides."</P>

<P>And so it went on: abroad, protestations of pacific intentions; at home, "guns before butter." [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>In 1937 this preparatory period drew to a close and Nazi policy moved from general preparation for future aggression to specific planning for the attainment of certain specific aggressive aims. And there are two documents in particular which mark that change.</P>

<P>The first of these was called "Directive for Unified Preparation for War", issued in 6/19376/29/1937by the Reich Minister for War, who was then Von Blomberg, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. That document is important, not only for its military directions, but for the appreciation it contained of the European situation and for the revelation of the Nazi attitude towards it.</P>

<P>"The general political position"Von Blomberg stated, and I am quoting from the document"justifies the supposition that Germany need not consider an attack from any side. Grounds for this are, in addition to the lack of desire for war in almost all nations, particularly the Western Powers, the deficiencies the preparedness for war of a number of states, and of Russia in particular."</P>

<P>It is true, he added, "The intention of unleashing a European war is held just as little by Germany." And it may be that that phrase was carefully chosen because, as the documents will show, Germany hoped to conquer Europe, perhaps to conquer the world in detail; to fight on one front at a time, against one power at time, and not to unleash a general European conflict. But Von Blomberg went on:</P>

<P>"The politically fluid world situation, which does not preclude surprising incidents, demands a continuous preparedness for war of the German Armed Forces (a) to counter attack at any time"yet he had just said that there was no fear of any attackand "(b)"and I invite the Tribunal again to notice this phrase"to enable the military exploitation of politically favorable opportunities, should they occur."</P>

<P>That phrase is no more than a euphemistic description of aggressive war. It reveals the continued adherence of the German military leaders to the doctrine that military might, and if necessary war, should be an instrument of policythe doctrine which had been explicitly condemned by the Kellogg Pact, which was renounced by the pact with Poland, and by innumerable other treaties.</P>

<P>The document goes on to set out the general preparations necessary for a possible war in the mobilization period of 1937-1938. It is evidence at least for this, that the leaders of the German Armed Forces had it in mind to use the military strength which they were building up for aggressive purposes. No reason, they say, to anticipate attack from any sidethere is a lack of desire for war. Yet they prepare to exploit militarily favorable opportunities.</P>

<P>Still more important as evidence of the transition to planned aggression is the record of the important conference which Hitler held at the Reich Chancellery on the 11/5/1937, at which Von Blomberg, Reich Minister for War; Von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army; Goering, Commander- in-Chief of the Luftwaffe; Raeder, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and Von Neurath, then the Foreign Minister, were present. The minutes of that conference have already been put in evidence. I refer to them now only to emphasize those passages which make apparent the ultimate intention to wage an aggressive war. You will remember that the burden of Hitler's argument at that conference was that Germany required more territory in Europe. Austria and Czechoslovakia were specifically envisaged. But Hitler realized that the process of conquering those two countries might well bring into operation the treaty obligations of Great Britain and of France. He was prepared to take the risk. You remember the passage:</P>

<P>"The history of all times: Roman Empire, British Empire has proved that every space expansion can be effected only by breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are unavoidable: Neither formerly nor today has space been found without an owner. The attacker always comes up against the proprietor. The question for Germany is where the greatest possible conquest can be made at the lowest possible cost."</P>

<P>In the course of that conference Hitler had foreseen and discussed the likelihood that Poland would be involved if the aggressive expansionist aims which he put forward brought about a general European war in the course of their realization by the Nazi State. And when, therefore, on that very day on which that conference was taking place, Hitler assured the Polish Ambassador of the great value of the 1934 Pact with Poland, it can only be concluded that its real value in Hitler's eyes was that of keeping Poland quiet until Germany had acquired such a territorial and strategic position that Poland was no longer a danger.</P>

<P>That view is confirmed by the events which followed. At the beginning of 2/1938 the change from Nazi preparation for aggression to active aggression itself took place. It was marked by the substitution of Ribbentrop for Neurath as Foreign Minister, and of Keitel for Blomberg as head of the OKW. Its first fruits were the bullying of Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden on 2/12/1938 and the forcible absorption of Austria in March. Thereafter the Green Plan for the destruction of Czechoslovakia was steadily developed in the way which you heard yesterdaythe plan partially foiled, or final consummation at least delayed, by the Munich Agreement.</P>

<P>With those aspects, those developments of Nazi aggression, my American colleagues have already dealt. But it is obvious that the acquisition of these two countries, their resources m manpower, their resources in the production of munitions of war, immensely strengthened the position of Germany as against Poland. And it is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that, just as the Defendant Goering assured the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, at the time of the Nazi invasion of Austria, that Hitler recognized the validity of the German- Czechoslovak Arbitration Treaty of 1925, and that Germany had no designs against Czechoslovakia herself you remember, "I give you my word of honor," the Defendant Goering saidjust as that is not surprising, so also it is not perhaps surprising that continued assurances should have been given during 1938 to Poland in order to keep that country from interfering with the Nazi aggression on Poland's neighbors.</P>

<P>Thus, on the 2/20/1938, on the eve of his invasion of Austria Hitler, referring to the fourth anniversary of the Polish Pact, permitted-himself to say this to the Reichstagand I quote:</P>

<P>"... and so a way to a friendly understanding has been successfully paved, an understanding which, beginning with Danzig, has today in spite of the attempt of some mischief makers succeeded in finally taking the poison out of the relations between Germany and Poland and transforming them into a sincere friendly co-operation ... Relying on her friendships, Germany will not leave a stone unturned to save that ideal which provides the foundation for the task ahead of us-peace."</P>

<P>Still more striking, perhaps, are the cordial references to Poland in Hitler's speech in the Sportpalast at Berlin on the 9/26/1938. He then said:</P>

<P>"The most difficult problem with which I was confronted was that of our relations with Poland. There was a danger that Poles and Germans would regard each other as hereditary enemies. I wanted to prevent this. I know well enough that I should not have been successful if Poland had had a democratic constitution. For these democracies which indulge in phrases about peace are the most bloodthirsty war agitators. In Poland there ruled no democracy, but a man. And with him I succeeded, in precisely 12 months, in coming to an agreement which, for 10 years in the first instance, removed in principle the danger of a conflict. We are all convinced that this agreement will bring lasting pacification. We realize that here are two peoples which must live together and neither of which can do away with the other. A people of 33 millions will always strive for an outlet to the sea. A way for understanding, then, had to be found, and it will be further extended. But the main fact is that the two governments, and all reasonable and clear-sighted persons among the two peoples within the two countries, possess the firm will and determination to improve their relations. It was a real work of peace, of more worth than all the chattering in the League of Nations palace at Geneva." [=]</P>

<P>And so flattery of Poland preceded the annexation of Austria and renewed flattery of Poland preceded the projected annexation of Czechoslovakia. The realities behind these outward expressions of good will are clearly revealed in the documents relating to the Fall Gruen, which are already before the Tribunal. They show Hitler as fully aware that there was a risk of Poland, England, and France being involved in war to prevent the German annexation of Czechoslovakia and that this risk, although it was realized, was also accepted. On 8/25/1938 top-secret orders to the German Air Force in regard to the operations to be conducted against England and France, if they intervened, pointed out that, as the French-Czechoslovak Treaty provided for assistance only in the event of an "unprovoked" attack, it would take a day or two for France and England, and I suppose for their legal advisors to decide whether legally the attack had been unprovoked or not, and consequently a Blitzkrieg, accomplishing its aims before there could be any effective intervention by France or England, was the object to be aimed at.</P>

<P>On the same day an Air Force memorandum on future organization was issued, and to it there was attached a map on which the Baltic States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland were all shown as part of Germany, and preparations for expanding the Air Force, and I quote, "as the Reich grows in area," as well as dispositions for two-front war against France and Russia, were discussed. And on the following day Von Ribbentrop was being minuted about the reaction of Poland towards the Czechoslovak problem. I quote: "The fact that after the liquidation of the Czechoslovakian question it will be generally assumed that Poland will be next in turn is not to be denied," is recognized, but it is stated, "The later this assumption sinks in, the better."</P>

<P>I will pause for a moment at the date of the Munich Agreement and ask the Tribunal to remind itself of what the evidence of documents and historical facts shows up to that day. It has made undeniable both the fact of Nazi aggressiveness and of active and actual aggression. Not only does that conference of 1937 show Hitler and his associates deliberately considering the acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia, if necessary by war, but the first of the operations had been carried through in 3/1938; and a large part of the second, under threat of wara threat which as we now see was much more than a bluffa threat of actual and real war, although without the actual need for its initiation, secured, as I said, a large part of the second objective in 9/1938. And, more ominous still, Hitler had revealed his adherence to the old doctrines of Mein Kampfthose essentially aggressive doctrines to the exposition of which in Mein Kampf, long regarded as the Bible of the Nazi Party, we shall draw attention in certain particular passages. Hitler is indicating quite clearly not only to his associates but indeed to the world at this time, that he is in pursuit of Lebensraum and that he means to secure it by threat of force, or threat of force fails, by actual forceby aggressive war.</P>

<P>So far actual warfare had been avoided because of the love of peace, the lack of preparedness, the patience, the cowardicecall it what you willof the democratic powers; but after Munich the question which filled the minds of all thinking people with acute anxiety was "where will this thing end? Is Hitler now satisfied as he declared himself to be? Or is his pursuit of Lebensraum going to lead to future aggressions, even if he has to embark on ope aggressive war to secure it?"</P>

<P>It was in relation to the remainder of Czechoslovakia and to Poland that the answer to these questions was to be given. So far, up to the time of the Munich Agreement, no direct and immediate threat to Poland had been made. The two documents from which I have just quoted, show of course, that high officers of the Defendant Goering's air staff already regarded the expansion of the Reich and, it would seem, the destruction and absorption of Poland as a foregone conclusion. They were already anticipating, indeed, the last stage of Hitler's policy as expounded in Mein Kampfwar to destroy France and to secure Lebensraum in Russia. And the writer of the minute to Ribbentrop already took it for granted that, after Czechoslovakia, Poland would be attacked. But more impressive than those two documents is the fact that, as I have said, at the conference of 11/5/1937, war with Poland, if she should dare to prevent German aggression against Czechoslovakia, had been quite coolly and calmly contemplated, and the Nazi leaders were ready to take the risk. So also had the risk of war with England and France under the same circumstances been considered and accepted. As I indicated, such a war would, of course, have been aggressive war on Germany's part, and they were contemplating aggressive warfare. For to force one state to take up arms to defend another state against aggression, in other words, to fulfill its treaty obligations is undoubtedly to initiate aggressive warfare against the first state. But in spite of those plans, in spite of these intentions behind the scenes, it remains true that until Munich the decision for direct attack upon Poland and her destruction by aggressive war had apparently not as yet been taken by Hitler and his associates It is to the transition from the intention and preparation of initiating aggressive war, evident in regard to Czechoslovakia, to the actual initiation and waging of aggressive war against Poland that I now pass. That transition occupies the 11 months from the 10/1/1938 to the actual attack on Poland on the 9/1/1939.</P>

<P>Within 6 months of the signature of the Munich Agreement the Nazi leaders had occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, which by that Agreement they had indicated their willingness to guarantee On the 3/141939 the aged and infirm president of the "rump" of Czechoslovakia, Hacha and his Foreign Minister were summoned to Berlin. At a meeting held between 1 o'clock and 2:15 in the small hours of the 15th of March in the presence of Hitler of the Defendants Ribbentrop, Goering, and Keitel, they were bullied and threatened and even bluntly told that Hitler "had issued the orders for the German troops to move into Czechoslovakia and for the incorporation of Czechoslovakia into the German Reich."</P>

<P>It was made quite clear to them that resistance would be useless and would be crushed "by force of arms with all available means," and it was thus that the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up and that Slovakia was turned into a German satellite, though nominally independent state. By their own unilateral action, on pretexts which had no shadow of validity, without discussion with the governments of any other country, without mediation, and in direct contradiction of the sense and spirit of the Munich Agreement, the Germans acquired for themselves that for which they had been planning in September of the previous year, and indeed much earlier but which at that time they had felt themselves unable completely to secure without too patent an exhibition of their aggressive intentions. Aggression achieved whetted the appetite for aggression to come. There were protests. England and France sent diplomatic notes. Of course, there were protests. The Nazis had clearly shown their hand. Hitherto they had concealed from the outside world that their claims went beyond incorporating into the Reich persons of German race living in bordering territory. Now for the first time, in defiance of their solemn assurances to the contrary, non-German territory and non- German people had been seized. This acquisition of the whole of Czechoslovakia, together with the equally illegal occupation of Memel on the 3/22/1939, resulted in an immense strengthening of the German positions, both politically and strategically, as Hitler had anticipated it would, when he discussed the matter at that conference in 11/1937.

<P>But long before the consummation by the Nazi leaders of their aggression against Czechoslovakia, they had begun to make demands upon Poland. The Munich settlement achieved on the 10/25/1938, that is to say within less than a month of Hitler's reassuring speech about Poland to which I have already referred and within, of course, a month of the Munich Agreement, M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador in Berlin, reported to M. Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, that at a luncheon at Berchtesgaden the day before, namely, on the 10/24/1938, the Defendant Ribbentrop had put forward demands for the reunion of Danzig With the Reich and for the building of an extra-territorial motor road and railway line across Pomorze, the province which the Germans called "The Corridor". From that moment onwards until the Polish Government had made it plain, as they did during a visit of the Defendant Ribbentrop to Warsaw in 1/1939, that they Would not consent to hand over Danzig to German sovereignty, negotiationS on these German demands continued. And even after Ribbentrop's return from the visit to Warsaw, Hitler thought it Worthwhile in his Reichstag speech on the 1/30/1939, to say:</P>

<P>"We have just celebrated the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of our non-aggression pact with Poland. There can scarcely be any difference of opinion today among the true friends of peace as to the value of this agreement. One only needs to ask oneself what might have happened to Europe if this agreement, which brought such relief, had not been entered into 5 years ago. In signing it, the great Polish marshal and patriot rendered his people just as great a service as the leaders of the National Socialist State rendered the German people. During the troubled months of the past year, the friendship between Germany and Poland has been one of the reassuring factors in the political life of Europe."</P>

<P>But that utterance was the last friendly word from Germany to Poland, and the last occasion on which the Nazi Leaders mentioned the German-Polish Agreement with approbation. During 2/1939 silence fell upon German demands in relation to Poland. But as soon as the final absorption of Czechoslovakia had taken place and Germany had also occupied Memel, Nazi pressure upon Poland was at once renewed. In two conversations which he and the Defendant Ribbentrop held on the 21st of March and the 26th of March, respectively, with the Polish Ambassador, German demands upon Poland were renewed and were further pressed. And in view of the fate which had overtaken Czechoslovakia, in view of the grave deterioration in her strategical position towards Germany, it is not surprising that the Polish Government took alarm at the developments. Nor were they alone. The events of 3/1939 had at last convinced both the English and the French Governments that the Nazi designs Of aggression were not limited to men of German race, and that the specter of European war resulting from further aggressions by Nazi Germany had not, after all, been exorcised by the Munich Agreement.</P>

<P>As a result, therefore, of the concern of Poland and of England and of France at the events in Czechoslovakia, and at the newly applied pressure on Poland, conversations between the English and Polish Governments had been taking place, and, on the 3/31/1939, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, speaking in the House of Commons, stated that His Majesty's Government had given an assurance to help Poland in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist. On the 4/6/1939 an Anglo-Polish communique stated that the two countries were prepared to enter into an agreement of a permanent and reciprocal character to replace the present temporary and unilateral assurance given by His Majesty's Government.</P>

<P>The justification for that concern on the part of the democratic powers is not difficult to find. With the evidence which we now have of what was happening within the councils of the German Reich and its Armed Forces during these months, it is manifest that the German Government were intent on seizing Poland as a whole, that Danzigas Hitler himself was to say in time, a month later was not the subject of the dispute at all." The Nazi Government was intent upon aggression and the demands and negotiations in respect to Danzig were merely a cover and excuse for further domination. . Would that be a convenient point to stop?</P>

<P>Afternoon Session</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Before the Attorney General continues his opening statement, the Tribunal wishes me to state what they propose to do as to time of sitting for the immediate future. We think it will be more convenient that the Tribunal shall sit from 10:00 o'clock in the morning until 1:00 o'clock, with a break for 10 minutes in the middle of the morning; and that the Tribunal shall sit in the afternoon from 2:00 o'clock until 5:00 o'clock with a break for 10 minutes in the middle of the afternoon, and that there shall be no open sitting of the Tribunal on Saturday morning, as the Tribunal has a very large number of applications by the defendants' counsel for witnesses and documents and other matters of that sort which it has to consider.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: May it please the Tribunal, when we broke off I had been saying that the Nazi Government was intent upon aggression, and all that had been taking place in regard to Danzigthe negotiations, the demands that were being made-were really no more than a cover, a pretext and excuse for further domination.</P>

<P>As far back as 9/1938 plans for aggressive war against Poland, England, and France were well in hand. While Hitler, at Munich, was telling the world that the German people wanted peace, and that having solved the Czechoslovakian problem, Germany had no more territorial problems in Europe, the staffs of his Armed Forces were already preparing their plans. On the 9/26/1938 he had stated:</P>

<P>"We have given guarantees to the states in the West. We have assured all our immediate neighbors of the integrity of their territory as far as Germany is concerned. That is no mere phrase. It is our sacred will. We have no interest whatever in a breach of the peace. We want nothing from these peoples."</P>

<P>And the world was entitled to rely on those assurances. International co-operation is utterly impossible unless one can assume good faith in the leaders of the various states and honesty in the public utterances that they make. But, in fact, within 2 months of that solemn and apparently considered undertaking, Hitler and his confederates were preparing for the seizure of Danzig. To recognize those assurances, those pledges, those diplomatic moves as the empty frauds that they were, one must go back to inquire what was happening within the inner councils of the Reich from the time of the Munich Agreement.</P>

<P>Written some time in 9/1938 is an extract from a file on the reconstruction of the German Navy. Under the heading</P>

<P>"Opinion on the Draft Study of Naval Warfare against England," this is stated:</P>

<P>"1. If, according to the Fuehrer's decision, Germany is to acquire a position as a world power, she needs not only sufficient colonial possessions but also secure naval communications and secure access to the ocean.</P>

<P>"2. Both requirements can be fulfilled only in opposition to Anglo-French interests and would limit their position as world powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by peaceful means. The decision to make Germany a world power, therefore, forces upon us the necessity of making the corresponding preparations for war.</P>

<P>"3. War against England means at the same time war against the Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well, and a large number of countries overseas, in fact, against one- third to one-half of the world.</P>

<P>"It can only be justified and have a chance of success"and it was not moral justification which was being looked for in this document"It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is prepared economically as well as politically and militarily, and waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an outlet to the ocean."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I think the Tribunal would like to know at what stage you propose to put the documents, which you are citing, in evidence.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: Well, Sir, my colleagues, my American and my British colleagues, were proposing to follow up my own address by putting these documents in. The first series of documents which will be put in by my noted colleague, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe will be the treaties.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I suppose that what you quote will have to be read again.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: Well, I am limiting my quotations as far as I possibly can. I apprehend that technically you may wish it to be quoted again, so as to get it on the record when the document is actually put into evidence. But I think it will appear, when the documents themselves are produced, that there will be a good deal more in most of them than I am actually citing now.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Very well.</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: This document on naval warfare against England is something which is both significant and new. Until this date the documents in our possession disclose preparations for war against Poland, England, and France, purporting on the face of them at least to be defensive measures to ward off attacks which might result from the intervention of those states in the preparatory German aggressions in Central Europe. Hitherto aggressive war against Poland, England, and France has been contemplated only as a distant objective. Now, in this document for the first time, we find a war of conquest by Germany against France and England openly recognized as the future aim, at least of the German Navy.</P>

<P>On 11/24/1938 an appendix was issued by Keitel to a previous order of the Fuehrer. In that appendix were set out the future tasks for the Armed Forces and the preparation for the conduct of the war which would result from those tasks.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer has ordered"I quote"that besides the three eventualities mentioned in the previous directive ... preparations are also to be made for the surprise occupation by German troops of the Free State of Danzig.</P>

<P>"For the preparation the following principles are to be borne in mind."This is the common pattern of aggression"The primary assumption is the lightning seizure of Danzig by exploiting a favorable political situation, and not war with Poland. Troops which are going to be used for this purpose must not be held at the same time for the seizure of Memel so that both operations can take place simultaneously, should such necessity arise."</P>

<P>Thereafter, as the evidence which is already before the Tribunal has shown, final preparations were taking place for the invasion of Poland. On the 4/3/1939, 3 days before the issue of the Anglo-Polish communique, the Defendant Keitel issued to the High Command of the Armed Forces a directive in which it was stated that the directive for the uniform preparation of war by the Armed Forces in 1939-1940, was being re-issued and that part relating to Danzig would be out in April. The basic principles were to remain the same as in the previous directive. Attached to this document were the orders Fall Weiss, the code name for the proposed invasion of Poland. Preparation for that invasion was to be made, it was stated, so that the operation could be carried out at any time from the 1st of 9/1939 onwards. [=]</P>

<P>Country of Publication: Germany</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>On the 11th of April Hitler issued his directive for the uniform preparation of the war by the Armed Forces, 1939- 1940, and in it he said:</P>

<P>"I shall lay down in a later directive future tasks of the Armed Forces and the preparations to be made in accordance with these for the conduct of war. Until that directive comes into force the Armed Forces must be prepared for the following eventualities:</P>

<P>"1. Safeguarding of the frontiers ...;</P>

<P>"2. Fall Weiss,</P>

<P>"3. The annexation of Danzig."</P>

<P>Then, in an annex to that document which bore the heading "Political Hypotheses and Aims," it was stated that quarrels with Poland should be avoided. But should Poland change her policy and adopt a threatening attitude towards Germany, a final settlement would be necessary, notwithstanding the Polish Pact. The Free City of Danzig was to be incorporated in the Reich at the outbreak of the conflict at the latest. The policy aimed at limiting the war to Poland, and this was considered possible at that time with the internal crises in France and resulting British restraint.</P>

<P>The wording of that documentand the Tribunal will study the whole of itdoes not directly involve the intention of immediate aggression. It is a plan of attack "if Poland changes her policy and adopts a threatening attitude." But the picture of Poland, with her wholly inadequate armaments, threatening Germany, now armed to the teeth, is ludicrous enough, and the real aim of the document emerges in the sentenceand I quote: "The aim is then to destroy Polish military strength and to create, in the East, a situation which satisfies the requirements of defense"a sufficiently vague phrase to cover designs of any magnitude. But even at that stage, the evidence does not suffice to prove that the actual decision to attack Poland on any given date had yet been taken. All the preparations were being set in train. All the necessary action was being proceeded with, in case that decision should be reached.</P>

<P>It was within 3 weeks of the issue of that last document that Hitler addressed the Reichstag on the 4/28/1939. In that speech he repeated the demands which had already been made upon Poland, and proceeded to denounce the German-Polish Agreement of 1934. Leaving aside for the moment, the warlike preparations for aggression, which Hitler had set in motion behind the scenes, I will ask the Tribunal to consider the nature of this denunciation of an agreement to which, in the past, Hitler had attached such importance.</P>

<P>In the first place, of course, Hitler's denunciation was per se ineffectual. The text of the agreement made no provision for its denunciation by either party until a period of 10 years had come to an end. No denunciation could be legally effective until 6-7/1943, and here was Hitler speaking in 4/1939, rather more than 5 years too soon.</P>

<P>In the second place, Hitler's actual attack upon Poland, when it came on 1 September was made before the expiration of the months' period after denunciation required by the agreement before any denunciation could be operative. And in the third place, the grounds for the denunciation stated by Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag were entirely specious. However one reads its terms, it is impossible to take the view that the Anglo- Polish guarantee of mutual assistance against aggression could render the German-Polish Pact null and void, as Hitler sought to suggest. If that had been the effect of the Anglo-Polish assurances, then certainly the pacts which had already been entered into by Hitler himself with Italy and with Japan had already invalidated the treaty with Poland. Hitler might have spared his breath. The truth is, of course, that the text of the English-Polish communique, the text of the assurances, contains nothing whatever to support the contention that the German-Polish Pact was in any way interfered with.</P>

<P>One asks: Why then did Hitler make this trebly invalid attempt to denounce his own pet diplomatic child? Is there any other possible answer but this:</P>

<P>That the agreement having served its purpose, the grounds which he chose for it's denunciation were chosen merely in an effort to provide Germany with some kind of justificationat least for the German people-for the aggression on which the German leaders were intent.</P>

<P>And, of course, Hitler sorely needed some kind of justification, some apparently decent excuse, since nothing had happened, and nothing seemed likely to happen, from the Polish side, to provide him with any kind of pretext for invading Poland. So far he had made demands upon his treaty partner which Poland, as a sovereign state, had every right to refuse. If dissatisfied with that refusal, Hitler was bound, under the terms of the agreement itself, "To seek a settlement"I am reading the words of the pact:</P>

<P>"To seek a settlement through other peaceful means, without prejudice to the possibility of applying those methods of procedure, in case of necessity, which are provided for such a case in the other agreements between them that are in force."</P>

<P>And that presumably was a reference to the German-Polish Arbitration Treaty, signed at Locarno in 1925.</P>

<P>The very facts, therefore, that as soon as the Nazi leaders cannot get what they want but are not entitled to from Poland by merely asking for it and that, on their side, they made no further attempt to settle the dispute "by peaceful means"in accordance with the terms of the agreement and of the Kellogg Pact, to which the agreement pledged both partiesin themselves constitute a strong presumption of aggressive intentions against Hitler and his associates. That presumption becomes a certainty when the documents to which I am about to call the attention of the Tribunal are studied.</P>

<P>On the 10th of May Hitler issued an order for the capture of economic installations in Poland. On the 16th of May the Defendant Raeder, as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, issued a memorandum setting out the Fuehrer's instructions to prepare for the operation Fall Weiss at any time from the 1st of September.</P>

<P>But the decisive document is the record of the conference held by Hitler on the 5/23/1939, in conference with many high- ranking officers, including the Defendants Goering, Raeder, and Keitel. The details of the whole document will have to be read to the Tribunal later and I am merely summarizing the substantial effect of this part of it now. Hitler stated that the solution of the economic problems with which Germany was beset at first, could not be found without invasion of foreign states and attacks on foreign property. "Danzig"and I am quoting:</P>

<P>"Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all. It is a question of expanding our living space in the East. There is, therefore, no question of sparing Poland, and we are left with the decision to attack Poland at the earliest opportunity. We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair. There will be fighting. Our task is to isolate Poland. The success of this isolation will be decisive. The isolation of Poland is a matter of skillful politics."</P>

<P>So he explained to his confederates. He anticipated the possibility that war with England and France might result, but a two-front war was to be avoided if possible. Yet England was recognized-and I say it with prideas the most dangerous enemy which Germany had. "England", he said, I quote, "England is the driving force against Germany. .. the aim will always be to force England to her knees." More than once he repeated that the war with England and France would be a life and death struggle. "But all the same," he concluded, "Germany will not be forced into war but she would not be able to avoid it." [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>On the 6/14/1939 General Blaskowitz, then Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Army group, issued a detailed battle plan for Fall Weiss. The following day Von Brauchitsch issued a memorandum in which it was stated that the object of the impending operation was to destroy the Polish Armed Forces. "High policy demands," he said, "High policy demands that the war should be begun by heavy surprise blows in order to achieve quick results." The preparations proceeded apace. On the 22d of June the Defendant Keitel submitted a preliminary timetable for the operation, which Hitler seems to have approved, and suggested that the scheduled maneuver must be camouflaged, "in order not to disquiet the population." On the 3rd of July, Brauchitsch wrote to the Defendant Raeder urging that certain preliminary naval moves should be abandoned, in order not to prejudice the surprise of the attack. On the 12th and 13th of August Hitler and Ribbentrop had a conference with Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister.</P>

<P>It was a conference to which the Tribunal will have to have regard from several points of view. I summarize now only on aspect of the matter: At the beginning of the conversation Hitler emphasized the strength of the German position, of Germany's Western and Eastern Fortifications, and of the strategic and other advantages they held in comparison with those of England, France and Poland. Now I quote from the captured document itself. Hitler said this:</P>

<P>"Since the Poles through their whole attitude had made it clear that, in any case, in the event of a conflict, they would stand on the side of the enemies of Germany and Italy a quick liquidation at the present moment could only be of advantage for the unavoidable conflict with the Western Democracies. If a hostile Poland remained on Germany's eastern frontier, not only would the 11 East Prussian divisions be tied down, but also further contingents would be kept in Pomerania and Silesia. This would not be necessary in the event of a previous liquidation." Then this:</P>

<P>"Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be to liquidate the false neutrals one after the other. This process could be carried out more easily if on every occasion one partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing with an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a neutral of that kind."</P>

<P>Ciano was for postponing the operation. Italy was not ready. She believed that a conflict with Poland would develop into a general European war. Mussolini was convinced that conflict with the Western Democracies was inevitable, but he was making plans for a period 2 or 3 years ahead. But the Fuehrer said that the Danzig question must be disposed of, one way or the other, by the end of August. I quote: "He had, therefore, decided to use the occasion of the next political provocation which has the form of an ultimatum ...."</P>

<P>On the 22d of August Hitler called his Supreme Commanders together and gave the order for the attack. In the course of what he said he made it clear that the decision to attack had, in fact, been made not later than the previous spring. He would give a spurious cause for starting the war. And at that time the attack was timed to take place in the early hours of the 26th of August. On the day before, on the 25th of August, the British Government, in the hope that Hitler might still be reluctant to plunge the world into war, in the belief that a formal treaty would impress him more than informal assurances which had been, given previously, entered an agreement, an express agreement for mutual assistance with Poland, embodying the previous assurances that had been given earlier in the year. It was known to Hitler that France was bound by the Franco- Polish Treaty of 1921, and by the Guarantee Pact signed at Locarno in 1925 to intervene in Poland's favor in case of aggression. And for a moment Hitler hesitated. The Defendants Goering and Ribbentrop, in the interrogations which you will see, have agreed that it was the Anglo-Polish Treaty which led him to call off, or rather postpone, the attack which was timed for the 26th. Perhaps he hoped that after all there was still some chance of repeating what he had called the Czech affair. If so, his hopes were lived. On the 27th of August Hitler accepted Mussolini's decision not at once to come into the war; but he asked for propaganda support and for a display of military activity on the part of Italy, so as to create uncertainty in the minds of the Allies. Ribbentrop on the same day said that the armies were marching.</P>

<P>In the meantime, and, of course, particularly during the last month, desperate attempts were being made by the Western Powers to avert war. You will have details of them in evidence, of the intervention of the Pope, of President Roosevelt's message, of the offer by the British Prime Minister to do our utmost to create the conditions in which all matters in issue could be the subject of free negotiations, and to guarantee the resultant decisions. But this and the other efforts of honest men to avoid the horror of a European conflict were predestined to failure. The Germans were determined that the day for war had come. On the 31st of August Hitler issued a top-secret order for the attack to commence in the early hours of the 1st of September.</P>

<P>The necessary frontier incidents duly occurred. Was it, perhaps, for that, that the Defendant Keitel had been instructed by Hitler to supply Heydrich with Polish uniforms? And so without a declaration of war, without even giving the Polish Government an opportunity of seeing Germany's final demandsand you will hear the evidence of the extraordinary diplomatic negotiations, if one can call them such, that took place in Berlinwithout giving the Poles any opportunity at all of negotiating or arbitrating on the demands which Nazi Germany was making, the Nazi troops invaded Poland.</P>

<P>On the 3rd of September Hitler sent a telegram to Mussolini thanking him for his intervention but pointing out that the war as inevitable and that the most promising moment had to be picked after cold deliberation. And so Hitler and his confederates now before this Tribunal began the first of their wars of aggression for which they had prepared so long and so thoroughly. They waged it so fiercely that within a few weeks Poland was overrun.</P>

<P>On the 11/23/1939 Hitler reviewed the situation to his military commanders and in the course of what he said he nad this observation:</P>

<P>"One year later Austria came; this step was also considered doubtful. It brought about an essential reinforcement of the Reich. The next step was Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland. This step also was not possible to accomplish in one move. First of all the Western Fortifications had to be finished .... Then followed the creation of the Protectorate, and with that the basis for action against Poland was laid. But I was not quite clear at the time whether I should start first against the East and then in the West, or vice versa .... The compulsion to fight with Poland came first. One might accuse me of wanting to fight again and again. In struggle, I see the fate of all beings."</P>

<P>He was not sure where to attack first. But that sooner or later he would attack, whether it were in the East or in the West, was never in doubt. And he had been warned, not only by the British and French Prime Ministers but even by his confederate Mussolini that an attack on Poland would bring England and France into the war. He chose what he thought was the opportune moment, and he struck. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Under these circumstances the intent to wage war against England and France, and to precipitate it by an attack on Poland, is not to be denied. Here was defiance of the most solemn treaty obligations. Here was neglect of the most pacific assurances. Here was aggression, naked and unashamed, which was indeed to arouse the horrified and heroic resistance of all civilized peoples, but which, before it was finished, was to tear down much of the structure of our civilization.</P>

<P>Once started upon the active achievement of their plan to secure the domination of Europe, if not of the world, the Nazi Government proceeded to attack other countries, as occasion offered. The first actually to be attacked, actually to be invaded, after the attack upon Poland, were Denmark and Norway.</P>

<P>On the 4/9/1940 the German Armed Forces invaded Norway and Denmark without any warning, without any declaration of war. It was a breach of the Hague Convention of 1907. It was a breach of the Convention of Arbitration and Conciliation signed between Germany and Denmark on 6/2/1926. It was, of course, a breach of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. It was violation of the Non-Aggression Treaty between Germany and Denmark made on the 5/31/1939. And it was a breach of the most explicit assurances which had been given. After his annexation of Czechoslovakia had shaken the confidence of the world, Hitler attempted to reassure the Scandinavian states. On the 4/28/1939 he affirmed that he had never made any request to any of them which was incompatible with their sovereignty and independence. On the 5/31/1939 he signed a non-aggression pact with Denmark.</P>

<P>On the 9/2/1939, the day after he had invaded Poland and occupied Danzig, he again expressed his determination, so he said, to observe the inviolability and integrity of Norway in an aide-memoire which was handed to the Norwegian Foreign Minister by the German Minister in Oslo on that day.</P>

<P>A month later, in a public speech on the 10/6/1939, said:</P>

<P>"Germany has never had any conflicts of interest or even points of controversy with the northern states, neither has she any today. Sweden and Norway have both been offered non- aggression pacts by Germany, and have both refused them, solely because they do not feel themselves threatened in any way."</P>

<P>When the invasion of Denmark and Norway was already begun in the early morning of 4/9/1940, a German memorandum was handed to the governments of those countries attempting to justify the German action. Various allegations against the governments of the invaded countries were made. It was said that Norway had been guilty of breaches of neutrality. It was said that she had allowed and tolerated the use of her territorial waters by Great Britain. It was said that Britain and France were themselves making plans to invade and occupy Norway and that the Government of Norway was prepared to acquiesce in such an event.</P>

<P>I do not propose to argue the question whether or not these allegations were true or false. That question is irrelevant to the issues before this Court. Even if the allegations were trueand they were patently falsethey would afford no conceivable justification for the action of invading without warning, without declaration of war, without any attempt at mediation or conciliation.</P>

<P>Aggressive war is none the less aggressive war because the state which wages it believes that other states might, in the future, take similar action. The rape of a nation is not justified because it is thought she may be raped by another. Nor even in self-defense are warlike measures justified except after all means of mediation have been tried and failed and force is actually being exercised against the state concerned.</P>

<P>But the matter is irrelevant because, in actual fact, with the evidence which we now possess, it is abundantly clear that the invasion of these two countries was undertaken for quite different purposes. It had been planned long before any question of breach of neutrality or occupation of Norway by England could ever have occurred. And it is equally clear that the assurances repeated again and again throughout 1939 were made for no other purpose than to lull suspicion in these countries and to prevent them taking steps to resist the attack against them which was all along in active preparation.</P>

<P>For some years the Defendant Rosenberg, in his capacity as Chief of the Foreign Affairs BureauAPAof the NSDAP, had interested himself in the promotion of Fifth Column activities in Norway and he had established close relationship with the Nasjonal Samling, a political group headed by the now notorious traitor, Vidkun Quisling. During the winter of 1938- 39, APA was in contact with Quisling, and later Quisling conferred with Hitler and with the Defendants Raeder and Rosenberg. In 8/1939 a special 14-day course was held at the school of the Office of Foreign Relations in Berlin for 25 followers whom Quisling had selected to attend. The plan was to send a number of selected and "reliable" men to Germany for a brief military training in an isolated camp. These "reliable men" were to be the area and language specialists to German special troops who were taken to Oslo on coal barges to undertake political action in Norway. The object was a coup in which Quisling would seize his leading opponents in Norway, including the King, and prevent all military resistance from the beginning. Simultaneously with those Fifth Column activities Germany was making her military preparations. On the 12/2/1939, as I said, Hitler had assured Norway of his intention to respect her neutrality. On 6 October he said that the Scandinavian states were not menaced in any way. Yet on the 3rd October the Defendant Raeder was pointing out that the occupation of bases, if necessary by force, would greatly improve the German strategic position. On the 9th of October Doenitz was recommending Trondheim as the main base, with Narvik as an alternative base for fuel supplies. The Defendant Rosenberg was reporting shortly afterwards on the possibility of a coup d'etat by Quisling, immediately supported by German military and naval forces. On the 12/12/1939 the Defendant Raeder advised Hitler, in the presence of the Defendants Keitel and Jodl, that if Hitler was favorably impressed by Quisling, the OKW should prepare for the occupation of Norway, if possible with Quisling's assistance, but if necessary entirely by force. Hitler agreed, but there was a doubt whether action should be taken against the Low Countries or against Scandinavia first. Weather conditions delayed the march on the Low Countries. In 1/1940 instructions were given to the German Navy for the attack on Norway. On the 1st of March a directive for the occupation was issued by Hitler. The general object was not said to be to prevent occupation by English forces but, in vague and general terms, to prevent British encroachment in Scandinavia and the Baltic and "to guarantee our ore bases in Sweden and to give our Navy and Air Force a wider start line against Britain." But the directive went on (and here is the common pattern):</P>

<P>"... on principle we will do our utmost to make the operation appear as a peaceful occupation, the object of which is the military protection of the Scandinavian states .... It is important that the Scandinavian states as well as the western opponents should be taken by surprise by our measures .... In case the preparations for embarkation can no longer be kept secret, the leaders and the troops will be deceived with fictitious objectives."</P>

<P>The form and success of the invasion are well known. In the early hours of the 9th of April, seven cruisers, 14 destroyers, and a number of torpedo boats and other small craft carried advance elements of six divisions, totalling about 10000 men, forced an entry and landed troops in the outer Oslo Fjord, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, and Narvik. A small force of troops was also landed at Arendal and Egersund on the southern coast. In addition, airborne troops were landed near Oslo and Stavanger in airplanes. The German attack came as a complete surprise. All the invaded towns along the coast were captured according to plan and with only slight losses. Only the plan to capture the King and Parliament failed. But brave as was the resistance, which was hurriedly organized throughout the country-nothing could be done in the face of the long-planned surprise attack-and on the 10th of June military resistance ceased. So another act of aggression was brought to completion. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Almost exactly a month after the attack on Norway, on the 5/10/1940, the German Armed Forces, repeating what had been done 25 years before, streamed into Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg according to plana plan that is, of invading without warning and without any declaration of war.</P>

<P>What was done was, of course, a breach of the Hague Convention, and is so charged. It was a violation of the Locarno Agreement of 1825, which the Nazi Government affirmed in 1935, only illegally to repudiate it a couple of years later. By that agreement all questions incapable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic means were to be referred to arbitration. You will see the comprehensive terms of all those treaties. It was a breach of the Treaty of Arbitration and Conciliation signed between Germany and the Netherlands on the 5/20/1926. It was a breach of a similar treaty with Luxembourg of 9/11/1929. It was a breach of the Kellogg- Briand Pact. But those treaties, perhaps, had not derived in the minds of the Nazi rulers of Germany any added sanctity from the fact that they had been solemnly concluded by the governments of pre-Nazi Germany. Let us then consider the specific assurances and undertakings which the Nazi rulers themselves gave to these states which lay in the way of their plans against France and England and which they had always intended to attack. Not once, not twice, but 11 times the clearest possible assurances were given to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. On those assurances, solemnly given and formally expressed, these countries were entitled to rely and did rely. In respect of the breach of those assurances these defendants are charged. On the 1/30/1937, for instance Hitler had said:</P>

<P>"As for the rest, I have more than once expressed the desire and the hope of entering into similar good and cordial relations with our neighbors. Germany has, and here I repeat this solemnly, given the assurance time and time again that, for instance, between her and France there cannot be any humanly conceivable points of controversy. The German Government has further given the assurance to Belgium and Holland that it is prepared to recognize and to guarantee the inviolability and neutrality of these territories."</P>

<P>After Hitler had remilitarized the Rhineland and had repudiated the Locarno Pact, England and France sought to re-establish the position of security for Belgium which Hitler's action had threatened. And they, therefore, gave to Belgium on the 4/24/1937 a specific guarantee that they would maintain, in respect of Belgium. the undertakings of assistance which they had entered into with her both under the Locarno Pact and under the Covenant of the League. On the 10/13/1937 the German Government also made a declaration assuring Belgium of its intention to recognize the integrity of that country.</P>

<P>It is, perhaps, convenient to deal with the remaining assurances as we review the evidence which is available as to the preparations and intentions of the German Government prior to their actual invasion of Belgium on the 5/10/1940.</P>

<P>As in the case of Poland, as in the case of Norway and Denmark so also here the dates speak for themselves.</P>

<P>As early as 8/1938 steps were being taken to utilize the Low Countries as bases for decisive action in the West in the event of France and England opposing Germany in the aggressive plan which was on foot at that time against Czechoslovakia.</P>

<P>In an Air Force letter dated the 8/25/1938 which deals with the action to be taken if England and France should interfere in the operation against Czechoslovakia, it is stated:</P>

<P>"It is not expected for the moment that other states will intervene against Germany. The Dutch and the Belgian area assumes in this connection much more importance for the conduct of war in Western Europe than during the World War, mainly as advance base for the air war."</P>

<P>In the last paragraph of that order it is stated:</P>

<P>"Belgium and the Netherlands, when in German hands, represent an extraordinary advantage in the prosecution of the air war against Great Britain as well as against France . . ."</P>

<P>That was in 8/1938. Eight months later, on the 4/28/1939, Hitler is declaring again:</P>

<P>"I was pleased that a number of European states availed themselves of this declaration by the German Government to express and emphasize their desire to have absolute neutrality."</P>

<P>A month later, on the 4/23/1939, Hitler held that conference in the Reich Chancellery, to which I already referred. The minutes of that meeting report Hitler as saying:</P>

<P>"The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed forces. Declarations of neutrality cannot be considered of any value. If England and France want a general conflict on the occasion of the war between Germany and Poland they will support Holland and Belgium in their neutrality .... Therefore, if England intends to intervene at the occasion of the Polish war, we must attack Holland with lightning speed. It is desirable to secure a defense line on Dutch soil up to the Zuider Zee."</P>

<P>Even after that he was to give his solemn declarations that he would observe the neutrality of these countries. On the 8/26/1939, when the crisis in regard to Danzig and Poland was reaching its climax, on the very day he had picked for the invasion of Poland, declarations assuring the governments concerned of the intention to respect their neutrality were handed by the German Ambassadors to the King of the Belgians, the Queen of the Netherlands, and to the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the most solemn form. But to the Army Hitler was saying:</P>

<P>"If Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held, a successful war against England will be secured."</P>

<P>On the 1st of September Poland was invaded, and 2 days later England and France came into the war against Germany, in pursuance of the treaty obligations already referred to. On the 6th of October Hitler renewed his assurances of friendship to Belgium and Holland, but on the 9th of October, before any kind of accusation had been made by the German Government of breaches of neutrality, Hitler issued a directive for the conduct of the war. And he said this:</P>

<P>"1) If it becomes evident in the near future that England and France, acting under her leadership, are not disposed to end the war, I am determined to take firm and offensive action without letting much time elapse. "2) A long waiting period results not only in the ending of Belgian and perhaps also of Dutch neutrality to the advantage of the Western Powers, but also strengthens the military power of our enemies to an increasing degree, causes confidence of the neutrals in final German victory to wane, and does not help to bring Italy to our aid as brothers-in-arms.</P>

<P>"3) I therefore issue the following orders for the further conduct of military operations:</P>

<P>"(a) Preparations should be made for offensive action on the northern flank of the Western Front crossing the area of Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland. This attack must be carried out as soon and as forcefully as possible.</P>

<P>"(b) The object of this attack is to defeat as many strong sections of the French fighting army as possible, and her ally and partner in the fighting, and at the same time to acquire as great an area of Holland, Belgium, and northern France as possible, to use as a base offering good prospects for waging aerial and sea warfare against England and to provide ample coverage for the vital district of the Ruhr."</P>

<P>Nothing could state more clearly or more definitely the object behind the invasion of these three countries than that document expresses it. [=]</P>

<P>On the 10/15/1939 the Defendant Keitel wrote a most- secret letter concerning "Fall Gelb" which was the name given the operation against the Low Countries. In it he said that:</P>

<P>"The protection of the Ruhr area by moving aircraft reporting service and the air defense as far forward as possible in the area of Holland is significant for the whole conduct of the war. The more Dutch territory we occupy, the more effective can the defense of the Ruhr area be made. This point of view must determine the choice of objectives of the Army, even if the Army and Navy are not directly interested in such territorial gain. It must be the object of the Army's preparations, therefore, to occupy, on receipt of a special order, the territory of Holland, in the first instance in the area of the Grebbe-Maas line. It will depend on the military and political attitude of the Dutch, as well as on the effectiveness of their flooding, whether objectives can and must be further extended."</P>

<P>The Fall Gelb operation had apparently been planned to take place at the beginning of 11/1939. We have in our possession a series of 17 letters, dated from 7th November until the 9th May postponing almost from day to day the D-Day of the operation, so that by the beginning of November all the major plans and preparations had in fact been made.</P>

<P>On the 1/10/1940 a German airplane force-landed in Belgium. In it was found the remains of an operation order which the pilot had attempted to burn; setting out considerable details of the Belgian landing grounds that were to be captured by the Air Force. Many other documents have been found which illustrate the planning and preparation for this invasion in the latter half of 1939 and early 1940, but they carry the matter no further, and they show no more clearly than the evidence to which I have already referred, the plans and intention of the German Government and its Armed Forces.</P>

<P>On the 5/10/1940 at about 0500 hours in the morning, the German invasion of Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg began.</P>

<P>And so once more the forces of aggression moved on. Treaties, assurances, the rights of sovereign states meant nothing. Brutal force, covered by as great an element of surprise as the Nazis could secure, was to seize that which was deemed necessary for striking the mortal blow against England, the main enemy. The only fault of these three unhappy countries was that they stood in the path of the German invader, in his designs against England and France. That was enough, and they were invaded.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.] [=]</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: On the 4/6/1941 German Armed Forces invaded Greece and Yugoslavia. Again the blow was struck without warning and with the cowardice and deceit which the world now fully expected from the self- styled "Herrenvolk". It as a breach of the Hague Convention. It was a breach of the Pact of Paris. It was a breach of a specific assurance given by Hitler on the 10/6/1939.</P>

<P>He had then said this:</P>

<P>Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss, I informed Yugoslavia that from now on the frontier with this country will also be an unalterable one and that we desire only to live in peace and friendship with her."</P>

<P>But the plan for aggression against Yugoslavia had, of course been in hand well before that. In the aggressive action eastward towards the Ukraine and the Soviet territories, security of the southern flank and the lines of communication had already been considered by the Germans.</P>

<P>The history of the events leading up to the invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany is well known. At 3 o'clock in the morning of the 10/28/1940 a 3-hour ultimatum had been presented by the Italian Government to the Greek Government, and the presentation of that ultimatum was immediately followed by the aerial bombardment of Greek provincial towns and the advance of Italian troops into Greek territory. The Greeks were not prepared. They were at first forced to withdraw. But later the Italian advance was at first checked, then driven towards the Albanian frontier, and by the end of 1940 the Italian Army had suffered severe reverses at Greek hands.</P>

<P>Of the German position in the matter there is, of course, the evidence of what occurred when, on the 8/12/1939, Hitler had this meeting with Ciano.</P>

<P>You will remember that Hitler said then:</P>

<P>"Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be to liquidate false neutrals one after the other. This process could be carried out more easily if, on every occasion, one partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing with an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a neutral of this kind."</P>

<P>Then the conference went on and it met again on the 13th of August, and in the course of lengthy discussions, Hitler said this:</P>

<P>"In general, however, on success by one of the Axis partners, not only strategical but also psychological strengthening of the other partner and also of the whole Axis would ensue. Italy carried through a number of successful operations in Abyssinia, Spain, and Albania, and each time against the wishes of the democratic entente. These individual actions have not only strengthened Italian local interests, but have also ... reinforced her general position. The same was the case with German action in Austria and Czechoslovakia .... The strengthening of the Axis by these individual operations was of the greatest importance for the unavoidable clash with the Western Powers."</P>

<P>And so once again we see the same procedure being followed. That meeting had taken place on the 8/12-13/1939. Less than 2 months later, Hitler was giving his assurance to Yugoslavia that Germany only desired to live in peace and friendship with her, with the state, the liquidation of which by his Axis partner, he had himself so recently suggested.</P>

<P>Then came the Italian ultimatum to Greece and war against Greece and the Italian reverse.</P>

<P>We have found, amongst the captured documents, an undated letter from Hitler to Mussolini which must have been written about the time of the Italian aggression against Greece:</P>

<P>Permit me"Hitler said" at the beginning of this letter to assure you that within the last 14 days my heart and my thoughts have been more than ever with you. Moreover, Duce, be assured of my determination to do everything on your behalf which might ease the present situation for you. When I asked you to receive me in Florence, I undertook the trip in the hope of being able to express my views prior to the beginning of the threatening conflict with Greece, about which I had received only general information. First, I wanted to request you to postpone the action, if at all possible, until a more favorable time of the year, at all events until after the American presidential election. But in any case, however, I wanted to request you, Duce, not to undertake this action without a previous lightning-like occupation of Crete and, for this purpose, I also wanted to submit to you some practical suggestions in regard to the employment of a German parachute division and a further airborne division . . . Yugoslavia must become disinterested, if possible, however, from our point of view, interested in co-operating in the liquidation of the Greek question. Without assurances from Yugoslavia, it is useless to risk any successful operation in the Balkans . . . Unfortunately, I must stress the fact that waging a war in the Balkans before March is impossible. Hence it would also serve to make any threatening influence upon Yugoslavia of no purpose, since the Serbian General Staff is well aware of the fact that no practical action could follow such a threat before March. Hence, Yugoslavia must, if at all possible, be won over by other means and in other ways."</P>

<P>On the 12th of 11/1939, in his top-secret order, Hitler ordered the OKH to make preparations to occupy Greece and Bulgaria, if necessary. Apparently 10 divisions were to be used in order to prevent Turkish intervention. I think I said 1939; it should, of course, have been the 11/12/1940. And to shorten the time, the German divisions in Romania were to be increased.</P>

<P>On the 13th of December Hitler issued an order to OKW, OKL OKH, OKM, and the General Staff on the operation Marita, as the invasion of Greece was to be called. In that order it was stated that the invasion of Greece was planned and was to commence soon as the weather was advantageous. A further order was issued on the 1/11/1941.</P>

<P>On the 1/28/1941 Hitler saw Mussolini. The Defendants Jodl, Keitel, and Ribbentrop were present at the meeting. We know about it from Jodl's notes of what took place. We know that Hitler stated that one of the purposes of German troop concentrations in Romania was for use in the plan Marita against Greece.</P>

<P>On the 3/1/1941 German troops entered Bulgaria and moved towards the Greek frontier. In the face of this threat of an attack on Greece by German as well as Italian forces, British troops were landed in Greece on the 3rd of March, in accordance with the declaration which had been given by the British Government on the 4/13/1939; that Britain would feel bound to give Greece and Romania, respectively, all the support in her power in the event of either country becoming the victim of aggression and resisting such aggression. Already, of course, the Italian operations had made that pledge operative. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>On the 3/25/1941, Yugoslavia, partly won over by the "other means and in other ways" to which Hitler had referred, joined the Three Power Pact which had already been signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. The preamble of the pact stated that the three powers would stand side by side and work together.</P>

<P>On the same day the Defendant Ribbentrop wrote two notes to the Yugoslav Prime Minister assuring him of Germany's full intention to respect the sovereignty and independence of his country. That declaration was just another example of the treachery employed by German diplomacy. We have already seen the preparations that had been made. We have seen Hitler's attempts to tempt the Italians into an aggression against Yugoslavia. We have seen, in January, his own orders for preparations to invade Yugoslavia and then Greece. And now, on the 25th of March, he is signing a pact with that country and his Foreign Minister is writing assurances of respect for her sovereignty and territorial integrity.</P>

<P>As a result of the signing of that pact, the anti-Nazi element in Yugoslavia immediately accomplished a coup d'etat and established a new government. And thereupon, no longer prepared to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of her ally, Germany immediately took the decision to invade. On the 27th of March, days after the Three Power Pact had been signed, Hitler issued instructions that Yugoslavia was to be invaded and used as a base for the continuance of the combined German and Italian operation against Greece.</P>

<P>Following that, further deployment and instructions for the action Marita were issued by Von Brauchitsch on the 3/30/1941.</P>

<P>It was saidand I quote:</P>

<P>"The orders issued with regard to the operation against Greece remain valid so far as not affected by this order .... On the 5th April, weather permitting, the Air Forces are to attack troops in Yugoslavia, while simultaneously the attack of the 12th Army begins against both Yugoslavia and Greece."</P>

<P>And as we now know, the invasion actually commenced in the early hours of the 6th of April.</P>

<P>Treaties, pacts, assurances, obligations of any kind, are brushed aside and ignored wherever the aggressive interests of Germany are concerned.</P>

<P>I turn now to the last act of aggression in Europemy American colleagues will deal with the position in relation to JapanI turn now to the last act of aggression in Europe with which these Nazi conspirators are charged, the attack upon Russia.</P>

<P>In 4/1939 Germany, although undoubtedly intending to attack Russia at some convenient opportunity, concluded a treaty of non-aggression with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. When Belgium and the Low Countries were occupied and France collapsed in 6/1940, Englandalthough with the inestimably valuable moral and economic support of the United States of Americawas left alone in the field as the sole representative of democracy in the face of the forces of aggression. At that moment only the British Empire stood between Germany and the achievement of her aim to dominate the Western World. Only the British Empireand England as its citadel. But it was enough. The first, and possibly the decisive, military defeat which the enemy sustained was in the campaign against England; and that defeat had a profound influence on the future course of the war.</P>

<P>On the 7/16/1940 Hitler issued to the Defendants Keitel and Jodl a directivewhich they found themselves unable to obeyfor the invasion of England. It started offand Englishmen forever be proud of itby saying that:</P>

<P>"Since England, despite her militarily hopeless situation, shows no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided to prepare a landing operation against England and if necessary to carry it out. The aim is... to eliminate the English homeland as a base for the carrying on of the war against Germany .... Preparations for the entire operation must be completed by mid-August."</P>

<P>But the first essential condition for that plan was, I quote:</P>

<P>"... the British Air Force must morally and actually be so far overcome that it does not any longer show any considerable aggressive force against the German attack."</P>

<P>The Defendant Goering and his Air Force, no doubt, made the most strenuous efforts to realize that condition, but, in one of the most splendid pages of our history, it was decisively defeated. And although the bombardment of England's towns and villages was continued throughout that dark winter of 1940-41, the enemy decided in the end that England was not to be subjugated by these means, and, accordingly, Germany turned back to the East, the first major aim unachieved.</P>

<P>On the 6/22/1941 German Armed Forces invaded Russia, without warning, without declaration of war. It was, of course, a breach of the usual series of treaties; they meant no more in this case than they had meant in the other cases. It was a violation of the Pact of Paris; it was a flagrant contradiction of the Treaty of Non-Aggression which Germany and Russia had signed on the 23rd of August a year before.</P>

<P>Hitler himself said, in referring to that agreement, that "agreements were only to be kept as long as they served a purpose."</P>

<P>The Defendant Ribbentrop was more explicit. In an interview with the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin on the 2/23/1941, he made it clear that the object of the agreement had merely been, so far as Germany was concerned, to avoid a two-front war.</P>

<P>In contrast to what Hitler and Ribbentrop and the rest of them were planning within the secret councils of Germany, we know what they were saying to the rest of the world.</P>

<P>On the 19th of July, Hitler spoke in the Reichstag:</P>

<P>"In these circumstances"he said"I considered it proper to negotiate as a first priority a sober definition of interest with Russia. It would be made clear once and for all what Germany believes she must regard as her sphere of interest to safeguard her future and, on the other hand, what Russia considers important for her existence. From this clear delineation of the sphere of interest there followed the new regulation of Russian-German relations. Any hope that now, at the end of the term of the agreement, a new Russo-German tension could arise is childish. Germany has taken no step which would lead her outside her sphere of interest, nor has Russia But England's hope to achieve an amelioration of her own position through the engineering of some new European crisis, is, insofar as it is concerned with Russo-German relations, an illusion.</P>

<P>"English statesmen perceive everything somewhat slowly, but they too will learn to understand this in the course of time."</P>

<P>The whole statement was, of course, a tissue of lies. It was not many months after it had been made that the arrangements for attacking Russia were put into hand. And the Defendant Raeder gives us the probable reason for the decision in a note which he sent Admiral Assmann:</P>

<P>"The fear that control of the air over the Channel in the Autumn of 1940 could no longer be attained, a realization which the Fuehrer no doubt gained earlier than the Naval War Staff, who were not so fully informed of the true results of air raids on England (our own losses), surely caused the Fuehrer, as far back as August and September"this was 8-9/1940"to consider whether, even prior to victory in the West, an Eastern campaign would be feasible, with the object of first eliminating our last serious opponent on the Continent .... The Fuehrer did not openly express this fear, however, until well into September."</P>

<P>He may not have spoken to the Navy of his intentions until later in September, but by the beginning of that month he had undoubtedly told the Defendant Jodl about them. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Dated the 9/6/1940, we have a directive of the OKW signed by the Defendant Jodl, and I quote:</P>

<P>"Directions are given for the occupation forces in the East to be increased in the following weeks. For security reasons"and I quote"this should not create the impression in Russia 'that Germany is preparing for an Eastern offensive."</P>

<P>Directives are given to the German Intelligence Service pertaining to the answering of questions by the Russian Intelligence Service, and I quote:</P>

<P>"The respective strength of the German troops in the East is to be camouflaged by ... frequent changes in this area .... The impression is to be created that the bulk of the troops is in the south of the Government General and that the occupation in the North is relatively small."</P>

<P>And so we see the beginning of the operations.</P>

<P>On the 11/12/1940 Hitler issued a directive, signed by the Defendant Jodl, in which it was stated that the political task to determine the attitude of Russia had begun, but that without reference to the result of preparations against the East, which had been ordered orally.</P>

<P>It is not to be supposed that the USSR would have taken part in any conversations at that time if it had been realized that on the very day orders were being given for preparations to be made for the invasion of Russia, and that the order for the operation, which was called "Plan Barbarossa", was in active preparation. On the 18th of December the order was issued, and I quote:</P>

<P>"The German Armed Forces have to be ready to defeat Soviet Russia in a swift campaign before the end of the war against Great Britain."</P>

<P>And later, in the same instruction and I quote again:</P>

<P>"All orders which shall be issued by the High Commanders in accordance with this instruction have to be clothed in such terms that they may be taken as measures of precaution in case Russia should change her present attitude towards ourselves."</P>

<P>Germany kept up the pretense of friendliness and, on the 1/10/1941, well after the Plan Barbarossa for the invasion of Russia had been decided upon, Germany signed the German- Russian Frontier Treaty. Less than a month later, on the 2/3/1941, Hitler held a conference, attended by the Defendants Keitel and Jodl, at which it was provided that the whole operation against Russia was to be camouflaged as if it was part of the preparation for the "Plan Seeloewe", as the plan for the invasion of England was described.</P>

<P>By March of 1941 plans were sufficiently advanced to include provision for dividing the Russian territory into nine separate states to be administered under Reich Commissars, under the general control of the Defendant Rosenberg and at the same time detailed plans for the economic exploitation of the country were made under the supervision of the Defendant Goering, to whom the responsibility in this matterand it is a serious onehad been delegated by Hitler.</P>

<P>You will hear something of the details of these plans. I remind you of one document which has already been referred to in this connection.</P>

<P>It is significant that on the 5/2/1941 a conference of State Secretaries took place in regard to the Plan Barbarossa, and in the course of that it was noted:</P>

<P>"1. The war can be continued only if all Armed Forces are fed out of Russia in the third year of the war.</P>

<P>"2. There is no doubt that, as a result, many millions of people will be starved to death if we take out of the country the things necessary for us."</P>

<P>But that apparently caused no concern. The "Plan Oldenbourg", as the scheme for the economic organization and exploitation of Russia was called, went on. By the 5/1/1941, the D-Day of the operation had been fixed. By the 1st of June preparations were virtually complete and an elaborate timetable was issued. It was estimated that, although there would be heavy frontier battles, lasting perhaps 4 weeks, after that no serious opposition was to be expected.</P>

<P>On the 22d of June, at 3:30 in the morning, the German armies marched again. As Hitler said in his proclamation to them, "I have decided to give the fate of the German people and of the Reich and of Europe again into the hands of our soldiers."</P>

<P>The usual false pretexts were, of course, given. Ribbentrop stated on the 28th of June that the step was taken because of the threatening of the German frontiers by the Red Army. It was a lie, and the Defendant Ribbentrop knew it was a lie.</P>

<P>On the 6/7/1941 Ribbentrop's own Ambassador in Moscow as reporting to him, and I quote, that, "All observations show that Stalin and Molotov, who are alone responsible for Russian foreign policy, are doing everything to avoid a conflict with Germany." The staff records which you will see make it clear that the Russians were making no military preparations and that they were continuing their deliveries under the Trade Agreement to the very last day. The truth is, of course, that the elimination of Russia as a political opponent and the incorporation of the Soviet territory in the German Lebensraum had been one of the cardinal features of Nazi policy for a very long time, subordinated latterly for what the Defendant Jodl called diplomatic reasons.</P>

<P>And so, on the 22d of June, the Nazi armies were flung against the power with which Hitler had so recently sworn friendship, and Germany embarked upon that last act of aggression in Europe, which, after long and bitter fighting, was eventually to result in Germany's own collapse.</P>

<P>That, then, is the case against these defendants, as amongst the rulers of Germany, under Count Two of this Indictment.</P>

<P>It may be said that many of the documents which have been referred to were in Hitler's name, and that the orders were Hitler's orders, and that these men were mere instruments of Hitler's will. But they were the instruments without which Hitler's will could not be carried out; and they were more than that. These men were no mere willing tools, although they would be guilty enough if that had been their role. They are the men whose support had built Hitler up into the position of power he occupied; these are the men whose initiative and planning often conceived and certainly made possible the acts of aggression done in Hitler's name; and these are the men who enabled Hitler to build up the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the war economy, the political philosophy, by which these treacherous attacks were carried out, and by which he was able to lead his fanatical followers into peaceful countries to murder, to loot, and to destroy. They are the men whose cooperation and support made the Nazi Government of Germany possible.</P>

<P>The government of a totalitarian country may be carried on without representatives of the people, but it cannot be carried on without any assistance at all. It is no use having a leader unless there are also people willing and ready to serve their personal greed and ambition by helping and following him. The dictator who is set up in control of the destinies of his country does not depend on himself alone either in acquiring power or in maintaining it. He depends upon the support and the backing which lesser men, themselves lusting to share in dictatorial power, anxious to bask in the adulation of their leader, are prepared to give.</P>

<P>In the criminal courts of our countries, when men are put on their trial for breaches of the municipal laws, it not infrequently happens that of a gang indicted together in the dock, one has the master mind, the leading personality. But it is no excuse for the common thief to say, "I stole because I was told to steal", for the murderer to plead, "I killed because I was asked to kill." And these men are in no different position, for all that it was nations they sought to rob, and whole peoples which they tried to kill. "The warrant of no man excuseth the doing of an illegal act." Political loyalty, military obedience are excellent things, but they neither require nor do they justify the commission of patently wicked acts. There comes a point where a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer to his conscience. Even the common soldier, serving in the ranks of his army, is not called upon to obey illegal orders. But these men were no common soldiers: They were the men whose skill and cunning, whose labor and activity made it possible for the German Reich to tear up existing treaties, to enter into new ones and to flout them, to reduce international negotiations and diplomacy to a hollow mockery, to destroy all respect for and effect in international law and, finally, to march against the peoples of the world to secure that domination in which, as arrogant members of their self-styled master race, they professed to believe.

<P>If these crimes were in one sense the crimes of Nazi Germany they also are guilty as the individuals who aided, abetted, counselled, procured, and made possible the commission of what was done.</P>

<P>The total sum of the crime these men have committed so awful in its comprehensionhas many aspects. Their lust and sadism, their deliberate slaughter and degradation of so many millions of their fellow creatures that the imagination reels, are but one side of this matter. Now that an end has been put to this nightmare, and we come to consider how the future is to be lived, perhaps their guilt as murderers and robbers is of less importance and of less effect to future generations of mankind than their crime of fraudthe fraud by which they placed themselves in a position to do their murder and their robbery. That is the other aspect of their guilt. The story of their "diplomacy", founded upon cunning, hypocrisy, and bad faith, is a story less gruesome no doubt, but no less evil and deliberate. And should it be taken as a precedent of behavior in the conduct of international relations, its consequences to mankind will no less certainly lead to the end of civilized society.</P>

<P>Without trust and confidence between nations, without the faith that what is said is meant and that what is undertaken will be served, all hope of peace and security is dead. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, of the United States of America, of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and of France, backed by and on behalf of every other peace-loving nation of the world, have therefore joined to bring the inventors and perpetrators of this Nazi conception of international relationship before the bar of this Tribunal. They do so, so that these defendants. may be punished for their crimes. They do so, also, that their conduct may be exposed in all its naked wickedness and they do so in the hope that the conscience and good sense of all the world will see the consequences of such conduct and the end to which inevitably it must always lead. Let us once again restore sanity and with it also the sanctity of our obligations towards each other.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Attorney, would it be convenient to the prosecutors from Great Britain to continue?</P>

<P>SIR HARTLEY SHAWCROSS: The proposal was that my friend, Mr. Sidney Alderman, should continue with the presentation of the case with regard to the final acts of aggression against Czechoslovakia and that that being done, my British colleagues would continue with the presentation of the British case. As the Tribunal will appreciate, Counts One and Two are in many respects complementary, and my American colleagues and ourselves are working in closest cooperation in presenting the evidence affecting those counts.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Alderman, would it be convenient for you to go on until 5 o'clock?</P>

<P>MR. ALDERMAN: Yes. May it please the Tribunal, it is quite convenient for me to proceed. I can but feel that it will be quite anticlimactic after the address which you just heard.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What was your last position in the SD?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Chief of Amt III in the RSHA.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Turning to the chart on the wall behind you, will you tell the Tribunal whether you can identify that chart in any way.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I have already seen this chart. I worked on it and I can identify it as accurate.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What, if anything, did you have to do with making up that chart?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: This chart was made up during my interrogation.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: For the information of the Tribunal, that is Exhibit Number USA-493, the chart of which the witness speaks.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I didn't understand you.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you tell the Tribunal whether that chart correctly portrays the basic organization of the RSHA, as well as the position of Kaltenbrunner, the Gestapo, and the SD in the German Police system?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: This chart represents the organization of the RSHA. It shows the correct position of the SD departments, of the State Police, and of the Secret Police.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Referring once more to the chart, please indicate your position in the RSHA and state for what period you continued to serve in that capacity.</P>

<P>[The witness pointed to Amt III on the chart.]</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What were the positions of Kaltenbrunner, Mueller, and Eichmann in the RSHA, and state for what periods of time each of them continued to serve in his respective capacity?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Kaltenbrunner was Chief of the Sicherheitspolizei and the SD; as such, he was also Chief of the RSHA, the internal organizational term for the office of the chief of the Sicherheitspolizei and the SD.</P>

<P>Kaltenbrunner occupied this position from 1/30/1943 until the end of the war. Mueller was Chief of Amt IV, the Gestapo. When the Gestapo was established, he became Deputy Chief, and as such he logically became Chief of Amt IV of the RSHA. He occupied this position until the end of the war. Eichmann occupied a position in Amt IV under Mueller and worked on the Jewish problem from approximately 1940 onwards. To my knowledge, he also occupied this position until the end of the war.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you tell us for what period of time you continued to serve as Chief of Amt III?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I was part-time Chief of Amt III from 1939- 1945.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Turning now to the designation "Mobile Units" with the Army shown in the lower right hand corner of the chart, please explain to the Tribunal the significance of the terms "Einsatzgruppe" and "Einsatzkommando."</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The concept "Einsatzgruppe" was established after an agreement between the Chiefs of the RSHA, OKW, and OKH, on the separate use of Sipo units in the operational areas. The concept "Einsatzgruppe" first appeared during the Polish campaign.</P>

<P>The agreement with the OKH and OKW, however, was arrived at only before the beginning of the Russian campaign. This agreement specified that a representative of the Chief of the Sipo and the SD would be assigned to the army groups, or armies, and that this official would have at his disposal mobile units of the Sipo and the SD in the form of an Einsatzgruppe, subdivided into Einsatzkommandos. The Einsatzkommandos would, on orders from the army group or army, be assigned to the individual army units as needed.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: State, if you know, whether prior to the campaign against Soviet Russia, any agreement was entered into between the OKW, OKH, and RSHA?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos, as I have just described them, were used on the basis of a written agreement between the OKW, OKH, and RSHA.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How do you know that there was such a written agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I was repeatedly present during the negotiations which Albrecht and Schellenberg conducted with the OKH and OKW; and I also had a written copy of this agreement, which was the outcome of these negotiations, in my own hands when I took over the Einsatzgruppe.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Explain to the Tribunal who Schellenberg was. What position, if any, did he occupy?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Schellenberg was, at the end, Chief of Amt VI in the RSHA at the time when he was conducting these negotiations as the representative of Heydrich, he belonged to the Amt I.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: On approximately what date did these negotiations take place?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The negotiations lasted several weeks. The agreement must have been reached: about 1 or 2 weeks before the beginning of the Russian campaign.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you yourself ever see a copy of this written agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you have occasion to work with this written agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: On more than one occasion?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes; in all questions arising out of the relationship between the Einsatzgruppen and the Army.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know where the original or any copy of that agreement is located today?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: To the best of your knowledge and recollection, please explain to the Tribunal the entire substance of this written agreement.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: First of all, the agreement stated that Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos would be set up and used in the operational areas. This created a precedent, because until that time the Army had, on its own responsibility, discharged the tasks which would now fall solely to the Sipo. The second was the regulation as to competence.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You're going too fast. What is it that you say the Einsatzkommandos did under the agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I said, this was the relationship between the Army and the Einsatzgruppen and the Einsatzkommandos. The agreement specified that the army groups or armies would be responsible for the movement and the supply of Einsatzgruppen but that instructions for their activities would come from the Chief of the Sipo and SD.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Let us understand. Is it correct that an Einsatz group was to be attached to each army group or army?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Every army group was to have an Einsatzgruppe attached to it. The army group in its turn would then attach the Einsatzkommandos to the armies of the army group.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And was the army command to determine the area within which the Einsatz group was to operate?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The operational area of the Einsatzgruppe was already determined by the fact that it was attached to a specific army group and therefore moved with it, whereas the operational areas of the Einsatzkommandos were then fixed by the army group or army.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did the agreement also provide that the army command was to direct the time during which they were to operate?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That was included under the heading "movement."</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And also to direct any additional tasks they were , to perform?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. Even though the Chiefs of the Sipo and SD had the right to issue instructions to them on their work, there existed a general agreement that the army was also entitled to issue orders to the Einsatzgruppen, if the operational situation made it necessary.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What did this agreement provide with respect to the attachment of the Einsatz group command to the army command?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I can't remember whether anything specific was contained in the agreement about that. At any rate a liaison man between the army command and the SD was appointed.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you recall any other provisions of this written agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I believe I can state the main contents of that agreement.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What position did you occupy with respect to this agreement?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: From 6/1941 to the death of Heydrich in June 1942, I led Einsatzgruppe D, and was the representative of the Chief of the Sipo and the SD with the 11th Army.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And when was Heydrich's death?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Heydrich was wounded at the end of 5/1942, and died on 6/4/1942.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How much advance notice, if any, did you have of the campaign against Soviet Russia?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: About 4 weeks.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How many Einsatz groups were there, and who were their respective leaders?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: There were four Einsatzgruppen, Group A, B, C and D. Chief of Einsatzgruppe A was Stahlecker; Chief of Einsatzgruppe B was Nebe; Chief of Einsatzgruppe C, Dr. Rasche, and later, Dr. Thomas; Chief of Einsatzgruppe D, I myself, and later Bierkamp.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: To which army was Group D attached?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Group D was not attached to any army group but was attached directly to the 11th Army.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Where did Group D operate?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Group D operated in the Southern Ukraine.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you describe in more detail the nature and extent of the area in which Group D originally operated, naming the cities or territories?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The northernmost city was Cernauti; then southward through Mohilev-Podolsk, Yampol, then eastward Zuvalje, Czervind, Melitopol, Mariopol, Taganrog, Rostov, and the Crimea.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What was the ultimate objective of Group D?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Group D was held in reserve for the Caucasus, for an army group which was to operate in the Caucasus.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: When did Group D commence its move into Soviet</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Group D left Duegen on 21 June and reached Pietra Namsk in Romania in 3 days. There the first Einsatzkommandos were already being demanded by the Army, and they immediately set off for the destinations named by the Army. The entire Einsatzgruppe was put into operation at the beginning of July.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: You are referring to the 11th Army?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In what respects, if any, were the official duties of the Einsatz groups concerned with Jews and Communist commissars?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: On the question of Jews and Communists, the Einsatzgruppen and the commanders of the Einsatzkommandos were orally instructed before their mission.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What were their instructions with respect to the Jews and the Communist functionaries?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The instructions were that in the Russian operational areas of the Einsatzgruppen the Jews, as well as the Soviet political commissars, were to be liquidated.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And when you say "liquidated" do you mean "killed?"</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, I mean "killed."</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Prior to the opening of the Soviet campaign, did you attend a conference at Pretz?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, it was a conference at which the Einsatzgruppen and the Einsatzkommandos were informed of their tasks and were given the necessary orders.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Who was present at that conference?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The chiefs of the Einsatzgruppen and the commanders of the Einsatzkommandos and Streckenbach of the RSHA who transmitted the orders of Heydrich and Himmler.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What were those orders?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Those were the general orders on the normal work of the Sipo and the SD, and in addition the liquidation order which I have already mentioned.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And that conference took place on approximately what date?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: About 3 or 4 days before the mission.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: So that before you commenced to march into Soviet Russia, you received orders at this conference to exterminate the Jews and Communist functionaries in addition to the regular professional work of the Security Police and SD; is that correct?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you, personally, have any conversation with Himmler respecting any communication from Himmler to the chiefs of army groups and armies concerning this mission?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. Himmler told me that before the beginning of the Russian campaign Hitler had spoken of this mission to a conference of the army groups and the army chiefsno, not the army chiefs but the commanding generalsand had instructed the commanding generals to provide the necessary support.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: So that you can testify that the chiefs of the army groups and the armies had been similarly informed of these orders for the liquidation of the Jews and Soviet functionaries?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I don't think it is quite correct to put it in that form. They had no orders for liquidation; the order for the liquidation was given to Himmler to carry out, but since this liquidation took place in the operational area of the army group or the armies, they had to be ordered to provide support. Moreover, without such instructions to the army, the activities of the Einsatzgruppen would not have been possible.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you have any other conversation with Himmler concerning this order?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, in the late summer of 1941 Himmler was in Nikolaiev. He assembled the leaders and men of the Einsatzkommandos, repeated to them the liquidation order, and pointed out that the leaders and men who were taking part in the liquidation bore no personal responsibility for the execution of this order. The responsibility was his, alone, and the Fuehrer's.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And you yourself heard that said?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know whether this mission of the Einsatz group was known to the army group commanders?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: This order and the execution of these orders were known to the commanding general of the army.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How do you know that?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Through conferences with the army and through instructions which were given by the army on the execution of the order.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Was the mission of the Einsatz groups and the agreement between OKW, OKH, and RSHA known to the other leaders in the RSHA?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: At least some of them knew of it, since some of the leaders were also active in the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos in the course of time. Furthermore, the leaders who were dealing with the organization and the legal aspect of the Einsatzgruppen also knew of it.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Most of the leaders came from the RSHA, did they not?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Which leaders?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Of the Einsatz groups.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No, one can't say that. The leaders in the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos came from all over the Reich.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know whether the mission and the agreement were also known to Kaltenbrunner?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: After his assumption of office Kaltenbrunner had to deal with these questions and consequently must have known details of the Einsatzgruppen which were offices of his.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Who was the commanding officer of the 11th Army?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: At first, Ritter von Schober; later, Von Manstein.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you tell the Tribunal in what way or ways the commanding officer of the 11th Army directed or supervised Einsatz Group D in carrying out its liquidation activities?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: An order from the 11th Army was sent to Nikolaiev stating that liquidations were to take place only at a distancegeneral.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you recall any other occasion?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: In Simferopol the army command requested the Einsatzkommandos in its area to hasten the liquidations, because famine was threatening and there was a great housing shortage.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know how many persons were liquidated by Einsatz Group D under your direction?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: In the year between 6/1941-6/1942 the Einsatzkommandos reported 90000 people liquidated.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did that include men, women, and children?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: On what do you base those figures?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: On reports sent by the Einsatzkommandos to the Einsatzgruppen.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Were those reports submitted to you?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And you saw and read those reports, personally?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And it is on those reports that you base the figures you have given the Tribunal?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know how those figures compare with the number of persons liquidated by other Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The figures which I saw of other Einsatzgruppen are considerably larger.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: That was due to what factor?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I believe that to a large extent the figures submitted by the other Einsatzgruppen were exaggerated.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you see reports of liquidations from the other Einsatz groups from time to time?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And those reports showed liquidations exceeding those of Group D; is that correct?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you personally supervise mass executions of these individuals?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you explain to the Tribunal in detail how an individual mass execution was carried out?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: A local Einsatzkommando attempted to collect all the Jews in its area by registering them. This registration was performed by the Jews themselves.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: On what pretext, if any, were they rounded up?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: On the pretext that they were to be resettled.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you continue?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: After the registration the Jews were collected at one place; and from there they were later transported to the place of execution, which was, as a rule an antitank ditch or a natural excavation. The executions were carried out in a military manner, by firing squads under command.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In what way were they transported to the place of execution?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: They were transported to the place of execution in trucks, always only as many as could be executed immediately. In this way it was attempted to keep the span of time from the moment in which the victims knew what was about to happen to them until the time of their actual execution as short as possible.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Was that your idea?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And after they were shot what was done with the bodies?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The bodies were buried in the antitank ditch or excavation.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What determination, if any, was made as to whether the persons were actually dead?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The unit leaders or the firing-squad commanders had orders to see to this and, if need be, finish them off themselves.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And who would do that?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Either the unit leader himself or somebody designated by him.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In what positions were the victims shot?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Standing or kneeling.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What was done with the personal property and clothing of the persons executed?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: All valuables were confiscated at the time of the registration or the rounding up and handed over to the Finance Ministry, either through the RSHA or directly. At first the clothing was given to the population, but in the winter of 1941- 1942 it was collected and disposed of by the NSV.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: All their personal property was registered at the time?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No, not all of it, only valuables were registered.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What happened to the garments which the victims were wearing when they went to the place of execution?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: They were obliged to take off their outer garments immediately before the execution.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: All of them?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The outer garments, yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How about the rest of the garments they were wearing?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The other garments remained on the bodies.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Was that true of not only your group but of the other Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That was the order in my Einsatzgruppe. I don't know how it was done in other Einsatzgruppen.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In what way did they handle it?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Some of the unit leaders did not carry out the liquidation in the military manner, but killed the victims singly by shooting them in the back of the neck.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And you objected to that procedure?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I was against that procedure, yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: For what reason?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Because both for the victims and for those who carried out the executions, it was, psychologically, an immense burden to bear.</P>

<P>Fulltext:</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Now, what was done with the property collected by the Einsatzkommandos from these victims?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: All valuables were sent to Berlin, to the RSHA or to the Reich Ministry of Finance. The articles which could be used in the operational area, were disposed of there.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: For example, what happened to gold and silver taken from the victims?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That was, as I have just said, turned over to Berlin, to the Reich Ministry of Finance.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How do you know that?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I can remember that it was actually handled in that way from Simferopol.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How about watches, for example, taken from the victims?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: At the request of the Army, watches were made available to the forces at the front.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Were all victims, including the men, women, and children, executed in the same manner?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Until the spring of 1942, yes. Then an order came from Himmler that in the future women and children were to be killed only in gas vans.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How had the women and children been killed previously?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: In the same way as the menby shooting.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What, if anything, was done about burying the victims after they had been executed?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The Kommandos filled the graves to efface the signs of the execution, and then labor units of the population leveled them.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Referring to the gas vans which you said you received in the spring of 1942, what order did you receive with respect to the use of these vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: These gas vans were in future to be used for the killing of women and children.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you explain to the Tribunal the construction of these vans and their appearance?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The actual purpose of these vans could not be seen from the outside. They looked like closed trucks, and were so constructed that at the start of the motor, gas was conducted into the van causing death in 10 to 15 minutes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Explain in detail just how one of these vans was used for an execution.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The vans were loaded with the victims and driven to the place of burial, which was usually the same as that used for the mass executions. The time needed for transportation was sufficient to insure the death of the victims.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How were the victims induced to enter the vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: They were told that they were to be transported to another locality.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How was the gas turned on?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I am not familiar with the technical details.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How long did it take to kill the victims ordinarily?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: About 10 to 15 minutes; the victims were not conscious of what was happening to them. [=]</P>

<P>Fulltext:</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How many persons could be killed simultaneously one such van?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: About 15 to 25 persons. The vans varied in size.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you receive reports from those persons operating these vans from time to time?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I didn't understand the question.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did you receive reports from those who were working on the vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I received the report that the Einsatzkommandos did not willingly use the vans.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Why not?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Because the burial of the victims was a great ordeal for the members of the Einsatzkommandos.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Now, will you tell the Tribunal who furnished these vans to the Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The gas vans did not belong to the motor pool of the Einsatzgruppen but were assigned to the Einsatzgruppe as a special unit, headed by the man who had constructed the vans. The vans were assigned to the Einsatzgruppen by the RSHA.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Were the vans supplied to all of the different Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I am not certain of that. I know only in the case f Einsatzgruppe D, and indirectly that Einsatzgruppe C also made use of these vans.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Are you familiar with the letter from Becker to Rauff with respect to these gas vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I saw this letter during my interrogation.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: May it please the Tribunal, I am referring to Exhibit 501-PS, Exhibit USA-288, being a letter already in evidence, a letter from Becker to Rauff.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Will you tell the Tribunal who Becker was?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: According to my recollection, Becker was the constructor of the vans. It was he who was in charge of the vans of Einsatzgruppe D.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Who was Rauff?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Rauff was group leader in Amt II of the RSHA. Among other things, he was at that time in charge of transportation.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Can you identify that letter in any way?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The contents roughly correspond to my experiences and are therefore probably correct.</P>

<P>[Document 501-PS was handed to the witness.]</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you look at the letter before you and tell us whether you can identify it in any way?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The external appearance of the letter as well as the initial "R" (Rauff) on it, and the reference to Zwabel or Fabel who took care of transportation under Rauff, seems to testify to the letter's authenticity. The contents roughly correspond to the experiences which I had at that time.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: So that you believe it to be an authentic document?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Fulltext:</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you now lay it aside on the table there?</P>

<P>Referring to your previous testimony, will you explain to the Tribunal why you believe that the type of execution ordered by you, namely, military, was preferable to the shooting-in-the- neck procedure adopted by the other Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: On the one hand, the aim was that the individual leaders and men should be able to carry out the executions in a military manner acting on orders and should not have to make a decision of their own; it was, to all intents and purposes, an order which they were to carry out. On the other hand, it was known to me that through the emotional excitement of the executions ill treatment could not be avoided, since the victims discovered too soon that they were to be executed and could not therefore endure prolonged nervous strain. And it seemed intolerable to me that individual leaders and men should in consequence be forced to kill a large number of people on their own decision.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In what manner did you determine which were the Jews to be executed?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That was not part of my task; but the identification of the Jews was carried out by the Jews themselves, since the registration was handled by a Jewish Council of Elders.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Did the amount of Jewish blood have anything to do with it?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I can't remember the details, but I believe that half-Jews were also considered as Jews.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What organizations furnished most of the officer personnel of the Einsatz groups and Einsatzkommandos?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I did not understand the question.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What organizations furnished most of the officer personnel of the Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The officer personnel was furnished by the State Police, the Kripo, and, to a lesser extent, by the SD.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Kripo?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, the State Police, the Criminal Police and, and to a lesser extent, the SD.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Were there any other sources of personnel?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, most of the men employed were furnished by the Waffen-SS and the Ordnungspolizei. The State Police and the Kripo furnished most of the experts, and the troops were furnished by the Waffen-SS and the Ordnungspolizei.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How about the Waffen-SS?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The Waffen-SS and the Ordnungspolizei were each supposed to supply the Einsatzgruppen with one company.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: How about the Order Police?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The Ordnungspolizei also furnished the Einsatzgruppen with one company.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: What was the size of Einsatz Group D and its operating area as compared with the other Einsatz groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I estimate that Einsatzgruppe D was one-half or two-thirds as large as the other Einsatzgruppen. That changed in the course of time, since some of the Einsatzgruppen were greatly enlarged.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: May it please the Tribunal, I have other questions relating to organizational matters which I think would clarify some of the evidence which has already been in part received by the Tribunal; but I don't want to take the time of the Tribunal unless they feel that they want any more such testimony. I thought perhaps if any members of the Tribunal had questions they would ask this witness directly, because he is the best informed on these organizational matters of anyone who will be presented in Court.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</P>

<P>Fulltext: THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Amen, the Tribunal does not think that it is necessary to go further into the organizational questions at this stage, but it is a matter which must be really decided by you because you know what the nature of the evidence which you are considering is.</P>

<P>So far as the Tribunal is concerned, they are satisfied at the present stage to leave the matter where it is. But there is one aspect of the witness' evidence which the Tribunal would like you to investigate, and that is whether the practices of which he has been speaking continued after 1942, and for how long.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: [To the witness.] Can you state whether the liquidation practices which you have described continued after 1942 and, if so, for how long a period of time thereafter?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I don't think that the basic order was ever revoked. But I cannot remember the detailsat least not in regard to Russiawhich would enable me to make concrete statements on this subject. The retreat began very shortly thereafter so that the operational region of the Einsatzgruppen became ever smaller. I do know, however, that other Einsatzgruppen with similar orders had been envisaged for other areas.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Your personal knowledge extends up to what date</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I know that the liquidation of Jews was prohibited about six months before the end of the war. I also saw a document terminating the liquidation of Soviet commissars, but I cannot recall a specific date.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Do you know whether in fact it was so terminated?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, I believe so.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to know the number of men in your Einsatz group.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: There were about 500 men in my Einsatzgruppe excluding those who were added to the group as assistants from the country itself.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Including them, did you say?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Excluding those who were added to the group from the country itself.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do you know how many there would be in other groups?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I estimate that at the beginning there were seven to eight hundred men; but, as I said, this number changed rapidly in the course of time, since the Einsatzgruppen themselves acquired new people or succeeded in getting additional personnel from the RSHA.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The numbers increased, did they?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, the numbers increased.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Now, here are perhaps just a half dozen of these questions I would like to ask, because I do think they might clear up, in the minds of the Tribunal, some of the evidence which has gone before. I shall be very brief, if that is satisfactory to the Tribunal.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Will you explain the significance of the different widths of the blue lines on the chart?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The thick blue line between the position of Himmler as Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police and the RSHA is designed to show the identity of the offices of the chiefs of the Sicherheitspolizei and the SD in their tasks. The RSHA treated both ministerial questions of leadership and individual executive questions, that is to say, matters of the Sipo and the SD. From the legal administrative point of view, however, the organizational scheme shows an illegal state of affairs in that the RSHA as such never actually had official validity. The formal, legal situation was different from that shown on this chart. Party and State offices with different authority were amalgamated. Under this designation RSHA, no directives or laws or orders could be issued on a legal basis, because the State Police, in its ministerial capacity, was still subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, whereas the SD, despite this set-up, was an organ of the Party.</P>

<P>Therefore if I wanted to reproduce this administrative scheme accurately, I should, for example, have to put in place of Amt IV, the Amt "Political Police", a part of the former Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei. This Amt "Political Police" existed formally to the very end and had sprung from the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior. Also, the Secret State Police Amt, the Central Office of the Prussian Secret State Police, the head office of all the political police offices of the different Laender, continued to exist formally.</P>

<P>Thus, ministerial questions continued to be dealt with under the heading of the Minister of the Interior. So far as it was necessary to emphasize the formal competence of the Ministry of the Interior, this was indicated in the heading "Reich Minister of the Interior" with the filing notice "Pol," the former designation of the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior, together with the appropriate filing notice of the competent department of the former Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei; for example, filing notice "Pol-S" meant Sicherheitspolizei; "V" meant Amt Verwaltung und Recht (Administration and Law).</P>

<P>The RSHA was therefore nothing more than a camouflage designation which did not correctly represent the actual state of affairs but gave the Chief of the Sipo and the SD, as a collective designation for the Chief of the Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei and the Chief of the SD Hauptamt (an office which existed until 1939), the opportunity of using one or the other letterhead at any time.</P>

<P>At the same time it gave him the opportunity of an internal amalgamation of all forces and the opportunity of a division of the spheres of work on a practical, effective basis. But the State offices in this Amt did remain in a way dependent on the Ministry of the Interior, and similarly the departments of the SD remained departments of the Party.</P>

<P>The SD Hauptamt, or the RSHA, had formally only the significance of an SS Main Office, in which the SS members of the Sipo and the SD belonged to the SS. But the SS, that is to say, Hitler, as Reichsfuehrer SS, gave these State offices no official authority to issue orders.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I am not sure that I follow altogether what you have been saying; but is what you have been saying the reason why you are shown on the chart as concerned with Amt III which refers, apparently, only to inside Germany, while, according to your evidence, you were the head of Einsatz Group D, which was operating outside Germany?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The fact that I led an Einsatzgruppe had nothing to do with my position as Chief of Amt III. I led the Einsatzgruppe as an individual and not as Chief of Amt III; and in my capacity as leader of an Einsatzgruppe, I entered into a completely new function and assumed an office completely separate from my previous one.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I see. And did it involve that you left Germany and went into the area invaded in the Soviet Union?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you now explain the significance of the dotted blue lines, as compared with the solid blue lines on the right-hand side of the chart?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The solid lines indicate a direct official channel for orders, whereas the dotted lines signify that there was, as a rule, no direct channel.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Was the term "SD" ever used to include both the Sipo and the SD?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: In the course of years the term "SD" was used more and more incorrectly. It came to be established as an abbreviation for Sipo and SD, without actually being suitable for that. "SD" was originally simply a designation for the fact that someone belonged to the SS through the SD Main Office. When the SD Main Office was dissolved and was taken over into the RSHA, the question arose whether the designation SD, which was also worn as insignia on the sleeve of the particular SS man, should be replaced by another insignia or a new abbreviation, e.g. RSHA. That was not done because the camouflage of the RSHA would thereby have been endangered. But when, for example I read in a Fuehrer order that in France people were to be turned over to the SD, that was a case in point of the false use of the designation SD, because there were no such offices in France and the SD, insofar as it functioned in departments, e.g., Amt III, had no executive power but was purely an intelligence organ.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Briefly, what was the relationship between the SS and the Gestapo?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: The relationship between the SS and Gestapo was this: The Reichsfuehrer SS, as such, took over the tasks of police and attempted to link the State Police and the SS more closely, that is to say, on the one hand to employ only members of the State Police who were eligible for the SS and, on the other hand, to use the institutions of the SS, e.g., education and training the younger generation by the Waffen-SS, in order in this way supply recruits for the State Police. This amalgamation was later extended by Himmler in an attempt to bring about the same relationship between the SS and the Ministry of the Interior, i.e., the whole internal administration.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: About how many full-time agents and honorary auxiliary personnel did the SD employ?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, well, in this connection, too, one cannot use the term SD; one must distinguish here between Amt III and Amt VI. Amt III, as the interior intelligence service, had about 400 salaried members, including men and women. On the other hand, the interior intelligence service worked essentially with honorary members, that is, with men and women who put their professional experiences and the experiences in their surroundings at the disposal of the interior intelligence service. I would judge their number to be roughly 30000.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you briefly give the Tribunal a general example of how a typical transaction was handled through the channels indicated on the chart?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: First, a general example, invented to make things clear. Himmler heard that more and more saboteurs were being dropped from planes into Germany and were endangering transportation and factory sites. He informed Kaltenbrunner in the latter's capacity as Chief of the Sipo and instructed him to draw the attention of his organs to this state of affairs and to take measures ensuring that these saboteurs would be seized as soon and as completely as possible.</P>

<P>Kaltenbrunner instructed the chief of Amt IV, that is, the State Police, to prepare an order to this effect for the regional offices. This order was drawn up by the competent authorities in Amt IV and was either transmitted by Mueller directly to the State Police offices in the Reich orand this is more probable on account of the importance of the question and the necessity to bring the order at the same time to the attention of the other offices of the Sicherheitspolizeior he gave it to Kaltenbrunner, who signed it and sent it to the regional offices in the Reich.</P>

<P>An order of this sort laid down, for example, that the State Police offices were to report the measures they were taking as well as their results. These reports went back through the same channels from the regional offices to the competent authorities in Amt IV, from there to the Chief of Amt IV, from there to the Chief of the Sicherheitspolizei, Kaltenbrunner, and then to the Chief of the German Police Himmler.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And, finally will you give a specific example of typical transaction handled through the channels indicated on the chart?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I take the example of the arrest of the leaders of the leftist parties after the events of the 20th of July. This order was also transmitted from Himmler to Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner passed it on to Amt IV and an appropriate draft for a decree was formulated by Amt IV, signed by Kaltenbrunner and sent to the regional offices. The reports were returned from the subordinate offices back to the higher offices along the same channels.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: May it please the Tribunal. The witness is now available to other counsel. I understand that Colonel Pokrovsky has some questions that he wishes to ask on behalf of the Soviets.</P>

<P>COLONEL Y. V. POKROVSKY (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the USSR). The testimony of the witness is important for the clarification of questions in a report on which the Soviet Delegation is at present working. Therefore, with the permission of the Tribunal I would like to put a number of questions to the witness.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Witness, you said that you were present twice at the mass executions. On whose orders were you an inspector at the executions?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I was present at the executions on my own initiative.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: But you said that you attended as inspector.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I said that I attended for inspection purposes.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: On your initiative?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Did one of your chiefs always attend the executions for purposes of inspection?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Whenever possible I sent a member of the staff of the Einsatzgruppe to witness the executions, but this was not always feasible since the Einsatzgruppen had to operate over great distances.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Why was some person sent for purposes of inspection?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Would you please repeat the question?</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: For what purpose was an inspector sent?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: To determine whether or not my instructions regarding the manner of the execution were actually being carried out.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Am I to understand that the inspector was to make certain that the execution had actually been carried out?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No, it would not be correct to say that. He was to ascertain whether the conditions which I had set for the execution were actually being carried out.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: What manner of conditions had you in mind?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: 1. Exclusion of the public; 2. Military execution by a firing-squad. 3. Arrival of the transports and carrying out of the liquidation in a smooth manner to avoid unnecessary excitement; 4. Supervision of the property to prevent looting. There may have been other details which I no longer remember. At any rate, all ill-treatment, whether physical or mental, was to be prevented through these measures.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You wished to make sure that what you considered to be an equitable distribution of this property was effected, or did you aspire to complete acquisition of the valuables.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes. [Editors note: Only the first half of the preceding question, originally spoken in Russian, was transmitted to the witness in German by the interpreter. The answer of the witness, therefore, refers only to this first half of the question.] [Errata note: Delete the word "yes" and the asterisk and insert the following: "The valuables were handed in already before the execution took place; they were collected by the Jewish Council of Elders and handed over to the local Einsatzkommando. COL. POKROVSKY: What kind of valuables or property was that? OHLENDORF: For example, gold, silver and bonds. COL. POKROVSKY: You wanted to make sure that these valuables were used in a proper manner? OHLENDORF: Yes." Footnote is to be deleted.]</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You spoke of ill-treatment. What did you mean by ill-treatment at the executions?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: If, for instance, the manner in which the executions were carried out caused excitement and disobedience among the victims, so that the Kommandos were forced to restore order by means of violence.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: What do you mean by "restore order by means of violence"? What do you mean by suppression of the excitement amongst the victims by means of violence?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: If, as I have already said, in order to carry out the liquidation in an orderly fashion it was necessary, for example, to resort to beating.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Was it absolutely necessary to beat the victims?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I myself never witnessed it, but I heard of it.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: From whom?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: In conversations with members of other Kommandos.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You said that cars, autocars, were used for the executions?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Do you know where, and with whose assistance, the inventor, Becker, was able to put his invention into practice?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I remember only that it was done through Amt II of the RSHA; but I can no longer say that with certainty.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: How many were executed in these cars?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I did not understand the question. [=]</P>

<P>Fulltext:</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: How many persons were executed by means of these cars?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I cannot give precise figures, but the number was comparatively very smallperhaps a few hundred.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You said that mostly women and children were executed in these vans. For what reason?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That was a special order from Himmler to the effect that women and children were not to be exposed to the mental strain of the executions; and thus the men of the Kommandos, mostly married men, should not be compelled to aim at women and children.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Did anybody observe the behavior of the persons executed in these vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, the doctor.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Did you know that Becker had reported that death in these vans was particularly agonizing?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No. I learned of Becker's reports for the first time from the letter to Rauff, which was shown to me here. On the contrary, I know from the doctor's reports that the victims were not conscious of their impending death.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Did any military unitsI mean, Army unitstake part in these mass executions?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: As a rule, no.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: And as an exception?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I think I remember that in Nikolaiev and in Simferopol a spectator from the Army High Command was present for a short time.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: For what purpose?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I don't know, probably to obtain information personally.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Were military units assigned to carry out the executions in these towns?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Officially, the Army did not assign any units for this purpose; the Army as such was actually opposed to the liquidation.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: But in practice?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Individual units occasionally volunteered. However, at the moment I know of no such case among the Army itself, but only among the units attached to the Army (Heeresgefolge).</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You were the man by whose orders people here sent to their death. Were Jews only handed over for the execution by the Einsatzgruppe or were Communists"Communist officials" you call them in your instructionshanded over for execution along with the Jews?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, activists and political commissars. Mere membership in the Communist Party was not sufficient to persecute or kill a man.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Were any special investigations made concerning the part played by persons in the Communist Party?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: No, I said on the contrary that mere membership of the Communist Party was not, in itself, a determining factor in persecuting or executing a man; he had to have a special political function.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Did you have any discussions on the murder vans sent from Berlin and on their use?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I did not understand the question.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Had you occasion to discuss, with your chiefs and your colleagues, the fact that motor vans had been sent to your own particular Einsatzgruppe from Berlin for carrying out the executions? Do you remember any such discussions?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I do not remember any specific discussion.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Had you any information concerning the fact that members of the execution squad in charge of the executions were unwilling to use the vans?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I knew that the Einsatzkommandos were using these vans.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: No, I had something else in mind. I wanted to know whether you received reports that members of the execution Squads were unwilling to use the vans and preferred other means of execution?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: That they would rather kill by means of the gas vans than by shooting?</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: On the contrary, that they preferred execution by shooting to killing by means of the gas vans.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: Yes, I have already said that the gas van...</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: And why did they prefer execution by shooting to killing in the gas vans? OHLENDORF: Because, as I have already said, in the opinion of the leader of the Einsatzkommandos, the unloading of the corpses was an unnecessary mental strain.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: What do you mean by "an unnecessary mental strain"?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: As far as I can remember the conditions at that timethe picture presented by the corpses and probably because certain functions of the body had taken place leaving the corpses lying in filth.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: You mean to say that the sufferings endured prior to death were clearly visible on the victims? Did I understand you correctly?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I don't understand the question; do you mean during the killing in the van?</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: I can only repeat what the doctor told me, that the victims were not conscious of their death in the van.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: In that case your reply to my previous question, that the unloading of the bodies made a very terrible impression on the members of the execution squad, becomes entirely incomprehensible.</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: And, as I said, the terrible impression created by the position of corpses themselves, and by the state of the vans which had probably been dirtied and so on.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: I have no further questions to put to this witness at the present stage of the Trial.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Prosecutor for the French Republic desire to put any questions to the witness?</P>

<P>M. FRANCOIS DE MENTHON (Chief Prosecutor for the French Republic): No.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Does the counsel for Kaltenbrunner desire to cross-examine now or at a later date?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: Perhaps I could ask a few questions now and request that I be allowed to make my cross-examination later, after consultation with Kaltenbrunner.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN [Turning to the witness.]: How long have you known Kaltenbrunner?</P>

<P>OHLENDORF: May I be allowed to sit? May I sit down?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly. [=]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do the Chief prosecutors wish to cross examine?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You are perhaps aware that you are the only living man who can expound to us the true purposes of the Nazi Party and the inner workings of its leadership?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am perfectly aware of that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON You, from the very beginning, together with those who were associated with you, intended to overthrow and later did overthrow, the Weimar Republic?</P>

<P>GOERING: That was, as far as I am concerned, my firm intention.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And, upon coming to power, you immediately abolished parliamentary government in Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: We found it to be no longer necessary. Also I should like to emphasize the fact that we were moreover the strongest parliamentary party, and had the majority. But you are correct when you say that parliamentary Procedure was done away with because the various parties were disbanded and forbidden. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You established the Leadership Principle, which you have described as a system under which authority existed only at the top, and is passed downwards and is imposed on the people below; is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I should like once more to explain the idea briefly, as I understand it. In German parliamentary procedure in the past responsibility rested with the highest officials, who were responsible for carrying out the anonymous wishes of the majorities, and it was they who exercised the authority. In the Leadership Principle we sought to reverse the direction, that is,.the authority existed at the top and passed downwards, while the responsibility began at the bottom and passed upwards.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, you did not believe in nd did not permit government, as we call it, by consent of the governed, in which the people, through their representatives, were the source of power and authority?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not entirely correct. We repeatedly called on the people to express unequivocally and clearly what they thought of our system, only it was in a different way from that previously adopted and from the system in practice in other countries. We chose the way of a so-called plebiscite. We also took the point of view that even a government founded on the Leadership Principle could maintain itself only if it was based in some way on the confidence of the people. If it no longer had such confidence, then t would have to rule with bayonets, and the Fuehrer was always of the opinion that that was impossible in the long run-to rule against the will of the people.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you did not permit the election of those who should act with authority by the people, but they were designated from the top downward continuously, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Quite right. The people were merely to acknowledge the authority of the Fuehrer, or, let us say, to declare themselves in agreement with the Fuehrer. If they gave the Fuehrer their confidence then it was their concern to exercise the other functions. Thus, not the individual persons were to be selected according to the will of the people, but solely the leadership itself.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, was this Leadership Principle supported and adopted by you in Germany because you believed that no people are capable of self-government, or because you belieVed that some may be, not the German people; or that no matter whether some of us are capable of using our own system, it should not be allowed in Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: I beg your pardon, I did not quite understand the question, but I could perhaps answer it as follows:</P>

<P>I consider the Leadership Principle necessary because the system which previously existed, and which we called parliamentary or democratic, had brought Germany to the verge of ruin. I might perhaps in this connection remind you that your own President Roosevelt, as far as I can recall-I do not want to quote it word for word-declared, "Certain peoples in Europe have forsaken democracy, not because they did not wish for democracy as such, but because democracy had brought forth men who were too weak to give their people work and bread, and to satisfy them. For this reason the peoples have abandoned this system and the men belonging to it." There is much truth in that statement. This system had brought ruin by mismanagement and according to my own opinion, only an organization made up of a strong, clearly defined leadership hierarchy could restore order again. But, let it be understood, not against the will of the people, but only when the people, having in the course of time, and by means of a series of elections, grown stronger and stronger, had expressed their wish to entrust their destiny to the National Socialist leadership.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The principles of the authoritarian government which you set up required, as I understand you, that there be tolerated no opposition by political parties which might defeat or obstruct the policy of the Nazi Party?</P>

<P>GOERING: You have understood this quite correctly. By that time we had lived long enough with opposition and we had had enough of it. Through opposition we had been completely ruined. It was now time to have done with it and to start building up.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: After you came to power, you regarded it necessary, in order to maintain power, to suppress all opposition parties?</P>

<P>GOERING: We found it necessary not to permit any more opposition, yes.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And you also held it necessary that you should suppress all individual opposition lest it should develop intO a party of opposition?</P>

<P>GOERING: Insofar as opposition seriously hampered our work of building up, this opposition of individual persons was, of courSe not tolerated. Insofar as it was simply a matter of harmless talk it was considered to be of no consequence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, in order to make sure that You suppressed the parties, and individuals also, you found it necessary to have a secret political police to detect opposition?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have already stated that I considered that necessary just as previously the political police had existed, but on a firmer basis and larger scale.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And upon coming to power you also considered it immediately necessary to establish concentration camps to take care of your incorrigible opponents?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have already stated that the reason for the concentration camps was not because it could be said, "Here are a number of people who are opposed to us and they must be taken into protective custody." Rather they were set up as a lightning measure against the functionaries of the Communist Party who were attacking us in the thousands, and who, since they were taken into protective custody, were not put in prison. But it was necessary, as I said, to erect a camp for themone, two, or three camps.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you are explaining, as the high authority of this system, to men who do not understand it very well, and I want to know what was necessary to run the kind of system that you set up in Germany. The concentration camp was one of the things you found immediately necessary upon coming into power, was it not? And you set them u as a matter of neceSsitY. as you saw it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That was faultily translated- it went too fast. But I believe I have understood the sense of your remarks. You asked me if I considered it necessary to establish concentration camps immediately in order to eliminate opposition. Is that correct?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your answer is "yes," I take it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Was it also necessary, in operating this system, that you must not have persons entitled to public trials in independent courts? And you immediately issued an order that your political police would not be subject to court review or to court orders, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: You must differentiate between the two categories; those who had committed some act of treason against the new state or those who might be proved to have committed such an act, were naturally turned over to the courts. The others, however, of whom one might expect such acts, but who had not yet committed them, were taken into protective custody, and these were the people who were taken to concentration camps. I am now speaking of what happened at the beginning. Later things changed a great deal. Likewise, if for political reasons-to answer your question- someone was taken into protective custody, that is, purely for reasons of state, this could not be reviewed or stopped by any court. Later, when some people were also taken into protective custody for nonpolitical reasons, people who had opposed the system in some other way, I once, as Prussian Prime Minister and Reich Minister of the Interior, I remember...

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let's omit that. I have not asked for that. If you will just answer my question, we shall save a great deal of time. Your counsel will be permitted to bring out any explanations you want to make.</P>

<P>You did prohibit all court review and considered it necessary to prohibit court review of the causes for taking people into what you called protective custody?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I answered very clearly, but I should like to make an explanation in connection with my answer.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your counsel will see to that. Now, the concentration camps and the protective custody...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, the Tribunal thinks the witness ought to be allowed to make what explanation he thinks right in answer to this question.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Tribunal thinks that you should be permitted to explain your answer now, and it will listen to your answers.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I did not mean that to apply generally to his answers. I meant it to apply to this particular answer.</P>

<P>GOERING: In connection with your question that these cases could not be reviewed by the court, I want to say that a decree was issued through me and Frick jointly to the effect that those who were turned over to concentration camps were to be informed after 24 hours of the reason for their being turned over, and that after 48 hours, or some short period of time, they should have the right to an attorney. But this by no means rescinded my order that a review wa not permitted by the courts of a politically necessary measure of protective custody. These people were simply to be given an opportunity of making a protest.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Protective custody meant that you were taking people into custody who had not committed any crimes but who, you thought, might possibly commit a crime?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. People were arrested and taken into protective custody who had not yet committed any crime, but who could be expected to do so if they remained free, just as extensive protective measures are being taken in Germany today on a tremendous scale.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, it is also a necessity, in the kind of state that you had, that you have some kind of organization to carry propaganda down to the people and to get their reaction and inform the leadership of it, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: The last part of that question has not been intelligibly translated.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you had to have organizations to carry out orders and to carry your propaganda in that kind of state, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course, we carried on propaganda, and for this we had a propaganda organization.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you carried that on through the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: The Leadership Corps was there, of course, partly to spread our ideas among the people. Secondly, its purpose was to lead and organize the people who made up the Party.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Through your system of Gauleiter and Kreisleiter down to Blockleiter, commands and information went down from the authority, and information as to the people's reactions came back to the leadership, didn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. The orders and commands that were to be given for propaganda or other purposes were passed down the grades as far as necessary. On the other hand, it was a matter of course that the reactions of the broad masses of the people were again transmitted upwards, through the various offices, in order to keep us informed of the mood of the people.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you also had to have certain organizations to carry out orders-executive organizations, organizations to fight for you if necessary, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, administrative organizations were, of course, necessary. I do not quite understand-organizations to fight what?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, if you wanted certain peoPle killed you had to have some organization that would kill them didn't you? Rohm and the rest of them were not killed by Hitler's own hands nor by yours, were they?</P>

<P>GOERING: Rohm-the Rohm affair I explained here clearly- that was a matter of State necessity...</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I did not ask you . . .</P>

<P>GOERING: ... and was carried out by the police.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But when it was State necessity to ill somebodY, you had to have somebody to do it, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, just as in other countries, whether it is called secret service or something else, I do not know. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the SA, the SS, and the SD, organizations of that kind, were the organizations that carried out the orders and dealt with people on a physical level, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: The SA never received an order to kill anybody, fieither did the SS, not in my time. Anyhow, I had no influence on it. I know that orders were given for executions, namely in the Rohm Putsch, and these were carried out by the police, that is, by a State organ.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What police?</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as I recall, through the Gestapo. At any rate, that was the organization that received the order. You see, it was a fight against enemies of the State.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the SS was for the same purpose, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not in north Germany at that time; to what extent that was the case in south Germany, where the Gestapo and the SS were still separated, and who carried out the action in south Germany, I do not know.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the SS carried out arrests and carried out the transportation of people to concentration camps, didn't they? You were arrested by the SS, weren't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I say, yes; but later.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: At what time did the SS perform this function of acting as the executor of the Nazi Party?</P>

<P>GOERING: After the seizure of power, when the police came to be more and more in the hands of Himmler. It is difficult for me to explain to an outsider where the SS or where the Gestapo was active. I have already said that the two of them worked very closely together. It is known that the SS guarded the camps and later carried out police functions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And carried out other functions in the camps?</P>

<P>GOERING: To what functions do you refer?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: They carried out all of the functions of the camps, didn't they?</P>

<P>GOERING: If an SS unit was guarding a camp and an SS leader happened to be the camp commander, then this unit carried out all the functions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, this system was not a secret system. This entire system was openly avowed, its merits were publicly advocated by yourself and others, and every person entering into the Nazi Party was enabled to know the kind of system of government you were going to set up, wasn't he?</P>

<P>GOERING: Every person who entered the Party knew that we embraced the Leadership Principle and knew the fundamental measures we wanted to carry out, so far as they were stated in the program. But not everyone who joined the Party knew down to the last detail what was going to happen later.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But this system was set up openly and was well known, was it not, in every one of its details? As to organization, everybody knew what the Gestapo was, did they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, everyone knew what the Gestapo was.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what its program was in general, not in detail?</P>

<P>GOERING: I explained that program clearly. At the very beginning I described that publicly, and I also spoke publicly of the tasks of the Gestapo, and I even wrote about it for foreign countries.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And there was nothing secret about the establishment of a Gestapo as a political police, about the fact that people were taken into protective custody, about the fact that these were concentration camps? Nothing secret about those things, was there?</P>

<P>GOERING: There was at first nothing secret about it at all.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: As a matter of fact, part of the effectiveness of a secret police and part of the effectiveness of concentration camp penalties is that the people do know that there are such agencies, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: It is true that everyone knows that if he acts against the state he will end up in a concentration camp or will be accused of high treason before a court, according to the degree of his crime But the original reason for creating the concentration camps was to keep there such people whom we rightfully considered enemies of the State.

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, that is the type of government the government which we have just been describing-the only type of government which you think is necessary to govern Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: I should not like to say that the basic characteristic of this government and its most essential feature was the immediate setting up of the Gestapo and the concentration camps in order to take care of our opponents, but that over and above that we had set down as our government program a great many far more impOrtant things, and that those other things were not the basic principles of our government.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But all of these things were necessary things as I understood you, for purposes of protection?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, these things were necessary because of the opponents that existed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I assume that that is the only kind of government that you think can function in Germany under present conditions?</P>

<P>GOERING: Under the conditions existing at that time, it was, in my opinion, the only possible form, and it also demonstrated that Germany could be raised in a short time from the depths of misery, poverty, and unemployment to relative prosperity.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, all of this authority of the State was concentrated-perhaps I am taking up another subject. Is it the intent to recess at this time?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</P>

<P>[The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.] [=]</P>

<P>Afternoon Session</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The witness Dahlerus has been in Nuremberg for several days and is waiting to testify. He has informed me that he must be in Stockholm again by Thursday without fail. or this reason he requests, and I am asking the High Tribunal's permission that he be called as a witness tomorrow morning, even if the cross examination has not been completed. The Prosecution have all agreed to my proposal.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Did you say the Prosecution had agreed to your proposal?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes, My Lord. I contacted the four gentlemen involved and they have agreed to this.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: How long do you anticipate that the examination in chief of the witness will take? You cannot answer for the cross-examination.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I believe that I will need half a day, that is until tomorrow noon. I cannot say definitely, but it is quite probable it will last as long as that.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: His evidence is relevant only to the fe days before the 9/1/1939?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: There are two additional questions, but these questions may be answered very briefly. He seems to have made two further efforts after September, but those are very brief questions.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: It appears to the Tribunal that half a day is a totally unnecessary time for the examination in chief of a witness who is going to speak about events during a few days before the war began.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I would not say that, Mr. President. It is not just a few days. These negotiations started already at the end of June or the beginning of July. I should like to add further that I shall naturally limit myself to such questions as are necessary or the Trial, but these questions should be asked.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal agrees, if the Prosecution is willing for this evidence to be interposed. The Tribunal trusts that you will find it possible to make your examination in chief Much shorter than you have indicated.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Witness, you have related to us the manner in which you and others co-operated in concentrating all authority in the German State in the hands of the Fuehrer is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: I was speaking about myself and to what extent I had a part in it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is there any defendant in the box you know of who did not co-operate toward that end as far as was possible?</P>

<P>GOERING: That none of the defendants here opposed or obstructed the Fuehrer in the beginning is clear, but I should like to call your attention to the fact that we must always distinguish between different periods of time. Some of the questions that are being put to me are very general and, after all, we are concerned with a nod extending over 24 to 25 years, if a comprehensive survey is to be made.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I want to call your attention to the fruits of this system. You, as I understand it, were informed in 1940 of an impending attack by the German Army on Soviet Russia?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have explained just how far I was informed of these matters.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You believed an attack not only to be unnecessary, but also to be unwise from the point of view of Germany itself?</P>

<P>GOERING: At that particular time I was of the opinion that this attack should be postponed in order to carry through other tasks which I considered more important.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You did not see any military necessity or an attack at that time, even from the point of view of Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: Naturally, I was fully aware of Russia's efforts in the deployment of her forces, but I hoped first to put into effect the other strategic measures, described by me, to improve Germany's POSITION I thought that the time required for these would ward off the critical moment. I well knew, of course, that this critical moment for Germany might come at any time after that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I can only repeat my question, which I submit you have not answered.</P>

<P>Did you at that time see any military necessity for an attack by Germany on Soviet Russia?</P>

<P>GOERING: I personally believed that at that time the danger had not yet reached its climax, and therefore the attack might not yet be necessary. But that was my personal view.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you were the Number 2 man at that time in all Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: It has nothing to do with my being second in importance There were two conflicting points of view as regards strategy.</P>

<P>The Fuehrer, the Number 1 man, saw one danger, and I, as the Number 2 man, if you wish to express it so, wanted to carry out another strategic measure. If I had imposed my will every time then I would probably have become the Number 1 man. But since the Number 1 man was of a different opinion, and I was only the Number 2 man, his opinion naturally prevailed. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I have understood from your testimony-and I think you can answer this "yes" or "no," and I would greatly appreciate it if you would-I have understood from your testimony that you were opposed, and told the Fuehrer that you were opposed, to an attack upon Russia at that time. Am I right or wrong?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you were opposed to it because you thought that it was a dangerous move for Germany to make; is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I was of the opinion that the moment-and I repeat this again-had not come for this undertaking, and that measures should be taken which were more expedient as far as Germany was concerned.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And yet, because of the Fuehrer system, as I understand you, you could give no warning to the German people; you could bring no pressure of any kind to bear to prevent that step, and you could not even resign to protect your own place in history.</P>

<P>GOERING: These are several questions at once. I should like to answer the first one.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Separate them, if you wish.</P>

<P>GOERING: The first question was, I believe, whether I took the opportunity to tell the German people about this danger. I had no occasion to do this. We were at war, and such differences of opinion, as far as strategy was concerned, could not be brought before the public forum during war. I believe that never has happened in world history. Secondly, as far as my resignation is concerned, I do not wish even to discuss that, for during the war I was an officer, a soldier, and I was not concerned with whether I shared an opinion or not I had merely to serve my country as a soldier.</P>

<P>Thirdly, I was not the man to forsake someone, to whom I had given my oath of loyalty, every time he was not of my way of thinking. If that had been the case there would have been no need to bind myself to him from the beginning. It never occurred to me to leave the Fuehrer.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Insofar as you know, the German people were led into the war, attacking Soviet Russia under the belief that you favored it?</P>

<P>GOERING: The German people did not know about the declaration of war against Russia until after the war with Russia had started. The German people, therefore, had nothing to do with this. The German people were not asked; they were told of the fact and of the necessity for it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: At what time did you know that the war, as regards achieving the objectives that you had in mind, was a lost war?</P>

<P>GOERING: It is extremely difficult to say. At any rate, according to my conviction, relatively late-I mean, it was only towards the end that I became convinced that the war was lost. Up till then I had always thought and hoped that it would come to a stalemate.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, in 11/1941 the offensive in Russia broke down?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not at all correct. We had reverses because of weather conditions, or rather, the goal which we had set was not reached. The push of 1942 proved well enough that there was no question of a military collapse. Some corps, which had pushed forward, were merely thrown back, and some were withdrawn. The totally unexpected early frost that set in was the cause of this.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You said, "relatively late." The expression that you used does not tell me anything, because I do not know what you regard as relatively late. Will you fix in terms, the of events or time, when it was that the conviction came to you that the war was lost?</P>

<P>GOERING: When, after 1/12/1945, the Russian offensive pushed forward to the Oder and at the same time the Ardennes offensive had not penetrated, it was then that I was forced to realize that defeat would probably set in slowly. Up to that time I had always hoped that, on the one side, the position at the Vistula toward the East and, on the other side, the position at the West Wall towards the West, could be held until the flow of the new mass produced weapons should bring about a slackening of the Anglo-American air war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, will you fix that by date; you told us when it was by events.</P>

<P>GOERING: I just said 1/1945; middle, or end of 1/1945. After that there was no more hope.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you want it understood that, as a military man, you did not realize until 1/1945 that Germany could not be successful in the war?</P>

<P>GOERING: As I have already said, we must draw a sharp distinction between two possibilities: First, the successful conclusion of a war, and second, a war which ends by neither side being the victor. As regards a successful outcome, the moment when it was realized that that was no longer possible was much earlier, whereas the realization of the fact that defeat would set in did not come until the time I have just mentioned.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: For some period before that, you knew that a successful termination of the war could only be accomplished if you could come to some kind of terms with the enemy; was that not true?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course, a successful termination of a war can only be considered successful if I either conquer the enemy or, through negotiations with the enemy, come to a conclusion which guarantees me success. That is what I call a successful termination. I call it a draw, when I come to terms with the enemy. This does not bring me the success which victory would have brought but, on the other hand, it precludes a defeat. This is a conclusion without victors or vanquished.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you knew that it was Hitler's policy never to negotiate and you knew that as long as he was the head of the Government the enemy would not negotiate with Germany, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I knew that enemy propaganda emphasized that under no circumstances would there be negotiations with Hitler. That Hitler did not want to negotiate under any circumstances, I also knew, but not in this connection. Hitler wanted to negotiate if there were some prospect of results; but he was absolutely opposed to hopeless and futile negotiations. Because of the declaration of the enemy in the West after the landing in Africa, as far as I remember, that under no circumstances would they negotiate with Germany but would force on her unconditional surrender, Germany's resistance was stiffened to the utmost and measures had to be taken accordingly. If I have no chance of concluding a war through negotiations, then it is useless to negotiate, and I must strain every nerve to bring about a change by a call to arms. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: By the time of 1/1945 you also knew that you were unable to defend the German cities against the air attacks of the Allies, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Concerning the defense of German cities against Allied air attacks, I should like to describe the possibility of doing this as follows: Of itself...</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Can you answer my question? Time may not mean quite as much to you as it does to the rest of us. Can you not answer "yes" or "no"? Did you then know, at the same time that you knew that the war was lost, that the German cities could not successfully be defended against air attack by the enemy? Can you not tell us "yes" or "no"?</P>

<P>GOERING: I can say that I knew that, at that time, it was not possible.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And after that time it was well known to you that the air attacks which were continued against England could not turn the tide of war, and were designed solely to effect a prolongation of what you then knew was a hopeless conflict?</P>

<P>GOERING: I believe you are mistaken. After 1/1945 there were no more attacks on England, except perhaps a few single planes, because at that time I needed all my petrol for the fighter planes for defense. If I had had bombers and oil at my disposal, then, of course, I should have continued such attacks up to the last minute as retaliation for the attacks which were being carried out on German cities, whatever our chances might have been.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What about robot attacks? Were there any robot attacks after 1/1945?</P>

<P>GOERING: Thank God, we still had one weapon that we could use. I have just said that, as long as the fight was on, we had to hit back; and as a soldier I can only regret that we did not have enough of these V-l and V-2 bombs, for an easing of the attacks on German cities could be brought about only if we could inflict equally heavy losses on the enemy.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And there was no way to prevent the war going on as long as Hitler was the head of the German Government, was there?</P>

<P>GOERING: As long as Hitler was the Fuehrer of the German people he alone decided whether the war was to go on. As long as my enemy threatens me and demands absolutely unconditional Surrender I fight to my last breath, because there is nothing left for me except perhaps a chance that in some way fate may change, even though it seems hopeless.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the people of Germany who thought it was time that the slaughter should stop had no means to stop it except revolution or assassination of Hitler, had they?</P>

<P>GOERING: A revolution always changes a situation, if it succeeds. That is a foregone conclusion. The murder of Hitler at this time, say 1/1945, would have brought about my succession. If the enemy had given me the same answer, that is, unconditional surrender, and had held out those terrible conditions which had been intimated, I would have continued fighting whatever the circumstances.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There wa's an attack on Hitler's life on 7/20/1944?</P>

<P>GOERING: Unfortunately, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And there came a time in 1945 when Hitler made a will in Berlin whereby he turned over the presidency of the Reich to your co-defendant, Admiral Doenitz. You know about that?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. I read of this will here.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And in making his will and turning over the Government of Germany to Admiral Doenitz, I call your attention to this statement:</P>

<P>"Goring and Himmler, quite apart from their disloyalty to my person, have done immeasurable harm to the country and the whole nation by secret negotiations with the enemy which they conducted without my knowledge and against my wishes, and by illegally attempting to seize power in the State for themselves."</P>

<P>And by that will he expelled you and Himmler from the Party and from all offices of the State.</P>

<P>GOERING: I can only answer for myself. What Himmler did I do not know.</P>

<P>I neither betrayed the Fuehrer, nor did I at that time negotiate with a single foreign soldier. This will, or this final act of the Fuehrer's, is based on an extremely regrettable mistake, and one which grieves me deeply-that the Fuehrer could believe in his last hours that I could ever be disloyal to him. It was all due to an error in the transmission of a radio report and perhaps to a misrepresentation which Bormann gave the Fuehrer. I myself never thought for a minute of taking over power illegally or of acting against the Fuehrer in any way.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In any event you were arrested and expected to be shot?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, in tracing the rise of power of the Party you have omitted some such things as, for example the Reichstag fire of 2/27/1933. There was a great purge following that fire, was there not, in which many people were arrested ad many people were killed?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know of a single case where a man was killed because of the Reichstag fire, except that of the incendiary, Van der Lubbe, who was sentenced by the court. The other two defendants in this trial were acquitted. Herr Thalmann was not, as you recently erroneously believed, accused; it was the communist representative Torgler. He was acquitted, as was also the Bulgarian, Dimitroff. Relatively few arrests were made in connection with the Reichstag fire. The arrests which you attribute to the Reichstag fire are the arrests of communist functionaries. These arrests, as I have repeatedly stated and wish to emphasize once more, had nothing to do with this fire. The fire merely precipitated their arrest and upset our carefully planned action, thus allowing several of the functionaries to escape. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, you had lists of Communists already prepared at the time of the Reichstag fire, of persons who should be arrested, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: We had always drawn up, beforehand, fairly complete lists of communist functionaries who were to be arrested. That had nothing to do with the fire in the German Reichstag.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: They were immediately put into execution-the arrests, I mean- after the Reichstag fire?</P>

<P>GOERING: Contrary to my intention of postponing this action for a few days and letting it take place according to plan, thereby perfecting the arrangements, the Fuehrer ordered that same night that the arrests should follow immediately. This had the disadvantage, as I said, of precipitating matters.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You and the Fuehrer met at the fire, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is right.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then and there you decided to arrest all the Communists that you had listed?</P>

<P>GOERING: I repeat again that the decision for their arrests had been reached some days before this; it simply meant that on that night they were immediately arrested. I would rather have waited a few days according to plan; then some of the important men would not have escaped.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the next morning the decree was presented to President Von Hindenburg, suspending the provisions of the constitution which we have discussed here, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I believe so, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Who was Karl Ernst?</P>

<P>GOERING: Karl Ernst-whether his first name was Karl I do not now-was the SA leader of Berlin.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And who was Helldorf?</P>

<P>GOERING: Count Helldorf was the subsequent SA leader of Berlin.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Heines?</P>

<P>GOERING: Heines was the SA leader of Silesia at that time.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, it is known to you, is it not that Ernst made a statement confessing that these three burned the Reichstag and that you and Goebbels planned and furnished the incendiary materials of liquid phosphorus and petroleum which were deposited by you in a subterranean passage for them to get, which passage led from your house to the Reichstag building? You knew of such a statement, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know of any statement by the SA leader Ernst. But I do know of some fairytale published shortly after in the foreign press by Rohm's chauffeur. This was after 1934.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But there was such a passage from the Reichstag building to your house, was there not?</P>

<P>GOERING: On one side of the street is the Reichstag building, and opposite is the palace of the Reichstag president. The two are connected by a passage along which the wagons run which carry the coke for the central heating.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And, in any event, shortly after this, Ernst was killed without a trial and without a chance to tell his story, was he not? "</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not correct. The Reichstag fire was in 2/1933. Ernst was shot on 6/30/1934, because together with Rohm he had planned to overthrow the Government and had plotted against the Fuehrer. He, therefore, had a year and a quarter in which he could have made statements regarding the Reichstag fire, if he had wished to do so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, he had begun to make statements, had he not, and you were generally being accused of burning the Reichstag building? You knew that, did you not? That was the . . .</P>

<P>GOERING: That accusation that I had set fire to the Reichstag came from a certain foreign press. That could not bother me because it was not consistent with the facts. I had no reason or motive for setting fire to the Reichstag. From the artistic point of view I did not at all regret that the assembly chamber was burned- I hoped to build a better one. But I did regret very much that I was forced to find a new meeting place for the Reichstag and, not being able to find one, I had to give up my Kroll Opera House, that is, the second State Opera House, for that purpose. The opera seemed to me much more important than the Reichstag.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Have you ever boasted of burning the Reichstag building, even by way of joking?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. I made a joke, if that is the one you are referring to, when I said that, after this, I should be competing with Nero and that probably people would soon be saying that, dressed in a red toga and holding a lyre in my hand, I looked on at the fire and played while the Reichstag was burning. That was the joke. But the fact was that I almost perished in the flames, which would have been very unfortunate for the German people, but very fortunate for their enemies. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never stated then that you burned the Reichstag?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. I know that Herr Rauschning said in the book which he wrote, and which has often been referred to here, that I had discussed this with him. I saw Herr Rauschning only twice in my life and only for a short time on each occasion. If I had set fire to the Reichstag, I would presumably have let that be known only to my closest circle of confidants, if at all. I would not have told it to a man whom I did not know and whose appearance I could not describe at all today. That is an absolute distortion of the truth.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you remember the luncheon on Hitler's birthday in 1942 at the Kasino, the officers' mess, at the headquarters of the Fuehrer in East Prussia?</P>

<P>GOERING: No.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You do not remember that? I will ask that you be shown the affidavit of General Franz Halder, and I call your attention to his statements which may refresh your recollection. I read it.</P>

<P>"On the occasion of a luncheon on the Fuehrer's birthday in 1942, the people around the Fuehrer turned the conversation to the Reichstag building and its artistic value. I heard with my own ears how Goring broke into the conversation and shouted: 'The only one who really knows the Reichstag is I, for I set fire to it.' And saying this he slapped his thigh."</P>

<P>GOERING: This conversation did not take place and I request that I be confronted with Herr Halder. First of all I want to emphasize that what is written here is utter nonsense. It says, "The only one who really knows the Reichstag is I." The Reichstag was known to every representative in the Reichstag. The fire took place only in the general assembly room, and many hundreds or thousands of people knew this room as well as I did. A statement of this type is utter nonsense. How Herr Halder came to make that statement I do not know. Apparently that bad memory, which also let him down in military matters, is the only explanation.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You know who Halder is?</P>

<P>GOERING: Only too well.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Can you tell us what position he held in the German Army?</P>

<P>GOERING: He was Chief of the General Staff of the Army, and I repeatedly pointed out to the Fuehrer, after the war started, that he would at least have to find a chief who knew something about such matters.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the Rohm purge you have left a little indefinite. What was it that Rohm did that he was shot? What acts did he commit?</P>

<P>GOERING: Rohm planned to overthrow the Government, and it was intended to kill the Fuehrer also. He wanted to follow it up by a revolution, directed in the first place against the Army, the officers' corps-those groups which he considered to be reactionary.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you had evidence of that fact?</P>

<P>GOERING: We had sufficient evidence of that fact.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But he was never tried in any court where he would have a chance to tell his story as you are telling yours, was he?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. He wanted to bring about a Putsch and therefore the Fuehrer considered it right that this thing should be nipped in the bud-not by a court procedure, but by smashing the revolt immediately.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Were the names of the people who were killed in that purge, following the arrest of Rohm, ever published?</P>

<P>GOERING: Some of the names, yes; but not all of them, I believe.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Who actually killed Rohm? Do you know?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know who personally carried out this action.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: To what organization was the order given?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I do not know either, because the shooting of Rohm was decreed by the Fuehrer and not by me, for I was competent in north Germany.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And who took into custody those who were destined for concentration camps, and how many were there?</P>

<P>GOERING: The police carried out the arrest of those who were, first of all, to be interrogated, those who were not so seriouslY incriminated and of whom it was not known whether they were incriminated or not. A number of these people were released very soon, others not until somewhat later. Just how many were arrested in this connection I cannot tell you. The arrests were made by the police. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Gestapo, you mean?</P>

<P>GOERING: I assume so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And if Milch testified that he saw 700 or 800 in Dachau in 1935, there musk have been a very much larger number arrested, since you say many were released. Do you know the number that were arrested?</P>

<P>GOERING: I state again, I do not know exactly how many were arrested because the necessary arrests, or the arrest of those who were considered as having a part in this, did not go through me. My action ended, so to speak, on the date when the revolt was smashed. I understood Milch a little differently and I sent a note to my counsel in order that it be made clear, through a question whether Milch meant by these 700 people those concerned with the Rohm Putsch or whether he meant to say that he saw altogether 700 arrested persons there. That is the way I understood it. But to clarify this statement we should have to question Milch again, for I believe this number of 500, 600, or 700, to be far too high for the total number of people arrested in connection with the Rohm Putsch.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Among those who were killed were Von Schleicher and his wife. He was one of your political opponents, was he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is right.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And also Erich Klausner, who had been Chief of the Catholic Action of Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: Klausner was likewise among those who were shot. Actually, it was Klausner's case which caused me, as I stated recently to ask the Fuehrer to give immediate orders to cease any further action, since, in my opinion, Klausner was quite wrongfully shot.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Strasser, who had been the former Number 2 man to Hitler and had disagreed with him in 12/1932-Strasser was killed, was he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of Strasser it cannot be said that he was Number 2 man after Hitler. He played an extremely important role within the Party before the seizure of power, but he was banned from the Party already before the seizure of power. Strasser participated in thiS revolt and he was also shot.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And when it got down to a point where there were only two left on the list yet to be killed, you intervened and asked to have it stopped; is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not entirely correct. I made it fairly clear and should like to repeat briefly that not when there were only two left on the list did I intervene; I intervened when I saw that many were shot who were not concerned with this matter. And when I did so, two persons were left who had taken a very active part, and the Fuehrer himself had ordered that they be shot. The Fuehrer was particularly furious with one of them, the chief instigator of the action. What I wanted to make clear was that I said to the Fuehrer, "It is better for you to give up the idea of having these two main perpetrators executed, and put an end to the whole thing immediately." That is what I meant.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What date was that? Did you fix the time?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I can give you a definite time. As far as I recall the decisive day was Saturday; on Saturday evening between 6 and 7 o'clock the Fuehrer arrived by plane from Munich. My request to stop the action was made on Sunday, some time between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what happened to the two men who were left on the list-were they ever brought to trial?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. One, as far as I remember, was taken to a concentration camp, and the other was for the time being placed under a sort of house arrest, if I remember correctly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, going back to the time when you met Hitler; you said that he was a man who had a serious and definite aim, that he was not content with the defeat of GermanY and with the Versailles Treaty; do you recall that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am very sorry, the translation was rather defective and I cannot understand it. Please repeat.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When you met Hitler, as I understand your testimony, you found a man with a serious and definite aim, as you said, in that he was not content with the defeat of Germany in the previous war and was not content with the Versailles Treaty.</P>

<P>GOERING: I think you did not quite understand me correctly here, for I did not put it that way at all. I stated that it had struck me that Hitler had very definite views of the impotency of protest; secondly, that he was of the opinion that Germany must be freed from the dictate of Versailles. It was not only Adolf Hitler; everY German, every patriotic German had the same feelings- and I, being an ardent patriot, bitterly felt the shame of the dictate of Versailles, and I allied myself with the man about whom I felt that he perceived most clearly the consequences of this dictate, and that probablY he was the man who would find the ways and means to set it aside. All the other talk in the Party about Versailles was, pardon the expression, mere twaddle.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So, as I understand you, from the very beginning publicly and notoriously, it was the position of the Nazi Party that the Versailles Treaty must be set aside and that protest was impotent for that purpose?</P>

<P>GOERING: From the beginning it was the aim of Adolf Hitler and his movement to free Germany from the oppressive fetters of Versailles, that is, not from the whole Treaty of Versailles, but from those terms which were strangling Germany's future.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And to do it by war, if necessary?</P>

<P>GOERING: We did not debate about that at all at the time. We debated only about the foremost condition, that Germany should acquire a different political structure, which alone would enable her to raise objections to this dictate, this one-sided dictate- everybody always called it a peace, whereas we Germans always called it a dictate and not merely objections, but such objections as would demand consideration.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That was the means-the means was the reorganization of the German State, but your aim was to get rid of what you call the dictate of Versailles. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: Liberation from these terms of the dictate of Versailles, which in the long run would make German life impossible, was the aim and the intention. But by that we did not go as far as to say, "We want to wage war on our enemies and be victorious." Rather, the aim was to suit the methods to the political events. Those were the basic considerations.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it was for that end that you and all of the other persons who became members of the Nazi Party gave to Hitler all power to make decisions for them, and agreed, in their oath of office, to give him obedience?</P>

<P>GOERING: Again here are several questions. Question One: The fight against the dictate of Versailles was for me the most decisive factor in joining the Party. For others, perhaps, other points of the program or of the ideology, which seemed more important, may have been more decisive. Giving the Fuehrer absolute powers was not a basic condition for getting rid of Versailles, but for putting into practice our conception of the Leadership Principle. To give him Our oath before he became the head of the State was, under the conditions then existing, a matter of course for those who considered themselves members of his select leadership corps. I do not know and I cannot tell exactly, just how the oath was given before the seizure of power; I can only tell you what I myself did. After a certain period of time, when I had acquired more insight into the Fuehrer's personality, I gave him my hand and said: "I unite my ate with yours for better or for worse: I dedicate myself to you in good times and in bad, even unto death." I really meant it-and still do.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If you would answer three or four questions for me "yes" or "no," then I would be quite willing to let you give your entire version of this thing. In the first place, you wanted a strong German State to overcome the conditions of Versailles.</P>

<P>GOERING: We wanted a strong State anyhow, regardless of Versailles; but in order to get rid of Versailles the State had, first of all, to be strong, for a weak State never makes itself heard; that we know from experience.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the Fuehrer principle you adopted because you thought it would serve the ends of a strong State?</P>

<P>GOERING: Correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And this aim, which was one of the aims of the Nazi Party, to modify the conditions of Versailles, was a public and notorious aim in which the people generally joined-it was one of your best means of getting people to join with you, was it not.</P>

<P>GOERING: The dictate of Versailles was such that every German in my opinion, could not help being in favor of its modification, and there is no doubt that this was a very strong inducement for joining the movement.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, a number of the men who took part in this movement are not here; and, for the record, there is no doubt in your mind, is there, that Adolf Hitler is dead?</P>

<P>GOERING: I believe there can be no doubt about that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the same is true of Goebbels?</P>

<P>GOERING: Goebbels, I have no doubt about that, for I heard from someone whom I trust completely, that he saw Goebbels dead.</P>

<P>MR JUSTICE JACKSON: And you have no doubt of the death of Himmler, have you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am not certain of that, but I think that you Must be certain, since you know much more about it than I, as he died a prisoner of yours. I was not there.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have no doubt of the death of Heydrich, have you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am absolutely certain about that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And probably of Bormann?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am not absolutely certain of this. I have no proof. I do not know, but I assume so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And those are the chief persons in your testimony, who have been mentioned as being responsible-Hitler for everything, Goebbels for inciting riots against the Jews, Himmler, who deceived Hitler, and Bormann, who misled him about his will?</P>

<P>GOERING: The influence exerted on the Fuehrer varied at different times. The chief influence on the Fuehrer, at least up till the end -of 1941 or the beginning of 1942, if one can speak of influence at all, vas exerted by me. From then until 1943 my influence gradually decreased, after which it rapidly dwindled. All in all, I do not believe anyone had anything like the influence on the Fuehrer that I had. Next to me, or apart from me, if one can speak of influence at all, Goebbels, with whom the Fuehrer was together quite a good deal, exerted an influence in a certain direction from the very beginning. This influence wavered for a time and was very slight, and then increased greatly in the last years of the war, for it was easy to win influence by means of...</P>

<P>Before the seizure of power and during the years immediately following the seizure of power, Hess had a certain influence, but only in regard to his special sphere. Then, in the course of the years, Himmler's influence increased. From the end of 1944 on this influence decreased rapidly. The most decisive influence on the Fuehrer during the war, and especially from about 1942-after Hess went out in 1941 and a year had elapsed-was exerted by Herr Bormann. The latter had, at the end, a disastrously strong influence. That was possible only because the Fuehrer was filled with profound mistrust after 20 July, and because Bormann was with him constantly and reported on and described to him all matters. Broadly speaking these are the persons who had influence at one time or another.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You took over a special intelligence organization in 1933 which was devoted to monitoring the telephone conversations of public officials and others inside and outside of Germany, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have explained that I had erected a technical apparatus which, as you said, monitored the conversations of important reigners to and from foreign countries-telegrams and wireless communications which were transmitted not only from Germany to foreign countries, but also from one foreign country to the other through the ether, and which were intercepted. It also monitored telephone conversations within Germany of: (1) all important foreigners; (2) important firms, at times; and (3) persons who for any reason of a political or police nature were to be watched.</P>

<P>In order to prevent any abuse on the part of the police, this department had to obtain my personal permission when it was to listen to telephone conversations. Despite this there could, of course, be uncontrolled tapping of wires at the same time, just as that is technically possible everywhere today. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You kept the results of those reports to yourself, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No; this was the procedure: These reports in which the Foreign Office was interested were released to the Foreign Office. Those reports which were important to the Fuehrer went to the Fuehrer. Those which were important to the military authorities went to the Minister of War, or to the Air Ministry, or to the Ministry of Economy. I or my deputy decided whether a report was important for this or that office. There was a man there whose job and responsibility it was to see that these secret reports were submitted only to the chief.l I could, of course, order at any time that this or that report should be exclusively for my knowledge and not be handed on. That was always possible.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You had a good deal of difficulty with other police authorities who wanted to get possession of that organization, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. The police did strive to get this instrument into their hands. But they did not get it from me, and perhaps they kept a watch of their own here and there. But the decisive control which had to be directed through the Ministry of Posts could technically be ordered only by me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have listened to the evidence of the Prosecution against all of the defendants in this case, have you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is there any act of any of your co-defendants which you claim was not one reasonably necessary to carry out the plans of the Nazi Party?</P>

<P>GOERING: At present those are only assertions by the Prosecution; they are not yet facts which have been proved. In these assertions there are a number of actions which would not have been necessary.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Will you specify which acts, of which defendants, you claim, are beyond the scope of the plans of the PartY?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is a very difficult question which I cannot answer straight away and without the data.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I object to this question. I do not believe that this is a question of fact, but rather of judgment, and that it is not possible to give an answer to such a general question.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, the Tribunal thinks that the question is somewhat too wide.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have said that the program of the Nazi Party was to rectify certain injustices which you considered in the Treaty of Versailles; and I ask you whether it is not a fact that your program went considerably beyond any matter dealt with in that Treaty?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course, the program contained a number of other points which had nothing to do with the Treaty of Versailles.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to a statement in Mein Kampf as follows:</P>

<P>"The boundaries of 1914 do not mean anything for the future of the German nation. They did not constitute a defense in the past nor do they constitute a power in the future. They will not give to the German people inner security or ensure their food supply, nor do these boundaries appear to be favorable or satisfactory from a military point of view."</P>

<P>That is all true, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I should like to reread the original passage in Mein Kampf in order to determine if it is exactly as you have read it. I assume that it is correct. If so, I can reply that this is the text of a public book and not the Party program.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The first country to be absorbed by Germany was Austria, and it was not a part of Germany before the first World War, and had not been taken from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles; is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: For this very reason this point was distinctly separated from Versailles in the program. Austria is directly connected with Versailles only insofar as the right of self-determination, as proclaimed there, was most gravely infringed; for Austria and the purely German population were not allowed the Anschluss which they wanted to see accomplished as early as 1918, after the revolution.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The second territory taken by Germany was Bohemia, then Moravia, and then Slovakia. These were not taken from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, nor were they part of .Germany before the first World War.</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as the Sudetenland is concerned the same applies as for Austria. The German representatives of the German Sudetenland likewise sat in the Austrian Parliament, and under their leader, Lottmann, cast the same vote. It is different in the case of the last act, that is, the declaration of the Protectorate. These parts of Czech territory, especially Bohemia and Moravia were not constituent parts of the smaller German Reich before the Treaty of Versailles, but formerly they had been united to the German Reich for centuries. That is an historical fact.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You still have not answered my question, although you answered everything else. They were not taken from you by the Treaty of Versailles, were they?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course Austria was taken away by the Versailles Treaty and likewise the Sudetenland, for both territories, had it not been for the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St. Gerrnain would have become German territories through the right of the people to self-determination. To this extent they have to do with it. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have testified, have you not, on interrogation, that it was Hitler's information that the United States would never go to war, even if attacked, and that he counted on the isolationists of that country to keep it out of war?</P>

<P>GOERING: This interrogation must have been recorded entirely incorrectly. That is the very reason why I refused from the beginning to give my oath to these interrogations before I had been able to look carefully at the German transcript and determine whether it had been correctly understood and translated. Only once, and that was on the part of the Russian Delegation, was a completely correct transcript submitted to me. I signed it page by page and thereby acknowledged it. Now, as far as this statement is concerned, I should like to put it right. I said that, at first, the Fuehrer did not believe that America would intervene in the war, and that he was confirmed in this belief by the attitude of the isolationist press, while I, on the contrary, unfortunately feared from the very beginning that America would in any case intervene in the war. Such nonsense-I hope you will excuse me-as to say that America would not come into the war even if she were attacked, you will understand that I could never have uttered, because, if a country is attacked, it defends itself.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you know Axel Wennergren?</P>

<P>GOERING: He is a Swede whom I have seen two or three times.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You talked with him about this subject, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: About the subject of America's entering the war I can very well have talked with him; it is even probable.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You told him that a democracy could not mobilize and would not fight, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not tell him any such nonsense, for we had one democracY as our chief enemy, namely England, and how this democracy would fight we knew from the last World War, and we experienced it again during this war. When I talked with Wennergren the war with England was in full swing.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have testified on interrogation, if I understand you correctly, that there were at all times two basic ideas in Hitler's mind, either to ally himself with Russia and seek increase in living space through the acquisition of colonies, or to ally himself with Britain and seek acquisition of territories in the East. But in view of his orientation, he would very much have preferred to ally himself with Great Britain, is that true?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. I need only to refer to the book Mein Kampf, where these things were set down in thorough detail by Hitler.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, as early as 1933 you began a real program to rearm Germany regardless of any treaty limitations, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right; tell us when you started.</P>

<P>GOERING: After all the proposals of disarmament which the Fuehrer made were refused, that is, shortly after our withdrawal from the disarmament conference he made several proposals for a limitation; but, since these were not taken seriously or discussed, he ordered a complete rearmament. At the end of 1933 already certain slight preparations were started by me personally, to the extent that I had made some inconsiderable preparations in regard to the air and had also undertaken a certain militarization of the uniformed police. But that was done by me personally; I bear the responsibility.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, then, the militarization of the police auxiliary was not a state affair. It was your personal affair. What do you mean by that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not the auxiliary police, but the municipal police; that is, there was one uniformed police force which had simply police duty on the streets, and a second which was grouped in formations and was at our disposal for larger operations-not created by us, let it be understood, but existing at the time of the seizure of power. This municipal police, which was grouped in units, uniformed armed, and housed in barracks, I formed very soon into a strong military instrument by taking these men out of the police service and having them trained more along military lines and giving them machine guns and such things, in addition to their small arms. This I did on my own responsibility. These formations were taken into the Armed Forces as regular Army units when the Armed Forces Law was declared.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I want to ask you some questions from your interrogation of the 10/17/1945. I Will first read you the questions and answers as they appear in the interrogations and I shall then ask you whether you gave those answers, and then you can make the explanations if you desire, and I assume you do. The interrogation reads:</P>

<P>"I wanted to ask you today about some of the economic history of the period. When was the armament program first discussed, that is, the rearmament program? What year?</P>

<P>"Answer: Immediately; in 1933.</P>

<P>"Question: In other words, Schacht had assumed the obligation at that time already, to raise funds for the rearmament program?</P>

<P>"Answer: Yes. But, of course, in co-operation with the Minister of Finance.</P>

<P>"Question: During the years 1933-1935, before general conscription came in, naturally, the rearmament was a secret rearmament, was it not?</P>

<P>"Answer Yes.</P>

<P>"Question: So that money that was used outside of the budget would have to be raised by some secret means not to be known to foreign nations?</P>

<P>"Answer: Yes, unless they could be raised from normal Army funds.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: More or less; generally speaking that is correct. I have these remarks to make: Firstly, I was asked when rearmament had been discussed, not when it had been started. It had, of course, been discussed already in the year 1933, because it was clear at once that our government had to do something about it, that is to say, to demand that the others should disarm, and, if they did not disarm, that we should rearm. These things required discussion. The conclusion of the discussion and the formulation into a definite order followed after the failure of our attempts to get other countries to disarm. As soon as we, or rather the Fuehrer, saw that his proposals would not be accepted under any circumstances, a gradual rearmament, of course, began to take place. There was no reason whatsoever why we should inform the world about what we were doing in the way of rearmament. We were under no obligation to do that, nor was it expedient.</P>

<P>Herr Schacht, in the year 1933 at the very beginning, could not raise any funds because at the start he held no office. He was able to do this only at a later date. And here it was understandable that the funds had to be raised through the Minister of Finance and the President of the Reichsbank according to the wishes and the orders of the Fuehrer, especially as we had left no doubt that, if the other side did not disarm, we would rearm. That had already been set down on our Party program since 1921, and quite openly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is it not a fact that on the 5/21/1935, by a secret decree, Schacht was named Plenipotentiary for the War Economy?</P>

<P>GOERING: The date-if you will kindly submit the decree to me, then I can tell you exactly. I have not the dates of decrees and laws in my head, especially if they do not have anything to do with me personally; but that can be seen from the decree.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: At any event, shortly after he was named, he suggested you as Commissioner for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: If Herr Schacht made this suggestion shortly after his appointment, then that appointment could not have taken place until 1936, because not until the summer of 1936 did Herr Schacht, together with the Minister of War, Von Blomberg, make the proposal that I should become Commissioner for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I ask you if you did not give this answer to the American interrogator on the 10/10/1945, referring to Schacht:</P>

<P>"He made the suggestion that I was to become the Commissioner for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency. He had the idea that, in that position, I could give the Minister for Economics and the President of the Reichsbank valuable support."</P>

<P>How did you give that answer, and is that information correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Will you please repeat.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Referring to Schacht, the record shows that you said:</P>

<P>"He made the suggestion that I was to become the Commissioner for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency. He had the idea that, in that position, I could give the Minister for Economics and the President of the Reichsbank valuable support."</P>

<P>GOERING: That is absolutely correct, with the exception of the word "Reichstagsprasident;" that ought to be President of the Reichsbank.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. That is the way I have it.</P>

<P>GOERING: It sounded like "Reichstagsprasident" over the earphones.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "Moreover, he was very outspoken in the suggestion that he and Blomberg made, that I should be put in charge of the Four Year Plan. However, Schacht's idea was that I did not know very much about economy, and that he could easily hide behind my back."</P>

<P>GOERING: That I said the other day quite clearly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, from that time on you and Schacht collaborated for some time in preparing a rearmament program, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: From that time on I worked together with Schacht in economic matters and covered the whole field of German economy, including the armament program, which of course was a sine qua non for the reassumed German military sovereignty.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you and he had some jurisdictional differences and executed an agreement settling your different spheres of authority, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that was on 7/7/1937, right?</P>

<P>GOERING: On that day a certain proposal for a settlement was made, but this did not lead to anything final being accomplished. That was because of the nature of the two posts and our personalities. Both of us, I, as Delegate for the Four Year Plan, and Herr Schacht, as Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, were able to exercise very great influence on German economy. As Herr Schacht also had a very strong personalitY and felt his position keenly, and I likewise was not inclined to hide my light under a bushel, whether we were friends or not we could not help getting in each other's way because of this question of authority, and one of us had finally to give in to the other.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And there came a time when he left the Ministry and the Reichsbank?</P>

<P>GOERING: First he resigned from the Reich Ministry of Economy in 11/1937, and, as far as I know, he resigned as President of the Reichsbank at the end of 1938, but I cannot be certain about that date. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There was no disagreement between you and him that the program of rearmament should be carried through, was there? You disagreed only in the methods of doing it.</P>

<P>GOERING: I assume that Herr Schacht also, as a good German, was, of course, ready to put all his strength at the disposal of Germany's rearmament, in order that Germany should be strong; and therefore differences could have occurred only in regard to methods, for neither Herr Schacht nor I was arming for a war of aggression.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And after he left the rearmament work he remained as a Minister without Portfolio and sat in the Reichstag for some time, did he?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. The Fuehrer wished it because, I believe, he wanted in this way to express his recognition of Herr Schacht.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And do you recall the time when you considered the calling up of 15-year-olds, the conscription of 15-year-olds?</P>

<P>GOERING: During the war you mean?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</P>

<P>GOERING: It was a question of Air Force auxiliaries, that is correct. They were 15- or 16-year-olds, I do not remember exactly which, and were called in as Air Force auxiliaries.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask that you be shown Document Number 3700-PS and ask you whether you received from Schacht the letter of which that is a carbon copy.</P>

<P>[The document was handed to the witness.]</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I certainly did receive that letter. The year is not given here; that is missing in the copy.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Could you fix, approximately, the date of its receipt?</P>

<P>GOERING: It says here 3rd of November, but from the incidents described on the other side, I assume it must be 1943. On this copy the year, strangely enough, is not given, but I believe it was in the year 1943, I received this letter.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you reply to Document 3700-PS? Did you reply to this letter?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot say that today with certainty-possibly. MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the Four Year Plan had as its purpose to put the entire economy in a state of readiness for war, had it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have explained that it had two tasks to fulfill-1) to safeguard German economy against crises, that is to say, to make it immune from export fluctuations, and, as regards food, from harvest fluctuations, as far as possible; and 2) to make it capable of withstanding a blockade, that is to say, in the light of experiences in the first World War, to put it on such a basis that in a second World War a blockade would not have such disastrous consequences. That the Four Year Plan in this respect was a basic prerequisite for the entire building-up and expansion of the armament industry goes without saying. Without it the rearmament industry could not have been shaped in this way.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: To get a specific answer, if possible did you not say in a letter to Schacht, dated the 12/18/1936, that you saw it to be your task, using these words "within 4 years to put the entire economy in a state of readiness for war"? Did you say that or did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course I said that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, do you recall the report of Blomberg in 1937 in which-and you may examine if you wish Document Number C-175-in which he starts his report by saying:</P>

<P>"The general political position justifies the supposition that Germany need not expect an attack from any side."</P>

<P>GOERING: That may have been quite possible at that moment. I took a most reassuring view of the German situation in 1937. It was after the Olympic games and at that time the general situation was extraordinarily calm. But that had nothing to do with the fact that I felt obliged, quite apart from passing fluctuations from a calmer to a more tense atmosphere, to make German economy ready for war and proof against crises or blockades, for exactly 1 year later incidents of a different nature occurred.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well now, does not Blomberg continue: "Grounds for this are, in addition to the lack of desire for war in almost all nations, particularly the Western Powers, the deficiencies in the preparedness for war of a number of states, and of Russia in particular"?</P>

<P>That was the situation in 1937, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is the way Herr Von Blomberg saw the situation Concerning the readiness for war in Russia, Herr Von Blomberg in the same way as all those representatives of our Reichswehr mentality, was always really mistaken in contrast to the opinion pressed in other quarters with regard to Russian armaments. This is merely the opinion of Herr Von Blomberg-not the Fuehrer's, not mine, and not the opinion of other leading people. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That, however, was the report of the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces on the 6/24/1937, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You organized, 1 month later, the Hermann Goring Works?</P>

<P>GOERING: Right.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the Herrnann Goring Works were concerned with putting Germany in the condition of readiness for war, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not right. The Hermann Goring Works were at first concerned solely with the mining of German iron ore in the region of Salzgitter and in a district in the Oberpfalz, and, after the annexation, with the iron ore works in Austria. The Hermann Goring Works first established exclusively mining and refining plants for this ore and foundries. Only much later steel works and rolling mills were added, that is to say, an industry.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Hermann Goring Works were a part of the Four Year Plan, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is right.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And you have already said that the Four Year Plan had as its purpose to put the economy in a state of readiness for war; and the Hermann Goring Works were organized to exploit ore mining and iron smelting resources and to carry the process through to completed guns and tanks, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not correct; the Hermann Goring Works lad at first no armament works of their own, but merely produced, as I again repeat, the basic product, steel, crude steel.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, at all events, you continued your efforts and on the 11/8/1943, you made a speech describing those efforts to the Gauleiter in the Fuehrer building at Iunih, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know the exact date, but about that time I made a short speech, one of a series of speeches, to the Gauleiter about the air situation, as far as I remember, and also perhaps about the armament situation. I do not remember the words of that Speech, since I was never asked about it until now; but the facts are correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, let me remind you if you used these terms, refreshing your recollection:</P>

<P>"Germany, at the beginning of the war, was the only country in the world possessing an operative, fighting air force. The other countries had split their air fleets up into army and navy air fleets and considered the air arm primarily as a necessary and important auxiliary of the other branches of the forces. In consequence, they lacked the instrument which is alone capable of dealing concentrated and effective blows, namely, an operative air force. In Germany we had gone ahead on those lines from the very outset, and the main body of the Air Force was disposed in such a way that it could thrust deeply into the hostile areas with strategic effect while a lesser portion of the air force, consisting of Stukas and, of course, fighter planes, went into action on the front line in the battlefields. You all know what wonderful results were achieved by these tactics and what superiority we attained at the very beginning of the war through this modern kind of air force."</P>

<P>GOERING: That is entirely correct; I certainly did say that, and what is more, I acted accordingly. But in order-that this be understood and interpreted correctly, I must explain briefly:</P>

<P>In these statements I dealt with two separate opinions on air strategy, which are still being debated today and without a decision having been reached. That is to say: Should the air force form an auxiliary arm of the army and the navy and be split up to form a constituent part of the army and the navy, or should it be a separate branch of the armed forces? I explained that for nations with a very large navy it is perhaps understandable that such a division should be made. From the very beginning, thank God, we made the correct, consistent decision to build up a strong-I emphasize the word "strong"-and independent Air Force along with the Army and the Navy; and I described how we passed from a tentative air force to an operative air force. As an expert I am today still of the opinion that only an operative air force can have a decisive effect. I have also explained in regard to two- and four-engine bombers, that at first I was quite satisfied with the two-engine bombers because, firstly, I did not have four-engine bombers; and secondly, the operational radius of the two-engine bombers was wide enough for the enemy with whom we had to deal at that time. I further pointed out that the main reason for the swift ending of the campaign in Poland and in the West was the effect of the Air Force.</P>

<P>So that is quite correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I remind you of the testimony of the witness Milch, sworn on your behalf, as to a subject on which I have not heard you express yourself. He said:</P>

<P>"I had the impression that already at the time of the occupation of the Rhineland, he, Goring, was worried lest Hitler's policy should lead to war."</P>

<P>Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And was it true or false? True or mistaken, perhaps, I should say.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I did not want a war and I thought the best way to avoid a war was to be strongly armed according to the well known adage, "He who has a strong sword has peace."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you are still of that opinion?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am of that opinion today, now that I see the entanglements more than ever. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it is true, as Milch said, that you were worried that Hitler's policies would lead to war at the time of the occupation of the Rhineland?</P>

<P>GOERING: Excuse me, I just understood you to ask whether it is also my opinion today that only a nation that is strongly armed can maintain peace. That is what I meant to answer with my last statement.</P>

<P>If you are connecting this question to the statement of Milch, that I was worried lest the policy of the Fuehrer might lead to war, I should like to say that I was worried lest war might come; and if possible I wanted to avoid it, but not in the sense that the policy of the Fuehrer would lead to it, because the Fuehrer also desired to carry out his program by agreements and diplomatic action.</P>

<P>In regard to the occupation of the Rhineland I was somewhat worried at the time about the reactions; all the same, it was necessary.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And when nothing happened, the next step was Austria?</P>

<P>GOERING: The one has nothing to do with the other. I never had any misgivings about Austria leading to a war, as I had with the Rhineland occupation, for in the case of the Rhineland occupation I could well imagine that there might be repercussions But how there could be any repercussions from abroad over the union of two brother nations of purely German blood was not clear to me, especially since Italy, who always pretended that she had a ital interest in a separate Austria, had somewhat changed her ideas. It could not have mattered in the least to England and France nor could they have had the slightest interest in this union. Therefore I did not see the danger of its leading to a war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask you just a few questions about Austria. You said that you and Hitler had felt deep regret about the death of Dollfuss, and I ask you if it is not a fact that Hitler put up a plaque in Vienna in honor of the men who murdered Dollfuss, and went and put a wreath on their graves when he was there. Is that a fact? Can you not answer that question with "yes" or "no"?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I cannot answer it with either "yes" or "no," if I am to speak the truth according to my oath. I cannot say 'Yes, he did it," because I do not know; I cannot say, "No, he did not do it," because I do not know that either. I want to say that I heard about this event here for the first time.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, in 6/1937, Seyss-Inquart came to you and State Secretary Keppler, and you had some negotiations.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it was Seyss-Inquart's desire to have an independent Austria, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as I remember, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Keppler was the man who was sent by Hitler to Vienna at the time of the Anschluss and who telegraphed to Hitler not to march in, do you recall?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is the telegram that you characterized as impudent and senseless from the man who was on the spot, and who had negotiated earlier with Seyss-Inquart, do you recall that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not characterize the telegram with this word which has just been translated to me in German, that is "impudent." I said that this telegram could no longer have any influence an was superfluous,because the troops were already on the move and had their order; the thing was already underway.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You had demanded that Seyss-Inquart be made Chancellor? Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not desire that personally, but it arose out of the circumstance that at that time he was the only man who could assume the Chancellorship because he was already in the Government.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, did Seys-Inquart become Chancellor of Austria with the understanding that he was to surrender his country to Germany, or did you lead him to believe that he would be independent, have an independent country?</P>

<P>GOERING: I explained the other day that even at the time when I left by plane the next morning, the Fuehrer himself had still -not made up his mind as to whether the union with Austria should not be brought about by means of a joint head of state. I also said that I personally did not consider this solution far-reaching enough and that I was for an absolute, direct, and total Anschluss.</P>

<P>I did not know exactly what Seyss-Inquart's attitude was at this time. Nevertheless I feared that his attitude was rather in the direction of continued separation with co-operation, and did not go as far as my attitude in the direction of a total Anschluss. Therefore I was very satisfied when this total Anschluss crystallized in the course of the day.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I respectfully submit that the answers are not responsive, and I repeat the question.</P>

<P>Did Seyss-Inquart become Chancellor of Austria with an understanding that he would call in the German troops and surrender Austria to Germany, or did you lead him to believe that he could continue an independent Austria? [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: Excuse me, but that is a number of questions which I cannot answer simply with "yes" or "no."</P>

<P>If you ask me, "Did Seyss-Inquart become Chancellor according to Hitler's wishes and yours?"-yes.</P>

<P>If you then ask me, "Did he become Chancellor with the understanding that he should send a telegram for troops to march in?"-I say, "No," because at the time of the Chancellorship there was no question of his sending us a telegram.</P>

<P>If you ask me, thirdly, "Did he become Chancellor on the understanding that he would be able to maintain an independent Austria?" -then I have to say again that the final turn of events was not clear in the Fuehrer's mind on that evening.</P>

<P>That is what I tried to explain.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is it not true that you suspected that he might want to remain as independent as possible, and that that was one of the reasons why the troops were marched in?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. Excuse me, there are two questions: I strongly Suspected that Seyss-Inquart wanted to be as independent as possible. The sending of troops had nothing at all to do with that Suspicion; not a single soldier would have been needed for that. I gave my reasons for the sending of the troops.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But it was never intimated to Seyss-Inquart that Austria would not remain independent until after-as You put it- the Fuehrer and you were in control of Austria's fate? Is that a fact?</P>

<P>GOERING: That was certainly not told him beforehand by the Fuehrer. As far as I was concerned, it was generally known that I desired it, and I assume that he knew of my attitude.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you have stated that you then in conversation with Ribbentrop in London, stressed that no ultimatum had been put to Seyss-Inquart, and you have said that legally that was the fact.</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not say "legally," I said "diplomatically."</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have your attention called to Document Number 3575-PS (Exhibit Number USA-781) which is the minutes of the Reich Defense Council of 11/18/1938, with you presiding.</P>

<P>I call your attention that the "meeting consisted solely of a 3-hour lecture by the Field Marshal. No decision took place."</P>

<P>Is that correct?</P>

<P>[Document 3575-PS was submitted to the defendant.]</P>

<P>GOERING: I have to read it first, this is the first time I have seen the document.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You did not know when you testified yesterday that we had this document, did you? Would you kindly answer that question?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have not seen this document before. I have to look at it first. It says here: "Notes on the session of the Reich Defense Council on 11/18/1938."</P>

<P>The Reich Defense Council, as it was described here, comprise few people. Here there were present, however, all Reich ministers and state secretaries, also the commanders-in-chief of the Army and the Navy, the chiefs of the General Staff, of the three branches of the Armed Forces, Reichsleiter Bormann for the Deputy of the Fuehrer, General Daluege, SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, the Reich Labor Fuehrer, the Price Commissioner, the President of the Reich Labor Office, and others.</P>

<P>When I gave my testimony I was thinking only of the Reich Defense Council as such. This is dealing with the Reich Defense Council within the framework of a large assembly. Nevertheless I was not thinking of that; this concerns, over and beyond the Reich Defense Council, an assembly that was much larger than that provided for under the Reich Defense Council.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to the fact that the "Field Marshal stated it to be the task of the Reich Defense Council to correlate all the forces of the nation for accelerated building up of German armament."</P>

<P>Do you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have it now.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The second paragraph?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Under II, "The Physical Task: The assignment is to raise the level of armament from a current index of 100 to one of 300."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>DR.SIEMERS: I cannot quite see the reason why it repeatedlY happens that the Defense does not receive documents that are discussed in Court and that are submitted to the Court. The document now discussed is also not known to us, at least not to me. During the last few days I have noticed that several times documents were suddenly presented by the Prosecution without any effort having been made to inform us of their existence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is perfectly true, and I think every lawyer knows that one of the great questions in this case is credibility, and that if we have, in cross-examination, to submit every document before we can refer to it in cross-examination after we hear their testimony, the possibilities of useful cross- examination are destroyed.</P>

<P>Now, of course, he did not know; and we have had the experience of calling document after document to their attention, always to be met with some explanation, carefully arranged and read here from notes. No defendant has ever had better opportunity to prepare his case than these defendants, and I submit that cross-examination of them should not be destroyed by any requirement that we submit documents in advance.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Did you wish to say something?</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: Yes. I should like to make two points. First, I am entirely agreed if Mr. Justice Jackson wants to make use of the element of surprise. I should merely be thankful if the Defense then were also permitted to use the element of surprise. Yet we have been told heretofore that we must show every document we want to submit weeks ahead of time, so that the Prosecution has several weeks to form an opinion on it.</P>

<P>Secondly, if the element of surprise is being used, I believe that at least we, as Defense Counsel, should not be given this surprise at the moment when the document is submitted to the Court and to the witness. I have at this moment neither today's documents nor the documents of the previous days.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What you have just said is entirely inaccurate. You have never been compelled to disclose any documents which you wished to put to a witness in cross-examination. This is cross-examination and therefore it is perfectly open to Counsel for the Prosecution to put any document without disclosing it beforehand; just as Defense Counsel could have put any document to witnesses called on behalf of the Prosecution, if they had wished to do so, in cross-examination.</P>

<P>I am sure that if counsel for the defendants wish to re-examine upon any such document as this, a copy of it will be supplied to them for that purpose.</P>

<P>The Tribunal now rules that this document may be put to the witness now. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: Does the Defense also have the opportunity, now that it is known to the entire Court, of receiving the document?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: I should be thankful if I could have a copy now.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am frank to say I do not know whether we have adequate copies to furnish them to all the Defense Counsel now.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe you have not, but you can let them have one or more copies.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But I do not think we should furnish copies until the examination with reference to that document is completed, that is to say...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Dr. Dix.</P>

<P>DR. DIX: I should like to make one request that at least the technical possibilities that at least the counsel of these defendants who are being cross-examined also be given the document that is submitted to the defendant, so that they are in a position, just as the Tribunal is, to follow the examination.</P>

<P>If Justice Jackson says that it is his opinion that it would be right for the defense counsel-in this case my colleague Stahmer to receive this document only after the examination-in this case of Goering-has ended, I beg earnestly, in the interest of the dignity and prestige of the Defense, to take objection to this suggestion of Justice Jackson's. I do not believe that he means by that to insinuate that the Defense Counsel would be able-having these documents in its hands at the same time as the Tribunal and at the same time as the witness-somehow through signs or otherwise to influence the defendant and thereby disturb the cross-examination by Mr. Justice Jackson, or by the prosecutor. Mr. Justice Jackson certainly did not mean that, but one might draw that conclusion.</P>

<P>I therefore make this request: If in the cross-examination, for the purpose of the cross-examination, in view of the altogether justified element of surprise, a document is presented to a witness that at the same time is presented to the Tribunal, that at least a copy of this document be given at the same time to the defense counsel, the defense counsel concerned, either the one who has called the witness or the one whose defendant is in the witness box, so that he can have some idea of what the witness is being confronted with, for Goering could read this document, but Dr. Stahmer could not. In other words, he was not in a position to follow the next part of Mr. Justice Jackson's cross-examination. That is certainly not intended, and would certainly not be fair, and I should therefore like to ask Mr. Justice Jackson to reply to My suggestion, and my application, in order to arrive at an understanding and thereby to relieve the Tribunal of the decision on a question that to me seems self-evident.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, the Tribunal is inclined to think-the Tribunal certainly thinks-that you are perfectlY right, that there is no necessity at all, as I have already stated, to disclose the document to the defendants before you use it in cross-examination. But, at the time you use it in cross-examination is there any objection to handing a copy of it to the counsel for the defendant who is being cross-examined?</P>

<P>JUSTICE JACKSON: In some instances it is physically impOssible because of our situation in reference to these documents. A good many of these documents have come to us very lately. Our photostatic facilities are limited.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I am not suggesting that you should hand it to all of them, but only to Dr. Stahmer.</P>

<P>DR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If we have copies, I have no objection to doing that, but if we do not have them in German-our difficulty has always been to get German copies of these documents.</P>

<P>DR. DIX: May I say something else. If it is not possible in German, then it should at least be possible in English, for one English copy will certainly be available. Furthermore, if it is a question of German witnesses, such as Goering, the document will be shown him in German anyhow; it will certainly be shown the witness in German. I believe that will surely be possible.</P>

<P>[Dr. Siemers approached the lectern.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We do not really need to hear more than one counsel on this sort of point. I have already ruled upon your objection, which was that the document should be produced before hand, but the Tribunal has already ruled that objection should be denied.</P>

<P>DR.SIEMERS: Mr. President, I am sorry. My motion was that the Defense Counsel should receive these documents at the same time the Tribunal does. I am not of the opinion expressed by Dr. Dix, that only one defense counsel should receive it. If it is a report regarding the Reich Defense Council, then it is a document important to several defendants. One copy is therefore not sufficient, but each defense counsel must have one. I believe that Mr. Justice Jackson...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: But not at this moment. There are, as we all know, the very greatest difficulties in producing all these documents, and extraordinary efforts have been made by the Prosecution and the Translating Division to supply the defendants with documents, and with documents in German, and it is not necessary that every member of the Defense Counsel have these documents at the time the witness is being cross-examined. I am sure the Prosecution will do everything it can to let you have the documents in due course- any document that is being used.</P>

<P>In the opinion of the Tribunal it is perfectly sufficient if one copy of the document is supplied to the counsel for the witness who is being cross-examined. As I say, the Prosecution will doubtless let you have copies of these documents in due course.</P>

<P>You are appearing for the Defendant Raeder, and the Defendant Raedfer, I am afraid, at the present rate will not be in the witness.</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: The result of that is that the defense counsel who is not momentarily concerned, cannot understand the cross examination. As to the technical question, I ask the Court to consider that I cannot follow Justice Jackson on this technical point. The document is mimeographed by means of a stencil. In mimeographing it makes no difference at all whether 20, 40, 80, or 150 copies are produced It makes no difference from the point of view of time except perhaps 4 or 5 minutes. I consider for this reason that one can hardly refer to technical difficulties in this matter.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel for the Prosecution will consider what you say, but no rule has been made by the Tribunal that every document should be supplied to every counsel during cross examination.</P>

<P>GOERING: I should like to say again in regard to the document that this is not.. . [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May I respectfully ask that the witness be instructed to answer the question and reserve his explanations until his counsel takes him on. Otherwise, this cross-examination cannot successfully be conducted, in the sense of being reasonable in time.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I have already explained, on several occasions, that it is the duty of defendants when they are in the witness box, and the duty of witnesses, to answer questions directly, if they are capable of being answered directly, in the affirmative or in the negative; and if they have any explanation to make afterwards, they can make it after answering the question directly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to Item 3, under II. "Finances," reading as follows:</P>

<P>"Very critical situation of the Reich Exchequer. Relief initially through the milliard imposed on the Jews and through profits accruing to the Reich from the Aryanization of Jewish enterprises."</P>

<P>You find that in the minutes, do you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is there.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And you find the minutes signed b Woermann, do you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not true. I beg your pardon? Here on the photostat Woermann has signed it, that is not Bormann. I know Bormann's signature well, it is quite different.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I said Woermann.</P>

<P>GOERING: Woermann, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right, my poor pronunciation Well, as it not a fact that you set up a working committee under the Reich Defense Council which did meet from time to time and did carry on certain work?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have already explained recently: That was the committee of departmental chiefs.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I call your attention to Document Number EC-405, minutes of a meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich Defense Council, Meeting Number 10.</P>

<P>GOERING: I understood the President to say before that when I have answered the question, I can add an explanation that seems necessary to me. Now that I have clearly answered your question with regard to the first document, I want to stress once again that his was not a meeting of the close Reich Defense Council but a general calling together of all ministers, state secretaries and numerous other persons. And that I began my statements as follows:</P>

<P>"I. Organization of the Reich Defense Council: The Reich Defense Council was already, by decision of the Cabinet of 1933-1934, called into being; but it has never met. Through the Reich Defense Law of 9/4/1938 it was re-established. The Chairman is the Fuehrer, who has appointed General Field Marshal Goering his permanent deputy."</P>

<P>Concerning the Reich Defense Council, about which we have been talking, consisting of Schacht-or rather of the triumvirate-it is attested here in writing once more, as I have correctly said, that this Council never met. I ask to have the question about the second document repeated, as I have forgotten it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You testified that the movement into the Rhineland had not been planned in advance.</P>

<P>GOERING: Only a short time in advance, I emphasized.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: How long?</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as I recall, at the most 2-3 weeks.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I call your attention to the minutes of the 10th meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich Defense Council, Document Number EC-405 toward the end of that document, the discussion on 6/26/1935, which reads as follows...</P>

<P>GOERING: May I ask what page? This document is very long and is new to me. What page, please, otherwise I shall have to read the whole document.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Turn to the last paragraph and we will work backwards.</P>

<P>"Commitment to writing of directives for mobilization purposes is permissible only insofar as it is absolutely necessary for the smooth execution of the measures provided for the demilitarized zone. Without exception such material must be kept in safes."</P>

<P>Do you find that part? [=]</P>

<P>GOERING: This document that has been handed to me contains alternating statements of various individuals, that is, a dialogue. May I ask once more . . . The last paragraph contains nothing of what you have stated, apparently there must be a difference between the German and English texts. The last paragraph here is altogether irrelevant. Where, please, am I to read in the document?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you find the third paragraph from the end? If my document is correct we have got the same document.</P>

<P>GOERING: You must tel me who was speaking, for different persons speak here.</P>

<P>[The place in the document was indicated to the defendant.]</P>

<P>Now it has been shown to me. Under the name Jodl; I have to read through it first.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you find this:</P>

<P>"The demilitarized zone requires special treatment. In his speech of 5/24/1935 and in other statements, the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor declared that the stipulations of the Versailles Treaty and the Locarno Pact regarding the demilitarized zone would be observed."</P>

<P>Do you find this?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And do you find the next paragraph,</P>

<P>"Since at present international entanglements must be avoided under all circumstances, all urgently needed preparations may be made. The preparations as such, or their planning, must be kept in strictest secrecy in the zone itself as well as in the rest of the Reich."</P>

<P>Do you find this?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you also find, "These preparations include in particular"-a) and b) are not important to my present question-"c) Preparation for the liberation of the Rhine."</P>

<P>GOERING: Oh, no, here you have made a great mistake. The original phrase-and this alone is the point in question-is: "c) Preparation for the clearing of the Rhine" It is a purely technical preparation that has nothing at all to do with the liberation of the Rhineland- Here it says, first, mobilization measures for transportation and communications, then "c) Preparation for the clearing of the Rhine," that is, in case of mobilization preparations the Rhine is ; not to be overburdened with freighters, tugboats, et cetera, but the river has to be clear for military measures. Then it continues: "d) Preparation for local defense," et cetera. Thus you see, it figures among small quite general, ordinary and usual preparations for mobilization. The phrase used by the Prosecution . . .</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Mobilization, exactly.</P>

<P>GOERING: That, if you remember, I stressed clearly in my statement, that in the demilitarized zone general preparations for mobilization were made. I mentioned the purchase of horses, et cetera. I wanted only to point out the mistake regarding "clearing of the Rhine," which has nothing to do with the Rhineland, but only with the river.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, those preparations were preparations for armed occupation of the Rhineland, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is altogether wrong. If Germany had become involved in a war, no matter from which side, let us assume from the East, then mobilization measures would have had to be carried out for security reasons throughout the Reich, in this event even in the demilitarized Rhineland; but not for the purpose of occupation, of liberating the Rhineland.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You mean the preparations were not military preparations?</P>

<P>GOERING: Those were general preparations for mobilization, such as every country makes, and not for the purpose of the occupation of the Rhineland.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But were of a character which had to be kept entirely secret from foreign powers?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not think I can recall reading beforehand the publication of the mobilization preparations of the United States.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I respectfully submit to the Tribunal that this witness is not being responsive, and has not been in his examination, and that it is . . .</P>

<P>Morning Session</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If the Tribunal please, the last question which I asked last night referring to mobilization preparations in the Rhineland, as shown in the official transcript, was this: "But of a character which had to be kept entirely secret from foreign powers?" The answer was: "I do not believe I can recall the publication of the preparations of the United States for mobilization."</P>

<P>Now, representing the United States of America, I am confronted with these choices-to ignore that remark and allow it to stand for people who do not understand our system; or to develop, at considerable expense of time, its falsity; or to answer it in rebuttal. The difficulty arises from this, Your Honor, that if the witness is permitted to volunteer statements in cross-examination there is no opportunity to make objection until they are placed on the record. of course, if such an answer had been indicated by a question of counsel, as I respectfully submit would be the orderly procedure, would have been objection, the Tribunal would have been in a position to discharge its duty under the Charter and I would have been in a position to have shortened the case by not having that remark placed.</P>

<P>The Charter in Article 18 provides that the Tribunal shall rule out irrelevant issues and statements of any kind whatsoever. We are squarely confronted with that question; we cannot discharge those duties if the defendant is to volunteer these statements without questions which bring them up. I respectfully submit that, if the ruling of the Tribunal that the defendant may volunteer questions of this kind is to prevail, the control of these proceedings is put in the hands of this defendant, and the United States has been substantially denied its right of cross-examination under the Charter, because cross-examination cannot be effective under this kind of procedure. Since we cannot anticipate, we cannot meet..</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I quite agree with you that any reference to by the United States' secrecy with reference to mobilization is entirely irrelevant and that the answer ought not to have been made, but the only rule which the Tribunal can lay down as a general rule is the rule-already laid down-that the witness must answer if possible "yes" or "no," and that he may make such explanations as may be necessary after answering questions directly in that way and that such explanations must be brief and not be speeches. As far as this particular answer goes, I think it is entirely irrelevant.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I must, of course, bow to the ruling of the Tribunal, but it is to the second part, I quite recall the admonition of the Court that there shall be answers "yes" or "no. This witness, of course, pays not the slightest attention to that, and I must say I cannot blame him; he is pursuing his interests. But we have no way of anticipating, and here we are confronted with this statement in the record, because when these statements are volunteered they are in the record before the Tribunal can rule upon them and I have no opportunity to make objections, and the Tribunal have no opportunity to rule. And it puts, as I said before the control of these proceedings in the hands of the defendant, if he first makes the charges and then puts it up to us to ignore them or answer them by long cross-examination in rebuttal; and I think the specific charge made against the United States of America from the witness stand presents that.</P>

<P>Your Honor now advises the United States that it is an improper answer, but it is in the record and we must deal with it. I respectfully submit that unless we have...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What exactly is the motion you are making? Are you asking the Tribunal to strike the answer out of the record?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, no; in a Trial of this kind, where propaganda is one of the purposes of the defendant, striking aut does no good after the answer is made, and Goering knows that as well as I. The charge has been made against the United States and it is in the record. I am now moving that this witness be instructed that he must answer my questions "yes" or "no" if they permit an answer, and that the explanation be brought out by his counsel in a fashion that will permit us to make objections, if they are irrelevant, and to obtain rulings of the Tribunal, so that the Tribunal can discharge its functions of ruling out irrelevant issues and statements of any kind whatsoever. We must not let the Trial degenerate into a bickering contest between counsel and the witness. That is not what the United States would expect me to participate in. I respectfully suggest that if he can draw any kind of challenge . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Are you submitting to the Tribunal that the witness has to answer every question "yes" or "no" and wait until he is re-examined for the purpose of making any explanations at all?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think that is the rule of cross examination under ordinary circumstances. The witness, if the question permits it, must answer, and if there are relevant explanations they should be reserved until later.</P>

<P>Now let me come back to the specific problem I have right here this morning. Here is an answer given which the Tribunal now rules is irrelevant- But we have no opportunity to object to it. The Tribunal had no opportunity to rule upon it. The witness asks, "Did you ever hear of the United States publishing its plan of mobilization?" Of course, we would have objected. The difficulty is that the Tribunal loses control of these proceedings if the defendant, in a case of this kind where we all know propaganda is one of the purposes of the defendant, is permitted to put his propaganda in, and then we have to meet it afterwards. I really feel that the United States is deprived of the opportunity of the technique of cross-examination if this is the procedure.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Surely it is making too much of a sentence the witness has said, whether the United States makes its orders for mobilization public or not. Surely that is not a matter of very great importance. Every country keeps certain things secret. Certainly it would be much wiser to ignore a statement of that sort. But as to the general rule, the Tribunal will now consider the matter. I have already laid down what I believe to be the rule, and ,; I think with the assent of the Tribunal, but I will ascertain...</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Let me say that I agree with Your Honor that as far as the United States is concerned we are not worried by anything the witness can say about it-and we expected plenty. The point is, do we answer these things or leave them, apart from the control of the Trial? And it does seem to me that this is the beginning of this Trial's getting out of hand, if I may say so, if we do not have control of this situation. I trust the Tribunal will pardon my earnestness in presenting this. I think it is a very vital thing.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I have never heard it suggested that the Counsel for the Prosecution have to answer every irrelevant observation made in cross-examination.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That would be true in a private litigation, but I trust the Court is not unaware that outside of this courtroom is a great social question of the revival of Nazism and that one of the purposes of the Defendant Goering-I think he would be the first to admit-is to revive and perpetuate it by propaganda from this Trial now in process.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Doctor Stahmer?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I just wanted to explain the following: An accusation has been made as if we intended to make propaganda here for Nazism, or in some other direction. I do not think this accusation is justified. Neither do I believe that the defendant intended to make an accusation against the United States. I think we have to consider the question that was put to him. That is, it was pointed out to him by the Prosecution that this document which was submitted to him was marked "secret." Then he stated that he had never heard that a document of that kind would have been made public in the United States. If instead of the U.S-A- he had said any other nation, then the remark would have been considered harmless.</P>

<P>In my opinion the answer was quite justified. The witness should be given the possibility not only to answer "yes" or "no," but to give reasons for his answer, as ruled by the Court.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, the Tribunal considers that the rule which it has laid down is the only possible rule and that the witness must be confined strictly to answering the question directly where the question admits of a direct answer, and that he must not make his explanation before he gives a direct answer but, after having given a direct answer to any question which admits of a direct answer, he may make a short explanation; and that he is not to be confined simply to making direct answers "yes" or "no," and leaving the explanation until his counsel puts it to him in his re-examination.</P>

<P>As to this particular observation of the defendant, the defendant ought not to have referred to the United States, but it is a matter which I think you might well ignore.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I shall bow to the ruling, of course.</P>

<P>wish to make a statement to the Tribunal about one of the documents. At the conclusion of the session yesterday we were considering Document Number EC-405. The Defendant Goering challenged the use of a word which he said should have been translated "clearance" rather than "liberation." We have since had the translation checked and find that the defendant is correct. This document was introduced under Exhibit Number GB-160 on the 9th of January, at Page 2396 of the Tribunal's records (Volume V, Page 28), and since it has already been received in evidence and it is before the Tribunal, we think it incumbent upon the Prosecution to make that correction now for the record.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] You stated yesterday that the minutes of the Reich Defense Council with which you were presented were not minutes of a meeting of the Reich Defense Council as such? [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I said that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And your testimony, notwithstanding that document, still stands, I take it, that the Reich Defense Council never met?</P>

<P>; GOERING: I said that also, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I now ask to have you shown a document which has just come into our possession, the minutes of the second session of the Reich Defense Council. I should have said, just come to us for translation. We have not had it translated; we just discovered it among our great collection of documents.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Could Doctor Stahmer have a copy in English or not?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We have not even had a chance to get it into English. I do not know what it says except that it is the minutes of their meeting. We have a photostat.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Are those not the minutes of the second meeting of the Reich Defense Council held on the 6/23/1939?</P>

<P>GOERING: I must read it first.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to the fact that the chairman is Minister President General Field Marshal Goering. You will find that on Page 1.</P>

<P>GOERING: I have never disputed that. It was fixed by law. This deals with the second Reich Defense Council, not the first one. Besides, I was not present at this meeting; and I point out that on the left is a list of the authorities who took part in the meeting, and in my case it says "Minister President Field Marshal Goering," and on the right, as representative for him, "State Secretary Korner and State Secretary Neumann." But I shall have to look through the document first in order to find out whether I took part personally.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Does it not say on Page 1, directly under the place of meeting, "Chairman: Minister President Goering"?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. I have to read it first.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you deny the authenticity of those minutes?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have not looked them through yet.</P>

<P>It seems to be an absolutely authentic copy of the minutes; I admit that. But here again we are dealing with a meeting not as I said when answering my counsel, of the Reich Defense Council but of a larger meeting in which many other departments participated and it is a matter of the second Reich Defense Council, which was set up after 1938, not a secret council such as was the case from 1933-1938.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, in interpreting your testimony, we must understand that, when you say there was n meeting of the Reich Defense Council, you mean only that there were no meetings at which no other people were present?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not correct. There were two Reich defense laws concerning the Reich Defense Council, which I tried to explain in my statement: the Secret Council of 1933-1938, which was not made public, and the Reich Defense Council which was created 1933 and converted into the Ministerial Council in 1939; the latter held meetings which were in no way confined to its own members.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you say that this was not the Defense Council that met under the ban of secrecy?</P>

<P>GOERING: The Prosecution want me to answer first with "yes" or "no." It is hard to answer this question with "yes" or "no." I assert that the Secret Defense Council, which was not made public and which arose out of a meeting of ministers in 1933, never met After 1938 a new Reich defense law created a new council. At that time it was clear that our military sovereignty had already been declared. This first council, which the Prosecution called the secret one, never met, and the document of yesterday proved that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Will you refer to Page 19 of this document, please, and tell me whether one of the very things with which this meeting concerned itself was not the lifting of the secrecy ban from the Reich defense law?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not the way it reads here. If I may translate it, the last point on the agenda: Consequences resulting from the lifting of the secrecy ban on the Reich defense law and measures to expedite procedures have already been dealt with by a letter from the Reich Defense Committee on 26 June: "Consequences resulting from the lifting of the secrecy ban with a view to expediting written communications."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have stated that on the Jewish question, some of the members of the government were more radical than you. Would you state who these were?</P>

<P>GOERING: Broadly speaking, when we took over the government, we only demanded their removal from political and other leading positions in the State.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is not what I asked you.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That is not a direct answer to the question. The question was that you said some members of the government were more radical toward Jews than you were. Would you tell us which of the members of the government were more radical than you were?</P>

<P>GOERING: Excuse me, I did not understand the question to mean who were more radical, but in what way they were more radical. If you ask who, then I would say that those were primarily Minister Goebbels and Himmler. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you also include your co-defendant, Streicher, as more radical than you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, but he was not a member of the government.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: He was the Gauleiter, was he not, or this very territory in which we are sitting.</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct; but he had very little or no influence in government measures.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What about Heydrich?</P>

<P>GOERING: Heydrich was subordinate to Himmler. If I said Himmler, I, of course, include Heydrich.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Heydrich is then included in the list the more radical ones to whom you refer?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is right; yes.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: What about Bormann?</P>

<P>GOERING: It was only during the later years that I observed at Bormann was becoming more radical. I do not know anything about his attitude in the beginning.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I want to review with you briefly what the Prosecution understands to be public acts taken by you in reference to the Jewish question. From the very beginning you regarded the elimination of the Jews from the economic life of Germany as one phase of the Four Year Plan under your jurisdiction, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: The elimination, yes; that is partly correct. The elimination as far as the large industries were concerned, because there were continual disturbances due to the fact that there were large industries, also armament industries, still partly under Jewish directors, or with Jewish shareholders, and that gave rise to a certain anxiety among the lower ranks.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, do I understand that you want he Tribunal to believe that all you were concerned about was the big Jewish enterprises? That is the way you want to be understood?</P>

<P>GOERING: I was not at first disturbed by the small stores. They did not come into the Four Year Plan.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When did you become disturbed by the small stores?</P>

<P>GOERING: When trade had to be limited, it was pointed out that this could be done first by closing the Jewish stores.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, let us go through the public acts which you performed on the Jewish question. First, did you proclaim the Nuremberg Laws?</P>

<P>GOERING: As President of the Reichstag, yes. I have already stated that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What date was that?</P>

<P>GOERING: 1935, I believe; here in Nuremberg, in September.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That was the beginning of the legal measures taken against the Jews, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That was a legal measure.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That was the first of the legal measures taken by your government against the Jews, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I believe the removal from office was before.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When was that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I could not state the exact date, but I believe that happened in 1933. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then on the first day of 12/1936, you promulgated an act making it a death penalty for Germans to transfer property abroad or leave it abroad; the property of a culprit to be forfeited to the State, and the People's Court given jurisdiction to prosecute, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct; the "Decree Governing Restriction on Foreign Currency." That is to say, whoever had an account in a foreign country without permission of the government.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, your third public act was on 4/22/1938 when you published penalties for veiling the character of a Jewish enterprise within the Reich, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then on 7/28/1939, you, Hermann Goering, published certain prescriptions on the competence of the courts to handle those matters by the decree, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Please, would you kindly read the law to me? I cannot recall it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will not take time reading it. Do you deny that you published the Reichsgesetzblatt law, 1939, found on Page 1370, referring to the competence of the courts to handle penalties against Jews? If you do not remember, say so.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I say that I cannot remember the law. If it is in the Reichsgesetzblatt and bears my name, then, of course, it is so; but I do not remember the contents.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, on 4/26/1938 you, under the Four Year Plan, published a decree providing for the registration of Jewish property and provided that Jews inside and outside Germany must register their property, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I assume so. I no longer remember it, but if you have the decree there, and if it is signed by me, there cannot be any doubt.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: On 4/26/1938 you published a decree under the Four Year Plan, did you not, that all acts of disposal of Jewish enterprises required the permission of the authorities?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I remember.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you published on 11/12/1938 a decree, also under the Four Year Plan, imposing a fine of a RM1 billion for atonement on all Jews?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have already explained that all these decrees at that time were signed by me, and I assume responsibility for them.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I am asking you if you did not sign that particular decree? I am going to ask you some further questions about it later.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then on the 11/12/1938, you also signed a decree that, under the Four Year Plan, all damage caused to Jewish property by the riots of 1938 must be repaired immediately by the Jews, and at their own expense; and their insurance claims were forfeited to the Reich. Did you personally sign that law?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did sign a similar law. Whether it was exactly the same as you have just read, I could not say.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You do not disagree that that was the substance of the law, do you?</P>

<P>GOERING: No.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And on the 11/12/1938, did you not also personally sign a decree, also under the Four Year Flan, that Jews may not own retail stores, or engage independently in handicrafts or offer goods, or services, for sale at markets, fairs, or exhibitions; or act as leaders of enterprises or as members of cooperatives? Do you recall all of that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. Those are all parts of the decrees for the elimination of Jewry from economic life.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, on the 2/21/1939, You personally signed a decree, did you not, that the Jews must render all objects of precious metals and jewels purchased, to the public office within 2 weeks?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not remember that, but without doubt, that is correct.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I refer to Volume I of the Reichsgesetzblatt, 1939, Page 282. You have no recollection of that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have not the Reichsgesetzblatt in front of me now but if there is a decree in the Reichsgesetzblatt, or a law Signed with my name, then I signed that law and decreed it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not also, on the 3/3/1939, sign a further decree concerning the period within which items of jewelry must be surrendered by Jews-Reichsgesetzblatt Volume I, 1939, Page 387?</P>

<P>GOERING: I assume that was the decree for the execution of the decree for surrender previously mentioned. A law sometimes requires regulations and decrees for execution consequent upon the law. Taken together, this is one single measure.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not also sign personally a decree under the Four Year Plan, of the 17th of September 1940 ordering the sequestration of Jewish property in Poland?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, as I stated before, in that part of Poland which, I may say, as an old German province, was to return to Germany.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not also, on the 11/30/1940, personally sign a decree which provided that the Jews should receive no compensation for damages caused by enemy attacks or by German forces, and did you not sign that in the capacity of President of the Reich Defense Council? I refer to the Reichisgesetzblatt, Volume I, 1940, Page 1547.</P>

<P>GOERING: If you have it there before you, then it must be correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have no recollection of that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not of all the separate laws and decrees. That is impossible.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, it was you, was it not, who signed, on the 7/31/1941, a decree asking Himmler, and the Chief of Security Police and the SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich to make the plans for the complete solution of the Jewish question?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not correct. I know that decree very well.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have you shown Document 710, Exhibit Number USA-509.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Is that 710-PS?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: 710-PS, Your Honor.</P>

<P>Turning to the witness.7 That document is signed by you, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it is addressed to the Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service, and to SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is also correct.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I am not certain whether the entire thing has been read into the record, but I think it should be; and, that we may have no difficulty about the translation of this, you correct me if I am wrong:</P>

<P>"Completing the task that was assigned to you on the 1/24/1939..."</P>

<P>GOERING: Here is a mistake already. It says: "Complementing' not "completing" the task which has been assigned to you.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Very well, I will accept that ". . . which dealt with arriving at a thorough furtherance of emigration and evacuation, a solution of the Jewish problem, as advantageously as possible, I hereby charge you with making all necessary preparations in regard to organizational and financial matters for bringing about a complete solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in Europe."</P>

<P>Am I correct so far?</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Give us your translation of it?</P>

<P>GOERING: May I read it as it is written here?</P>

<P>"Complementing the task which was conferred upon you already on 1/24/1939, to solve the Jewish problem by means of emigration and evacuation in the best possible way according to present conditions, I charge you herewith to make all necessary preparations as regards organizational, factual, and material matters...."</P>

<P>Now comes the decisive word which has been mistranslated: "for total solution," not "for a final solution."</P>

<P>". . . for a total solution of the Jewish question within the area of German influence in Europe. Should these come within the competence of other governmental departments, then such departments are to co-operate.</P>

<P>"I charge you further to submit to me as soon as possible a general plan showing the organizational and material measures for reaching the desired total solution of the Jewish question.... Complementing the task assigned to you on 1/24/1939...."</P>

<P>That was at a time when there was no war or prospect of a war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now are you reporting the instrument or are you making an explanation?</P>

<P>GOERING: I wanted to add an explanation to the quotation and just to point out the date.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. Well, I just did not want it to appear that it was a part of the instrument. The last that is contained in the instrument is:</P>

<P>"I charge you furthermore to send me, before long, an overall plan concerning the organizational, factual, and material measures necessary for the accomplishment of the desired solution of the Jewish question."</P>

<P>Is that not a substantially accurate translation of your order to Heydrich and Himmler?</P>

<P>GOERING: To Heydrich and the other government departments which had anything to do with it. That can be seen from the first part of the letter, the last sentence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let us have no misunderstanding about this translation now. This letter was directed to the Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service, and SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich. We are right about that, are we not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct, but I have to make an explanation in connection with that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right.</P>

<P>GOERING: The reason I sent this letter to him was that, by the decree of 1/24/1939, Heydrich, or it may have been Himmler had been given the task of dealing with the emigration of the Jews. Therefore, this was the government department concerned, and it was to the department which had been given the task that I had to apply concerning all material and economic matters arising therefrom.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. And you ordered all other governmental agencies to co-operate with the Security Police and the SS in the final solution of the Jewish question, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: There is nothing about the SS here, only about the Sicherheitspolizei, a governmental agency. The fact that Heydrich was SS Gruppenfuehrer had no direct bearing on it, because it was sent to the Chief of the Security Police-mentioning his rank as SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And mentioning his rank in the SS was just superfluous and has nothing to do with the case?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have to explain that. For instance, if I write to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, then I write: "To the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Colonel General or Field Marshal Von Brauchitsch." And if I write to the Chief of the Security Police, then I must address it: "To the Chief of the Security Police, SS Gruppenfuihrer Heydrich." That was his rank and his title. How ever that does not mean that the SS had anything to do with it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, at the time that you issued this order you had received complete reports as to the 1938 riots and Heydrich's part in them, hadn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: At that time I had no knowledge of Heydrich's part in the riots-only Heydrich's report on the riots, for which I had asked.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right. Now we will show you Document Number 3058-PS, in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-508.</P>

<P>[Document 3058-PS was submitted to the witness.]</P>

<P>That is the report written by Heydrich which you say you had received, and it is dated 11/11/1938, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it recited to you the looting of Jewish shops, the arrest of 174 persons for looting, the destruction of 815 shops, 171 dwellings set on fire or destroyed, and that this indicated only a fraction of the actual damage caused; 191 synagogues were set on fire, and another 76 completely destroyed; in addition, 11 parish halls, cemetery chapels, and similar buildings were set on fire, and 3 more completely destroyed; 20000 Jews were arrested; also, 7 Aryans and 3 foreigners-the latter were arrested for their own safety; 36 deaths were reported, and the seriously injured were also numbered at 36. Those killed and injured are Jews. One Jew is still missing. The Jews killed include 1 Polish national, and those injured include 2 Poles.</P>

<P>You had that report on or about the 11/11/1938, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. That is the report mentioned by me and which I had asked the police to supply, because I wanted to know what had happened up to then.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Exactly. And the note was made at the top of it, The General Field Marshal has been informed and no steps are to be taken." Was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not quite correct. It says here, "General Field Marshal has taken note. No steps are to be taken by any other Office, because I myself wanted to take them.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you know that that is not true, do you not, that steps were to be taken by some other office? I put it to you squarely whether you are telling this Tribunal the truth when you say that no steps were to be taken by anyone else.</P>

<P>GOERING: This is a note by my staff department, that nothing was to be done by that quarter, because I said I was going to deal with it personally. In fact I went straight to the Fuehrer with this report.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right. Did you receive a report from the Chief Party Judge of the Nazi Party, dated Munich, the 2/13/1939, concerning the proceedings taken by the Party in these matters?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. I received that report much later.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And at the time you appointed-I withdraw the question. It is obvious from the dates of the documents. You acknowledged the receipt of that document, did you not, to Party member Buch?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is also correct.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And the only proceedings that were taken about these riots were those taken by the Party Court, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not quite; some were brought before the law courts. That is in the report also.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask that he be shown the report, which is Document 3063-PS. It is not in evidence. Since the document apparently has not been brought here, I will ask you from your recollection.</P>

<P>GOERING: I know it fairly well.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I thought so.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, because it has been submitted to me before, here.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, it has not been kept from you. Now, in the first place, the Party Court reported that it was probably understood-I quote-"by all of the Party leaders present from oral instructions of the Reich Propaganda Director, that the Party should not appear outwardly as the originator of the demonstrations, but in reality should organize and execute them." Was that the report of the Party Court?</P>

<P>GOERING: The Party Court, as a result of its investigation established that the Propaganda Chief, Dr. Goebbels, had given these directives. May I ask, if we are dealing with a report dated March or maybe April?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The 2/13/1939, is the date.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct; that is the result of investigations after the incidents.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right. Now, as a result of the riots, did the Court, the Party Court, not also report this to you: that the Supreme Party Court has reserved itself the right to investigate the killings, also the severe mistreatment and moral aims and will request the Fuehrer to drop proceedings against any person whom the Party Court did not find guilty of excesses?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the Party Court was made up of Gauleiter and Group Leaders of the Party?</P>

<P>GOERING: The Party Court changed. I cannot say just now, without having the document, who made up the Party Court at that time. I see that I am being given the document. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to Page 4, toward the bottom, where the report says, "Gauleiter and Group Leaders of the branches served as jurors at the trials and decisions."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, it was a matter of course that the jurors of the Party Court were always taken from these categories according to their importance. I wanted only to say I did not know which persons were taking part here.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the Party Court found five persons guilty of offenses, did they not? Number 1, a Party member, was guilty of a moral crime and race violation and he was expelled. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: And turned over to the penal court. That is what it says in the last sentence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right. Another Party member, Case Number 2, was suspected of race violation and expelled from the Nazi Party.</P>

<P>GOERING: Expelled for suspected race violation and theft, and turned over to the ordinary court.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes; and Number 2, Gustav, was expelled from the Party and SA for theft. Right?</P>

<P>GOERING: You are at Number 3?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I have Number 2, Gustav, the first name mentioned.</P>

<P>GOERING: Gustav is the first name- Gerstner-yes, for theft, also turned over to the ordinary court for suspected race violation.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, Number 3 dealt with two expulsions of Party members on the grounds of moral crimes against a Jew, and they are now held in protective custody. Right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Expelled from the NSDAP and taken into protective custody; they were also turned over to the civil court later. I know that very well.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, we come to Cases 4 and 5, the first of which was a man, a Party member and SA member, who was reprimanded and declared unfit to hold office for 3 years because of a disciplinary offense, namely, for killing the Jewish couple Selig, contrary to order. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And in the last of these cases the offender was reprimanded and declared unfit to hold office for 3 years for shooting a 16-year-old Jew, contrary to orders after completion of the drive. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We now come to the cases of the killing of Jews, where proceedings were suspended or minor punishments pronounced. I will not go through those in detail, but it is a fact that only minor punishments were pronounced by the Supreme Court of the Party for the killing of Jews, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I now ask you to turn to Page 8.</P>

<P>GOERING: One moment please.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I call your attention to the language in regard to Cases 3 to 16.</P>

<P>GOERING: Which page, please?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Nine, I believe it is. The Supreme Party Court asks the Fuehrer to quash the proceedings in the State criminal courts.</P>

<P>Goering; To quash them, to beat them down, that does not mean suppress. A penal proceeding can be "niedergeschlagen." In Germany that is a different thing from "suppress."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you give us your version of it and tell us what it is. What does beating down a proceeding mean? Does it mean that it has ended?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is what it means, but it can only be ordered by an office which has authority to do it; that is to say, the Fuehrer can at any time "beat down" a proceeding by way of an amnesty The Cabinet could at any time pass a resolution to "beat down" a proceeding-suppressing it would have been illegal. In Germany, "niedergeschlagen" is a legal term meaning "to suspend." [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And one further question. It was also reported to you, was it not, in that report-I refer to Page 11:</P>

<P>"The public down to the last man realize that political drives, like those of 9 November, were organized and directed by the Party, whether this is admitted or not. When all the synagogues burned down in one night, it must have been organized in some way and can only have been organized by the Party."</P>

<P>That also was in the report of the Supreme Party Court, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have not found it yet. It is not the same page as mine.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let us find it and not have any mistake about it. Page 11. I should think it would be at the very bottom of Page 10, perhaps, where it starts.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have just found it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did I give a reasonably correct translation of it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break it off? Before we break off, will you offer in evidence these documents that you have been putting to the witness? Those which are not already in evidence?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, they should be, Your Honor, I will do that.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I think Document 3575-PS may have been offered yesterday, but not strictly offered in evidence; and Document 3063-PS today; and one other document the number of which I have not got.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I appreciate very much your calling my attention to it.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>DR. HORN: Mr. President: I ask you, Your Honor, to permit the Defendant Von Ribbentrop to be absent from tomorrow's session as there are still some fundamental questions I have to discuss with him in order to prepare his counterevidence.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, your suggestion as I understand it, is that the Defendant Ribbentrop should be absent from tomorrow morning's sitting in order that you may consult with him in reference to the preparation of his defense. Is that right?</P>

<P>DR.HORN: Yes.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has no objection to that course being taken provided that you make arrangements with some other Defense Counsel to look after Defendant Ribbentrop's interests if any questions arise. The Tribunal does not wish that you should come hereafter and say that you and Defendant Ribbentrop were out of court and object to what may have happened in your absence. You understand what I mean?</P>

<P>DR. HORN: Yes, Mr. President, and I give you my assurance that I will not use an objection of that nature, and shall ask one of my colleagues to act on my behalf.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has no objection to your taking that course of action, but of course you realize that the Trial cannot be held up by any delay which might be caused in the future by the fact that you were not present.</P>

<P>DR.HORN: Mr. President, the purpose of my request is such that it will help me to avoid future delays.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I quite understand that. I was only saying that in allowing you to do this, which is perfectly reasonable, the Tribunal is merely indicating they will not allow any future delays. The Trial must continue.</P>

<P>DR. HORN: I understand that and I wish to thank you.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: [Turning to the witness.] Now, the Volkischer Beobachter of the 3/12/1933 quotes a speech of yours delivered at Essen on the 3/11/1933, including the following-and I refresh your recollection by calling it to your attention:</P>

<P>"I am told that I must employ the police. Certainly I shall employ the police, and quite ruthlessly, whenever the German people are hurt; but I refuse the notion that the police are protective troop for Jewish stores. No, the police protect whoever comes into Germany legitimately, but it does not exist for the purpose of protecting Jewish usurers." Did you say that?</P>

<P>GOERING: When did you say that was?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you say that on the 3/11/1933 in a speech at Essen, either that, or that in substance?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct, but the circumstances were different. Before I answer, I would like to ask whether you have finished with the document in the book that was submitted to me previously. I gave no explanation and will ask my counsel to have me questioned later in regard to that document. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is satisfactory.</P>

<P>After the riots of November 9th and 10th, you have testified that you called a meeting on the 12th of November and ordered all officials concerned to be present, and that the Fuehrer had insisted on Goebbels being present.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, all chiefs of the economic departments.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Could you tell us who was there in addition to yourself and Goebbels?</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as I recall, the following were there for the purpose of reporting: The Chief of the Secret State Police, concerning the events, the Minister of Economy, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of the Interior...</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Will you please state their names so that there will not be any mistake about who was there at that time.</P>

<P>GOERING: I can quote only from memory. There were present to draw up a report: The leader of the Secret State Police in Berlin, Heydrich; the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick; Dr. Goebbels you have mentioned already; the then Minister of Economy, Funk, was there; the Finance Minister, Count Schwerin von Krosigk; and Fischbock from Austria.</P>

<P>Those are the only names I can recall at present, but there may have been a few others there too.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Part of the time, Hilgard, representing the insurance companies, was also present, was he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: He was summoned and waited there. His views were asked on special questions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you have been shown the stenographic minutes of that meeting which are in evidence as Exhibit Number USA-261, being Document Number 1816-PS, have you not, in your interrogation?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask that they be shown to you, and now, so that we may have no misunderstanding about the translations.</P>

<P>You opened the meeting with this statement. I will read it: "Gentlemen..." I think perhaps we had better be clear about which meeting it was. This is the meeting held on the 11/12/1938 at the office of the Reich Air Ministry. That is correct, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You opened the meeting:</P>

<P>"Gentlemen, today's meeting is of a decisive nature. I have received a letter written OD the Fuehrer's orders by the Stabsleiter of the Fuehrer's Deputy, Bormann, requesting that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or another."</P>

<P>Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Further down, I find this:</P>

<P>"Gentlemen, I have had enough of these demonstrations. They do not harm the Jews, but finally devolve on me, the highest authority for the German economy. If today a Jewish shop is destroyed, if goods are thrown into the street, the insurance company will pay the Jew for the damages so that he does not suffer any damage at all. Furthermore, consumer goods, goods belonging to the people, are destroyed. If, in the future, demonstrations occur-and on occasion they may be necessary-then I ask that they be so directed that we do not cut our own throats."</P>

<P>Am I correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, quite correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Skipping two or three paragraphs, I come to this...</P>

<P>GOERING: But the supplement has been omitted.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you can supplement it any way you want to.</P>

<P>GOERING: "...then I ask that they be so directed that we do not cut our own throats. For it is absurd to empty and set fire to a Jewish store, when a German insurance company has to cover the damage, and the goods which I sorely need are burned. I might as well take and burn the raw materials when they come in." [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right. You read any part of it that you want to as we go along, in addition to what I read.</P>

<P>"I am not going to tolerate a situation in which the German insurance companies are the ones to suffer. To prevent this, I will use my authority and issue a decree In this, of course, I ask for the support of the competent government agencies, so that everything shall be settled properly and the insurance companies will not be the ones who suffer.</P>

<P>"But another problem immediately emerges: It may be that these insurance companies have re-insurance in foreign countries. If there are such re-insurances, I would not want to give them up, because they bring in foreign exchange. The matter must be looked into. For that reason, I have asked Mr. Hilgard from the insurance company to attend, since he is best qualified to tell us to what extent the insurance companies are covered by re-insurance against such damage. I would not want to give this up under any circumstances. "</P>

<P>Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is absolutely correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "I do not want to leave any doubt, gentlemen, as to the purpose of today's meeting. We have not come together merely to talk again, but to make decisions; and I earnestly ask the competent departments to take trenchant measures for the Aryanizing of German economy and to submit them to me as far as is necessary."</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I then skip a considerable portion, unless there is more that you wish to put in, and come to this statement:</P>

<P>"The State Trustee will estimate the value of the business and decide what amount the Jew shall receive. Naturally, this amount is to be fixed as low as possible. The State Trustee will then transfer the business to Aryan ownership. The aim is thus accomplished, inasmuch as the business is transferred to the right ownership and its goodwill and balance sheet remain unimpaired.</P>

<P>"Then the difficulties begin. It is easily understandable that attempts will be made on a large scale to get Party members into all these stores and thus give them some compensation. I have witnessed terrible things in the past; little chauffeurs of Gauleiter have profited so much by these transactions that they have raked in half a million. You gentlemen know it. Is that correct?"</P>

<P>And they assented.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I said that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Would you care to read anything further in connection with that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Perhaps only the next sentence:</P>

<P>"These are, of course, things which are not permissible, and I shall not hesitate to deal ruthlessly with such underhand dealings. If a prominent person is involved I shall go straight to the Fuehrer and report these dirty tricks quite impartially."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is, if any individual was tempting to profit by Jewish possessions-is that what you meant?</P>

<P>GOERING: By Aryanization.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I will quote another portion:</P>

<P>"In other words, it must be an ordinary business transaction One sells his business and another buys it. If there are Party members among the would-be purchasers, they are to be given preference if they fulfill the same conditions. First of all should come those who have suffered damage. After that preference should be given on grounds of Party membership."</P>

<P>I will skip a line or two:</P>

<P>"This Party member should have a chance to buy the business for as cheap a price as possible. In such a case, the State will not receive the full price, but only the amount the Jew received."</P>

<P>Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a moment, please, I believe you skipped something.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, we did. If you want to put it in, you may read it.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I want to put it quite briefly, so that it will not take too long. I said what you have already said, that all things being equal, the Party member is to be given preference, the first on the list being the member who suffered prejudice by having his business license cancelled because he was a Party member Then follows the paragraph which you read and which is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you then speak at considerable length of the method by which you intended to Aryanize Jewish businesses, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then you take up the Aryanization of Jewish factories.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You speak of the smaller factories first.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Have you found the place where you speak of the factories?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have found it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I quote.</P>

<P>"Now the factories. With regard to the smaller and medium sized ones, two things will have to be made clear: First, which are the factories for which I have no use, and which can be shut-down? Could they not be put to another use? If not, these factories are to be pulled down. Second, if the factory should be needed, it will be turned over to Aryans in the same manner as the stores.</P>

<P>That is correct, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you care to say any more on that subject?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, those are the basic elements for the laws.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I call your attention to the Second paragraph, starting, "Take now the larger factories." Do you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Dealing with the larger factories, do you not say the solution is very simple, that the factory can be compensated in the same manner as the stores, that Is, at a rate which we shall determine, and the Trustee shall take over the Jew's interest, as well as his shares, and in turn sell or transfer them to he State as he thinks fit.</P>

<P>GOERING: That means any one who has any interest in the factories will receive compensation, according to the scale laid down by us.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And the reparation will be turned over to the State Trustee, will it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, to the State Trustee. The matter was simply is: The Jew relinquished his ownership and received bonds. That was to be settled by the Trustee through 3% bonds.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we will pass on to where you deal with the foreign Jews, do you recall that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: At that point a representative of the Foreign Office claimed the right to participate on behalf of the Foreign Minister, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, now, we will pass on to the point of the conversation between yourself and Heydrich.</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a moment, please. Part of the minutes are missing. All right. I have found the place where Heydrich is mentioned for the first time.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You inquired how many synagogues were actually burned, and Heydrich replied, "Altogether there were 101 synagogues destroyed by fire, 76 synagogues demolished, and 7,500 stores destroyed in the Reich." Have I quoted that correctly?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, then Dr. Goebbels interposed "I am of the opinion that this is our chance to dissolve the synagogues." And then you have a discussion about the dissolving of the synagogues, have you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: By Dr. Goebbels, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, Dr. Goebbels raised the question of Jews traveling in railway trains?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let me know if I quote correctly the dialogue between you and Dr. Goebbels on that subject. Dr. Goebbels said:</P>

<P>"Furthermore, I advocate that Jews be banned from all public places where they might cause provocation. It is still possible for a Jew to share a sleeper with a German. Therefore, the Reich Ministry of Transport must issue a decree ordering that there shall be separate compartments for Jews. If this compartment is full, then the Jews cannot claim a seat. They can only be given separate compartments after all Germans have secured seats. They must not mix with the Germans; if there is no more room, they will have to stand in the corridor."</P>

<P>Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "GOERING: I think it would be more sensible to give them separate compartments.</P>

<P>"Goebbels: Not if the train is overcrowded.</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a moment. There will be only one Jewish coach. If that is filled up the other Jews will have to stay at home.</P>

<P>"Goebbels: But suppose there are not many Jews going, let us say, on the long-distance express train to Munich. Suppose there are two Jews on the train, and the other compartments are overcrowded; these two Jews would then have a compartment to themselves. Therefore, the decree must state, Jews may claim a seat only after all Germans have secured a seat.</P>

<P>"GOERING: I would give the Jews one coach or one compartment, and should a case such as you mention arise, and the train be overcrowded, believe me, we will not need a law. He will be kicked out all right, and will have to sit alone in the toilet all the way." Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. I was getting irritated when Goebbels came with his small details when important laws were being discussed. I refused to do anything. I issued no decrees or laws in this connection- Of course, today, it is very pleasant for the Prosecution to bring it up, but I wish to state that it was a very lively meeting at which Goebbels made demands which were quite outside the economic sphere, and I used these expressions to give vent to my feelings.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then Goebbels, who felt very strongly about these things, said that Jews should stand in the corridor, and you said that they would have to sit in the toilet. That is the way you said it?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, it is not. I said that they should have a special compartment; and when Goebbels still was not satisfied, and harped on it, I finally told him, "I do not need a law. He can either sit in the toilet or leave the train." These are utterances made in this connection which, however, have nothing to do with the world-wide importance of the great conflict.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let us go down to where Goebbels brings up the subject of the German forests.</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a moment. Yes. It starts where Goebbels asked for a decree which would prevent Jews from going to German holiday resorts. To which I replied "Give them their own." And then he suggested that it would have to be considered whether we should give them their own resorts, or place some German bathing places at their disposal, but not the best ones so that people might ay: "You allow the Jews to get fit by using our bathing resorts." The question must also be considered whether it was necessary to forbid the Jews to go into the German forests. Herds of Jews are -today running around in Grunewald; that is a constant provocation -and so on. Then when he broke in again, I replied very sharply, 'It would be better to put a certain part of the forest at the disposal Of the Jews," as he wanted them out of the whole of the forests. Then I made the remark which seems to be of so much interest.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let us have that remark. Is it not correct you did state:</P>

<P>"We will give the Jews a certain part of the forest, and Alpers will see to it that the various animals, which are damnably like the Jews-the Elk too has a hooked nose-go into the Jewish enclosure and settle down among them."</P>

<P>Is that what you said?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I said it, but it should be linked up with the whole atmosphere of the meeting. Goebbels comes back on it again in the next sentence and says he considers my attitude provoking. I too can say I was provoked by his insistence on unimportant things, when such far-reaching and decisive matters were being discussed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you come to the point where you ask Mr. Hilgard from the insurance company to come in. Can you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you made a statement to Mr. Hilgard when he came in.</P>

<P>"The position is as follows: Because of the justified anger of the people against the Jews, the Reich has suffered a certain amount of damage. Windows have been broken, goods damaged and people hurt; synagogues have been burned, and so forth I suppose many of the Jews are also insured against damage committed by public disorder?</P>

<P>"Hilgard: Yes.</P>

<P>"GOERING: If that is so, the following situation arises. The people in their justified anger meant to harm the Jews, but it is the German insurance companies which have to compensate the Jews for the damage. The thing is simple enough. I have only to issue a decree to the effect that damage resulting from these riots shall not have to be paid by the insurance companies."</P>

<P>Is that what you said?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I said all that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Hilgard then outlined three kinds of insurance He pointed out that at least as far as plate glass insurance was concerned, the majority of the sufferers were Aryans who owned buildings and that, as a rule, the Jews only rented them. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, those are the details of the discussion.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Hilgard said:</P>

<P>"May I draw your attention to the following facts: Plate glass Is not manufactured by the Bohemian glass industry, but is entirely in the hands of the Belgian glass industry. In my estimation the damage amounts to 6 millions, that is to say, under the insurance policies, we shall have to pay the owners who for the most part are Aryans, about 6 millions compensation for the glass."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, before you pass from that page, in the third paragraph, just for the sake of accuracy, it appears that the name "Mr. Hilgard" is wrongly placed, does it not, because he seems both to put the question and to answer it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I think that is . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Probably the Defendant Goering put the question. It is the third paragraph on my page.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I take the minutes to read that when Hilgard appeared, Goering addressed him as "Mr. Hilgard."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I see.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But it is correct, as Your Honor suggests.</P>

<P>GOERING: I wish to point out what was said before concerning like broken glass. Goebbels said: "The Jews must pay for the damage," and I said, "It is no use, we have no raw material, it is all foreign glass. That will require foreign currency. It is like asking for the moon." Then Hilgard comes with the discussions just mentioned.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, and Hilgard pointed out that: Incidentally the amount of damage equals about half a year's production of the whole of the Belgian glass industry. We believe that the manufacturers will take 6 months to deliver the glass."</P>

<P>Do you recall that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, passing down, you come to a point at which Hilgard tells you about a store on Unter den Linden which was attacked. Can you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: He said, "The biggest incident is the case of Margraf, 3 Unter den Linden." Isn't that so?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "The damage reported to us amounts to 1.7 million because the store was completely ransacked." Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "GOERING: Daluege and Heydrich, you just get me these jewels by large-scale raids." Is that the order you gave?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course, so that the stolen goods should be brought back.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Brought back to you, not to the Jews.</P>

<P>GOERING: Not to me personally, I beg your pardon, that is quite clear.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Brought back to the State-you did not intend to return them to the Jews?</P>

<P>GOERING: It does not say that here. The main thing is, that they should be brought back.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "We are trying to get the loot back " as Heydrich put it, is that right? And you added, "And the jewels?"</P>

<P>GOERING: If a large jewelry shop is plundered, something must be done about it because with these valuables a great deal of trouble could be caused. Therefore, I ordered raids to be carried out to have these things, as well as other stolen goods, brought back. When a business was Aryanized, its stock was also transferred to the new owner. The main point, however, was that action should be taken against those who had stolen and plundered, and in fact 150 had already been arrested.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Heydrich went on to report on the method of these raids after you reminded him to bring back, to get the jewels.</P>

<P>"It is difficult to say. Some of the articles were thrown into the street and picked up. The same happened with the furriers. For example, in the Friedrichstrasse in the district of Police Station C. There the crowd naturally rushed to pick up mink and skunk furs, et cetera. It will be very difficult to recover them. Even children filled their pockets just for the fun of the thing. It is suggested that the Hitler Youth should not be employed on such actions without the Party's consent. Such things are very easily destroyed."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, so it says.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And Daluege then suggests:</P>

<P>"The Party should issue an order to the effect that the police must immediately be notified if the neighbor's wife-everybody knows his neighbor very well-has a fur coat remodeled or somebody is seen wearing a new ring or bracelet. We should like the Party to assist in this matter."</P>

<P>GOERING: This is absolutely correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, Hilgard objected to your plan of releasing the insurance companies from paying the claims, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, this is also correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he gave the reasons:</P>

<P>"Hilgard: If I may give the reasons for my objection, the point is that we do a large international business. Our business has a sound international basis, and in the interests of the foreign exchange position in Germany we cannot allow the confidence in the German insurance business to be shaken. If we were .. now to refuse to fulfill commitments entered into by legal contracts it would be a blot on the escutcheon of the German insurance business.</P>

<P>"GOERING: But it would not be if I were to issue a decree or . a law."</P>

<P>Am I quoting correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, and in Hilgard's reply-and that is the reply I wanted to come to-he pointed out that the insurance companies could not get out of paying claims unless a law provided for it. If the sovereign state passes a law to the effect that the insurance sums must be forfeited to the state, then the insurance companies are no longer under any obligation.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I suggest to you that that is correct, but that even though you proposed to issue a decree absolving the German insurance companies, the companies insisted on meeting their obligations; and then Heydrich interposed and said: "By all means, let them pay the claims and when payment is made it will be confiscated. Thus we will save our face." Correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: Heydrich said that, but I issued a law. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not then say:</P>

<P>"One moment. They will have to pay in any case because Germans suffered damage. There will, however, be a law forbidding them to make direct payments to Jews. They will also have to make payment for damage suffered by Jews, not to the Jews, but to the Minister of Finance.</P>

<P>"Hilgard: Aha."</P>

<P>GOERING: I have just said so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You accepted Heydrich's suggestion, which was quite contrary to the one you made?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I did not accept Heydrich's suggestion, but I issued a law to the effect that insurance money due to Jews must be paid to the Minister of Finance, as I did not agree with Heydrich that money should be paid out and then surreptitiously confiscated. I went about it in a legal way and was not afraid to make the necessary law and to take the responsibility for the claims to be paid to the State, that is, to the Minister of Finance.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the Tribunal will judge for itself, we have the evidence.</P>

<P>Now, Hilgard, representing the insurance companies, then raised the question that the amount of glass insurance premium was very important, that glass insurance was the companies' greatest asset "but the amount of the damage now caused is twice as high as in an ordinary year," and he pointed out that the whole of the profits of the German insurance companies would be absorbed, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And also the question of the number of the stores destroyed-Heydrich reported 7,500, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I call your attention to the following conversation.</P>

<P>Who, by the way, was he?</P>

<P>GOERING: Daluege was the leader of the Schutzpolizei.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "One question has still to be discussed. Most of the goods in the stores were not the property of the shopkeepers but were on consignment from other firms which had supplied them. Now the unpaid invoices are being sent in by these firms, which are certainly not all Jewish, but Aryan, in respect to these goods on consignment.</P>

<P>"Hilgard: We will have to pay for them too.</P>

<P>"GOERING: I wish you had killed 200 Jews instead of destroying such valuables.</P>

<P>"Heydrich: There were 35 killed."</P>

<P>Do I read that correctly?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, this was said in a moment of bad temper and excitement.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Spontaneously sincere, wasn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: As I said, it was not meant seriously. It was the expression of spontaneous excitement caused by the events, and by the destruction of valuables, and by the difficulties which arose Of course, if you are going to bring up every word I said in the course of 25 years in these circles, I myself could give you instances of even stronger remarks.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then Funk interposed to discuss the foreign exchange point, did he not? He contributed to the discussion, did he not, for a while? I will not bother to go into it.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, but not everything is put down in the minutes, which are not clear on this point. I regret the minutes are incomplete. That is strange. [=]</P>

<P>Hilgard returned again to the subject of the profit of the insurance companies, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you made this statement, did you not?</P>

<P>"The Jew must report the damage. He will get the insurance money, but it will be confiscated. The final result will be that the insurance companies will gain something, as not all damages will have to be made good. Hilgard, you can consider yourself damned lucky``  .</P>

<P>"Hilgard: I have no reason for that. The fact that we shall not have to pay for all the damage is called a profit.</P>

<P>"GOERING: Just a moment. If you are legally bound to pay 5 millions and all of a sudden an angel, in my somewhat corpulent shape, appears before you and tells you you may keep 1 million, hang it, is this not a profit?

<P>Afternoon Session</P>

<P>DR. ALFRED SEIDL (Counsel for Defendant Hess): Mr. President the Defendant Hess has expressed the wish to be excused from attending this afternoon's session, because he wants to prepare himself for his examination as a witness, which will take place in the next few days. I do not believe that this will cause a delay in the proceedings, and I should like to ask the Tribunal to grant this request.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly, on the same conditions as before namely, that you arrange with somebody to protect your interests while you are absent.</P>

<P>DR. SEIDL: I will not be absent myself, only Hess.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: [To the witness.] I would like to call your attention again to the Exhibit USA-261, Document 1816-PS. Would you turn to Part 5, where you were speaking of Margraf's jewels that disappeared?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is going back to something already dealt with.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, for a time, to Part 5. I call your attention to your statement as follows:</P>

<P>"Now we come to the damage sustained by the Jew, the disappearance of the jewels at Margraf's, et cetera. Well, they are gone and he will not get them refunded. He is the one who has to suffer the damage. Any of the jewels which may be returned by the police will belong to the State."</P>

<P>Do you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct, but on the basis of the laws he -as compensated for that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there was a representative of Austria present at this meeting, was there not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I ask you to turn to his statement in reference to conditions in Austria, a page or so farther on.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I ask you whether he did not report to your meeting as follows:</P>

<P>"Your Excellency, in this matter, we have already a very complete plan for Austria. There are 12000 Jewish workshops and 5000 Jewish retail shops in Vienna. Even before the National Socialist revolution we already had, concerning these 17000 shops, a definite plan for dealing with all tradesmen. Of the 12000 workshops about 10000 were to be closed definitely ..."</P>

<P>GOERING: The interpreter did not follow . . .</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you find it?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have found it, but the interpreter has not.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "Regarding this total of 17000 stores, of the shops of the 12000 artisans, about 10000 were to be closed definitely and 2000 were to be kept open. Four thousand of the 5000 retail stores were to be closed and 1000 kept open, that is, were to be Aryanized. According to this plan, 3000-3500 of the total of 17000 stores would be kept open, all others closed. This was decided following investigations in every single branch and according to local needs, in agreement with all competent authorities, and is ready for publication as soon as we shall receive the law which we requested in September. This law shall empower us to withdraw licenses from artisans quite independently of the Jewish question. That would be quite a short law.</P>

<P>"GOERING: I shall have this decree issued today."</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course. This concerns a law for the curtailment of the heavy retail trade which, even apart from the Jewish question, would have reduced the number of retailers. That can be seen from the minutes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Very well, let us go on a little further. Do you mean to inform the Tribunal that this did not apply to Jewish shops; that it had no connection with the Jewish question?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have said that independently of the Jewish question, in view of the overfilled retail trade, a limitation of the number of tradesmen would have followed, and that it can be seen from the following statement by Mr. Fischbock, which you have read, that I asked for a law which would authorize us to withdraw licenses, without any connection with the Jewish question. That would be a brief law. Whereupon I answered, "I will issue the decree today." [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, if you will . . .</P>

<P>GOERING: Naturally, above all, Jewish stores were to be eliminated, as I said in the beginning.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Please go on down two paragraphs to where this was reported:</P>

<P>"But I do not believe that there will be 100 stores, probably fewer- and thus, by the end of the year, we would have liquidated all the recognized Jewish-owned businesses.</P>

<P>"GOERING: That would be excellent.</P>

<P>"Fischbock: . . . "</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, yes, that was the import of that meeting.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "Fischbock: Out of 17000 stores 12000-14000 would be shut down and the remainder Aryanized or handed over to the Trustee's office, which belongs to the State.</P>

<P>"GOERING: I have to say that this proposal is grand. This way the whole affair in Vienna, one of the Jewish capitals so to speak, would be wound up by Christmas or by the end of the year.</P>

<P>"Funk: We can do the same thing here. I have prepared a law elaborating that. Effective 1/1/1939, Jews shall be prohibited from operating retail stores and wholesale establishments, as well as independent workshops. They shall be further prohibited from keeping employees, or offering any ready-made products on the market; from advertising or receiving orders. Whenever a Jewish shop is operated the police shall shut it down.</P>

<P>"From 1/1/1939 a Jew can no longer be head of an enterprise, as stipulated in the law for the organization of national labor of 1/20/1934. If a Jew has a leading position in an establishment without being the head of the enterprise, his contract may be declared void within 6 weeks by the head of the enterprise. With the expiration of this period all claims of the employee, including all claims to maintenance, become invalid. That is always very disagreeable and a great danger. A Jew cannot be a member of a corporation. Jewish members of corporations will have to be retired by 12/31/1938. A special authorization is unnecessary. The competent ministers of the Reich are being authorized to issue the provision necessary for execution of this law..</P>

<P>"GOERING: I believe we can agree with this law."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now I ask you to pass a considerable dialogue relating to the Vienna situation; and I call your attention to the point at which Funk inquires of you:</P>

<P>"Why should the Jew not be allowed to keep bonds?</P>

<P>"GOERING: Because in that way he would actually be given a share."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that was the purpose, to get him out of the enterprise. If he kept the bonds, on the basis of his rights as stockholder he still had an interest in the enterprise, and on the basis of ownership of stocks his will would still carry weight in the enterprise.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You turned Funk's suggestion down that the Jews be allowed to keep bonds?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. I replaced the bonds with securities.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we will pass several more pages of debate, unless there is something you want to call attention to; and I come to the point where Heydrich is stating his position. I call your attention to this dialogue:</P>

<P>"Heydrich: At least 45000 Jews were made to leave the country by legal measures.</P>

<P>"GOERING: . . . " GOERING: One moment, please. l find it now.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: "At least 45000 Jews were made to leave the country by legal measures.</P>

<P>"GOERING: How was this possible?"</P>

<P>And then Heydrich tells you that: " . . .through the Jewish -societies we extracted a certain amount of money from the rich Jews who wanted to emigrate. By paying this amount and an additional sum in foreign currency they made it possible for a number of poor Jews to leave. The problem was not to make the rich Jews leave but to get rid of the Jewish mob."</P>

<P>Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: One moment. I do not find it here yet, but generally that is correct, yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Pass on a little further. Heydrich is making suggestions and says:</P>

<P>"As for the isolating, I would like to make a few proposals regarding police measures, which are important also because of their psychological effect on public opinion.</P>

<P>"For example, anybody who is Jewish according to the Nuremberg Laws will have to wear a certain badge. That is a possibility which will facilitate many other things. I see no danger of excesses, and it will make our relationship with the foreign Jews easier.</P>

<P>"GOERING: A uniform?</P>

<P>"Heydrich: A badge. In this way we could put an end to foreign Jews being molested who do not look different from ours.</P>

<P>"GOERING: But my dear Heydrich, you will not be able to avoid the creation of ghettos on a very large scale in all the cities.</P>

<P>They will have to be created."</P>

<P>Is that what you said?</P>

<P>GOERING: I said that. At that time the problem was also to get the Jews together in certain parts of the cities and in certain streets because on the basis of the tenancy regulations there was no other possibility, and if the wearing of badges was to be made obligatory each individual Jew could have been protected.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, passing further in the discussion I call your attention to this warning from Heydrich about those measures which have been discussed:</P>

<P>"GOERING: Once we have a ghetto, we could determine what stores ought to be there and we would be able to say, 'You, Jew so and so, together with so and so, shall take care of the delivery of goods,' then a German wholesale firm will be ordered to deliver the goods for this Jewish store. The store would then not be a retail shop but a co-operative store, a co-operative society for Jews.</P>

<P>"Heydrich: All these measures will eventually lead to the institution of a ghetto. I must say: nowadays one should not want to set up a ghetto, but these measures, if carried through as outlined here, will automatically drive the Jews into a ghetto."</P>

<P>Did Heydrich give that warning?</P>

<P>GOERING: Here it says so, yes, but it can be seen from the following discussion that I said: "Now comes that which Goebbels mentioned before, compulsory renting. Now the Jewish tenants will come together." It was a question of the Jewish tenants drawing together in order to avoid the disagreeable results which arose from reciprocal subletting.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have omitted that Funk also remarked at this point that "Jews will have to stand together. What are million? Every one will have to stand up for the next fellow. Alone he will starve."</P>

<P>Do you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. But in another part of these minutes it is stated very clearly: "One cannot let the Jews starve, and therefore the necessary measures must be taken."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Toward the close of that meeting you said the following, didn't you?</P>

<P>"I demand that German Jewry as a whole shall, as a punishment for the abominable crimes, et cetera, make a contribution of RM1 billion. That will work. The pigs will not commit a second murder so quickly. Incidentally, I would like to say again that I would not like to be a Jew in Germany."</P>

<P>GOERING: That was correct, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Were you joking about that too?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have told you exactly what led to the fine of RM1 billion.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You pointed out that the chauffeurs of Gauleiter must be prevented from enriching themselves through the Aryanization of Jewish property, right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We will now take up the subject of art.</P>

<P>I call your attention to Document 141-PS, Exhibit Number USA-308 [Errata note: change "USA-308" to "USA-368"]. That is the decree establishing priorities on the claim for Jewish art property. Do you recall that?</P>

<P>GOERING: That has been mentioned several times, and I have recently spoken about it in detail. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The order was issued as here stated was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, certainly; I emphasized that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In Paragraph 5 reference is made to art objects that are suitable to be given to French museums,</P>

<P>and which were to be sold by auction. The profit from this auction was to be given to the French State for the benefit of war widows and children. You say that this was never done?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not say that this never happened. That was my for intention in that decree.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I am asking you if it ever has been done.</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as Paragraph 5 is concerned, I cannot say. I can only refer to the payments mentioned in Paragraph 2- the things that I pointed out-which I had effected after an estimate, and I said the other day that this amount was kept in readiness and that I repeatedly asked into which account it should be paid. And among the object destined to go into the collection which I was to make, I had every single item valued.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Where was this amount kept?</P>

<P>GOERING: In my bank, under the name "Art Funds."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In what bank?</P>

<P>GOERING: It was-I cannot say for sure, there were several banks-in which bank exactly the art fund was deposited, I cannot say I would have to have the documents here for that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In the several interrogations you have never been able to point out where that fund is, have you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot say, but you would only have to question my secretary who kept account of all the funds; she can tell You quite accurately.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: This order, 141-PS, was carried out by the Rosenberg Special Staff (Einsatzstab), wasn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you know who carried it out who actually was there? Did you know Turner?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not understand the name.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you know Mr. Turner?</P>

<P>GOERING: I know a certain Turner, who, however, had nothing to do with the Einsatzstab, the Rosenberg Special Staff and who as far as I know, was in Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Wasn't State Counsellor Turner in Paris in connection with the art collections?</P>

<P>GOERING: I repeat again so that no error is possible, you said Turner, T-u-r-n-e-r, or Korner, K-o-r-n-e-r?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Turner.</P>

<P>GOERING: Korner?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: T-u-r-n-e-r.</P>

<P>GOERING: Turner-I do not know whether he had anything to do with Rosenberg's Einsatzstab.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you knew him, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And did you know a Dr. Bunjes?</P>

<P>GOERING: Bunjes, B-u-n-j-e-s, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You knew him?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: He had to do with captured or confiscated Jewish art treasures, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not believe that Dr. Bunjes had anything to do with that. He was competent in a different field of art- but the Einsatzstab Rosenberg and certain departments of the military administration, had something to do with it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask to have you shown, so that you can follow me, to refresh your memory, Document 2523-PS, Exhibit Number USA-783, a letter from Dr. Bunies, and ask you if this refreshes your recollection of certain events.</P>

<P>"On Tuesday, 2/4/1941, at 1830 hours I was ordered for the first time to report to the Reich Marshal at the Quai d'Orsay. Field Commander Von Behr of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg was present. It is, of course, difficult to describe in words the cordial atmosphere in which the conversation was held."</P>

<P>Do you recall such a meeting?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, it was not important enough for me to remember it, but I do not deny it, in any case.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We shall see if this refreshes your recollection:</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal dropped the subject for the time being and asked for the report of the present state of the seizure of Jewish art property in the occupied western territories. On this occasion he gave Herr Von Behr the photographs of those objects of art that the Fuehrer wants to bring into his possession. In addition, he gave Herr Von Behr the photographs of those objects of art that the Reich Marshal wants to acquire for himself."</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot follow here.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You mean you do not find these words, or you do not recall the events?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I have not found the passage yet, and I would like to have a little time to see the context of this letter, which was neither written by me nor addressed to me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let me call your attention to a further paragraph of it and see if it does not refresh your recollection:</P>

<P>"On Wednesday, 2/5/1941, I was ordered to the Jeu de Paume by the Reich Marshal. At 1500 o'clock, the Reich Marshal, accompanied by General Hanesse, Herr Angerer, and Herr Hofer, visited the exhibition of Jewish art treasures newly set up there."</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have already stated before that at Jeu de Paume I selected the art treasures which were exhibited there. That is right.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right; now we are getting there. "Then, with me as his guide, the Reich Marshal inspected the exhibited art treasures and made a selection of those works of art which were to go to the Fuehrer, and those which were to be placed in his own collection.</P>

<P>"During this confidential conversation, I again called the Reich Marshal's attention to the fact that a note of protest had been received from the French Government against the activity of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg, with reference to the Hague Rules on Land Warfare recognized by Germany at the Armistice of Compiegne and I pointed out that General Von Stulpnagel's interpretation of the manner in which the confiscated Jewish art treasures are to be treated, was apparently contrary to the Reich Marshal's interpretation. Thereupon the Reich Marshal asked for a detailed explanation and gave the following orders:</P>

<P>"'First, it is my orders that you have to follow. You will act directly according to my orders. The art objects collected in the Jeu de Paume are to be loaded on a special train immediately and taken to Germany by order of the Reich Marshal. These art objects which are to go into the Fuehrer's possession and those art objects which the Reich Marshal claims for himself, will be loaded on two railroad cars which will be attached to the Reich Marshal's special train, and upon his departure for Germany, at the beginning of next week, will be taken along to Berlin. Feldfuehrer Von Behr will accompany the Reich Marshal in his special train on the journey to Berlin.'</P>

<P>"When I made the objection that the jurists would probably be of a different opinion and that protests would most likely be made by the military commander in France, the Reich Marshal answered, saying verbatim as follows, 'Dear Bunjes let me worry about that; I am the highest jurist in the State.'</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal promised to send from his headquarters by courier to the Chief of the Military Administrative District of Paris on Thursday, 6 February, the written order for the transfer to Germany of the confiscated Jewish art treasures."</P>

<P>Now, does that refresh your memory?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not in the least, but it is not at all in contradiction to what I have said with respect to the art treasures, with the exception of one sentence. It is pure nonsense that I should have said that I was the highest jurist in the state because that, thank God, I was not. That is something which Mr. Bunjes said, and I cannot be held responsible for every statement which anyone may have made to somebody else without my having any possibility of correcting it. As for the rest, it corresponds to the statement I made recently. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the art objects then were loaded on cars and shipped to Berlin, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: A part of them, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I now call your attention to, and ask to have you shown, Document 014-PS, Exhibit Number USA-784ow, I ask you to refresh your recollection by following this report to he Fuehrer with me, and tell me if this conforms with your testimony:</P>

<P>"I report the arrival..."</P>

<P>GOERING: I would like to point out that this report did not come from me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I understand that. I am asking if it is right or wrong.</P>

<P>"I report the arrival of the principal shipment of ownerless Jewish treasures of art at the salvage point Neuschwanstein by special train on Saturday the 15th of this month. It was secured by my Einsatzstab, in Paris. The special train, arranged for by Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, comprised 25 express baggage cars filled with the most valuable paintings, furniture, Gobelin tapestries works of artistic craftmanship, and ornaments. The shipment consisted mainly of the most important parts of the collections of Rothschild, Seligmann"-and half a dozen others.</P>

<P>Have you found that and is it correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know whether this is correct, since the report did not come from me. The only thing which I can remember is that I was asked by the Einsatzstab to see to it that a sufficient number of special cars, box cars was put at their disposal to ship the art treasures, since Jeu de Paume was not a safe place in case of air attacks. Neuschwanstein lies south of Munich. This concerns the objects destined for the Fuehrer.</P>

<P>I should like, however, to refer to the next sentence of this document, which was not written by me. It goes as follows:</P>

<P>"The confiscation actions of my Einsatzstab were begun in 10/1940 in Paris according to your order, my Fuehrer."</P>

<P>That coincides with what I have said in my previous statements.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And would you care to read further?</P>

<P>GOERING: You mean where it says:</P>

<P>"Besides this special train, the main art objects selected by the Reich Marshal-mainly from the Rothschild collection- had previously been shipped in two special cars to Munich and were there put into the air raid shelter of the Fuehrerhaus."</P>

<P>They are those most precious works of art which I had designated for the Fuehrer, and which were to be sent, at the wish of the Fuehrer, to the air raid shelter. This had nothing to do directly with my affairs, but I did not dispute the fact, and I have explained it in detail.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When you were examined by the American Foreign Assets Commission, you estimated your art object as having a value, at the time you turned them over to the government, of 50 million Reichsmark, as I recall it. Am I right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not quite correct. The Commission insisted a valuation, and the discussion continued a long time backwards and forward. I expressly told the Commission that I could not assess the value because I did not have the objects in hand nor a list of them and I could not quote them from memory; furthermore, that the estimates were subject to fluctuation depending on the one hand upon the prices art lovers might pay and, on the other, upon the actual market value. Since I did not see a copy of the minutes, in spite of my pleas, and especially as minutes of this nature often give rise to misunderstandings, I can only acknowledge the records which ave signed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, do you question this fact? "When I gave the news to the Minister of Finance I estimated the value at that time at 50 million marks." Did you say that or did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot estimate the value. I only told the Finance Minister that the entire collection, including my own, would be turned over to the State. And since I know my passion for collecting, I thought that it was quite possible that something might suddenly happen to me, and that as I had put my entire fortune into these works of art, the entire collection might possibly become State, that is, public property, and my family would thus be deprived of ever,y means of subsistence. I therefore asked him to provide for a pension or some compensation for my family. That was the negotiation with the Finance Minister, to which he can testify.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What proportion of your art collection was acquired after 1933?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not understand the question.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What proportion of your art collection was acquired after 1933?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I could not say in detail- quite a number of pictures and statues.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you have claimed that some part of your art collection you bought?</P>

<P>GOERING: Certainly. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And in connection with that some inquiry was made into your financial transactions, was there not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know who made the inquiries.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you were asked, were you not, your receipt of RM7.276 million from the Reemtsma cigarette factory?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I was never asked about that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were never asked about it?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, neither about the amount nor about the cigarette factory, nor anything else.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let me refresh your recollection about that. Did you not tell them and did you not tell Colonel Amen in interrogations that this money was given to you by this cigarette factory and that their back taxes were canceled?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I even denied that their back taxes were ever canceled. I remember now that the question was put to me in a different connection. A sum of money was set aside for the so-called Hitler Fund, and this amount the Fuehrer put at my disposal for general cultural tasks.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: By the cigarette factory?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not by the cigarette factory; a number of business then subscribed to the Adolf Hitler Fund, and Mr. Reemtsma gave me this sum from the fund in the course of the years, after agreement with the Fuehrer. A part of it was allotted to the State theaters, other part for building up art collections, and other cultural expenditure.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you were interrogated on the 12/2/1945 by the External Assets Branch of the United States Investigation of Cartels and External Assets, were you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: May I first say explicitly that I had been asked whether I would be ready to make any statements about it, and was told that these statements would in no way be connected with this Trial. Therefore the presence of my defense counsel would not be necessary This was expressly told me, and was repeated to me by the prison authorities, and before the interrogation it was again confirmed to me that these statements should in no way be brought in in connection with this Trial. However, that is all the same to me. You may produce them as far as I am concerned. But because of the method employed, I desire to have this made known here.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I protest against the use of the statements for the reason that has just been given by the witness. I myself sometime ago-I think it was around Christmas-was asked by, I believe, members of the United States Treasury whether they could interrogate the Defendant Goering on questions of property, adding expressly that I did not have to be present at the interrogation because this had nothing to do with the Trial, and would not be used for it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am not able either to affirm or deny and therefore I will not pursue this subject further at this time. I do not believe that any stipulation was made that these facts should not be gone into. I was not informed of it, and if there has been of course, it would be absurd.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Now, you were asked about receiving some art objects from Monte Cassino.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask you if it is not the fact that an altar statue taken from the Cassino Abbey was brought and delivered to you, and that you expressed great appreciation for it.</P>

<P>GOERING: I am glad to be able to clarify this also. After the monastery of Monte Cassino had been completely destroyed by shelling and had been defended by a paratroop division, a delegation arrived one day bringing along a statue of some saint, entirely worthless from an artistic point of view, as a souvenir of this destroyed monastery. I thanked the men and showed the statue to the curator of my art collection, and he also considered the statue as of absolutely no value. It then remained in the box and was put away somewhere. The other...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think this is coming through sufficiently loud for the shorthand writers to hear.</P>

<P>GOERING: The rest of the art treasures from Monte Cassino according to my knowledge, were shipped in the following manner: A large part, especially those objects which belonged to the old monastery itself, was sent to the Vatican. I must assume this from the fact that the abbot of the monastery sent me and my division a letter written in Latin in which he expressed his extreme gratitude for this action.</P>

<P>Secondly, as far as I remember, the art treasures from the museum in Naples, which were at Monte Cassino, were for the greater part sent by us to Venice and there turned over to the Italian Government. Some pictures and statues were brought to Berlin, and there they were turned over to me. On the very same day I gave the list to the Fuehrer, and some time later also the objects themselves which were in my air raid shelter, so that he could negotiate about the matter with Mussolini. I did not keep a single one of these objects for my own collection. If my troops had not intervened, these priceless art treasures, which were stored in Monte Cassino and belonged to the monastery there, would have been entirely destroyed by enemy bombardment, that is to say, by the gritish-American attackers. Thus they have been saved.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you say of no value-no substantial value?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is even now my conviction, and I depended, above all, on the judgment of my experts. I never took this statue out of its packing case. It did not interest me. On the other hand, I wanted to say a few words of thanks to the men who brought it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The labor shortage in the Reich was becoming acute by 11/1941, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. [=]</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And you yourself gave the directives for the employment of Russian prisoners of war, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Employment for what?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: For war industry- tanks, artillery pieces, airplane parts.</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That was at the conference of the 11/7/1941, that you gave that order, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: At what conference that was I could not tell you; I issued these directives only in a general way.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the directive was that Russian prisoners of war should be selected in collecting camps beyond the Reich border, and should be transported as rapidly as possible and employed in the following order of priority: mining, railroad maintenance, war industry-tanks, artillery pieces, airplane parts, agriculture, building industry, et cetera. You gave that order, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: If I have signed it, the order is from me. I do not remember details.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What was the number of that, Mr. Jackson?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have you shown Document Number 1193-PS.</P>

<P>GOERING: I have not seen it yet.</P>

<P>[Document 1193-PS was submitted to the witness.]</P>

<P>This document, which you have just mentioned . . .</P>

<P>MR JUSTICE JACKSON: I did not get the answer. GOERING: Excuse me. I have just received a document about the use of Russian troops. Is that the document of which you speak?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is right. I call your attention to the fact that it is referred to as an annex in the letter signed by Goering.</P>

<P>GOERING: I want to paint out that this document is not signed by me, but by Korner, which, however, does not diminish my responsibility.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you do not question that on the 11/7/1941, you gave the order, as Korner reports it do you, in the document referred to as 1193-PS?</P>

<P>GOERING: I said only that it was not signed by me but by Korner and here even a still younger official, a Regierungsrat, and I wanted only to explain that this was my field and that therefore I assume responsibility. But I have not read it through yet. This deals with directives and outlines which I gave in general and which were then filled in and revised by the department concerned, whereby naturally not every word or every sentence written here was said or dictated by myself. But that does not alter the fact that I bear the responsibility for it, even if I did not know it in detail, or would have perhaps formulated it differently. But the general directives were given by me and implemented accordingly by the lesser authorities.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You also gave the order, did you not, that 100000 men were to be taken from among the French prisoners of war not yet employed in armament industry? Gaps in manpower resulting therefrom will be filled by Soviet prisoners of war. The transfer of the above-named French prisoners of war is to be accomplished by October the 1st. You gave the order, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. Here we deal primarily with the fact that a large part of French skilled workers who were prisoners of war were turned into free workers on condition that they worked in the German armament industry. The shortages which occurred at their previous places of work at that time, where they had worked as prisoners of war, were to be remedied by Russian prisoners of war, because I considered it pointless that qualified skilled industria workers should be employed in agriculture, for instance, or in an other field not corresponding to their abilities. Thus there was an incentive in the fact that these people could become free workerS instead of remaining prisoners of war, if they would agree to these conditions. The directives were given by me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And did you know that there was any forced labor employed in Germany?</P>

<P>GOERING: Compulsory labor. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not testify under interrogation on the 10/3/1945, that:</P>

<P>"I would like to add something to the last question of the interrogation The Colonel asked me if the forced labor program was effective, and I said 'Yes'. There are two remarks I would like to make to that.</P>

<P>"I must say that in the results as such it was effective. However, a great number of acts of sabotage did occur, and also treason and espionage.</P>

<P>"Question: But on the whole you would say it was a successful program from the German point of view?</P>

<P>"Answer: Yes. Without this manpower many things could never have been achieved."</P>

<P>Did you say that?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is obvious, because without workers one cannot do any work.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think you answered the question. The question was if you said the forced labor had been a success. What do you have to say to that? Did you say that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have said what I did in answering the question is whether the manpower used was successful; yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you were shown a document, 3700-PS, written by Schacht to you, and you have said that you received it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I remember.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you and Schacht were somewhat rivals in the economic field at one period, were you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I explained that only recently, and to what extent.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You wanted his position abolished in the event of war and he wanted your position abolished in event of war, did he not-your economic position?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not quite. They were two similar authorities having similar powers at the same time, two personalities, and that in the long run was not possible. It simply had to be decided which one of the two should be the sole authority. That would have been especially necessary in case of a mobilization.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You, in testifying on the 17th day of October last, as to your relations with Schacht, made this statement, did you not, in reference to your disagreements with Schacht: "This I must underline: Schacht always tried to maneuver for a new post, while all the other ministers co-operated absolutely." Did you say that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not exactly as it is there, but I wanted to emphasize that, contrary to the other ministers who obediently followed directives for the Four Year Plan, I had certain difficulties with Schacht, which I have already explained, due to his original strong personality.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The question was whether you made that statement in substance or in those words?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not exactly in these words, but as I have just explained in substance.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, do you have in mind Schachts letter to you, Document Number 3700-PS?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I read it a short time ago.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And in that letter Schacht said this to you, did he not, referring to 3700-PS? "It may be militarily necessary. .. " Do you want to follow it?</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>"It may be militarily necessary to conscript the 15-year-olds but it will heavily tax the fighting morale of the German people. The facts as the German people see them are as follows:</P>

<P>"First, the original prospect of a short war has not been realized.</P>

<P>"Second, the prospective quick victory over England by the Air Force did not materialize.</P>

<P>"Third, the public statement that Germany would remain free of enemy air raids has not been fulfilled.</P>

<P>"Fourth, the repeated announcements that the Russian resistance was definitely broken have been proved to be untrue.</P>

<P>"Fifth, Allied supplies of arms to Russia, and the manpower reserves of Russia have, on the contrary, been sufficient to bring continuous heavy counterattacks against our Eastern Front.</P>

<P>"Sixth, the original victorious advance into Egypt has been halted after repeated attempts.</P>

<P>"Seventh, the landing of the Allies in North and West Africa, declared impossible, has nevertheless been accomplished.</P>

<P>"Eighth, the extremely large amount of shipping space which was required for this landing has shown that our U-boats, in spite of their great successes, did not suffice to prevent this transport. In addition, the reductions in civilian traffic, in material for armaments, and in the availability of manpower are obvious to all the people.</P>

<P>"The conscription of the 15-year-olds will increase the doubts concerning the termination of this war."</P>

<P>Can you fix any more definitely than you have done the date when you received that letter?</P>

<P>GOERING: I can only say again that it is dated the 3rd of November, but the year is missing. If I were to be given a copy where the ear is stated, I could give an exact answer I have said recently that, according to my knowledge of events, it is a question of either 11/1944-11/1943. But, unfortunately, that is not indicated here. I can only see 3rd of November. The year is missing.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you know when Schacht was sent to the concentration camp? Do you know the date of that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not exactly, but now that you remind me of it, I can say that this letter certainly was not written in 1944 because in 11/1944, I believe, Mr. Schacht was already in the concentration camp; consequently, it must date back to 11/1943.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he was sent to the concentration camp shortly after dispatching that letter to you, wasn't he?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: How much longer was he at large?</P>

<P>GOERING: The letter is of 11/3/1943, as we have just found. I heard about the arrest of Schacht only after the attempt on the life of the Fuehrer and after my return a few days later, after an illness of some time, that is to say, in 9/1944. There is not the least connection between this letter and his arrest, because, when I asked about his arrest, I was told definitely it was in connection with the 20th of July.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you make an agreement, as Supreme commander of the Air Force, with the Reichsfuehrer SS, the Youth Fuehrer of the German Reich, and the Reich Minister for Occupied Eastern Territories, about the recruiting of youthful Russlans, Ukrainians, White Russians, Lithuanians, and Tartars between the pages of 15 and 20? Did you come to some agreement with Himmler and Rosenberg about that?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I personally concluded such an agreement, I do not think so. It is possible and even probable that my office did so, however.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you have testified yesterday or the day before-I think Friday-as follows; let me refresh your recollection about the questions of confiscations.</P>

<P>"Now, about the question of confiscation of State property and it was only such property that was confiscated. As far as I know, private property is mentioned in the official report as far as the winter of 1941-1942 is concerned, that might have been the case in the matter of furs or perhaps fur boots, and some soldiers may have taken little odds and ends from the people; but on the whole there was no private property and so none could be confiscated."</P>

<P>And I think you also said that you never took anything, not even so much as a screw or a bolt, when you were in occupation of foreign territory. Do you recall that testimony?</P>

<P>GOERING: Very exactly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you still stand on it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have you shown a document EC-317.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, that is a secret command matter, is it not, dated the 9/7/1943? Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have a letter here before me of 2/21/1944.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you have the wrong exhibit-- EC-317, Page 3.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes; Page 3.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: This letter of transmittal we will not bother about. Your secret command matter is dated 9/7/1943, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it reads as follows:</P>

<P>"Concerning the removal of the harvested crops and the destruction of the means of production in the agricultural and food economy in parts of the Occupied Eastern Territories.</P>

<P>"By direction of the Fuehrer, I give the following orders: "First: In the territories east of the line fixed by the highest military command, the following measures are to be taken gradually, according to the military situation at the time. The measures are to be determined by the commanders of the army groups:</P>

<P>"(1) All agricultural products, means of production, and machinery of enterprises serving the agriculture and food industry are to be removed.</P>

<P>"(2) The factories serving the food economy, both in the field of production and of processing, are to be destroyed.</P>

<P>"(3) The basis of agricultural production, especially the records and establishments, storage plants, et cetera, of the organizations responsible for the food economy, are to be destroyed.</P>

<P>"(4) The population engaged in the agricultural and food economy is to be transported into the territory west of the fixed line."</P>

<P>GOERING: Absolutely correct; but I want to make the following statement in connection with it. We are dealing here with purely military measures in a retreat, and may I comment on these four points: I emphasized the other day that a great number of agricultural machines had been brought to Russia by us. As the Russians, in their retreat, destroyed everything, we had all the less military reason to allow the machinery of industries which we had set up and brought there to fall into their hands undestroyed. This concerns an urgently necessary military order which had been issued during a retreat, and which was executed in the same way as before in the reverse sense. It does not deal with any sort of private property.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it was signed by you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, this order bears my signature.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I am about to go into a different subject, may it please Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we will adjourn now.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask that the witness be shown a document, 3786-PS, of which there are no extra copies available because it came to us so late. I will ask you to examine that and tell me whether you recall the meeting to which these minutes refer?</P>

<P>GOERING: We are apparently concerned here with a report dealing with a meeting which took place daily with the Fuehrer. As meetings occurred once or twice daily, I naturally cannot, with any accuracy, without first having read the report, recall the report of 1/27/1945, for I was present at a great number of these meetings during the course of the war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I shall call your attention to specific incidents in it. The minutes indicate that the Fuehrer, yourself, Keitel, and Jodl were present, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is according to the notes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I will call your attention to Page 31 and ask you to follow with me the notes and see if it refreshes your recollection. Now this relates to 10000 impriSoned air force officers. I quote what is attributed to you.</P>

<P>"GOERING: Near Sagan, there are 10000 imprisoned air force officers. Their custody is the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army (B.d.E.). Personnel for guarding or transporting them is said to be lacking. The suggestion was made as to whether the prisoners should not be left to their Soviet Russian allies. It would give them 10000 airmen.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer: Why did you not remove them earlier? This is an unequaled bungling.</P>

<P>"GOERING: That is the business of the commander of the B.d.E. We have nothing to do with it. I can only report it.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer: They must be removed, even if they have to go on foot. The Volkssturm must be called in. Anyone who escapes will be shot. Any means must be used.</P>

<P>"GOERING: That is from Sagan, there are 10000 men.</P>

<P>"Guderian: In the transfer process the 4th Armored Division has been moved out completely, also the 227th Division- the remainder of the 32d Division is now moving out. The next in line is the Headquarters of the 3rd SS Panzer Corps which will move tonight, and tomorrow night the Division Niederland, which has already pulled out. Parts of the Division Nordland have also been withdrawn from the front.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer: Are they to get replacements? Are they already on the move?</P>

<P>"Guderian: Fegelein took care of that. He has already ordered that they should be replenished immediately.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer: It is absolutely clear that the Army Group Vistula has nothing, for the time being, besides the Corps Nehring, the one group, and what it has on the Vistula. This must be organized. It will come from here and partly from Germany. It must be done, notwithstanding.</P>

<P>"GOERING: How many cattle cars are needed for 10000 men? "The Fuehrer: If we transport them according to German standards, then we need at least 20 transport trains for l000 men. If we transport them according to Russian standards, we need 5 or 3.</P>

<P>"GOERING: Take their pants and boots off so that they cannot walk in the snow."</P>

<P>Do you recall that incident?</P>

<P>GOERING: I remember this incident but vaguely.</P>

<P>Now that I have given the answer I would like to give a short explanation of the value of this document.</P>

<P>I understood that this document has just now arrived, but I have alreadY been interrogated with respect to this document long before the beginning of the proceedings. Already at that time I pointed out that at the stenographic recording of a meeting two stenographers took notes at the same time, since the meetings often lasted 4 or 5 hours, and therefore these stenographic notes always had to be gone over afterwards, especially as frequently, because of the presence of many men, inaccuracies occurred in the recordings so at statements made by one person were credited to another in the minutes- For that reason I said at that time already that not only did I not remember this statement, but that in my opinion I have never made this statement. We were concerned solely with the preparation of motor vehicles for transport.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I must say that you were interrogated with reference to the incident, but not with reference to these note which were not transcribed.</P>

<P>GOERING: In respect to this transcript and this incident, it was especially emphasized that we were concerned with the stenotype record of the report of the meeting, and I already uttered a similar opinion at that time. It was not submitted to me at that time.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Not stenotype, but stenographic.</P>

<P>You are also reported on Page 35. I call your attention to this and ask you, is it attributed to you mistakenly?</P>

<P>"GOERING: The 10000 prisoners in Sagan should be transported away by Obergruppenfuehrer Juttner." Perhaps I do not pronounce the word as you would.</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer: These prisoners must be removed by all available means.</P>

<P>Volkssturm must be employed with the most energetic men. All who attempt to flee will be shot.</P>

<P>"Fegelein: We have a man for that who guards the concentration camps. That is Gruppenfuehrer Glucks. He must do the job."</P>

<P>Did that occur?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I do not know. I have already testified before that the B.d.E. had to take charge of the transportation, because we had nothing to do with it. What ideas and opinions the other gentlemen expressed in the discussions I cannot completely testify to, or state here. It was a question of whether these 10000 were to be surrendered or shipped away. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask you a question or two about the Warsaw bombing. Was it known to you that on the 3rd of September, the house of the Ambassador of the United States, situated some 17 kilometers out of Warsaw, was bombed by the German Air Force?</P>

<P>GOERING: No; that is unknown to me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your Air Force took a good many pictures of the Polish villages and of Warsaw and used them for distributing among the German people, didn't they?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is possible, I was not concerned with that. In any event, the Luftwaffe did not distribute pictures to the German people. It is possible that pictures taken by the Luftwaffe might have got into the German press by way of the Propaganda Ministry. But distribution, in the sense of the Luftwaffe's distribution photographs like leaflets, never occurred.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Luftwaffe did take the pictures for the purpose of determining the efficiency of its hits, did it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: The Luftwaffe took pictures before the target was bombed, and again after the target had been bombed, to determine whether the target had actually been hit.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have you shown five photographs and ask you if those are not photographs taken by the Luftwaffe, following the attack on Poland.</P>

<P>[Photographs were shown to the witness.]</P>

<P>GOERING: To answer the first question, whether the pictures had actually been taken by the German Air Force, I regret I cannot give a positive answer for there is no indication that these were made by the German Air Force. Four out of the five pictures were, if you observe them closely, taken from an oblique angle, as though they had been taken from a church steeple rather than from an airplane from which generally only vertical pictures are taken because of the built-in camera.</P>

<P>The picture showing the destruction of parts of Warsaw can be regarded technically as such an aerial photo. The date is lacking here. But none of these pictures give any proof that they were taken by the Luftwaffe.</P>

<P>However, let us assume that they were taken by the Luftwaffe so that further questions will be facilitated.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You say you will assume they were by the Luftwaffe?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, although I doubt it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I do not want you to give away anything here. If you think they were not taken by the Luftwaffe, I do not want you to admit it.</P>

<P>GOERING: I said there is no proof. I did not take the pictures, l do not recognize them, they were not submitted to me as Luftwaffe pictures and from a purely technical point of view they could only have been taken from a plane with a private camera from a very oblique angle. They are not true aerial pictures, that is vertical pictures as taken by the Air Force.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we will pass them then and go to something else.</P>

<P>Let us take up Document 638-PS, Exhibit Number USA-788, about which you have been interrogated and which, as I recall, you authenticated.</P>

<P>[Document 638-PS was submitted to the Witness.] This is the document which was signed by Dr. Joel and I ask you to follow me.</P>

<P>"From the Reich Marshal's plans of 9/24/1942. "First: The Reich Marshal is looking for daring fellows who will be employed in the East as Sonderkommandos and who will be able to carry out the task of creating confusion behind the lines. They are to be formed into bands under leadership, and with interpreters assigned to them. For this purpose the Reich Marshal is considering convicts who are first offenders, who have committed not particularly heinous offenses for which there can be some human understanding. "The Reich Marshal first of all mentioned persons convicted of poaching. He knew, of course, that the Reichsfuehrer SS had picked out the so-called poachers, and they were already in his hands. He requests, however, that the question be reexamined. The only suitable men are those with a passion for hunting, who have poached for love of the trophy, not men who have laid snares and traps. The Reich Marshal also mentioned fanatical members of smuggling gangs, who take part in gun battles on the frontiers and whose passion it is to outwit the customs at the risk of their own lives, but not men who attempt to bring articles over the frontier in an express train or by similar means.</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal leaves it to us to consider whether still another category of convicts can be assigned to these bands or pursuit commands.</P>

<P>"In the regions assigned for their operations, these bands, whose first task should be to destroy the communications of the partisan groups, could murder, burn and ravish; in Germany they would once again come under strict supervision.</P>

<P>"Signed: Dr. Joel, 9/24/1942."</P>

<P>Do you wish to make an explanation of that document to the Tribunal?</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, with the same that I made once before. The first two paragraphs clearly show that I wanted only those people who had committed no offenses involving laws of honor, such as poachers distinguishing between those having a passion for hunting and those who only want to steal. I made a distinction also with regard to smugglers, between those who take personal risks showing a certain passion for their activity, and those who do it in a dishonorable way.</P>

<P>Both these main paragraphs plainly show that I did not wish to use criminals of any type, and that is why I explicitly denied having said what is stated in the last paragraphs. It is not a question of the minutes but of the notes taken by an official with whom I discussed these things. He should be able to testify where and if he heard these words uttered by me. But they contradict my ideas so much, and I particularly emphasize this, and in particular, as I have clearly said, as regards rape, which I always punished with death even if committed against citizens of enemy states, that I rejected that statement; and I again pointed out that the main paragraphs are in utmost contradiction to the last remark because if it had been a matter of indifference to me, I could have selected criminals.</P>

<P>Thirdly, I expressly stated above, that their main task behind the lines was to create confusion, to disrupt communications, to destroy railways, and the like. Fourthly and lastly, the whole thing never took place.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You objected to the word "ravish" which had been translated the first time "rape", and that is the only objection you made to this document when it was presented to you. Is that not correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, it is not correct that way. I say this because it Is a most significant concept which has always particularly contradicted my sense of justice, for shortly after the seizure of power I instigated a sharpening of this phase of German penal laws. And I wanted to show by this word and this concept, that this entire latter part could not have been uttered by me, and I deny having said it. I will absolutely and gladly take responsibility for even the most serious things which I have done, but I deny this statement, as being in complete contradiction to my opinions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Who is the signer of this document?</P>

<P>GOERING: Dr. Joel.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes-you knew him?</P>

<P>GOERING: I knew him slightly. I saw him at this conference.</P>

<P>Mr. JUSTICE JACKSON: He was present at the conference?</P>

<P>GOERING: I instructed him to come to tell him that I wished at type of people.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you dealt in economic matters the various occupied countries through Reichskommissars?</P>

<P>GOERING: I testified the other day that all sorts of authorities, including the Reichskommissars had to follow my economic directives and orders.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And were to report to you on economic matters?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not about all of them, only insofar as they concerned my directives.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And who was your Reichskommissar Poland?</P>

<P>GOERING: There was no Reichskommissar in Poland. There was Governor General in Poland, that was Dr. Frank.</P>

<P>MR JUSTICE JACKSON: And who was the Reichskommissar in the Netherlands?</P>

<P>GOERING: Dr. Seyss-Inquart was Reichskommissar for Holland.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Who was the Reichskommissar for Norway?</P>

<P>GOERING: In Norway the Gauleiter Terboven was Reichskommissar.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Terboven-he was also a Gauleiter you say?</P>

<P>GOERING: He was Gauleiter at Essen.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You appointed him to Norway or attained his appointment?</P>

<P>GOERING: I neither appointed him for Norway-because that was beyond my jurisdiction- nor did I have him appointed. I did not oppose his appointment in any way as I considered he would make a very competent Reichskommissar. [=]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he was there from 1940-1945?</P>

<P>GOERING: I believe that is correct.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I will ask to have you shown Document R-134, a communication from Terboven to you.</P>

<P>[Document R-134 was submitted to the witness]</P>

<P>That is a communication of the 5/1/1942, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I note the date; yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that reports to you as follows does it not-it is addressed to you as Reich Marshal, "My esteemed Reich Marshal", is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Omitting the first paragraph, unless you are to give it.</P>

<P>"Several days ago on an island west of Bergen we captured a Norwegian sabotage unit, trained by the Secret Service and found extensive stores of sabotage instruments, some of them of a new kind, including probably poison and bacteria. Those which appeared unfamiliar were forwarded to the Reich Security Main Office for closer examination.</P>

<P>"Besides other tasks, this sabotage unit was to begin its sabotage work, on Sola and Herdla using the explosive of which a sample is enclosed herewith. This appears from written directives found. Since it must be assumed that similar actions are under way on airfields on the rest of the European coast, and assuming that a means of sabotage actually unknown until now is involved, I am communicating with you by the fastest possible means, in order to give you an opportunity to issue an appropriate warning.</P>

<P>"Unfortunately, two especially reliable officers of the Security Police were killed in the fight against the sabotage unit. We buried them this morning at 1000 hours in the Heroes' Cemetery in Bergen.</P>

<P>"On the same day and at the same hour 18 Norwegians were shot on my order. These had been captured some time previously in the attempt to go to England illegally.</P>

<P>"On the same day, the entire village which had harbored the sabotage unit was burned down and the population deported. All the males were taken to a German concentration camp without any notification being sent to their families. The women were sent to a female forced labor camp in Norway and those children who were not capable of working went to a children's camp. Hail Hitler! Yours obediently, Terboven." Is that correct?</P>

<P>GOERING: It says so in the letter, a copy of which is before me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Terboven remained after that report until 1945, didn't he?</P>

<P>GOERING: That's correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, later in the same year, 1942 you adopted very similar means to those reported by Terboven to you, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not understand the question.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well you adopted later in the same year the same means as Terboven, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I? Where?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I will ask that you be shown Document 1742-PS.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Now, this is a decree of 10/26/1942, by Goering. I ask you, follow me:</P>

<P>"Simultaneously with the intensified combating of guerrilla activity ordered by the Fuehrer, and the cleaning up of the land behind the lines, in particular that behind the Army Group Center, I request that the following points be taken into consideration, and the conclusions drawn therefrom be put into practice:</P>

<P>"1. Simultaneously with the combating of the underground forces and the combing out of the areas contaminated by them, all available livestock must be driven off to safe areas. Similarly, food supplies are to be removed and brought into safety, so that they will no longer be available to the guerrillas.</P>

<P>"2. All male and female labor suitable for any kind of employment must be forcibly recruited and allocated to the Plenipotentiary General for Labor, who will then employ them in safe areas behind the lines or in the Reich. Separate camps must be organized behind the lines for the children.</P>

<P>Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Absolutely. It concerns areas overrun by guerrillas, and no one could expect me to leave cattle and foodstuffs at their disposal. Furthermore, people who were repeatedly being incited to guerrilla activities and revolts against us had to be brought back to safe areas and put to work. I would like to emphasize that this was absolutely vital for the security of the troops. But I may emphasize again that you said I gave the same orders which you read from Terboven's letter. I did not order villages to be burned, and did not order the shooting of hostages. This was something basically different.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You simply seized all the men, women and children and moved them out. That is what I referred to.</P>

<P>By 5/1944 your problem in the loss of fighter aircraft and fighter personnel was becoming serious?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: On the 5/19/1944, you had a conference in your office, on the subject of fighter aircraft and the losses of fighter personnel, did you not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you have been shown the minutes of that meeting and authenticated them in your interrogations?</P>

<P>GOERING: It is not the minutes of that conference It is a short and brief summary by an officer of a meeting which, as far as I know, lasted 2 days.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will ask to have you shown Document L-166. It is entitled, "Most Secret Document," isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it is also entitled, "Minutes of conference on fighter aircraft with the Reich Marshal on 5/15-16/1944." That is correct, too, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, it says, "Notices of a conference on fighter air craft at the Reich Marshal's on 5/15-16/1944."</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: "Notices," you translate it "notices"?</P>

<P>GOERING: It says "memorandum" here and that is the original.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "Notes of Conference on Fighter.</P>

<P>GOERING: Lasting 2 days.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. And at first General Galland described in detail the situation regarding fighter personnel. That took place, didn't it, and he reviewed the losses?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And reviewed the losses?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is right.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then he reviewed at some length under Item 2, "Remedial Measures," is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: According to the memorandum, yes, but whether that actually took place I cannot say. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: This conference took place, didn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Absolutely, 2 days.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And under Item 3 General Galland made certain proposals, did he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then after considerable discussion General Schmidt made certain proposals, Items 12 and 13, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: It must have been so. At any rate it says so according to the memorandum.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You recommended a conference between the chief of the General Staff and the chief of artillery, as soon as possible, did you not? Item 13?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And General Schmidt's recommendations and requests appear in Items 14 and 15 and 16 and 17 and 18?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you decided:</P>

<P>The Reich Marshal has decided that only the III-groups of fighter squadrons are to remain in the Reich, and that all the fighters fit for operations are to be pressed into service."</P>

<P>That occurred, did it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then:</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal desires that when low-level attack on airfields are made, causing considerable loss in personnel and material, the measures taken for defense and dispersal are to be re-examined by the Luftwaffenfuihrungsstab." Number 19. That occurred, did it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Item 20 reads:</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal wishes to propose to the Fuehrer that American and English crews who shoot indiscriminately over towns, at moving civilian trains, or at soldiers hanging to parachutes should be shot immediately on the spot."</P>

<P>Have I correctly read that?</P>

<P>GOERING: It says so here. And I objected at once at that time that this was not correct. This passage has no connection at all with the context of these notes, 19-21. Besides the expression soldiers hanging to parachutes" is entirely misleading and not Commonly used. I thought for a long time about how this could have got into the notes, which I never saw and which were drawn up over a period of 2 days, and can only find the explanation that I pointed out-as can be gathered from the other evidence-that around that time the Fuehrer gave a directive in that connection, and that in any event there must be a mistake; that is, it should not be that the Reich Marshal wants to propose, et cetera, to the Fuehrer, but that I might have suggested that the Fuehrer had some such intention. But about this the author of these notes would have to be consulted. No other item in all these notes refers to this. Even the next item is entirely different. Whereas everything else stands in relationship, this one point is extraneous.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In all the notes of the 2 days, the one thing that you say is mistaken.</P>

<P>Now I ask to have you shown Document 731-PS.</P>

<P>[Document 731-PS was submitted to the witness.] [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Now, the conference, the notes of which I have just read you was followed within a week by the order, 731-PS, was it not the memorandum, 731-PS, which reads:</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer has reached the following decision in regard to measures to be taken against Anglo-American air crews in special instances:</P>

<P>"Enemy airmen who have been brought down are to be shot without court martial proceedings in the following instances . . ."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, shouldn't you refer to a passage four lines above that, after "Report of the Reich Marshal"?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I did not, but perhaps for the record it ought to be in full.</P>

<P>"Chief of the Command Staff of the Armed Forces, Chief WFSt. Please direct drafting of order. W (Warlimont). K (Keitel) Deputy Chief of Command Staff of the Armed Forces. Must go to Reichsfuehrer SS. According to the report of the Reich Marshal, General Korten made the following statement: 'Memorandum' "-I think the next line is not in the original "'The Fuehrer has given the following ruling in regard to measures to be taken against Anglo-American air crews in special instances:</P>

<P>"'Enemy airmen whose machines have been shot down are to be shot without trial by court martial in the following cases:</P>

<P>"'(1) In the event of the shooting of our own German air crews while they are parachuting to earth.</P>

<P>"'(2) In the event of aerial attacks upon German planes which have made emergency landings and whose crews are in the immediate vicinity.</P>

<P>"'(3) In the event of attacks upon railway trains engaged in public transport.</P>

<P>"'(4) In the event of low-level aerial attacks upon individual civilians, farmers, workers, single vehicles, and so forth.'"</P>

<P>Now, there is a note: "In the event of low-level aerial attackS on individual civilians, single civilian vehicles, and so forth," is there not?</P>

<P>GOERING: On my copy, "In the event of low-level aerial attacks on single"-"single" is crossed out here and there are two words written above which I cannot read. Before the expression, "single vehicles," is the word "civilian" and referring to Point 2, it says:</P>

<P>"I consider it doubtful, because the destruction of a plane which has made an emergency landing cannot be designated as gangster methods but rather as a measure in keeping with the strictest standards of civilized warfare."</P>

<P>We are concerned with the entire series of questions discussed in these days and weeks and to which Von Brauchitsch also testified recently.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That note about that emergency landing is signed by "J," isn't it, which stands for "Jodl"?</P>

<P>GOERING: Certainly.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think that is all I care to ask.</P>

<P>There are a number of documents which should be introduced in this connection, and I think it will be best perhaps if we tabulate them and get them ready over the evening and present them in the morning.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly, Mr. Justice Jackson, you can put them all in then.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want to ask you first some questions about the matter of the British Air Force officers who escaped from Stalag Luft III. Do you remember that you said in giving your evidence that you knew this incident very completely and very minutely? Do you remember saying that?</P>

<P>GOERING: No-that I had received accurate knowledge; not that I had accurate knowledge-but that I received it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Let me quote your own words, as they were taken down, "I know this incident very completely, very minutely, but it came to my attention, unfortunately, at a later period of time." That is what you said the other day, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is what I meant; that I know about the incident exactly, but only heard of it 2 days later. [=]</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You told the Tribunal that you were on leave at this time, in the last period of 3/1944, is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, as far as I remember I was on leave in March Until a few days before Easter.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And you said, "As I can prove." I want you to tell the Tribunal the dates of your leave.</P>

<P>GOERING: I say again, that this refers to the whole of March-I remember it well-and for proof I would like to mention the people who were with me on this leave.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What I want to know is, when you were on leave.</P>

<P>GOERING: Here, in the vicinity of Nuremberg.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So you were within easy reach of the telephone from the Air Ministry or, indeed, from Breslau if you were wanted?</P>

<P>GOERING: I would have been easily accessible by phone if someone wanted to communicate with me.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want you to help me with regard to one or two other dates of which you have spoken. You say: "I heard 1 or 2 days later about this escape." Do you understand, Witness, that it is about the escape I am asking you, not about the shooting, for the moment; I want to make it quite clear.</P>

<P>GOERING: It is clear to me.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you mean by that, that you heard about the actual escape 1 or 2 days after it happened?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you hear about it from the office of your adjutant or from your director of operations?</P>

<P>GOERING: I always heard these things through my adjutant. Several other escapes had preceded this one.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, that's right. There had been a number of escapes from this camp.</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot tell you exactly whether they were from this camp. Shortly before several big escapes had taken place which I always heard of through the office of my adjutant.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want you to tell the Tribunal another date: You say that on your return from leave your chief of staff made a communication to you. Who was your chief of staff?</P>

<P>GOERING: General Korten was chief of staff at that time.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Can you tell us the date at which he made this communication to you?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I cannot tell you that exactly. I believe I discussed his incident with my chief of staff later, telling him what I had already heard about it from other sources.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Who was the first to tell you about it?</P>

<P>Was it your chief of staff who told you about the shootings? Do you mean that some one else had told you about shooting?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot say exactly now whether I heard about the shooting from the chief of staff, or from other sources. But in any event I discussed this with the chief of staff.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What was the date that you talked about it with your chief of staff?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot tell you the date exactly from memory, but it must have been around Easter.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That would be just about the end of March, wouldn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. It might have been at the beginning of April, the first half of April. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And then you had an interview with Himmler, you have told us?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I talked with Himmler about this.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Can you fix that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Of course I cannot establish this date with certainty. I saw Himmler, and, at the first opportunity after I had heard about this incident, spoke to him about it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So that you can't fix the date in relation to your coming back from leave, or the interview with your chief of staff, or any other date, or Easter?</P>

<P>GOERING: Without any documents it is, as I said, impossible for me today to fix the date. I can only mention the approximate period of time; and that I have done.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You said the other day that you could prove when you were on leave. Am I to take it that you haven't taken the trouble to look up what your leave dates were?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have already said the 28th or the 29th of March. I cannot tell you. For proof OfhthaperYhaps can fix this date more definitely. I know only that I was there in March.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Witness, will it be perfectly fair to you if I take the latest of your dates, the 29th of March, to work on?</P>

<P>GOERING: It would be more expedient if you would tell me when Easter was that year, because I do not recall it. Then it will be easier for me to specify the dates, because I know that a few days before Easter I returned to Berchtesgaden in order to pass these holidays with my family.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: A few days before Easter you went back to Berchtesgaden?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So you had come back on leave some day before that. Before you went to Berchtesgaden you had come back from your March leave?</P>

<P>GOERING: Berchtesgaden was then at the same time the headquarters of the Fuehrer. I returned from my leave to Berchtesgaden and with my return my leave ended, because I returned to duty. The return to Berchtesgaden was identical with the termination of my leave.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I can't give you Easter offhand, but I happen to remember Whitsuntide was the 28th of May, so that Easter would be early, somewhere about the 5th of April. So that your leave would finish somewhere about the end of March, maybe the 26th or the 29th; that is right, isn't it?</P>

<P>Now, these shootings of these officers went on from the 25th of March to the 13th of April; do you know that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know that exactly.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You may take that from me because there is an official report of the shooting, and I want to Se quite fair with you. Only 49 of these officers were shot on the 6th of April, as far as we can be sure, and one was shot either on the 13th of April or later. But the critical period is the end of March, and we may take it that you were back from leave by about the 29th of March.</P>

<P>I just want you to tell the Tribunal this was a matter of great importance, wasn't it? Considered a matter of great importance?</P>

<P>GOERING: It was a very important matter.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: General Milch-I beg pardon- Field Marshal Milch has said that it was a matter which would require the highest authority, and I think you have said that you know it was Hitler's decision that these officers should be shot Is that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: The question did not come through clearly.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It was Hitler's decision that these officers should be shot?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct; and I was later notified that it was Hitler's decree.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want you just to remember one other thing, that immediately it was published, the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, at once said that Great Britain would demand justice of the perpetrators of these murders- do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I cannot remember the speech to the House of Commons given by Eden. I myself do not know the substance of this speech even today. I just heard that he spoke in Parliament about this incident.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want you to tell the Tribunal just who the persons in your ministry involved were. I will tell you; I think it would be shorter in the end. If you disagree you can correct me.</P>

<P>The commandant of Stalag Luft III was Oberst Von Lindeiner of your service, was he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is quite possible. I did not know the names of all these commandants. There was a court martial against him and that was because the escape was possible. He was not connected with the shootings.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, but he was commandant of the camp, and I suppose you had to review and confirm the proceedings of the Zentralluftwaffengericht which convicted him and sentenced him to a year's imprisonment for neglect of duty. That would come to you, wouldn't it? Wouldn't that come to you for review?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, only if larger penalties were involved. One year imprisonment would not come to my attention. But I know, and I would like to certify, that court proceedings were taken against him for neglect of duty at the time of the escape.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: In 5/1943, Inspectorate Number 17 had been interposed between the Luftwaffe and the Prisoners of War Organization of the OKW, the Kriegsgefangenenwesen; do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know the details about inspection nor how closely it concerned the Prisoners of War Organization of the OKW, or how it was otherwise.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want to remind you of who your own officers were. You understand, Witness, that your own officers are involved in this matter. I want to remind you who they were.</P>

<P>Was the head of Inspectorate 17 Major General Grosch of the Luftwaffe?</P>

<P>GOERING: Major General Grosch is of the Luftwaffe.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You told the Tribunal the other day-I am quoting your own words-that you knew from information, you knew this incident very completely and very minutely. You are now telling the Tribunal you don't know whether Major General Grosch was head of Inspectorate Number 17 of the Luftwaffe.</P>

<P>GOERING: That is irrelevant. I told the High Tribunal that I heard an accurate account of the incident of the shooting of these airmen, but that has no connection with General Grosch and his inspectorate, for he did not participate in the shooting.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I will show you that connection in one minute if you will just answer my questions. Was Grosch's second in command Oberst Welder; do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know the particulars of the organization for inspection of prisoner-of-war camps, nor the leaders, nor what positions they held. At least not by heart. I would like to emphasize again, so that there will be no confusion, that when I said I knew about this matter, I mean that I knew how the order was issued and that the people were shot, that I came to know all about this but not as far as this was related to inspections, possibilities of flight, et cetera.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And did General Grosch, as head of Inspectorate 17, have to report to General Forster, your director of operations at the Luftwaffe Ministerium?</P>

<P>GOERING: That I cannot tell you without having the diagram of the subordinate posts before me. General Forster was, I believe at that time, head of the Luftwehr, or a similar designation, in the ministry. I concerned myself less with these matters, because they were not directly of a tactical, strategic, or of an armament nature. But it is quite possible and certain that he belonged to this department.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I put it to you quite shortly, and if you don't know I will leave it for the moment. Did you know Major General Von Graevenitz was head of the Defendant Keitel's department, the Kriegsgefangenenwesen, that dealt with prisoners of war?</P>

<P>GOERING: I first heard about General Graevenitz here for this department did not directly concern me. I could not know all of these military subordinate commanders in their hundreds and thousands of departments.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So I take it that you did not know Colonel, now General Westhoff, of the department under Von Graevenitz?</P>

<P>GOERING: Westhoff I never saw at all, and he did not belong to the Luftwaffe.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am not suggesting that Von Graevenitz and Westhoff belonged to the Luftwaffe. I wanted to make it clear that I was suggesting they belonged to General Keitel's organization.</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not know either; and I did not know what posts they occupied.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Up to that time you still had a considerable influence in the Reich, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: At this time no longer. This no longer concerns 1944.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But you were still head of the Luftwaffe and head of the Air Ministry, weren't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I was. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And you had, as head of the Luftwaffe and head of the Air Ministry, been responsible for six prisoner-of-war camps for the whole of the war up to that time, hadn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: How many prisoner-of-war camps I do not know. But of course I bear the responsibility for those which belonged to my ministry.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: To the Air Force?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, those which were subordinate to the Air Force.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You knew about the general plan for treatment of prisoners of war, which we have had in evidence as the "Aktion Kugel" plan, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. I knew nothing of this action. I was not advised of it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You were never advised of Aktion Kugel?</P>

<P>GOERING: I first heard of Aktion Kugel here; saw the document and heard the expression for the first time. Moreover no officer of the Luftwaffe ever informed me of such a thing; and I do not believe that a single officer was ever taken away from the Luftwaffe camps. A report to this effect was never presented to me, in any case.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You know what Aktion Kugel was: That escaped officers and noncommissioned officers, other than British and American, were to be handed over to the police and taken to Mauthausen, where they were shot by the device if having a gun concealed in the measuring equipment when they thought they were getting their prison clothes. You know what "Aktion Kugel" is, don't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I heard of it here.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Are you telling the Tribunal that You did not know that escaped prisoners of war who were picked up by the police were retained by the police and taken to Mauthausen?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I did not know that. On the contrary, variOus prisoners who escaped from my camps were caught again by the police; and they were all brought back to the camps; this was the first case where this to some extent did not take place. # SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But didn't you know that Colonel Welder, as second in command of your ministry's inspectorate issued a written order a month before this, in 2/1944, that prisoners of war picked up by the Luftwaffe should be delivered back to their camp, and prisoners of war picked up by the police should be held by them and no longer counted as being under the protection of the Luftwaffe; didn't you know that?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. Please summon this colonel to testify if he ever made a report of that nature to me, or addressed such a letter to me.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, of course I cannot tell whether your ministry was well run or not. But he certainly issued the order, because he says so himself.</P>

<P>GOERING: Then he must say from whom he received this order.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Well, he says that he issued this order, and you know as well as I do that prisoners of war is a thing that you have got to be careful about, because you have got a protecting power that investigates any complaint; and you never denounced the Convention and you had the protecting power in these matters all through the war, had you not? That is right, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct, but I take the liberty to ask who gave him this order, whether he received this order from me.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, he would not get it direct from you. I do not think you had ever met him, had you? He would get it from Lieutenant General Grosch, wouldn't he?</P>

<P>GOERING: Then Grosch should say whether he received such an order from me. I never gave such an order.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. So you say that you had never heard- this was 31/2 years after the beginning of the war and you had never heard that any escaped prisoners of war were to be handed over to the police. Is that what you ask the Tribunal to believe?</P>

<P>GOERING: To any offenses or police, I believe gave any order the extent that escaped prisoners of war committed crimes, they were of course turned over to the But I wish to testify before the Court that I never that they should be handed over to the police or sent to concentration camps merely because they had attempted to break out or escape, nor did I ever know that such measures, were taken.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: This is my last question: I want to make it quite clear, Witness, that I am referring to those who had escaped, who had got away from the confines of the camp and were recaptured by the police. Didn't you know that they were handed over to the police?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. Only if they had committed crimes while fleeing, such as murder and so on. Such things occurred.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Morning Session</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Witness, do you remember telling me last night that the only prisoners of war handed over to the police were those guilty of crimes or misdemeanors?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not express myself that way. I said if the police apprehended prisoners of war, those who had committed a crime during the escape, as far as I know, were detained by the police and were not returned to the camp. To what extent the police kept prisoners of war, without returning them to a camp I was able to gather from interrogations and explanations here.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Would you look at Document D-569? Would you look first at the top left-hand corner, which shows that it is a document published by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht?</P>

<P>GOERING: The document which I have before me has the following heading at the top left-hand corner: "The Reichsfuehrer SS," and the subheading: "Inspector of Concentration Camps."</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It is a document dated the 11/22/1941. Have you got it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have it now.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, look at the left-hand bottom corner, as to distribution. The second person to whom it is distributed is the Air Ministry and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force on 11/22/1941. That would be you.</P>

<P>GOERING: That's correct. I would like to make the following statement in connection with this...</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Just for a moment. I would like you to appreciate the document and then make your statement upon it. I shall not stop you. I want you to look at the third sentence in Paragraph 1. This deals with Soviet prisoners of war, you understand. The third sentence says:</P>

<P>"If escaped Soviet prisoners of war are returned to the camp in accordance with this order, they have to be handed over to the nearest post of the Secret State Police, in any case."</P>

<P>And then Paragraph 2 deals with the special position-if they commit crimes, owing to the fact that:</P>

<P>"...at present these misdemeanors on the part of Soviet prisoners of war are particularly frequent, due most likely to living conditions still being somewhat unsettled, the following temporary regulations come into force. They may be amended later. If a Soviet prisoner of war commits any other punishable offense then the commandant of the camp must hand the guilty man over to the head of the Security Police."</P>

<P>Do I understand this document to say that a man who escapes will be handed over to the Security Police? You understand this document says a man who escapes will be handed over to the Secret ice, a man who commits a crime, as you mentioned, will be headed over to the Security Police. Wasn't that the condition obtained from 1941 up to the date we are dealing with in 3/1944?</P>

<P>GOERING: I would like to read the few preceding paragraphs that no sentences are separated from their context.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, while the witness is reading the document, might I go over the technical matter of the arrangement of exhibits? When I cross-examined Field Marshal Slecking I put in three documents, UK-66, which becomes Exhibit 274, D-39, which becomes GB-275; TC-91, which becomes GB-276; This document will become GB-277. [Turning to the witness.] Have you had an opportunity of reading it, Witness?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Then I am right, am I not, that Soviet prisoners of war who escaped were to be, after their return to the camp, handed over to the Secret State Police. If they committed a crime, they were to be handed over to the Security Police, isn't that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not exactly correct. I would like to point to the third sentence in the first paragraph. There it says, "If a prisoner-of-war is in the vicinity, then the man who is recaptured is to be transported there."</P>

<P>; SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But read the next sentence, "If a Soviet prisoner of war is returned to the camp"-that is in accordance with this order which you have just read-"he has to be handed to the nearest service station of the Secret State Police." Your own sentence.</P>

<P>GOERING Yes, but the second paragraph which follows gives an explanation of frequent criminal acts of Soviet prisoners of war, ft cetera committed at that time. You read that yourself; that is o connected with this Paragraph Number 1. But this order was given by itself and it was distributed to the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. And I would like to give the explanation of its distribution. In this war there were not only hundreds, but thousands of current orders which were issued by superiors to subordinate officers and were transmitted to various departments. That does not mean that each of these thousands of orders was submitted to the Commander-in-Chief; only the most decisive and most important were shown to him. The others went from department to department. Thus it is that this order from the Chief of the High Command was signed by a subordinate department, and not by the Chief of the High Command himself.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: This order would be dealt with by your prisoner-of-war department in your ministry, wouldn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: This department, according to the procedure adopted for these orders, received the order, but no other department received it.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think the answer to my question must be "yes." It would be dealt with by the prisoner-of-war department- your ministry. Isn't that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: I would say yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It is quicker, you see, if you say "yes" in the beginning; do you understand?</P>

<P>GOERING: No; it depends upon whether I personally have read the order or not, and I will then determine as to my responsibility.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, the escape...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You were not asked about responsibility; you were asked whether it would be dealt with by your prisoner-of-war department.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, the escape about which I am asking you took place on the night of the 24th to the 25th of March. I want you to have that date in mind. The decision to murder these young officers must have been taken very quickly, because the first murder which actually took place was on the 26th of March. Do you agree with that? It must have been taken quickly?</P>

<P>GOERING: I assume that this order, as I was informed later, was given immediately, but it had no connection with this document.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, no; we are finished with that document; we are going into the murder of these young men The Grossfahndung-a general hue and cry, I think, would be the British translation-was also issued at once in order that these men should be arrested; isn't that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. Whenever there was an escape, and such a large number of prisoners escaped, automatically in the whole Reich, a hue and cry was raised, that is, all authorities had to be on the lookout to recapture the prisoners.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So that in order to give this order to murder these men, and for the Grossfahndung, there must have been a meeting of Hitler, at any rate with Himmler or Kaltenbrunner, in order that that order would be put into effect; isn't that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct. According to what I heard, Himmler was the first to report this escape to the Fuehrer.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, General Westhoff, who vas in Defendant Keitel's Kriegsgefangenenwesen, in his prisoner-of-war set-up, says this, that "On a date, which I think was the 26th, Keitel said to him, 'This morning Goering reproached me in the presence of Himmler for having let some more prisoners of war escape. It was unheard of.'"</P>

<P>Do you say that General Westhoff is wrong?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. This is not in accordance with the facts. General Westhoff is referring to a statement of Field Marshal Keitel. This utterance in itself is illogical, for I could not accuse Keitel because he would not draw my attention to it, as the guarding was his responsibility and not mine.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: One of the Defendant Keitel's officers dealing with this matter was a general inspector, General Rottich. I do not know if you know him.</P>

<P>GOERING: No.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, General Westhoff, as one could understand, is very anxious to assure everyone that his senior officer had nothing to do with it, and he goes on to say this about General Rottich:</P>

<P>"He was completely excluded from it by the fact that these matters were taken out of his hands. Apparently at that conference with the Fuehrer in the morning, that is to say, the conference between Himmler, Field Marshal Keitel, and Goering, which took place in the Fuehrer's presence, the Fuehrer himself always took a hand in these affairs when officers escaped."</P>

<P>You say that is wrong? You were at no such conference?</P>

<P>GOERING: I was not present at this conference, neither was General Westhoff; he is giving a purely subjective view, not the facts of the case.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So that we find that-you think that-Westhoff is wrong? You see, Westhoff, he was a colonel at this time, I think, and now he finishes as a major general, and he asks that the senior officers be asked about it; he says this: "It should be possible to find out that Himmler made the suggestion to the Fuehrer-to find that out from Goering who was present at the conference." Again and again Westhoff, who after all is a comparatively junior officer, is saying that the truth about this matter can be discovered from his seniors. You say that it cannot.</P>

<P>GOERING: I would not say that. I would like just to say that General Westhoff was never present for even a moment, therefore he cannot say, I know or I saw that Reich Marshal Goering was present. He is assuming it is so, or he may have heard it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What he says is, you know, that Keitel blamed him, as I have read to you; that Keitel went on to say to him at General Von Graevenitz', "Gentlemen, the escapes must stop. We must set an example. We shall take very severe measures. I am only telling you that, that the men who have escaped will be shot; probably the majority of them are dead already." You never heard anything of that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I was neither present at the Keitel-Westhoff-Graevenitz conversation nor at the Fuehrer-Himmler conversation. As far as I know General Westhoff will be testifying here. Moreover, Field Marshal Keitel will be able to say whether I was there or not. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well then, I am bound to put this to you. I come on to your own ministry. I suppose in general you take responsibility for the actions of the officers of your ministry from the rank of field officer and above-colonels and major generals and lieutenant generals?</P>

<P>GOERING: If they acted according to my directives and my instructions, yes; if they acted against my directives and instructions, no.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just let us see what happened in your own ministry. You know that-do you know, that Colonel Walde made a personal investigation of this matter at the camp? Did you know that?</P>

<P>GOERING: The particulars about this investigation, as I explained yesterday, are unknown to me; I know only that investigations did take place.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, on the 27th of March, that was a Monday, did you know that there was a meeting in Berlin about this matter? Just let me tell you who were there before you apply your mind to it, so you will know. Your ministry was represented by Colonel Walde, because Lieutenant General Grosch had another meeting, so he ordered his deputy to attend; the Defendant Keitel's organization was represented by Colonel on Reurmont; the Gestapo was represented by Gruppenfuehrer Muller; the Kripo was represented by Gruppenfuehrer Nebe. Now, all these officers were of course not on the policy level, but they were high executive officers who had to deal with the actual facts that were carried out, were they not?</P>

<P>GOERING: They were not executive officers, insofar as it has not been definitely established that executive powers are within an officer's province. To the first question, whether I knew about this meeting, I would say no. Colonel Walde I do not even know personally.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You mean to say, you are telling the Tribunal, that you were never told about this meeting at any time?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I am saying that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I just want you to look at-let him have Walde's statement-I want you to look at the statement of one of the officers of your own ministry on this point. This is a statement made by Colonel Ernst Walde, and-I am sorry I have not another German copy, but I will get one in due course-and in my copy, Witness, it is at the foot of Page 2, the beginning of the paragraph which I want you to look at, is: "As recaptured prisoners were not to be taken back to their camp, according to an order issued several weeks previously..."can you find it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Where is it?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, in the English version it is at the middle of the second page, and I want to ask you about the-the middle of that paragraph; I do not know if you see a name-it stands out in my copy-Major Dr. Huhnemorder; do you see that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have found it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, it is the sentence after the name Major Dr. Huhnemorder appears: "On this Monday"- have you got this?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Thank you.</P>

<P>"On this Monday a conference took place at the Reich Security Main Office at Berlin, Albrechtstrasse. As far as I remember this conference had been called by the Chief of the Prisoner-of-War Organization OKW, and I attended as representative of Luftwaffe Inspection 17, since General Grosch was unable to attend in person, for reasons which I cannot remember; the Chief of the Prisoner-of-War Organization, as far as I know, was represented by Colonel Von Reurmont, while the Security Office was represented by Gruppenfuehrer Muller and Gruppenfuehrer Nebe, the Chief of the Criminal Police at that time. I find it impossible to give a verbatim account of the conversation or to state what was said by every single person. But I remember this much: That we were informed about a conference which had taken place on the previous day, that is Sunday, at the Fuehrer's headquarters in connection with the mass escape from Sagan, in the course of which heated discussions had taken place between the participants. In this connection the names of Himmler, Goering, and Keitel were mentioned. Whether Ribbentrop's name was also mentioned I do not remember. The Fuehrer was not mentioned. At this conference appropriate measures were said to have been discussed, or taken, to check any such mass escapes in the future. The nature of these measures was not disclosed. Later, and more or less in conclusion, Gruppenfuehrer Muller declared that requisite orders had already been given and put into effect the previous morning. Regarding the search for escaped prisoners, he could or would not make any statement; he merely declared that according to reports so far received, shootings had taken place at some points for attempted escapes. I think he said that the number was 10 or 15.</P>

<P>"After these remarks by Gruppenfuehrer Muller, which unmistakably caused a shattering effect, it became clear to me that a decision had been made by the highest authority, and that therefore any intervention by subordinate departments was impossible and pointless."</P>

<P>Now, this was announced at a meeting of persons that I would call executives, that the shooting had already begun. Are you telling this Tribunal that this matter was made clear to these executives, including one of your own officers, and was never told to you? Are you still saying that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am still saying that. Firstly, that I have never heard anything about this conference. Secondly, that the officer in question is only surmising when he mentions the names, he makes no assertion. And thirdly, I would like to ask you also to mention the beginning of this statement, which begins as follows:</P>

<P>"In this matter of the mass escape of British Air Force officers from Prisoner-of-War Camp Number III, at Sagan on 3/24-25/1944, I make the following statement:</P>

<P>"I have to point out that in view of the absence of any documents, I am forced to reconstruct completely from memory events which happened almost a year and 9 months ago; I therefore ask that this fact and the possibility thus arising of my making a mistake be taken into consideration, and that de allowances be made."</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is a perfectly fair point, and the answer to it is that I will show you what this officer reported at the time to his general.</P>

<P>Give the witness General Grosch's statement.</P>

<P>[The document was submitted to the witness.] We are getting reasonably high up. This officer, General Grosch, signs it as a Lieutenant General. Now, would you like, if you can, to help me again-you were most helpful last time-to try to find the place? This is a statement by Lieutenant General Grosch.</P>

<P>GOERING: I request to have permission to read this document first, to see whether similar modifications apply here also.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Will you read the first sentence? I do not want to take up time to read an account of the general matter. It says: During my interrogation on 12/7/1945 I was told to write down all I knew about the Sagan case." And then he wrote it down. But I would like you to look at Number 1, the first page. Do you see at the foot of the page an account of the pyramid in your ministry of administration? Do you see that at the foot of Page 1?</P>

<P>[There was no response.] [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Witness, do you see at the foot of Page 1 the pyramid?</P>

<P>GOERING: I see it but-I am now at the place.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It comes in about the fourth paragraph.</P>

<P>GOERING: I can see it, but I should like to read the other first.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Then, if you will look about four small paragraphs on, it begins: "A few days after the day of the escape-I cannot remember the date any more-Colonel Walde informed me that OKW had called a conference in Berlin."</P>

<P>Do you see that?</P>

<P>I do not mind you running through it quickly, but you may take it that the first two pages are what I said were there, the pyramid of your ministry.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have found it. Which paragraph, please?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It is Part C, the fourth paragraph, the Sagan case. "A few days after the escape...." Do you find that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, I have the place.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Thank you.</P>

<P>"A few days after the day of the escape-I cannot remember the date any more-Colonel Walde informed me that the OKW had called a conference in Berlin- I believe on the premises of a high SS and police authority, and that the lnspectorate Number 17 was to send representatives. I should have liked to have gone myself, but had to attend another conference in Berlin, and asked Colonel Walde to attend as representative. After his return Colonel Walde informed me that the spokesman of the OKW had informed them that there was a decision by the Fuehrer to the effect that, on recapture, the escaped British airmen were not to be handed back to the Luftwaffe but were to be shot."</P>

<P>Then missing a paragraph and taking the last line of the next paragraph:</P>

<P>"It is, however, certain that the danger of their being shot was even then clearly recognizable I asked Colonel Walde whether such a far-reaching decision would be notified in writing to the High Command of the Luftwaffe or the Reich Air Ministry or whether he had been given anything in writing. Colonel Walde gave me to understand that the assembly were told by the spokesman of the OKW, that they would receive nothing in writing, nor was there to be any correspondence on this subject. The circle of those in the know was to be kept as small as possible. I asked Colonel Walde whether the spokesman of the OKW had said anything to the effect that the Reich Marshal or the High Command of the Luftwaffe had been informed about the matter. Colonel Walde assured me that the OKW spokesman had told them that the Reich Marshal was informed."</P>

<P>I will not ask you about that for the moment. I want you to look at what your general did. It says:</P>

<P>"Up to the time of Colonel Walde's report I had not received even so much as a hint anywhere that escaped prisoners of war should be treated in any other way than according to the provisions of the Geneva Convention.</P>

<P>"The same afternoon I rang up my superior officer, the Chief of Air Defense, to ask time for an interview with General der Flieger Forster. This was fixed for the next morning.</P>

<P>"When I came there to report I found General Forster together with his chief of staff. I asked General Forster for permission to speak to him alone and put the facts before him. In conclusion, I expressed the opinion that if the British airmen were to be shot, (a) there would be a breach of the Geneva Convention, (b) reprisal measures endangering the lives of German airmen held by the British as prisoners of war would have to be expected. I asked General Forster to bring the matter to the notice of the Reich Marshal even at this very late stage, and to stress those two points.</P>

<P>"General Forster was immediately prepared to do this. When it came to the choice of the way in which the matter could be brought to the attention of the Reich Marshal, it was decided to report to State Secretary Field Marshal Milch.</P>

<P>"In my presence General Forster rang up the office of the state secretary and obtained the interview at once. General Forster left the room, and while doing so he instructed me to wait for his return in his study. After some time General Forster came back and told me that he had reported the matter to the state secretary and that Field Marshal Milch had made the necessary notes."</P>

<P>Look at the last paragraph:</P>

<P>"I gave Colonel Walde the order, despite the ban by the OKW, to incorporate a detailed written statement about the conference in our records. So far as I know, this was done."</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Counsel Stahmer on behalf of the Defendant Goering.</P>

<P>We have had submitted here a series of affidavits given by witnesses who are in Nuremberg and who, in my opinion, could be brought as witnesses in person. Because of the importance of this matter, not only for Goering but for other defendants, I object to this procedure, on the assumption that the same rules apply for cross-examination as examination in chief. By that I mean that we should not be satisfied with an affidavit and depend on an affidavit, if the Prosecution can, without difficulty, summon the witness in order to have him testify before the Tribunal, so that the Defense may be in position to cross-examine these witnesses.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, what you have said is entirely inaccurate. The rules with reference to cross-examination are not the same as rules with reference to examination in chief, and what is being done at the present moment is that the Defendant Goering is being cross-examined as to his credit. He has said that he knew nothing about this matter, and he has been cross-examined to prove that he has lied when he said that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, according to my opinion the procedure should be that the witness be brought here in person The fact remains that, in our estimation, a reference to an affidavit Is a less desirable means than the personal testimony of a witness which affords the Defense the possibility of adducing evidence.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, as I have already pointed out to you, you are quite in error in thinking that the rules for cross examination are the same as for examination in chief. The witness at the present moment is being cross-examined and is being cross examined as to credit; that is to say, to prove whether or not he is telling the truth.</P>

<P>As to the calling of this witness-I think his name is Grosch you can apply to call him if you want to do so. That is an entirely different matter. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes. I quite understand, Mr. President; but I had to have the possibility of calling the people who are mentioned in this affidavit, in case I consider it necessary.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you can apply to do that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: [Turning to the witness.] You understand, what I am suggesting to you is that here was a matter which was not only known in the OKW, not only known in the Gestapo and the Kripo, but was known to your own director of operations, General Forster, who told General Grosch that he had informed Field Marshal Milch. I am suggesting to you, that it is absolutely impossible and untrue that in these circumstances you knew nothing about it.</P>

<P>GOERING: I would like first to establish an entirely different point. In the German interpretation regarding the first objection by Dr. Stahmer, the following came through:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The Tribunal does not want you to discuss legal objections.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you please answer the question that is put to you? You have already been told that you must answer a question directly and make any explanation afterwards, and shorten it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you still say, in view of that evidence, in view of these statements from the officers of your own ministry, that you knew nothing about this?</P>

<P>GOERING: Precisely these statements confirm this, and I would like to make a short explanation. You determined a date. You said it was the 27th. But in this statement by Grosch this date is not determined. It says: "A few days after the escape, I do not recall the date, Colonel Walde informed me."</P>

<P>Secondly, it says here that General Forster, who was not chief of my operational branch but chief of another branch of the ministry mentioned this matter to State Secretary Field Marshal Milch, without referring to the date. General Field Marshal Milch was here as a witness, but unfortunately, he was never questioned as to whether he gave me this report, and at what time, and whether to me direct.</P>

<P>SIR David MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh yes, he was, and General Field Marshal Milch took the same line as you, that he knew nothing about it, that Forster had never spoken to him. It was asked by my friend, Mr. Roberts, "Didn't General Forster speak to you about it?"</P>

<P>What I am suggesting is that both you and Field Marshal Milch are saying you knew nothing about it, when you did, and are leaving the responsibility on the shoulders of your junior officers. That is what I am suggesting and I want you to understand it.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I do not wish to push responsibility on to the shoulders of my subordinates, and I want to make it clear-that is the only thing that is important to me- that Field Marshal Milch, did not say that he reported this matter to me. And, secondly, that the date when Forster told Milch about this is not established. It could have been quite possible that on the date when this actually happened, the Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe might already have conferred with me about it. The important factor is-and I want to maintain it-that I was not present at the time when the command was given by the Fuehrer. When I heard about it, I vehemently opposed it. But at the time I heard of it, it was already too late. That a few were shot later, was not yet known at the time, neither was the exact time of the event. Most of them had been shot already.</P>

<P>Thirdly, those who escaped, and were captured in the direct vicinity of the camp by our guards were returned to the camp and were not handed over. Those prisoners who were captured by the police and the Grossfahndung, and returned to the camp before the Fuehrer had issued the decree, were likewise not handed over and shot.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You know that, according to Wielen, who is going to give evidence, the selection of the officers to be shot-a list as regards the selection of officers to be shot-a list had been prepared by the camp authorities at the request of Department 5, that is of the RSHA Kripo Department, in which those officers were regarded as disturbing elements-plotters and escape leaders, having been specifically mentioned. The names were selected either by the commandant or by one of these officers. Thereupon, the shooting of the officers mentioned by name was accordingly ordered by Department 4 of the RSHA and corresponding instructions sent to the Staatspolizei.</P>

<P>Are you telling the Tribunal you did not know that your own officers were selecting the men to be shot on the ground that they were plotters and escape leaders? In any other service in the world, attempt to escape is regarded as a duty of an officer, isn't it, when he is a prisoner of war? Isn't that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct, and I have emphasized that. To your first question, I would like to put on record very definitely that we are dealing with the utterances of a man who will be testifying as a witness. As to whether he actually asked for a list and saw a list, his utterance is illogical. There was no selection made for shooting. Those who were captured by the police were shot without exception, and those who had not been returned to the camp. No officers were selected as representing disturbing elements, but those who had returned to the camp were not shot. Those who were recaptured by the police outside the camp were shot without exception, on the orders of the Fuehrer. Therefore, the utterance is entirely illogical and not in accordance with the facts.</P>

<P>I know nothing about such a list being asked for, nor about the carrying out of such a wish. I personally pointed out to the Fuehrer repeatedly that it is the duty of these officers to escape, and that on their return after the war, they would have to give an account of such attempts, which as far as I can remember should be repeated three times, according to English rules.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You remember that the Government of Germany sent an official note about this matter, saying that they had been shot while resisting arrest while trying to escape? Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I heard for the first time that there had been a note to this effect when the reply to it was sent. I had no part in the drawing up of the note. I know of its contents only through the reply, for I happened to be there when the reply came in.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am not at the moment on the point that everyone now admits that the note was a complete and utter lie. I am on the point of the seriousness of this matter. Do you know that General Westhoff says in his statement: "Then, when we read this note to England in the newspaper, we were all absolutely taken aback. We all clutched our heads, mad." According to Mr. Wielen, who will be here, it was a contributory cause for General Nebe of the Kripo, for nights on end, not going to bed but passing the night on his office settee. You will agree, won't you, Witness, that this was a serious and difficult matter' All these officers that had to deal with it found it a serious and difficult matter, isn't that so?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not only these officers found this matter serious and difficult, but I myself considered it the most serious incident of the whole war and expressed myself unequivocally and clearly on this point, and later, when I learned the contents of the note, I knew that this note was not in accordance with the truth. I gave expression to my indignation, inasmuch as I immediately told my Quartermaster General to direct a letter to the OKW to the effect that we wished to give up the camps for prisoners of war, because under these circumstances, we no longer wished to have anything to do with them.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And according to your evidence in chief, what you did was to turn to Himmler, asking him if he had received the order, and then you said,</P>

<P>"I told him what excitement would result in my branch, because we could not understand such measures; and if he had received such orders, he would please inform me before carrying them through so that I would have the possibility to prevent such orders from being carried out, if possible"- and then you said that you- "talked to the Fuehrer and that he confirmed that he had given the order and told me why."</P>

<P>You, according to that evidence, still had enough influence in Germany, in your opinion, to stop even Himmler issuing such orders or carrying-I am sorry, I said "issuing"-carrying out such orders.</P>

<P>GOERING: You are giving my statement a completely wrong meaning. I told Himmler plainly that it was his duty to telephone me before the execution of this matter, to give me the possibility, even at this period of my much diminished influence, to prevent the Fuehrer from carrying out this decree. I did not mean to say that I would have been completely successful, but it was a matter of course that I, as Chief of the Luftwaffe, should make it clear to Himmler that it was his duty to telephone me first of all, because it was I who was most concerned with this matter. I told the Fuehrer in very clear terms just how I felt, and I saw from his answers that, even if I had known of it before, I could not have prevented this decree, and we must keep in mind that two different methods of procedure are in question. The order was not given to the Luftwaffe, that these people were to be shot by the Luftwaffe personnel, but to the police. If the Fuehrer had said to me, "I will persist in this decree which I gave the police." I would not have been able to order the police not to carry through the Fuehrer's decree. Only if this decree had had to be carried out by my men, would it have been possible for me perhaps to circumvent the decree, and I would like to emphasize this point strongly. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, that may be your view that you could not have got anywhere with the Fuehrer; but I suggested to you that when all these officers that I mentioned knew about lt, you knew about it, and that you did nothing to prevent these men from being shot, but co-operated in this foul series of murders.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, are you passing from that now?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You are putting in evidence these two documents?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am putting them in. I put them to the witness. D-731 will be GB-278, and D-730 will be.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: And should you not refer perhaps to the second paragraph in 731?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: It shows that apparently, in the early hours of the 25th of March the matter was communicated to the office of the adjutant of the Reich Marshal-the second paragraph beginning with "the escape."</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.</P>

<P>"The escape of about 30 to 40 prisoners, the exact number having to be ascertained by roll call, was reported by telephone from the Sagan Camp to the inspectorate in the early hours of the 25th of March, Saturday morning, and duly passed on in the same way by this office to the higher authorities which were to be informed in case of mass escapes. These were: 1.) the Office of the Adjutant of the Reich Marshal; 2.) the OKW, for directors of these prisoners of war; 3.) the Inspector General of Prisoners of War, and 4.) Director of Operations, Air Ministry."</P>

<P>I am much obliged. You must remember that the witness did not admit yesterday afternoon that the news of the escape had been given to the office of his adjutant.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am much obliged to you.</P>

<P>GOERING: The escape was communicated to us every time relatively quickly. I should now like to give my view of the statement made by you before that-it concerns assertions made by you-but I still maintain that I did not hear about this incident until after it had occurred.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I have put my questions on the incident. I pass to another point. I want to ask you two or three questions about the evidence that you gave 2 days ago leading with the evidence of your own witness, Herr Dahlerus, who made his first visit to London on the 8/25/1939, after an interview and a telephone conversation with you on the 24th. I just want you to fix the date because it is sometimes difficult to remember what these dates are. At that time, you were anxious that he should persuade the British Government to arrange a meeting of plenipotentiaries who would deal with the questions of Danzig and the Corridor. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You knew perfectly well, did you not, that as far as the Fuehrer was concerned, Danzig and the Corridor was not the real matter that was operating in his mind at all. Will you let me remind you what he said on the 23rd of May: "Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all; it is a question of expanding our living space in the East, of securing our food supplies, and of the settlement of the Baltic problem." You knew that, didn't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: I knew that he had said these things at that time, but I have already pointed out repeatedly that such discussions can only be assessed, if considered in conjunction with the whole political situation. At the moment of these negotiations with England, we were solely concerned with Danzig and the Corridor.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, you say that despite what Hitler said on the 23rd of May, that at that moment Hitler was only concerned with Danzig and the Corridor? Do you say that seriously?</P>

<P>GOERING: I maintain in all seriousness that, in the situation as it was at that time, this was really the case. Otherwise it would be impossible to understand any of Hitler's acts. You might just as well take his book Mein Kampf as a basis and explain all his acts by it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am interested in the last week of August at the moment. I want you now just to remember two points on what you said, with regard to Dahlerus, during the morning of the 25th. Do you remember, you had a telephone conversation with him at 11:30 on the 2th? On the 25th, were you sufficiently in Hitler's confidence to know that he was going to proffer the note verbal to Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador, on the 25th? Did you know that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: At that time, when you were sending Dahlerus, and the note verbal was being given to the British Ambassador, the arrangement and order was that you were going to attack Poland on the morning of the 26th, wasn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: There seems to be a disturbance on the line. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I think there is some mechanical difficulty. Perhaps it would be a good thing to adjourn for a few minutes.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You told me, Witness, that the arrangements to attack Poland on the morning of the 26th were changed on the evening of the 25th. Before I come to that, I will ask you one or two questions about that.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I did not say that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Wait a minute. I am sorry, but that is what I understood you to say.</P>

<P>GOERING: No. I said explicitly that already on the 25th the attack for the morning of the 26th was cancelled. It is a technical and military impossibility to cancel a large-scale attack of a whole army the evening before an attack. The shortest time required would be from 24 hours to 48 hours.</P>

<P>I expressly mentioned that on the 25th the situation was clear.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: At the time, you had asked Dahlerus to go to England on the 24th. It was still the plan that the attack would take place on the 26th. Was not your object ln sending Dahlerus to have the British Government discussing their next move when the attack took place, in order to make it more difficult for the British Government?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I want to emphasize that-and perhaps I should have the documents for the date-that when I sent Dahlerus at that time, and when at that moment Sir Nevile had been handed a note on behalf of the Fuehrer, the attack for the 26th had been cancelled and postponed.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Let me remind you of what you said yourself on the 29th of August:</P>

<P>"On the day when England gave her official guarantee to Poland, it was 5:30 on 25 August, the Fuehrer called me on the telephone and told me he had stopped the planned invasion of Poland. I asked him then whether it was just temporary or for good. He said, 'No, I will have to see whether we can eliminate British intervention.' I asked him, 'Do you think that it will be definite within 4 or 5 days?'"</P>

<P>Isn't that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: 'That was what I said, but I did not say that this occurred on the 25th, but when the Fuehrer was clear about the guarantee that was given. I emphasize that once more...</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That was what I was quoting to you. When the official guarantee was given, the treaty was signed at 5:30 on the evening of the 25th of August. 1 am putting your own words to you. It was after that the Fuehrer telephoned you and told you the invasion was off. Do you wish to withdraw your statement that it was after the official guarantee was given to Poland?</P>

<P>GOERING: I emphasized once more-after we knew that the guarantee would be given. It must be clear to you too that if the signing took place at 5:30 p.m. on the 25th, the Fuehrer could know about it only shortly afterwards. Not till then would the Fuehrer have called a conference, and in that case an attack for the 26th could have been called off only during the night of the 25th to 26th. Every military expert must know that that is an absolute impossibility. I meant to say in my statement, ". . . when it was clear to the Fuehrer that a guarantee was given."</P>

<P>I emphasize once more that I have not seen this record nor sworn to it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I admit that I do not know anything about that. I do not know whether you were still in Hitler's confidence at the time or not. But, wasn't it a fact that Signor Attolico came on the 25th and told Hitler that the Italian Army and Air Force were not ready for a campaign? Were you told that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course I was told that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That was why the orders for the attack were cancelled on the 26th, wasn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is absolutely wrong, because when the question of Italian assistance came up, the fact was that its value was doubted in many quarters. During the tension of the preceding days it became evident that the demands made by the Italians which could not be fulfilled by us were formulated in order to keep Italy out of the war. The Fuehrer was convinced that England had only given such a clear-cut guarantee to Poland, because in the meantime the British Government had learned that it was not the intention of Italy to come into the war as a partner of the Axis.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I will put to you your own account of what the Fuehrer said. "I will have to see whether we can eliminate British intervention." Isn't it correct that you tried, through Mr. Dahlerus, in every way, to try and eliminate British intervention?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have never denied that. It was my whole endeavor to avoid war with England. If it had been possible to avoid this war by coming to an agreement with Poland, then that would have been accepted. If the war with England could have been avoided in spite of a war with Poland, then that was my task also. This is clear from the fact that, even after the Polish campaign had started on 9/1/1939 I still made every attempt to avoid a war with England and to keep the war from spreading.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: In other words, what you were trying to do from the 25th onwards was to get England to try and agree and help the Reich in the return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, wasn't that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That, of course, is quite clearly expressed. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, you remember the interview with Mr. Dahlerus. It was the interview in which you colored the portions on the map. I only want you to have it in your mind. If I say 11:30 on the 29th of August it will not mean anything to you. I want you to see it so that I can ask you one or two questions about it.</P>

<P>You remember, at that time, that you were upset at the interview which had taken place when Hitler handed Henderson the German reply, and there had been the remark about the ultimatum. Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course I was upset, since that had suddenly completely disturbed my whole position.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And is this correct? Mr. Dahlerus says on Page 72 of his book that you came out with a tirade, strong words against the Poles. Do you remember that he quotes you as saying: "Wir kennen die Polen"? Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, of course. You must consider the situation at the time. I had heard about the excesses and I would not go and tell Dahlerus, a neutral, that I considered Germany wholly guilty and the Poles completely innocent. It is correct that I did say that, but it arose out of a situation.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Are you still an admirer of Bismarck?</P>

<P>GOERING: I admire Bismarck absolutely, but I have never said that I am Bismarck.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, I am not suggesting that. I thought you might have in mind his remark about the Poles. Do you remember: "Haut doch die Polen, dass sie am Leben verzagen" (Let us strike the Poles until they lose the courage to live.) Is that what was in your mind at the time?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I had no such thoughts, still less because for years I had genuinely sought friendship with Poland.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You have been quite frank about your general intention, and I am not going to take time on it, but I just want to put one or two subsidiary points.</P>

<P>You remember the passage that I read from Mr. Dahlerus book about the airplane and the sabotage, that he said that you had said to him, mentioning the Defendant Ribbentrop-you remember that passage? You have given your explanation and I just want to. ...</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, yes, I gave that explanation and I made it quite clear.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, your explanation was that Herr Dahlerus was confusing your concern that his airplane should not be shot down in making his journey. That is putting your explanation fairly, isn't it? You are saying that Herr Dahlerus was confused. What you were saying was your concern that his airplane should not be shot down. Isn't that right? That is as I understood it.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I think I have expressed it very clearly. Would you like me to give it again? I will repeat it.</P>

<P>Dahlerus, who stood in the witness box here, used the words, "I must correct myself," when he was asked about Ribbentrop. I am quoting Dahlerus. He said, "I connected it with Ribbentrop, since shortly beforehand the name was mentioned in some other connection."</P>

<P>Thereupon I explained I was really anxious lest something might happen. I explained that very clearly and I need not repeat it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The question I put to you, Witness-I think we are agreed on it-was that your anxiety was about his plane, and the point that I want to make clear to you now is that that incident did not occur on this day when Dahlerus was preparing for his third visit, but occurred when he was in England and rang you up during his second visit. He rang you up on the evening of the 27th of August, and on Page 59 of his book he says: "Before leaving the Foreign Office, I telephoned Goering to confirm that I was leaving for Berlin by plane at 7:00 p.m. He seemed to think this was rather late. It would be dark and he was worried lest my plane be shot at by the British, or over German territory. He asked me to hold the line, and a minute later came back and gave me a concise description of the route the plane must follow over Germany to avoid being shot at. He also assured me that the anti-aircraft stations along our course would be informed that we were coming."</P>

<P>What I am suggesting to you is that your explanation is wrong, that you have confused it with this earlier incident of which Mr. Dahlerus speaks, and that Mr Dahlerus is perfectly accurate when he speaks about the second incident which occurred 2 days later.</P>

<P>GOERING: That is not at all contradictory. In regard to the first flight the position was that it was already dark, which means that the danger was considerably greater; and I again point out that, in connection with the second journey, preparedness for war in all countries had reached such a degree that flying was hazardous.</P>

<P>I emphasize once more that I had to correct Dahlerus when he was questioned by my counsel, that I lid not tell him that Ribbentrop had planned an attack against him. I emphasize for the last time that Von Ribbentrop knew nothing about my negotiations with Dahlerus.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you really say that? Do you remember that on the 29th of August-first of all, on the 28th of August, at 10:30 p.m., when Henderson and Hitler had an interview. That was before the difficulties arose. It was the interview when Hitler was considering direct negotiations with the Poles. He said, "We must summon Field Marshal Goering to discuss it with him." That is in our Blue Book, and as far as I know it has never been denied. You were summoned to the interview that Hitler and Ribbentrop were having with Sir Nevile Henderson.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I must interrupt you. The Fuehrer said, "We will have to fetch him," but I was not fetched and that is not said in the Blue Book either.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But according to Mr. Dahlerus, he says:</P>

<P>"During our conversation Goering described how he had been summoned to Hitler immediately after Henderson's departure, how Hitler, Goering, and Ribbentrop had discussed the conference that had taken place with Henderson, and how satisfied all three of them were with the result. In this connection Hitler had turned to Ribbentrop and said mockingly, 'Do you still believe that Dahlerus is a British agent?' Somewhat acidly Ribbentrop replied that perhaps it was not the case."</P>

<P>You say that is not true, either? [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>GOERING: Herr Dahlerus is describing the events without having been present. From that description, too, it becomes clear that I arrived after Henderson had already left. The description is a little colorful. Ribbentrop had no idea what I was negotiating with Dahlerus about, and the Fuehrer did not inform him about these negotiations either. He merely knew that I used Dahlerus as a negotiator, and he was of course, opposed to him, because he, as Foreign Minister, was against any other channels being used.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That was exactly the point, you know, that I put to you about 7 minutes ago, that Ribbentrop did know you were using Dahlerus, with which you disagreed. You now agree that he knew you were using Dahlerus, so I will leave it.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, I beg your pardon. I still say-please do not distort my words-that Ribbentrop did not know what I was negotiating with Dahlerus about, and that he had not even heard of it through the Fuehrer.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You said "distort my words." I especially did not say to you that he knew what you were negotiating about. I said to you that he knew you were using Dahlerus, and that, you agree, is right. I limited it to that, didn't I? And that is right, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: He did not know either that I was carrying on negotiations with England through Dahlerus at that time. He did not know about the flights either.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, I want you just to help me on one or two other matters.</P>

<P>You remember that in 1/1937, and in 10/1937, the German Government gave the strongest assurances as to the inviolability and neutrality of Belgium and Holland. Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not remember it in detail, but it has been mentioned here in Court.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And do you remember that on the 8/25/1938 the Air Staff put in a memorandum on the assumption that France and Great Britain-oh no, that France would declare war during the case of Fall Grun, and that Great Britain would come in? Do you remember that? It is Document Number 375-PS, Exhibit Number USA-84. I want you to have it generally in mind because I am going to put a passage to you.</P>

<P>GOERING: May I ask whether the signature is Wolte? W-o-l-t-e-r?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I shall let you know. Yes, that is right.</P>

<P>GOERING: In that case I remember the document exactly. It has been given to me here.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is right. I only want to recall your recollection to one sentence:</P>

<P>"Belgium and the Netherlands in German hands represent an extraordinary advantage in the prosecution of the air war against Great Britain as well as against France. Therefore, it is held to be essential to obtain the opinion of the Army as to the conditions under which an occupation of this area could be carried out, and how long it would take."</P>

<P>Do you remember that? It is pretty obvious air strategy, but you remember it?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is absolutely correct. That was the principal work of a captain of the General Staff, 5th Department, who, naturally when making his report, must propound the best arguments.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Then, after that, on the 4/28/1939, you remember that Hitler said that he had given binding declarations to a number of states, and this applied to Holland and Belgium? I think that was the time when he made a speech in the Reichstag and mentioned a number of small states as well as that but he said it included Holland and Belgium.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. It has, of course been mentioned repeatedly here.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes. Now, do you remember that on the 23rd of May, in the document that I have already put to you at the meeting at the Reich Chancellery, Hitler said this: "The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed force. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored."</P>

<P>Do you remember his saying that?</P>

<P>GOERING: It says so in the document, yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And, on The 8/22/1939, in the speech to the Commanders-in-chief, which is Document Number 798-PS, Exhibit Number USA-29, he said:</P>

<P>"Another possibility is the violation of Dutch, Belgian, and Swiss neutrality. I have no doubt that all these states, as well as Scandinavia, will defend their neutrality by all available means. England and France will not violate the neutrality of these countries."</P>

<P>Do you remember his saying that?</P>

<P>GOERING: You can see for yourself from those words how often the Fuehrer changed his ideas, so that even the plan he had in May was not at all final. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: They are perfectly consistent in my estimation. He is saying that they must be occupied; that declarations of neutrality must be ignored, and he is emphasizing that by saying that England and France will not violate the neutrality, so it is perfectly easy for Germany to do it.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, what he means to say is that we on our part would not find it necessary to do so either. I merely want to point out that political situations always turn out to be different, and that at these interrogations and this Trial we must regard the political background of the world as a whole.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That was on the 22d. You have agreed as to what was said. Immediately after that, on the 26th, 4 days later, Hitler gave another assurance. Do you remember that, just before the war he gave another assurance?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And on the 10/6/1939, he gave a further assurance, and on the 7th of October, the day after that last assurance, the order, which is Document Number 2329-PS, Exhibit GB-105, was issued.</P>

<P>"Army Group B has to make all preparations according to special orders for immediate invasion of Dutch and Belgian territory, if the political situation so demands."</P>

<P>And on the 9th of October, there is a directive from Hitler:</P>

<P>"Preparations should be made for offensive action on the northern flank of the Western Front crossing the area of Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland. This attack must be carried out as soon and as forcibly as possible."</P>

<P>Isn't it quite clear from that, that all along you knew, as Hitler stated on the 22d of August, that England and France would not violate the neutrality of the low countries, and you were prepared to violate them whenever it suited your strategical and tactical interests? Isn't that quite clear?</P>

<P>GOERING: Not entirely. Only if the political situation made it necessary. And in the meantime the British air penetration of the neutrality of Holland and Belgium had taken place, up to October.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You say not entirely. That is as near agreement with me as you are probably prepared to go.</P>

<P>Now I want to ask you quite shortly again about Yugoslavia. You remember that you have told us in your evidence in chief that Germany before the war, before the beginning of the war, had the very best relations with the Yugoslav people, and that you yourself had contributed to it. I am putting lt quite shortly.</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And that was emphasized, if you will remember, on 6/1/1939 a speech of Hitler at a dinner with Prince Paul.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, 80 days after that, on the 8/12/1939, the Defendant Ribbentrop, Hitler, and Ciano had a meeting, and just let me recall to you what Hitler said at that meeting to Count Ciano.</P>

<P>"Generally speaking..."</P>

<P>GOERING: I beg your pardon, what is the number of the document?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am sorry, it was my fault- Document Number TC-77, Exhibit Number GB-48. It is the memorandum of a conversation between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Ciano at Obersalzberg on the 12th of August.</P>

<P>GOERING: I merely wanted to know if this was from Ciano's diary? That is important for me.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh no, not from Ciano's diary, it is a memorandum. This is the official report.</P>

<P>"Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be for uncertain neutrals to be liquidated one after the other. This process could be carried out more easily if on every occasion one partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing with an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a neutral of this kind."</P>

<P>That was rather inconsistent with your statement as to the good intentions towards Yugoslavia, and the Fuehrer's statement to Prince Paul, wasn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: I should like to read that through carefully once more and see in what connection that statement was made. As it is presented now it certainly wouLd not fit in with that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You know I do not want to stop you unnecessarily in any way, but that document has been read at least twice during the Trial and any further matter perhaps you will consider. But you will agree, unless I have wrenched it out of its context-and I hope I have not-that is quite inconsistent with friendly intentions, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: As I said, it does not fit in with that. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, it was 56 days after that, on the 6th of October, Hitler gave an assurance to Yugoslavia and he said:</P>

<P>"Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss I informed Yugoslavia that from now on the frontier with this country would also be an unalterable one and that we only desired to live in peace and friendship with her."</P>

<P>And then again in 3/1941, on the entry of the Tripartite Pact, the German Government announced that it confirmed its determination to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia at all times.</P>

<P>Now, after that of course, as I have always said when you dealt with this, there was the Simovic Putsch in Yugoslavia. But I think you said quite frankly in your evidence, that Hitler and yourself never took the trouble, or thought of taking the trouble, of inquiring whether the Simovic Government would preserve its neutrality or not. That is right, is it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not say that. We were convinced that they were using these declarations to mislead. We knew that this Putscn was first of all directed from Moscow, and, as we learned later, that it had been financially supported to a considerable extent by Britain. From that we recognized the hostile intentions as shown by the mobilization of the Yugoslav Army, which made the matter quite clear, and we did not want to be deceived by the Simovic declarations.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I would like to say one word about the mobilization in a moment. But on the 27th of March, that was 2 days after the signing of the pact I have just referred to there was a conference in Berlin of Hitler with the German High Command, at which you were present, and do you remember the Fuehrer saying:</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer is determined, without waiting for possible loyalty declarations of the new government, to make all preparations to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a national unit. No diplomatic inquiries will be made nor ultimatums presented. Assurances of the Yugoslav Government, which cannot be trusted anyhow in the future, will be taken note of. The attack will start as soon as means and troops suitable for it are ready. Politically it is especially important that the blow against Yugoslavia is carried out with unmerciful harshness and that the military destruction is effected in a lightning-like undertaking. The plan is on the assumption that we speed up schedules of all preparations and use such strong forces that the Yugoslav collapse will take place within the shortest possible time."</P>

<P>It was not a very friendly intention toward Yugoslavia to have no diplomatic negotiations, not give them the chance of assurance or coming to terms with you, and to strike with unmerciful harshness, was it?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have just said that after the Simovic Putsch the situation was completely clear to us, and declarations of neutrality on the part of Yugoslavia could be regarded as only camouflage and deception in order to gain time. After the Putsch, Yugoslavia definitely formed part of the enemy front, and it was therefore for us also to carry out deceptive moves and attack as quickly as possible, since our forces at that time were relatively weak.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You realized, of course, that you said that General Simovic was inspired by Moscow. I am not going to argue that point with you at all. But I do point out to you that this was 3 months before you were at war with the Soviet Union. You realize that, do you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, that is correct. It was precisely the Simovic Putsch which removed the Fuehrer's last doubts that Russia's attitude towards Germany had become hostile. This Putsch was the very reason which caused him to decide to take quickest possible counter measures against this danger. Secondly . . .</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Just one moment. Do you know that it appears in the documents quite clearly, that the attack on the Soviet Union was postponed for 6 weeks because of this trouble in the Balkans? That is quite inconsistent with what you are saying now, isn't it?</P>

<P>GOERING: No. If you will read again my statement on that point, you will see I said that a number of moves on the part of Russia caused the Fuehrer to order preparations for invasion, but that he still withheld the final decision on invasion, and that after the Simovic Putsch this decision was made. From the strategic situation it follows that the military execution of this political decision was delayed by the Yugoslavian campaign.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want to ask you one other point about Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>You remember your evidence that the attack on Belgrade was due to the fact that the war office and a number of other important military organizations were located there. I am trying to summarize it, but that was the effect of your evidence, was it not?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, do you remember how it was put in Hitler's order which I have just been reading to you:</P>

<P>"The main task of the Air Force is to start as early as possible with the destruction of the Yugoslavian Air Force ground installations ..."</P>

<P>Now, I ask you to note the next word "and":</P>

<P>". . . and to destroy the capital of Belgrade in attacks by waves. Besides the Air Force has to support the Army."</P>

<P>I put it to you that that order makes it clear that the attack on Belgrade was just another of your exhibitions of terror attacks in order to attempt to subdue a population that would have difficultY in resisting them.</P>

<P>GOERING: No, that is not correct. The population of Belgrade did defend itself. Belgrade was far more a center of military installations than the capital of any other country; and I would like to draw your attention to this.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now, I am going to pass from that matter to one or two points on which you gave evidence-I think at the instance of counsel for the organizations. You remember you gave evidence in answer to Dr. Babel about the Waffen-SS? Do you remember that-a few days ago?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I would just like you to look at a document which has not got a number, but it is the Fuehrer's ideas about the Waffen-SS, and to see if you agree. It is Document Number D-665, and it will be Exhibit Number GB-280. It is a document from the High Command of the Army, General Staff of the Army-statements of the Fuehrer regarding the future state military police-and the covering letter of the document says, "After the Fuehrer's proposals for the Waffen-SS had been passed on, doubts arose as to whether it was intended that they should be given wider distribution." If you will pass to the documents, perhaps you will follow it while I read it. I do not think it has been introduced before:</P>

<P>"On 8/6/1940 when the order for the organization of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler "-Adolf Hitler Bodyguard-"was issued, the Fuehrer stated the principles regarding the necessity for the Waffen-SS as summed up below:</P>

<P>"The Greater German Reich in its final form will not include within its frontiers only those national groups which from the very beginning will be well disposed towards the Reich. It is therefore necessary to maintain outside the Reich proper a state military police capable in any situation of representing and imposing the authority of the Reich.</P>

<P>"This task can be carried out only by a state police composed of men of best German blood and wholeheartedly pledged to the ideology n which the Greater German Reich is founded. Only such a formation will resist subversive influences, even in critical times. Such a formation, proud of its purity, will never fraternize with the proletariat and with the underworld which undermines the fundamental idea. In our future Greater German Reich, a police corps will have the necessary authority over the other members of the community only if it is trained along military lines. Our people are so military minded as a result of glorious achievements in war and training by the National Socialist Party that a 'sock-knitting' police, as in 1848, or a bureaucratic police, as in 1918, would no longer have any authority.</P>

<P>"It is therefore necessary that this state police roves its worth and sacrifices its blood at the front, in close formations in the same way as every unit of the armed forces. Having returned home, after having proved themselves in the field in the ranks of the Army, the units of the Waffen-SS will possess the authority to execute their tasks as state police. "This employment of the Waffen-SS for internal purposes is just as much in the interests of the Wehrmacht itself. We must never again allow the conscripted German Wehrmacht to be used against its fellow countrymen, weapon in hand, in critical situations at home. Such action is the beginning of the end. A state which has to resort to such methods is no longer in a position to use its armed forces against an enemy from without, and thereby gives itself up.</P>

<P>"There are deplorable examples of this in our history. In future the Wehrmacht is to be used solely against the foreign enemies of the Reich.</P>

<P>"In order to ensure that the men in the units of the Waffen-SS are always of high quality, the recruitment into the units must be limited. The Fuehrer's idea of this limitation is that the units of the Waffen-SS should generally not exceed 5 to 10% of the peacetime strength of the Army."</P>

<P>Do you agree with that? Is that a correct description of the purpose of the Waffen-SS?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am absolutely convinced that he did say that, but that does not contradict my statement.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, I just want you, while we are on the SS, to look at a note which is Document D-729 and will be Exhibit Number GB-281. It is on the conversation between you and the Duce in the Palazzo Venezia on 10/23/1942. At that time you were still in good odor with the Fuehrer and still retained your power; is that right?</P>

<P>I will read it: It is Page 35, Paragraph 1.</P>

<P>"The Reich Marshal then described Germany's method in fighting the partisans. To begin with, all livestock and foodstuffs were taken away from the areas concerned, so as to deny the partisans all sources of supply."</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a second please. Where is this?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It is Page 35, Paragraph 1, but I will find it for you if you have any difficulty. I think it is marked, and it begins "The Reich Marshal..." Can you find it?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I will start again if I may. "The Reich Marshal then described Germany's method in fighting the partisans. To begin with, all livestock and foodstuffs were taken away from the areas concerned, so as to deny the partisans all sources of supply. Men and women were taken away to labor camps, the children to children's camps, and the villages burned down. It was by the use of these methods that the railways in the vast wooded areas of Bialowiza had been safeguarded. Whenever attacks occurred, the entire male population of the villages were lined up on one side and the women on the other. The women were told that all the men would be shot, unless they-the women-pointed out which men did not belong to the village. In order to save their men, the women always pointed out the nonresidents. Germany had found that, generally speaking, it was not easy to get soldiers to carry out such measures Members of the Party discharged this task much more harshly and efficiently. For the same reason armies trained ideologically, such as the German-or the Russian-fought better than others. The SS, the nucleus of the old Party fighters, who have personal ties with the Fuehrer and who form a special elite, confirm this principle."</P>

<P>Now, is that a correct description?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, certainly.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And this expresses correctly your views on how war against partisans should be carried out?</P>

<P>GOERING: I have transmitted this.</P>

<P>Just a second, please. May I ask what the number of this document is?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, I will give it again: Document Number D-729, and it becomes Exhibit Number GB-281.</P>

<P>Now, I just want you to help me on one other matter on these organizations. You will remember that in answer, I think, to Dr. Servatius, you made some remarks about the Leadership Corps. Do you remember that? I just want you to have them in mind.</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, will you look at the document which will be presented to you, Document Number D-728, Exhibit Number GB-282. This is a document from the Office of the Gau Leadership for Hessen-Nassau. I am sorry; there is a reference to an order of the Party Chancellery dated 2/10/1945, its subject is, "Action by the Party to be taken for keeping the German population in check until the end of the war." It is signed by Sprenger, Gauleiter and Commissioner for Reich Defense.</P>

<P>GOERING: The date is 3/15/1945, is that right?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am grateful to you. I knew it was just after 10 March. I have not got it in my copy but if you say it, I will take it.</P>

<P>GOERING: 1945.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.</P>

<P>[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe then read rom the document excerpts which were withdrawn and stricken from the record on 8/16/1946.]</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I must object to the use of this document, since I cannot recognize that it is genuine. I have not yet seen the original and the doubts as to its being genuine are due to the fact that expressions are used which are most unusual in the German language.</P>

<P>GOERING: I was going to raise the same objection. It is not an original as it says at the top, "copy," and there is no original signature, but only the typewritten words "Sprenger, Gauleiter" at the bottom.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: For instance the expression "Gerichtlichkeiten" is used. This is an expression completely unusual and unknown in the German language, and I cannot imagine that an official document originating from Gauleiter could contain such a word.</P>

<P>GOERING: I can draw your attention to yet another point showing that this is evidently not an original document. If there had been an increase in meat or fat rations, I would have heard something about it. Not a single word of these two documents is known to me It does not bear a rubber stamp either, the whole thing is typewritten, including the signatures. Therefore, I cannot accept this document.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: This is a file copy which, to the best of my knowledge, was captured at the office of the Gau Leader. It was sent to us by the British Army of the Rhine. I shall make inquiries about it, but it purports to be a file copy and I have put the original document which we have, which is a file copy, to the witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, I have the original document in my hands now, together with the certificate of an officer of the British Army stating that the document was delivered to him in the above capacity, in the ordinary course of official business, as the original of a document found in German records of files capture military forces under the command of the Supreme Commander. Under these circumstances it is in exactly the same position as all the other captured documents. The defense, of course, can bring any evidence which it thinks right, to criticize the authenticity of the document. The document stands on exactly the same footing as the other captured documents, subject to any criticism to support which you may be able to bring evidence.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Witness, I want you to deal with the sentence in paragraph 6.</P>

<P>Now, this paragraph is certainly directed to all administrative levels down to the Kreisleiter, county leaders of the Nazi Party, and it assumes they knew all about the running of concentration camps. Are you telling the Tribunal that you, who up to 1943 were the second man in the Reich, knew nothing about concentration camps?</P>

<P>GOERING: First of all, I want to say once more that I do not accept this document, and that its whole wording is unknown to me, and that this paragraph appears unusual to me. I did not know anything about what took place and what methods were used in the concentration camps later, when I was no longer in charge.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Let me remind you of the evidence that has been given before this Court, that as far as Auschwitz alone is concerned, 4 million people were exterminated. Do you remember that?</P>

<P>GOERING: This I have heard as a statement here, but I consider it in no way proved that figure, I mean.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If you do not consider it proved, let me remind you of the affidavit of Hoettl, who was Deputy Group Leader of the Foreign Section, of the Security Section of Amt IV of the RSHA. He says that approximately 4 million Jews have been killed in the concentration camps, while an additional 2 million met death in other ways. Assume that these figures-one is a Russian figure, the other a German-assume they are even 50% correct, assume it was 2 million and 1 million, are you telling this Tribunal that a Minister with your power in the Reich could remain ignorant that that was going on?</P>

<P>GOERING: This I maintain, and the reason for this is that these things were kept secret from me. I might add that in my opinion not even the Fuehrer knew the extent of what was going on.</P>

<P>This is also explained by the fact that Himmler kept all these matters very secret. We were never given figures or any other details.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But, Witness, haven't you access to the foreign press, the press department in your ministry, to foreign broadcasts? You see, there is evidence that altogether, when you take the Jews and other people, something like 10 million people have been done to death in cold blood, apart from those killed in battle. Something like 10 million people. Do you say that you never saw or heard from the foreign press, in broadcasts, that this was going on?</P>

<P>GOERING: First of all, the figure 10 million is not established in any way. Secondly, throughout the war I did not read the foreign press, because I considered it nothing but propaganda. Thirdly though I had the right to listen to foreign broadcasts, I never did so, simply because I did not want to listen to propaganda. Neither did I listen to home propaganda.</P>

<P>Only during the last 4 days of the war did I-and this I could prove-listen to a foreign broadcasting station for the first time.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You told Mr. Justice Jackson yesterday that there were various representatives in Eastern territories, and you have seen the films of the concentration camps haven't you, since this Trial started? You knew that there were millions of garments, millions of shoes, 20,952 kilograms of gold wedding rings, 35 wagons of furs-all that stuff which these people who were exterminated at Maidanek or Auschwitz left behind them. Did nobody ever tell you, under the development of the Four Year Plan, or anyone else, that they were getting all these amounts of human material? Do you remember we heard from the Polish Jewish gentleman, who gave evidence, that all he got back from his family, of his wife and mother and daughter, I think, were their identity cards? His work was to gather up clothes. He told us that sc thorough were the henchmen of your friend Himmler that it took 5 minutes extra to kill the women because they had to have their hair cut off as it was to be used for making mattresses. Was nothing ever told you about this accretion to German material, which came from the effects of these people who were murdered?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, and how can you imagine this? I was laying down the broad outlines for the German economy, and that certainly did not include the manufacture of mattresses from women's hair or the utilization of old shoes and clothes. I leave the figure on. But, also I do want to object to your reference to my "friend Himmler." [=]</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I will say, "your enemy Himmler," or simply "Himmler" whichever you like. You know whom I mean, don't you?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, indeed.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, I just want to remind you of one other point: Exhibit Number USA-228, Document Number 407(V)-PS, " . . . I have the honor to report to you that it was possible to add 3.638 million new foreign workers to the German war economy between April 1st of last year and March 31st of this year.... In addition to the foreign civilian workers 1.622 million prisoners of war are employed in the German economy." Now, just listen to this, out of the 5 million foreign workers who have arrived in Germany, not even 200000 came voluntarily." That is from the minutes of the Central Planning Board on the 1st of March. Do you say that you, in your position in the State and as the great architect of German economy, did not know that you were getting for your economy 4.8 million foreign workers who were forced to come? Do you tell the Tribunal that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I never told the Tribunal that. I said that I knew it quite well that these workers were brought in and not always voluntarily, but whether the figure of 200000 is correct, that I do not know, and I do not believe it either. The number of volunteers was greater, but this does not alter the fact that workers were forced to come to the Reich. That I have never denied, and have even admitted it.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You admit-and I want to put it quite fairly-that a large number of workers were forced to come to the Reich and work there?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes, certainly.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, would you like to adjourn now?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Afternoon Session SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you remember what you said about the relations between you and the Fuehrer? May I repeat your words:</P>

<P>"The chief influence on the Fuehrer, if I may mention influence on the Fuehrer at all, was up to the end of 1941 or the beginning of 1942, and that influence was I. Then my influence gradually decreased until 1943, and from 1943 on it decreased speedily. All in all, apart from myself I do not believe anyone else had anywhere near the influence on the Fuehrer that I had."</P>

<P>That is your view on that matter?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think you told the Tribunal that right up to the end your loyalty to the Fuehrer was unshaken. Is that right?</P>

<P>GOERING: That is correct.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you still seek to justify and glorify Hitler after he had ordered the murder of these 50 young flying officers at Stalag Luft Number III?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am here neither to justify the Fuehrer Adolf Hitler nor to glorify him. I am here only to emphasize that I remained faithful to him, for I believe in keeping one's oath not in good times only, but also in bad times when it is much more difficult.</P>

<P>As to your reference to the 50 airmen, I never opposed the Fuehrer so clearly and strongly as in this matter, and I gave him my views about it. After that no conversation between the Fuehrer and myself took place for months.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The Fuehrer, at any rate, must have had full knowledge of what was happening with regard to concentration camps, the treatment of the Jews, and the treatment of the workers, must he not?</P>

<P>GOERING: I already mentioned it as my opinion that the Fuehrer did not know about details in concentration camps, about atrocities as described here. As far as I know him, I do not believe he was informed. But insofar as he. . .</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am not asking about details I am asking about the murder of four or five million people. Are you suggesting that nobody in power in Germany, except Himmler and perhaps Kaltenbrunner, knew about that?</P>

<P>GOERING: I am still of the opinion that the Fuehrer did not know about these figures.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, you remember how Mr. Dahlerus described the relations between you and Hitler on Page 53 of his book:</P>

<P>"From the very beginning of our conversation, I resented his manner towards Goering, his most intimate friend and comrade from the years of struggle. His desire to dominate was explicable, but to require such obsequious humility as Goering now exhibited, from his closest collaborator, seemed to me abhorrent and unprepossessing."</P>

<P>Is that how you had to behave with Hitler?</P>

<P>GOERING: I did not have to behave in that way, and I did not behave in that way. Those are journalistic statements by Dahlerus, made after the war. If Germany had won the war, this description would certainly have been very different.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Mr. Dahlerus was your witness, though.</P>

<P>GOERING: Mr. Dahlerus was not asked to give a journalistic on account. He was solely questioned about the matters with which he, as courier between myself and the British Government, had to deal.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, on Tuesday of last week, the defendant called General Bodenschatz, who gave general evidence as to his character and reputation. He, therefore, in my respectful submission, makes me entitled to put one document to him which is an account by the Defendant Raeder of his general character and reputation. In accordance with the English practice, I make my submission and ask the Court's permission to put it in.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I object to the reading of this document. It would be considerably easier to question Admiral Raeder, as witness, on his statements, since he is here with us. Then we shall be able to determine in cross-examination whether and to what extent he still maintains this alleged statement.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I have to put it in cross-examination to give the defendant the chance of answering it. The Defendant Raeder can give his explanations when he comes into the witness box.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to look at the document before it is put in.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is the English translation. I will show Dr. Stahmer the German.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I should like to point out, that the document bears no date and we do not know when and where it was drawn up. [=]</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The date is in Raeder's handwriting as is the signature; the 27th of July, I think it is 1945. Each page of the document is signed by the Defendant Raeder.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, you said the defendant has put his character in issue through Bodenschatz?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Your Lordship will remember he was asked by Doctor Stahmer: "Will you now tell me about the defendant's social relations?" And then he proceeded to give an account of his character and his kindness and other qualities at that time; and I notice that Doctor Stahmer has just included as an exhibit still further evidence as to character in the form of a statement by one Hermann Winter.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But, My Lord, the rule is that if the defendant puts his character in issue, he is entitled to be crossexamined on his character and his general reputation, and of course it is permissible to call a witness .to speak as to his general reputation.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: May I make the following remark? I did not call Bodenschatz, neither did I question him as witness for Goering's character. I questioned him about certain facts and happenings from which Bodenschatz subsequently drew certain conclusions. In my opinion, all these questions should have been put to Bodenschatz when he was here. These statements could then have been used to prove that it was Bodenschatz who was not telling the truth, not that Goering had told an untruth. To prove this the document should have been used during Bodenschatz's interrogation. Then we would have been able to question Bodenschatz about it to.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: He may prefer that Bodenschatz be brought back and it be pu$ to him, but I think I am entitled to put it to the defendant who called for the evidence as to his character and reputation.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal rules that at the present stage, this document cannot be used in cross-examination.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Honor please, I understand that Your Lordship leaves open the question for further argument, whether it can be used for the Defendant Raeder in the witness box.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am much obliged.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.]</P>

<P>Now, Witness, you said before the Tribunal adjourned, that Hitler, in your opinion, did not know about-broadly-or was ignorant about, the question of concentration camps and the Jews. I would like you to look at Document Number D-736. hat is an account of a discussion between the Fuehrer and the Hungarian Regent Horthy on the 4/17/1943, and if you would look at Page 4, you will see the passage just after "Nuremberg and Furth."</P>

<P>GOERING: Just a moment. I should like to read through it very quickly to determine its authenticity.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Certainly.</P>

<P>GOERING: Page 4.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Page 4-Exhibit Number GB-283. You see, after the mention of Nuremberg and Furth, Hitler goes on:</P>

<P>"The Jews did not even possess organizational value. In spite of the fears which he, the Fuehrer, had heard repeatedly in Germany, everything continued to go its normal way without the Jews. Where the Jews were left to themselves, as for instance in Poland, the most terrible misery and decay prevailed. They are just pure parasites. In Poland, this state of affairs had been fundamentally cleared up. If the Jews there did not want to work, they were shot. If they could not work, they had to perish. They had to be treated like tuberculosis bacilli, with which a healthy body may become infected. This was not cruel-if one remembers that even innocent creatures of nature, such as hares and deer, have to be killed so that no harm is caused by them. Why should the beasts who wanted to bring us Bolshevism be more preserved? Nations which do not rid themselves of Jews perish. One of the most famous examples is the downfall of that people who were once so proud, the Persians, who now lead a pitiful existence as Armenians."</P>

<P>And would you look at Exhibit USSR-170, Document Number USSR-170, which is a conference which you had on the 8/6/1942.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Before you pass from this document, is there, not a passage higher up that is important? It is about 10 lines down I think, in the middle of the line. . .</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Your Honor is correct.</P>

<P>"To Admiral Horthy's counterquestion as to what he should do with the Jews, now that they had been deprived of almost all possibility of earning their livelihood-he could not kill the them off-the Reich Minister of Foreign Affairs declared that the Jews should be exterminated or taken to concentration camps. There was no other possibility."</P>

<P>GOERING: I do not know this document. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, this is a conference which you had with a number of people, and on Page 143, if you will turn to it, you get on to the question of butter. If you will look where it says: "Reich Marshal GOERING: How much butter do you deliver 30000 tons?"</P>

<P>Do you see that?</P>

<P>GOERING: Yes.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And then Lohse, who is in the conference, says, "Yes," and you say, "Do you also deliver to Wehrmacht units?" and then Lohse says, "I can answer that too. There are only a few Jews left alive. Tens of thousands have been disposed of, but I can tell you that the civilian population gets, on your orders, 15% less than the Germans." I call your attention to the statement that "there are only a few Jews left alive, tens of thousands have been disposed of." Do you still say, in the face of these two documents, that neither Hitler nor yourself knew that the Jews were being exterminated?</P>

<P>GOERING: I beg that the remarks be rightly read. They are quite incorrectly reproduced. May I read the original text? "Lohse:"-thus not my remark, but the remark of Lohse-"I can also answer that. The Jews are left only in small numbers. Thousands have gone." It does not say here that they were destroyed. From this remark you cannot conclude that they were killed. It could also mean that they had gone away-they were removed. There is nothing here...</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: About the preceding remark, I suggest that you make quite clear what you meant by "there are only a few Jews left alive, whereas tens of thousands have been disposed of."</P>

<P>GOERING: They were "still living there." That is how you should understand that.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You heard what I read to you about Hitler, what he said to Horthy and what Ribbentrop said, that the Jews must be exterminated or taken to concentration camps. Hitler said the Jews must either work or be shot. That was in 4/1943. Do you still say that neither Hitler nor you knew of this policy to exterminate the Jews?</P>

<P>GOERING: For the correctness of the document . . .</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Will you please answer my question. Do you still say neither Hitler nor you knew of the policy to exterminate the Jews?</P>

<P>GOERING: As far as Hitler is concerned, I have said I do not think so. As far as I am concerned, I have said that I did not know, even approximately, to what extent these things were taking place.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You did not know to what degree, but you knew there was a policy that aimed at the extermination of the Jews?</P>

<P>GOERING: No, a policy of emigration, not liquidation of the Jews. I knew only that there had been isolated cases of such perpetrations.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Thank you.</P>

<P>Morning Session</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: With the agreement of the Tribunal, I now call the witness Hoess.</P>

<P>[The witness Hoess took the stand.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Stand up. Will you state your name?</P>

<P>RUDOLF FRANZ FERDINAND HOESS (Witness): Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Hoess.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear by God-the Almighty and Omniscient-that I will speak the pure truth-and will withhold and add nothing.</P>

<P>]The witness repeated the oath in German.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you sit down?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Witness, your statements will have far reaching significance. You are perhaps the only one who can throw some light upon certain hidden aspects, and who can tell which people gave the orders for the destruction of European Jewry, and can further state how this order was carried out and to what degree the execution was kept a secret.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kauffman, will you kindly put questions to the witness.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Yes.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] From 1940-1943, you were the Commander of the camp at Auschwitz. Is that true?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And during that time, hundreds of thousands of human beings were sent to their death there. Is that correct?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it true that you, yourself, have made no exact notes regarding the figures of the number of those victims because you were forbidden to make them?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it furthermore correct that exclusively one man by the name of Eichmann had notes about this, the man who had the task of organizing and assembling these people? HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it furthermore true that Eichmann stated to you that in Auschwitz a total sum of more than 2 million Jews had been destroyed? HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Men, women, and children?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: You were a participant in the World War? HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And then in 1922, you entered the Party?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Were you a member of the SS?</P>

<P>HOESS: Since 1934.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it true that you, in the year 1924, were unwitnessed to a lengthy term of hard labor because you participated in a so-called political murder?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. DR. KAUFFMAN: And then at the end of 1934, you went to the concentration camp of Dachau?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What task did you receive?</P>

<P>HOESS: At first, I was the leader of a block of prisoners and then I became clerk and finally, the administrator of the property of prisoners.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And how long did you stay there?</P>

<P>HOESS: Until 1938.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What job did you have from 1938 on and where were you then?</P>

<P>HOESS: In 1938 I went to the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen where, to begin with, I was adjutant to the commander and later on I became the head of the protective custody camp.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: When were you commander at Auschwitz?</P>

<P>HOESS: I was commander at Auschwitz from 5/1940-12/1943. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What was the highest number of human beings, prisoners, ever held at one time at Auschwitz?</P>

<P>HOESS: The highest number of internees held at one time at Auschwitz, was about 140000 men and women.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it true that in 1941 you were ordered to Berlin to see Himmler? Please state briefly what was discussed.</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. In the summer of 1941 I was summoned to Berlin to Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler to receive personal orders. He told me something to the effectI do not remember the exact wordsthat the Fuehrer had given the order for a final solution of the Jewish question. We, the SS, must carry out that order. If it is not carried out now then the Jews will later on destroy the German people. He had chosen Auschwitz on account of its easy access by rail and also because the extensive site offered space for measures ensuring isolation.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: During that conference did Himmler tell you that this planned action had to be treated as a secret Reich matter?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. He stressed that point. He told me that I was not even allowed to say anything about it to my immediate superior Gruppenfuehrer Glucks. This conference concerned the two of US only and I was to observe the strictest secrecy.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What was the position held by Glucks whom you have just mentioned?</P>

<P>HOESS: Gruppenfuehrer Glucks was, so to speak, the inspector of concentration camps at that time and he was immediately subordinate to the Reichsfuehrer.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Does the expression "secret Reich matter mean that no one was permitted to make even the slightest allusion to outsiders without endangering his own life?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, "secret Reich matter" means that no one was allowed to speak about these matters with any person and that everyone promised upon his life to keep the utmost secrecy.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Did you happen to break that promise?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, not until the end of 1942.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Why do you mention that date? Did you talk to outsiders after that date?</P>

<P>HOESS: At the end of 1942 my wife's curiosity was aroused by remarks made by the then Gauleiter of Upper Silesia, regarding happenings in my camp. She asked me whether this was the truth and I admitted that it was. That was my only breach of the promise I had given to the Reichsfuehrer. Otherwise I have never talked about it to anyone else.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: When did you meet Eichmann?</P>

<P>HOESS: I met Eichmann about 4 weeks after having received that order from the Reichsfuehrer. He came to Auschwitz to discuss the details with me on the carrying out of the given order. As the Reichsfuehrer had told me during our discussion, he had instructed Eichmann to discuss the carrying out of the order with me and I was to receive all further instructions from him.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Will you briefly tell whether it is correct that the camp of Auschwitz was completely isolated, describing the measures taken to insure as far as possible the secrecy of carrying out of the task given to you.</P>

<P>HOESS: The Auschwitz camp as such was about 3 kilometers away from the town. About 20000 acres of the surrounding country had been cleared of all former inhabitants, and the entire area could be entered only by SS men or civilian employees who had special passes. The actual compound called "Birkenau," where later on the extermination camp was constructed, was situated 2 kilo meters from the Auschwitz camp. The camp installations themselves, that is to say, the provisional installations used at first were deep in the woods and could from nowhere be detected by the eye. In addition to that, this area had been declared a prohibited area and even members of the SS who did not have a special pass could not enter it. Thus, as far as one could judge, it was impossible for anyone except authorized persons to enter that area.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And then the railway transports arrived. During what period did these transports arrive and about how many people roughly, were in such a transport?</P>

<P>HOESS: During the whole period up until 1944 certain operations eve carried out at irregular intervals in the different countries, so that one cannot speak of a continuous flow of incoming transports. It was always a matter of 4-6 weeks. During those 4-6 weeks two to three trains, containing about 2000 persons each, arrived daily. These trains were first of all shunted to a siding in the Birkenau region and the locomotives then went back. The guards who had accompanied the transport had to leave the area at once and the persons who had been brought in were taken over by guards belonging to the camp.</P>

<P>They were there examined by two SS medical officers as to their fitness for work. The internees capable of work at once marched to Auschwitz or to the camp at Birkenau and those incapable of work were at first taken to the provisional installations then later to the newly constructed cremator.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: During an interrogation I had with you the other day you told me that about 60 men were designated to receive these transports, and that these 60 persons, too, had been bound to the same secrecy described before. Do you still maintain that today?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, these 60 men were always on hand to take the internees not capable of work to these provisional installations and later on to the other ones. This group, consisting of about ten leaders and subleaders, as well as doctors and medical personnel, had repeatedly been told, both in writing and verbally, that they were bound to the strictest secrecy as to all that went on in the camps.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Were there army signs that might show an outsider who saw these transports arrive, that they would be destroyed or was that possibility so small because there was in Auschwitz an unusually large number of incoming transports, shipments of goods and so forth?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, an observer who did not make special notes for that purpose could obtain no idea about that because to begin with not only transports arrived which were destined to be destroyed but also other transports arrived continuously, containing new internees who were needed in the camp. Furthermore, transport likewise left the camp in sufficiently large numbers with internees fit for work or exchanged prisoners.</P>

<P>The trains themselves were closed, that is to say the doors of the freight cars were closed so that it was not possible, from the outside, to get a glimpse of the people inside. In addition to that up to 100 cars of materials, rations, et cetera, were daily rolled in the camp or continuously left the workshops of the camp in which war material was being made. [=]</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And after the arrival of the transports ear the victims stripped of everything they had? Did they have to undress completely; did they have to surrender their valuables? Is that true?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: And then they immediately went to their death?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: I ask you, according to your knowledge, did these people know what was in store for them?</P>

<P>HOESS: The majority of them did not, for steps were taken to keep them in doubt about it and suspicion would not arise that they were to go to their death. For instance, all doors and all walls bore inscriptions to the effect that they were going to undergo a delousing operation or take a shower. This was made known in several languages to the internees by other internees who had come in with earlier transports and who were being used as auxiliary crews during the whole action.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: And then, you told me the other day, that death by gassing set in within a period of 3 to 15 minutes. Is that correct?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: You also told me that even before death finally set in, the victims fell into a state of unconsciousness?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. From what I was able to find out myself or from what was told me by medical officers, the time necessary for reaching unconsciousness or death varied according to the temperature and the number of people present in the chambers. Loss of consciousness took place within a few seconds or a few minutes.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: Did you yourself ever feel pity with the victims, thinking of your own family and children?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: How was it possible for you to carry out these actions in spite of this?</P>

<P>HOESS: In view of all these doubts which I had, the only one and decisive argument was the strict order and the reason given for it by the Reichsfuehrer Himmler.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: I ask you whether Himmler inspected the camp and convinced himself, too, of the process of annihilation?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. Himmler visited the camp in 1942 and he watched in detail one processing from beginning to end.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMANN: Does the same apply to Eichmann?</P>

<P>HOESS: Eichmann came repeatedly to Auschwitz and was intimately acquainted with the proceedings.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Did you ever talk with Kaltenbrunner with reference to your task?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, never. I was with Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner on only one single occasion.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: When was that?</P>

<P>HOESS: That was one day after his birthday in the year 1944.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What position did you hold in the year 1944?</P>

<P>HOESS: In the year 1944 I was the head of Department E-1 in the Main Economic and Administrative Office in Berlin. My office was the former Inspectorate of Concentration Camps at Oranienburg. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And what was the subject of that conference which you have just mentioned?</P>

<P>HOESS: It concerned a report from the camp at Mauthausen on the so-called nameless internees and their engagement in armament industry. Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner was to make a decision on the matter. For that reason I came to him with the report from the commander at Mauthausen but he did not make a decision telling me he would do so later.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Regarding the location of Mauthausen, will you please state in which district Mauthausen is situated. Is that Upper Silesia or is it the Government General?</P>

<P>HOESS: Mauthausen...</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Auschwitz, I beg your pardon, I made a mistake. I mean Auschwitz.</P>

<P>HOESS: Auschwitz is situated in the former state of Poland. Later, after 1939, it was incorporated in the province of Upper Silesia.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is it right for me to assume that administration and feeding of concentration camps were exclusively under the control of the Main Economic and Administrative Office?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: A department which is completely separated from the RSHA?</P>

<P>HOESS: Quite correct.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: And then from 1943 until the end of the war, you were one of the chiefs in the Inspectorate of the Main Economic and Administrative Office?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, that is correctly stated.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Do you mean by that, that you are particularly well informed on everything occurring in concentration camps regarding the treatment and the methods applied?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: I ask you, therefore, first of all, whether you have any knowledge regarding the treatment of internees, whether certain methods became known to you according to which they were tortured and cruelly treated? Please formulate your statement according to periods, up to 1939 and after 1939.</P>

<P>HOESS: Until the outbreak of war in 1939, the situation in the Camp regarding feeding, accommodations, and treatment of internees was the same as in any other prison or penitentiary in the Reich. The internees were treated severely, but methodical beatings or ill-treatments were out of the question. The Reichsfuehrer gave frequent orders that every SS man who laid violent hands on an internee would be punished; and several times SS men who did ill-treat internees were punished.</P>

<P>Feeding and billeting at that time were on the same basis as those of other prisoners under legal administration.</P>

<P>The accommodations in the camps during those years were still normal because the mass influxes at the outbreak of the war and during the war had not yet taken place. When the war started and when mass deliveries of political internees arrived, and, later on, when prisoners who were members of the resistance movements arrived from the occupied territories, the construction of buildings and the extensions of the camps could no longer keep pace with the number of incoming internees. During the first years of the war this problem could still be overcome by improvising measures; but later, due to the exigencies of the war, this was no longer possible since there were practically no building materials any more at our disposal. And, furthermore, rations for the internees were again and again severely curtailed by the provincial economic administration offices.</P>

<P>This then led to a situation where internees in the camps no longer had the staying power to resist the now gradually growing epidemics.</P>

<P>The main reason why the prisoners were in such bad condition towards the end of the war, why so many thousands of them were found sick and emaciated in the camps, was that every internee had to be employed in the armament industry to the extreme limit Of his forces. The Reichsfuehrer constantly and on every occasion kept this goal before our eyes, and also proclaimed it through the Chief of the Main Economic and Administrative Office, ObergrUppenfuehrer Pohl, to the concentration camp commanders and administrative leaders during the so-called commanders' meetings.</P>

<P>Every commander was told to make every effort to achieve this. The aim was not to have as many dead as possible or to destroy as many internees as possible; the Reichsfuehrer was constantly concerned with being able to engage all forces available in the armament industry.</P>

<P>DR. CAFFEINE: There is no doubt that the longer the war lasted, the larger became the number of the ill-treated and tortured inmates. Whenever you inspected the concentration camps did you not learn something of this state of affairs through complaints, et cetera, or do you consider that the conditions which have been described are more or less due to excesses?</P>

<P>HOESS: These so-called ill-treatments and this torturing in concentration camps, stories of which were spread everywhere among the people, and later by the prisoners that were ]iterated by the occupying armies, were not, as assumed, inflicted methodically, but were excesses committed by individual leaders, subleaders, and men who laid violent hands on internees.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Do you mean you never took cognizance of these matters?</P>

<P>HOESS: If in any way such a case came to be known, then the perpetrator was, of course, immediately relieved of his post or transferred somewhere else. So that, even if he were not punished for lack of evidence to prove his guilt, even then, he was taken away from the internees and given another position. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: To what do you attribute the particularly bad and shameful conditions, which were ascertained by the entering Allied troops, and which to a certain extent were photographed and filmed?</P>

<P>HOESS: The catastrophic situation at the end of the war was due to the fact that, as a result of the destruction of the railway network and of the continuous bombing of the industrial plants, care for these masses-I am thinking of Auschwitz with its 140000 internees-could no longer be assured. Improvised measures, truck columns, and everything else tried by the commanders to improve the situation were of little or no avail; it was no longer possible. The number of the sick became immense. There were next to no medical supplies; epidemics raged everywhere. Internees who were capable of work were used over and over again. By order of the Reichsfuehrer, even half-sick people had to be used wherever possible in industry. As a result every bit of space in the concentration camps which could possibly be used for lodging was overcrowded with sick and dying prisoners.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: I am now asking you to look at the map which is mounted behind you. The red dots represent concentration camps. I will first ask you how many concentration camps as such existed at the end of the war?</P>

<P>HOESS: At the end of the war there were still 13 concentration camps. All the other points which are marked here on the map mean so-called labor camps attached to the armament industry situated there The concentration camps, of which there are 13 as I have already said, were the center and the central point of some district such as the camp at Dachau in Bavaria, or the camp of Mauthausen in Austria; and all the labor camps in that district were under the control of the concentration camp. That camp had then to supply these outside camps, that is to say, they had to supply them with workers, exchange the sick inmates and furnish clothing; the guards, too, were supplied by the concentration camp.</P>

<P>From 1944 on, the supplying of food was almost exclusively a matter of the individual armament industries in order to give the prisoners the benefit of the wartime supplementary rations.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: What became known to you about so-called medical experiments on living internees?</P>

<P>HOESS: Medical experiments were carried out in several camps. For instance, in Auschwitz there were experiments on sterilization carried out by Professor Klaubert and Dr. Schumann; also experiments on twins by SS medical officer Dr. Mengele.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Do you know the medical of fiber Dr. Rancher?</P>

<P>HOESS: In Dachau he was a medical officer of the Luftwaffe who carried out experiments, on internees who had been sentenced to death, about the resistance of the human body to cold and in high pressure chambers.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Can you tell whether such experiments carried out within the camp were known to a large circle?</P>

<P>HOESS: Such experiments, just like all other matters, were, of course, called "secret Reich matters." However, it could not be avoided that the experiments became known since they were carried out in a large camp and must have been seen in some way by the inmates. I cannot say, however, to what extent the outside world learned about these experiments.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: You explained to me that orders for executions were received in the camp at Auschwitz, and you told me that until the outbreak of war such orders were few, but that later on they became more numerous. Is that correct?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. There were hardly any executions until the beginning of the war-only in particularly serious cases. I remember one case in Buchenwald where an SS man had been attacked and beaten to death by internees, and the internees were later hanged.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: But during the war-and that you will admit-the number of executions increased, and not inconsiderably.</P>

<P>HOESS: That had already started with the beginning of the war.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Was the basis for these execution orders in many cases a legal sentence of German courts?</P>

<P>HOESS: No. Orders for the executions carried out in the camps came from the RSHA.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Who signed the orders for executions which you received? Is it correct that occasionally you received orders for executions which bore the signature "Kaltenbrunner," and that these were not the originals but were teleprints which therefore had the signature in typewritten letters?</P>

<P>HOESS: It is correct. The originals of execution orders never came to the camps. The original of these orders either arrived at the Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps, from where they were transmitted by teletype to the camps concerned, or, in urgent cases, the RSHA sent the orders directly to the camps concerned and the Inspectorate was then only informed, so that the signatures in the camps were always only in teletype.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: So as to again determine the signatures. will you tell the Tribunal whether the overwhelming majority of all execution orders either bore the signature of Himmler or that of Muller in the years before the war and until the end of the war.</P>

<P>HOESS: Only very few teletypes which I have ever seen came from the Reichsfuehrer and still fewer from the Defendant Kaltenbrunner. Most of them, I could say practically all, were signed "Signed Muller."</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Is that the Muller with whom you repeatedly talked about such matters as you stated earlier?</P>

<P>HOESS: Gruppenfuehrer Muller was the Chief of Department IV in the RSHA. He had to negotiate with the Inspectorate about all matters connected with concentration camps.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Would you say that you went to see the Gestapo Chief Muller because you, on the strength of your experience, were of the opinion that this man because of his years of activities was acting almost independently?</P>

<P>HOESS: That is quite right. I had to negotiate all matters regarding concentration camps with Gruppenfuehrer Muller. He wa informed on all these matters, and in most cases he would make an immediate decision. [=]</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Well, so as to have a clear picture, did you ever negotiate these matters with the defendant?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Did you learn that towards the end of the vary concentration camps were evacuated? And, if so, who gave the orders?</P>

<P>HOESS: Let me explain. Originally there was an order from the Reichsfuehrer, according to which camps, in the event of the approach of the enemy or in case of air attacks, were to be surrendered to the enemy. Later on, due to the case of Buchenwald, which had been reported to the Fuehrer, there was-no, at the beginning of 1945, when various camps came within the operational sphere of the enemy, this order was withdrawn. The Reichsfuehrer ordered the Higher SS and Police Leaders, who in an emergency case were responsible for the security and safety of the camps, to decide themselves whether an evacuation or a surrender was appropriate.</P>

<P>Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen were evacuated. Buchenwald was also to be evacuated, but then the order from the Reichsfuehrer came through to the effect that on principle no more camps were to be evacuated. Only prominent inmates and inmates who were not to fall into Allied hands under any circumstances were to be taken away to other camps. This also happened in the case of Buchenwald. After Buchenwald had been occupied, it was reported to the Fuehrer that internees had armed themselves and were carrying out plundering in the town of Weimar. This caused the Fuehrer to give the strictest order to Himmler to the effect that in the future no more camps were to fall into the hands of the enemy, and that no internees capable of marching would be left behind in any camp.</P>

<P>This was shortly before the end of the war, and shortly before northern and southern Germany were cut. I shall speak about the Sachsenhausen camp. The Gestapo chief, Gruppenfuihrer Muller, called me in the evening and told me that the Reichsfuehrer had ordered that the camp at Sachsenhausen was to be evacuated at once. I pointed out to Gruppenfuehrer Mueller what that would Mean Sachsenhausen could no longer fall back on any other camp except perhaps on a few labor camps attached to the armament Works that were almost filled up anyway. Most of the internees would have to be sheltered in the woods somewhere. This would mean countless thousands of deaths and, above all, it would be impossible to feed these masses of people. He promised me that he would again discuss these measures with the Reichsfuihrer. He called me back and told me that the Reichsfuehrer had refused and was demanding that the commanders carry out his orders immediately.</P>

<P>At the same time Ravensbruck was also to be evacuated in the same manner but it could no longer be done. I do not know to what extent camps in southern Germany were cleared, since we, the Inspectorate, no longer had any connections with southern Germany.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: It has been maintained here-and this is my last question-that the Defendant Kaltenbrunner gave the order that Dachau and two auxiliary camps were to be destroyed by bombing or with poison. I ask you, did you hear anything about this; if not, would you consider such an order possible?</P>

<P>HOESS: I have never heard anything about this, and I do not know anything either about an order to evacuate any camps in southern Germany, as I have already mentioned. Apart from that, I consider it quite impossible that a camp could be destroyed by this method.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: I have no further questions.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants' counsel want to ask any questions?</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: Witness, did the State Police, as an authority of the Reich, have anything to do with the destruction of Jews in Auschwitz?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, insofar as I received all my orders as to the carrying out of that action from the Obersturmfuehrer Eichmann.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: Was the administration of concentration camps under the control of the Main Economic and Administrative Office?</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: You said already that you had nothing to do with the RSHA.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: Please, will you emphasize, therefore, that the Gestapo as such had nothing to do with the administration of the camps or the accommodation, feeding, and treatment of the internees but that this was exclusively a matter for the Main Economic and Administrative Office?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, that is quite correct.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: How do you explain it then that you, nevertheless, discussed different questions concerning concentration Camp with Muller?</P>

<P>HOESS: The RSHA, or rather Amt IV, had the executive power for the directing of all internees into camps, classification into the camp grades 1, 2, 3, and furthermore, the punishments which were to be carried out on the part of the RSHA. Executions, the accommodation of special internees, and all question which might ensue therefrom were also taken care of by the RSHA or Amt IV.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: When was this Main Economic and Administrative Office created?</P>

<P>HOESS: The Main Economic and Administrative Office existed since 1933 under various names. The Inspectorate of Concentration Camps was, however, subordinated only to this Main Economic and Administrative Office since the year 1941.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: Then these concentration camps were from the very beginning under the control of this Main Economic and Administrative Office, that is to say the SS and not the State Police.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: You mentioned the name of Dr. Rancher a while ago. Do you know this doctor personally?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. [=]</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: Do you know that Dr. Rancher before beginning his work at Dachau had become a member of the SS?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, I know nothing about that. I only know that later he-I still saw him in the uniform of an Air Force medical officer. Later he was supposed to have been taken over into the SS, but I did not see him again.</P>

<P>DR. MERKEL: I have no further questions. Thank you very much.</P>

<P>HERR LUDWIG BABEL (Counsel for SS): Witness, at the beginning of your examination you stated that when you were ordered to the Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler, he told you that the carrying out of this order of the Fuehrer was to be left to the SS and that the SS had been ordered to do it. What is to be understood under this general title SS?</P>

<P>HOESS: According to the explanations of the Reichsfuehrer, this could only mean the men guarding the concentration camps. According to the nature of the order only concentration camp crews and not the Affiance could be concerned with the carrying out of this task.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: How many members of the SS were assigned to concentration camps, and which units did they belong to?</P>

<P>HOESS: Toward the end of the war there were approximately 35000 SS men and in my estimation approximately 10000 men from the Army, Air Force, and the Navy detailed to the labor camps for guard duties.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: What were the tasks of these guards? As far as I know, the duties varied. First, there was the actual guarding and then there was a certain amount of administrative work within the camp.</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, that is correct.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: How many guards were there within the camps for, let us say, 1000 internees?</P>

<P>HOESS: You cannot estimate it in that way. According to my observations about 10% of the total number of guarding personnel were used for internal duties, that is to say, administration and supervision of internees within the camp, including the medical personnel of the camp.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: So that 90% were therefore used for the exterior guarding, that is to say, for watching the camp from watch towers and for escorting the internees on work assignments.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: Did you make any observations as to whether there was any ill-treatment of prisoners to a greater or lesser degree on the part of those guards, or whether the ill-treatment was mainly to be traced back to the so-called Kapos?</P>

<P>HOESS: If any ill-treatment of prisoners by guards occurred- I myself have never observed any-then this was possible only to a very small degree since all offices in charge of the camps took care that as few SS men as possible had direct contact with the inmates, because in the course of the years the guard personnel had deteriorated to such an extent that the standards formerly demanded could no longer be maintained.</P>

<P>We had thousands of guards who could hardly speak German, who came from all lands as volunteers and joined these units. or we had older men, between 50 and 60, who lacked all interest in their work, so that a camp commander had to watch constantly that these men fulfilled even the lowest requirements of their duties. It is obvious that there were elements among them who would ill-treat internees, but this ill-treatment was never tolerated.</P>

<P>Besides, it was impossible to have these masses of people directed at work or when in the camp by SS men only; therefore, inmates had to be assigned everywhere to direct the other prisoners and set them to work. The internal administration of the camp was almost completely in their hands. Of course a great deal of ill treatment occurred which could not be avoided because at night there were hardly any members of the SS in the camps. Only in specific cases were SS men allowed to enter the camp, so that the internees were more or less exposed to these Kapos.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: You have already mentioned regulations which existed for the guards, but there was also a standing order in each camp. In this camp order certainly punishment was provided for internees who violated the camp rules. What punishment wa provided?</P>

<P>HOESS: First of all, transfer to a penal company (Strafkompanie) that is to say, harder work and restricted accommodations; next, detention in the cell block, detention in a dark cell; and in very serious cases, chaining or strapping. Punishment by strapping was prohibited in the year 1942-1943-I cannot say exactly when-by the Reichsfuehrer. Then there was the punishment of standing at the camp gate over a rather long period, and finally corporal punishment.</P>

<P>However, no commander could decree this corporal punishment on his own authority. He could only apply for it. In the case of men, the decision came from the Inspector of Concentration Camps, Gruppenfuehrer Schmidt, and where women were concerned, the Reichsfuehrer reserved the decision exclusively for himself.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: It may also be known to you that for members of the SS, too, there were two penal camps which sometimes were called concentration camps, namely, Dachau and Danzig-Matzkau.</P>

<P>HOESS: That is right. [=]</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: Were the existing camp regulations and the treatment of members of the SS who were put in such camps different from the regulations applying to the other concentration camps?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes; these two detention camps were not under the Inspectorate for Concentration Camps, but they were under an SS and Police court. I myself have neither inspected nor seen these two camps.</P>

<P>HERR BABEL: So that you know nothing about the standing orders relating to those camps?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal ruled a long time ago that only one counsel could be heard.</P>

<P>DR. HAENSEL: Yes.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER OTTO KRANZBUHLER(Counsel for Defendant Doenitz): Witness, you just mentioned that members of the avow were detailed to guard concentration camps.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Were these concentration camps, or were they labor camps?</P>

<P>HOESS: They were labor camps.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Are labor camps barracks camps of the armament industries?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, if they were not accommodated in the actual factories themselves.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: I have been informed that soldiers who were to be assigned for guard duty at labor camps were given over to the SS.</P>

<P>HOESS: That is only partially correct. A part of these men- I do not recall the figure was taken over into the SS. A part was returned to the original unit, or exchanged. Exchanges were continually taking place.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the matter can be looked into.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Witness, I was asking you about these execution orders which you testify were signed by Muller. Do you understand?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Is it not a fact that all of these execution orders which you testify were signed by Mueller were also signed by order of, or as representative of, the Chief of the RSHA, Kaltenbrunner?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. That was on the copies that I had in the originals. Afterward, when I was employed at Oranienburg, it said underneath, "I. V. Mueller"-"in Vertretung Muller" (as representative, Muller).</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: In other words Muller was merely signing as the representative of the Chief of the RSHA, Kaltenbrunner? Is that not correct?</P>

<P>HOESS: I must assume so.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And, of course, you know that Muller was a subordinate of the Chief of the RSHA, Kaltenbrunner.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Witness, you made an affidavit, did you not, at the request of the Prosecution?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: I ask that the witness be shown Document 3868-PS, which will become Exhibit USA-81P.</P>

<P>[The document was submitted to the witness.]</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: You signed that affidavit voluntarily, Witness?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: And the affidavit is true in all respects?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: This, if the Tribunal please, we have in four languages.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.]</P>

<P>Some of the matters covered in this affidavit you have already told us about in part, so I will omit some parts of the affidavit. If you will follow along with me as I read, please. Do you have a copy of the affidavit before you?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: I will omit the first paragraph and start with Paragraph 2:</P>

<P>"I have been constantly associated with the administration of concentration camps since 1934, serving at Dachau until 1938; then as Adjutant in Sachsenhausen from 1938-5/1/1940, when I was appointed Commandant of Auschwitz. I commanded Auschwitz until 12/1/1943, and estimate that at least 2.5 million victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease making a total dead of about 3 million. This figure represents about 70-80% of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners, the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries; included among the executed and burned were approximately 20000 Russian prisoners of war (previously screened out of prisoner-of-war cages by the Gestapo) who were delivered at Auschwitz in Wehrmacht transports operated by regular Wehrmacht officers and men. The remainder of the total number of victims included about 100000 German Jews, and great numbers of citizens, mostly Jewish, from Holland, France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Greece, or other countries. We executed about 400000 Hungarian Jews alone at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944."</P>

<P>That is all true, Witness?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, it is. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Now I omit the first few lines of Paragraph 3 and start in the middle of Paragraph 3:</P>

<P>". . . prior to establishment of the RSHA, the Secret State Police Office (Gestapo) and the Reich Office of Criminal Police were responsible for arrests, commitments to concentration camps, punishments and executions therein. After organization of the RSHA all of these functions were carried on as before, but pursuant to orders signed by Heydrich as Chief of the RSHA. While Kaltenbrunner was Chief of RSHA orders for protective custody, commitments, punishment, and individual executions were signed by Kaltenbrunner or by Mueller, Chief of the Gestapo, as Kaltenbrunner's deputy."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Just for the sake of accuracy, the last date in Paragraph 2, is that 1943-1944?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: 1944, I believe. Is that date correct, Witness, at the close of Paragraph 2, namely, that the 400000 Hungarian Jews alone at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944 were executed? is that 1944-1943?</P>

<P>HOESS: 1944. Part of that figure also goes back to 1943; only a part. I cannot give the exact figure; the end was 1944, autumn of 1944.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Right.</P>

<P>"4. Mass executions by gassing commenced during the summer of 1941 and continued until fall 1944. I personally supervised executions at Auschwitz until 12/1/1943 and know by reason of my continued duties in the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps, WVHA, that these mass executions continued as stated above. All mass executions by gassing took place under the direct order, supervision, and responsibility of RSHA. I received all orders for carrying out these mass executions directly from RSHA."</P>

<P>Are those statements true and correct, Witness?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, they are.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: "5. On 12/1/1943 I became Chief of Amt I in Amt Group D of the WVHA, and in that office was responsible for coordinating all matters arising between RSHA and concentration camps under the administration of WVHA. I held this position until the end of the war. Pool, as Chief of WVHA, and Kaltenbrunner, as Chief of RSHA often conferred personally and frequently communicated orally and in writing concerning concentration camps.... "</P>

<P>You have already told us about the lengthy report which you took to Kaltenbrunner in Berlin, so I will omit the remainder of Paragraph 5.</P>

<P>"6. The 'final solution' of the Jewish question meant the complete extermination of all Jews in Europe. I was ordered to establish extermination facilities at Auschwitz in 6/1941. At that time, there were already in the General Government three other extermination camps: Belzek, Treblinka and Wolzek. These camps were under the Einsatzkommando of the Security Police and SD. I visited Treblinka to find out how they carried out their exterminations. The camp commandant at Treblinka told me that he had liquidated 80000 in the course of one-half year. He was principally concerned with liquidating all the Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto. He used monoxide gas, and I did not think that his methods were very efficient. So when I set up the extermination building at Auschwitz, I used Cyklon B, which was a crystallized presoak acid which we dropped into the death chamber from a small opening. It took from 3-15 minutes to kill the people in the death chamber, depending upon climatic conditions. We knew when the people were dead because their screaming stopped. We usually waited about one-half hour before we opened the doors and removed the bodies. After the bodies were removed our special Kommandos took off the rings and extracted the gold from the teeth of the corpses."</P>

<P>Is that all true and correct, Witness?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Incidentally, what was done with the gold which vase taken from the teeth of the corpses, do you know?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Will you tell the Tribunal?</P>

<P>HOESS: This gold was melted down and brought to the Chief Medical Office of the SS at Berlin.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: "7. Another improvement we made over Treblinka was that we built our gas chamber to accommodate 2000 people at one time whereas at Treblinka their 10 gas chambers only accommodated 200 people each. The way we selected our victims was as follows: We had two SS doctors on duty at Auschwitz to examine the incoming transports of prisoners. The prisoners would be marched by one of the doctors who would make spot decisions as they walked by. Those who were fit for work were sent into the camp. Others were sent immediately to the extermination plants. Children of tender years were invariably exterminated since by reason of their youth they were unable to work. Still another improvement we made over Treblinka was that at Treblinka the victims almost always knew that they were to be exterminated and at Auschwiti we endeavored to fool the victims into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process. Of course, frequently they realized our true intentions and we sometimes had riots and difficulties due to that fact. Very frequently women would hide their children under the clothes, but of course when we found them we would send the children in to be exterminated. We were required to carry out these exterminations in secrecy but of course the foul and nauseating stench from the continuous burning of bodies permeated the entire area and all of the people living in the surrounding communities knew that exterminations were going on at Auschwitz."</P>

<P>Is that all true and correct, Witness?</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: Now, I will omit Paragraphs 8 and 9, which have to do with the medical experiments as to which you have already testified.</P>

<P>"10. Rudolf Mildner was the chief of the Gestapo at Katowice . . . from approximately 3/1941-9/1943. As such, he frequently sent prisoners to Auschwitz for incarceration or execution. He visited Auschwitz on several occasions. The Gestapo court, the SS Standgericht, which tried persons accused of various crimes, such as escaping prisoners of war, et cetera, frequently met within Auschwitz, and Mildner often attended the trial of such persons, who usually were executed in Auschwitz following their sentence. I showed Mildner through the extermination plant at Auschwitz and he was directly interested in it since he had to send the Jews from his territory for execution at Auschwitz.</P>

<P>"I understand English as it is written above. The above statements are true; this declaration is made by me voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over the statement I have signed and executed the same at Nuremberg, Germany, on the 4/5/1946."</P>

<P>Now I ask you, Witness, is everything which I have read to you true to your own knowledge? [=]</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes.</P>

<P>COL. AMEN: That concludes my crosexamination, except for one exhibit that our British allies would like to have in, which is a summary sheet of the exhibits which I introduced at the commencement of the cross-examination. That will be Exhibit Number USA-810. It is a summary of the earlier exhibits that I put in with respect to the Affiance at the commencement of my cross-examination.</P>

<P>Now, I understand, Your Lordship, that both the Soviet and the French delegations have one or two questions which they consider peculiar to their country which they would like to put to this witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, you will remember that the Tribunal was assured by Counsel for the Prosecution that, so far as witnesses were concerned, with the exception of one or two particular defendants, the Prosecution would have only one crossexamination and now, since that assurance was given, this is the second instance when the Prosecution have desired to have more than one crosexamination.</P>

<P>GEN. REDNECK: This is correct, Mr. President, that the Prosecution did make that statement; however, the Prosecution reserved the right to do otherwise on certain occasions when deemed necessary. Since, in this case, the Prosecution represent four different states, occasions do arise when each of the prosecutors feel that he has the right to ask the defendant or witnesses individual questions particularly interesting to his own country.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you indicate the nature of the questions which the Soviet Prosecution desire to put? I mean the subjects upon which they are. I don't mean the exact questions but the subject.</P>

<P>GEN. REDNECK: Yes, I understand. Colonel Pokrovsky, who intends to ask the questions, will report on the subject to the Tribunal.</P>

<P>COL. POKROVSKY: May I report to you, Mr. President, that the questions of interest to the Soviet Prosecution are those dealing specifically with the annihilation of millions of Soviet citizens and some details connected with that annihilation. At the request of the French Prosecution, and in order to clarify the contents I would also like to ask two or three questions connected with the documents which in due course were submitted as Document F-709(a) to the Tribunal by the French Prosecution. This is really all there is; however, these questions do have great importance for us.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Pokrovsky, the Tribunal, as has just been stated, made the rule, with the assent of the Prosecutors, that in the case of the witnesses there should be one cross-examination. There is nothing in the Charter which expressly gives to the Prosecution the right for each prosecutor to cross-examine and there is, on the other hand, Article 18 which directs the Tribunal to take strict measures to prevent any action which will cause unreasonable delay, and, in the opinion of the Tribunal in the present case, the subject has been fully covered and the Tribunal therefore think it right to adhere to the rules which they have laid down in this case. They will therefore not hear any further cross-examination.</P>

<P>Do you wish to re-examine, Dr. Kauffman?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: I will be very brief.</P>

<P>Witness, in the affidavit which was just read, you said under Point 2 that "at least an additional half million died through starvation and disease." I ask you, when did this take place? Was it towards the end of the war or was this fact observed by you already at an earlier period?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, it all goes back to the last years of the war, that is beginning with the end of 1942.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Under Point 3-do you still have the affidavit before you?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: May I ask that it be given to the witness again?</P>

<P>[The document was returned to the witness.]</P>

<P>Under Point 3, at the end you state that orders for protective custody, commitments, punishments, and special executions were signed by Kaltenbrunner or Muller, Chief of the Gestapo, as Kaltenbrunner's deputy. Thus, do you wish to contradict what you stated previously?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, this only completes what I said over and again. I read only a few decrees signed by Kaltenbrunner; most of them were signed by Muller.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Under Point 4, at the end, you state:</P>

<P>"All mass executions through gassing took place under the direct order, supervision, and responsibility of RSHA. I received all orders for carrying out these mass executions directly from RSHA."</P>

<P>According to the statements which you previously made to the Tribunal, this entire action came to you directly from Himmler through Eichmann, who had been personally delegated. Do you maintain that now as before?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: With this last sentence under Point 4, do you wish to contradict what you testified before?</P>

<P>HOESS: No. I always mean regarding mass executions, Obersturmbannfuehrer Eichmann in connection with the RSHA. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Under Point 7, at the end, you state-I am not going to read it-you were saying that even though exterminations took place secretly, the population in the surrounding area noticed something of the extermination of people. Did not, at an earlier period of time-that is, before the beginning of this special extermination action-something of this nature take place to remove people who had died in a normal manner in Auschwit?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, when the cremator had not yet been built we burned in large pits a large part of those who had died and who could not be cremated in the provisional cremator of the camp a large number-I do not recall the figure anymore-were placed in mass graves and later also cremated in these graves. That was before the mass executions of Jews began.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Would you agree with me if I were to say that from the described facts alone, one could not conclusively prove that this was concerned with the extermination of Jews?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, this could in no way be concluded from that. The population . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What was your question about?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: My question was whether one could assume from the established facts-at the end of Paragraph 7-that this concerned the so-called extermination of Jews. I tied this question .". to the previous answer of the witness. It is my last question.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The last sentence of Paragraph 7 is with reference to the foul and nauseating stench. What is your question about that?</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: Whether the population could gather from ease things that an extermination of Jews was taking place.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That really is too obvious a question, isn't it? They could not possibly know who it was being exterminated.</P>

<P>DR. KAUFFMAN: That is enough for me. I have no further questions.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: I ask the Tribunal's permission to ask a few supplementary questions, for during cross-examination the witness stated that the Defendant Frick had visited the concentration camps Sachsenhausen and Oranienburg in 1938.</P>

<P>Witness, when an inspection of the concentration camp of Oranienburg took place at that time, 1937-1938, was there any evidence at all of atrocities?</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: Why not?</P>

<P>HOESS: Because there was no question of atrocities at that time.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: Is it correct that at that period of time the concentration camp at Oranienburg was still a model of order and that agricultural labor was the main occupation?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes, that is right. However, work was mainly done in Workshops in wood-finishing workshops.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: Can you give me any details as to what was shown at that time at such an official visit?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. The visiting party was shown through the prisoners' camp proper, inspected the quarters, the kitchen, the hospital, and then all the administrative buildings; above all the workshops, where the inmates were employed.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: At that time were the quarters and the hospitals already overcrowded?</P>

<P>HOESS: No, at that time they were normally filled.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: How did these quarters look?</P>

<P>HOESS: At that period of time, living quarters looked the same as the barracks of a training ground. The internees still had bed clothing and all necessary hygienic facilities. Everything was yet in the best of order.</P>

<P>DR. PANNENBECKER: That is all. I have no further questions.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Francis Biddle, Member for the United States): Witness, what was the greatest number of labor camps existing at any one time?</P>

<P>HOESS: I cannot give the exact figure but in my estimation, there were approximately 900. [=]</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Badly): What was the population of these 900?</P>

<P>HOESS: I am not able to say that either; the population varied There were camps with 100 internees and camps with 10000 internees. Therefore, I cannot give any figure of the total number of people who were in these labor camps.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Under whose administration were the labor compounder what offices?</P>

<P>HOESS: These labor camps, as far as the guarding, direction and clothing were concerned, were under the control of the Economic and Administration Main Office. All matters dealing with labor output and the supplying of food were attended to by the armament industries which employed these internees.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And at the end of the war were the conditions in those labor camps similar to those existing in the concentration camps as you described them before?</P>

<P>HOESS: Yes. Since there no longer was any possibility of bringing ill internees to the main camps, there was much overcrowding in these labor camps and the death rate very high.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</P>

<P>[The witness left the stand.]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I have an announcement to make.</P>

<P>The Tribunal orders that any of the evidence taken on commission which the Defense Counsel or the Prosecution wish to use shall be offered in evidence by them. This evidence will then become a part of the record, subject to any objections.</P>

<P>Counsel for the organizations should begin to make up their document books as soon as possible and put in their requests for translations.</P>

<P>That is all.</P>

<P>Dr. Stahmer.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: With reference to the events at Katyn, the Indictment contains only the remark: "In 9/1941 11000 Polish officers, prisoners of war, were killed in the Katyn woods near Smolensk." The Russian Prosecution only submitted the details at the session of 2/14/1946. Document USSR-54 was then submitted to the Tribunal. This document is an official report by the Extraordinary State Commission, which was officially authorized to investigate the Katyn case. This commission, after questioning the witnesses . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal are aware of the document and they only want you to call your evidence; that is all.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I wanted only to add, Mr. President, that according to this document, there are two accusations: One, that the period of the shooting of the Polish prisoners of war was the autumn of 1941; and the second assertion is, that the killing was carried out by some German military authority, camouflaged under the name of "Staff of Engineer Battalion 537."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That is all in the document, is it not? I have just told you we know the document. We only want you to call your evidence.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Then, as my first witness for the Defense, I shall call Colonel Friedrich Ahrens to the witness stand.</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I have a request to make before the evidence is heard in the Katyn case. The Tribunal decided that three witnesses should be heard, and it hinted that in the interests of equality, the Prosecution could also produce only three witnesses, either by means of direct examination or by means of an affidavit. In the interests of that same principle of equality, I should be grateful if the Soviet Delegation, in the same way as the Defense, would state the names of their witnesses before the hearing of the evidence. The Defense submitted the names of their witnesses weeks ago. Unfortunately, up to now, I note that in the interests of equality and with regard to the treatment of the Defense and the Prosecution, the Soviet Delegation has so far not given the names of the witnesses.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, were you going to give me the names of the witnesses?</P>

<P>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, Mr. President. Today we notified the General Secretary of the Tribunal that the Soviet Prosecution intends to call three witnesses to the stand: Professor Prosorovsky, who is the Chief of the Medico-Legal Experts Commission; the Bulgarian subject, Professor of Legal Medicine at Sofia University Markov, who at the same time was a member of the so-called International Commission created by the Germans; and Professor Bazilevsky, who was the deputy mayor of Smolensk during the time of the German occupation.</P>

<P>[The witness Ahrens took the stand.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</P>

<P>FRIEDRICH AHRENS (Witness): Friedrich Ahrens.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear by God the Almighty and Omniscient that I will speak the pure truthand will withhold and add nothing.</P>

<P>[The witness repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, did you, as a professional officer in the German Armed Forces, participate in the second World War?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, of course; as a professional officer I participated in the second World War.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What rank did you hold finally?</P>

<P>AHRENS: At the end as colonel.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were you stationed in the eastern theater of war?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In what capacity?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I was the commanding officer of a signal regiment of an army group.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What were the tasks of your regiment?</P>

<P>AHRENS: The signal regiment of an army group had the task of setting up and maintaining communications between the army group and the neighboring units and subordinate units, as well as preparing the necessary lines of communication for new operations.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did your regiment have any special tasks apart from that?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, with the exception of the duty of defending themselves, of taking all measures to hinder a sudden attack and of holding themselves in readiness to defend themselves with the forces at their disposal, so as to prevent the capture of the regimental battle headquarters.</P>

<P>This was particularly important for an army group signal regiment and its battle headquarters because we had to keep a lot of highly secret material in our staff.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Your regiment was the Signal Regiment 537. Was there also an Engineer Battalion 537, the same number?</P>

<P>AHRENS: During the time when I was in the Army Group Center I heard of no unit with the same number, nor do I believe that there was such a unit.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: And to whom were you subordinated?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I was directly subordinated to the staff of the Army Group Center, and that was the case during the entire period when I was with the army group. My superior was General Oberhauser.</P>

<P>With regard to defense, the signal staff of the regiment with its first battalion, which was in close touch with the regimental staff, was at times subordinated to the commander of Smolensk; all orders which I received from that last-named command came via General Oberhauser, who either approved or refused to allow the regiment to be employed for a particular purpose.</P>

<P>In other words, I received my orders exclusively from General Oberhauser.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Where was your staff accommodated?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I prepared a sketch of the position of the staff headquarters west of Smolensk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I am having the sketch shown to you. Please tell us whether that is your sketch.</P>

<P>AHRENS: That sketch was drawn by me from memory.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I am now going to have a second sketch shown to you. Will you please have a look at that one also, and will you tell me whether it presents a correct picture of the situation?</P>

<P>AHRENS: May I briefly explain this sketch to you? At the right-hand margin, that large red spot is the town of Smolensk. West of Smolensk, and on either side of the road to Vitebsk, the staff of the army group was situated together with the Air Force corps, that is south of Krasnibor. On my sketch I have marked the actual area occupied by the Army Group Center.</P>

<P>That part of my sketch which has a dark line around it was very densely occupied by troops who came directly under the army group; there was hardly a house empty in that area.</P>

<P>The regimental staff of my regiment was in the so-called little Katyn wood. That is the white spot which is indicated on the sketch; it measures about 1 square kilometer of the large forest and is a part of the entire forest around Katyn. On the southern edge of this small wood there lay the so-called Dnieper Castle, which was the regimental staff headquarters.</P>

<P>Two and a half kilometers to the east of the staff headquarters of the regiment there was the first company of the regiment. which was the operating company, which did teleprinting and telephone work for the army group. About 3 kilometers west of the regimental staff headquarters there was the wireless company. There were no buildings within the radius of about 1 kilometer of the regimental staff headquarters.</P>

<P>This house was a large two-story building with about 14 to 15 rooms, several bath installations, a cinema, a rifle range, garages, Sauna (steam baths) and so on, and was most suitable for accommodating the regimental staff. Our regiment permanently retained this battle headquarters.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were there also any other high-ranking staff headquarters nearby?</P>

<P>AHRENS: As higher staff headquarters there was the army group, which I have already mentioned, then a corps staff from the Air Force, and several battalion staffs. Then there was the delegate of the railway for the army group, who was at Gnesdovo in a special</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: It has been stated in this Trial that certain events which have taken place in your neighborhood had been most secret and most suspicious. Will you please, therefore, answer the following questions with particular care?</P>

<P>How many Germans were there in the staff personnel, and what positions did they fill?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I had 3 officers on my staff to begin with, and then 2, and approximately 18 to 20 noncommissioned officers and men; that is to say, as few as I could have in my regimental staff, and every man in the staff was fully occupied.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you have Russian personnel in your staff?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, we had four auxiliary volunteers and some female personnel living in the immediate vicinity of the regimental staff quarters. The auxiliary volunteers remained permanently with the regimental staff, whereas the female personnel changed from time to time. Some of these women also came from Smolensk and they lived in a separate building near the regimental staff.</P>

<P>DR.STAHMER: Did this Russian personnel receive special instructions from you about their conduct?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I issued general instructions on conduct for the regimental headquarters, which did not solely apply to the Russian personnel.</P>

<P>I have already mentioned the importance of secrecy with reference to this regimental headquarters, which not only kept the records of the position of the army group, but also that of its neighboring units, and on which the intentions of the army group were clearly recognizable. Therefore, it was my duty to keep this material particularly secret. Consequently, I had the rooms containing this material barred to ordinary access. Only those persons were admittedgenerally officerswho had been passed by me, but also a few noncommissioned officers and other ranks who were put under special oath.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: To which rooms did this "no admission" order refer?</P>

<P>AHRENS: In the first place, it referred to the telephone expert's room, it also referred to my own room and partly, although to a smaller degree, to the adjutant's room. All remaining rooms in the house and on the site were not off limits.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, how is this evidence about the actual conditions in these staff headquarters relevant to this question?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, in the Russian document the allegation is contained that events of a particularly secret nature had taken place in this staff building and that a ban of silence had been imposed on the Russian personnel by Colonel Ahrens, that the rooms had been locked, and that one was only permitted to enter the rooms when accompanied by guards. I have put the questions in this connection in order to clear up the case and to prove that these events have a perfectly natural explanation on account of the tasks entrusted to the regiment and which necessitated quite obviously, a certain amount of secrecy.</P>

<P>For that reason, I have put these questions. May I be permitted...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have almost finished with these questions.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Was the Katyn wood cordoned of, and especially strictly guarded by soldiers?</P>

<P>Mr. President, may I remark with reference to this question that here also it had been alleged that this cordon had only been introduced by the regiment. Previously, there had been free access to the woods, and from this conclusions are drawn which are detrimental to the regiment.</P>

<P>AHRENS: In order to secure antiaircraft cover for the regimental staff headquarters, I stopped any timber from being cut for fuel in the immediate vicinity of the regimental staff headquarters. During this winter the situation was such that the units cut wood wherever they could get it.</P>

<P>On 22 January, there was a fairly heavy air attack on my position during which half a house was torn away. It was quite impossible to find any other accommodation because of the over... crowding of the area, and I therefore took additional precautions to make sure that this already fairly thin wood would be preserved r so as to serve as cover. Since, on the other hand, I am against the !;. putting up of prohibition signs, I asked the other troop units by way of verses to leave us our trees as antiaircraft cover. The wood was not closed off at all, particularly as the road had to be kept open for heavy traffic, and I only sent sentries now and then into the wood to see whether our trees were left intact.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The Prosecution . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, at a time that is convenient to you, you will, of course, draw our attention to the necessary dates, the date at which this unit took over its headquarters and the date at which it left.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Very well.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] When did your unit, your regiment, move into this Dnieper Castle?</P>

<P>AHRENS: As far as I know, this house was taken over immediately after the combat troops had left that area in 8/1941, and it was confiscated together with the other army group accommodations and was occupied by advance parties. It was then permanently occupied by the regimental headquarters as long as I was there up to 8/1943.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: So, if I understand you correctly, it was first of all in 8/1941 that an advance party took it over?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, as far as I know.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: When did the staff actually arrive?</P>

<P>AHRENS: A few weeks later.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Who was the regimental commander at that time?</P>

<P>AHRENS: My predecessor was Colonel Bedenck.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: When did you take over the regiment?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I joined the army group during the second half of 11/1941, and after getting thoroughly acquainted with all details I took over the command of the regiment, at the end of November, if I remember rightly, on 30 November.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was there a proper handing over from Bedeck to you?</P>

<P>AHRENS: A very careful, detailed, and lengthy transfer took place, on account of the very considerable tasks entrusted to this regiment. Added to that, my superior, General Oberhauser, was an extraordinarily painstaking superior, and he took great pains to convince himself personally whether, by the transfer negotiations and the instructions which I had received, I was fully capable of taking over the responsibilities of the regiment.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The Prosecution further alleges and claims that it was suspicious that shots were often fired in the forest. Is that true, and to what would you attribute that?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I have already mentioned that it was one of the main tasks of the regiment to take all the necessary measures to defend themselves against sudden attack. Considering the small number of men which I had in my regimental staff, I had to organize and take the necessary steps to enable me to obtain replacements in the shortest time possible. This was arranged through wireless communication with the regimental headquarters. I ordered that defensive maneuvers should be carried out and that defense works should be prepared around the regimental headquarters sector and that there should be maneuvers and exercises in these works together with the members of the regimental headquarters. I personally participated in these maneuvers at times and, of course, shots were fired, particularly since we were preparing ourselves for night fighting.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: There is supposed to have been a very lively and rather suspicious traffic to and around your staff building. Will you please tell us quite briefly what this traffic signified?</P>

<P>AHRENS: There was an extraordinary lively traffic around staff headquarters which still increased in the spring of 1941 as I was having the house rebuilt. I think I mentioned that it had been destroyed through air attacks. But, of course, the traffic increased also through the maneuvers which were held nearby. The battalions in the front area operating at 300 and 400 kilometers distance had to, and could perform their job only by maintaining personal contact with the regiment and its staff headquarters.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: There is supposed to have been considerable truck traffic which has been described as suspicious.</P>

<P>AHRENS: Besides our supplies, which were relatively small, the Kommandos, as I have just mentioned, were brought in by trucks; but so was, of course, all the building material which I required. Apart from that, the traffic was not unusually heavy.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that about 25 kilometers west of Smolensk there were three Russian prisoner-of-war camps, which had originally been inhabited by Poles and which had been abandoned by the Russians when the German troops approached in 7/1941?</P>

<P>AHRENS: At that time I had not yet arrived. But never during the entire period I served in Russia did I see a single Pole; nor did I hear of Poles.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: It has been alleged that an order had been issued from Berlin according to which Polish prisoners of war were to be shot. Did you know of such an order?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No. I have never heard of such an order.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you possibly receive such an order from any other office?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I told you already that I never heard of such an order and I therefore did not receive it, either.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were any Poles shot on your instructions, your direct instructions?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No Poles were shot on my instructions. Nobody at all was ever shot upon my order. I have never given such an order in all my life.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Well, you did not arrive until 11/1941. Have you heard anything about your predecessor, Colonel Bedenck, having given any similar orders?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I have not heard anything about it. With my regimental staff, with whom I lived closely together for 21 months, I had such close connections, I knew my people so well, and they also knew me, that I am perfectly convinced that this deed was not perpetrated by my predecessor nor by any member of my former regiment. I would undoubtedly have heard rumors of it at the very least.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: This is argument, you know, Dr. Stahmer. This is not evidence; it is argument. He is telling you what he thinks might have been the case.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I asked whether he had heard of it from members of his regiment.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The answer to that would be "no," I suppose, that he had not heardnot that he was convinced that he had not done it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Very well.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] After your arrival at Katyn, did you notice that there was a grave mound in the woods at Katyn?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Shortly after I arrivedthe ground was covered by snowone of my soldiers pointed out to me that at a certain spot there was some sort of a mound, which one could hardly describe as such, on which there was a birch cross. I have seen that birch cross. In the course of 1942 my soldiers kept telling me that here in our woods shootings were supposed to have taken place, but at first I did not pay any attention to it. However, in the summer of 1942 this topic was referred to in an order of the army group later commanded by General Von Harsdorff. He told me that he had also heard about it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did these stories prove true later on?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, they did turn out to be true and I was able to confirm, quite by accident, that there was actually a grave here. During the winter of 1943I think either January or February quite accidentally I saw a wolf in this wood and at first I did not believe that it was a wolf; when I followed the tracks with an expert, we saw that there were traces of scratchings on the mound with the cross. I had investigations made as to what kind of bones these were. The doctors told me "human bones." Thereupon I informed the officer responsible for war graves in the area of this fact, because I believed that it was a soldier's grave, as there were a number of such graves in our immediate vicinity.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Then, how did the exhumation take place?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I do not know about all the details. Professor Dr. Butz arrived one day on orders from the army group, and informed me that following the rumors in my little wood, he had to make exhumations, and that he had to inform me that these exhumations would take place in my wood.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did Professor Butz later give you details of the result of his exhumations?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, he did occasionally give me details and I remember that he told me that he had conclusive evidence regarding the date of the shootings. Among other things, he showed me letters, of which I cannot remember much now; but I do remember some sort of a diary which he passed over to me in which there were dates followed by some notes which I could not read because they were written in Polish. In this connection he explained to me that these notes had been made by a Polish officer regarding events of the past months, and that at the endthe diary ended with the spring of 1940the fear was expressed in these notes that something horrible was going to happen. I am giving only a broad outline of the meaning.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did he give you any further indication regarding the period he assumed the shooting had taken place?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Professor Butz, on the basis of the proofs which he had found, was convinced that the shootings had taken place in the spring of 1940 and I often heard him express these convictions in my presence, and also later on, when commissions visited the grave and I had to place my house at the disposal of these commissions to accommodate them. I personally did not have anything to do whatsoever with the exhumations or with the commissions. All I had to do was to place the house at their disposal and act as host.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: It was alleged that in 3/1943 lorries had transported bodies to Katyn from outside and these bodies were buried in the little wood. Do you know anything about that?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, I know nothing about that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Would you have had to take notice of it?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I would have had to take notice of itat least my officers would have reported it to me, because my officers were constantly at the regimental battle headquarters, whereas I, as a regimental commander, was of course, frequently on the way. The officer who in those days was there constantly was First Lieutenant Hodt, whose address I got to know last night from a letter.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were Russian prisoners of war used for these exhumations?</P>

<P>AHRENS: As far as I remember, yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell us the number?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I cannot say exactly as I did not concern myself any further with these exhumations on account of the dreadful and revolting stench around our house, but I should estimate the number as being about 40 to 50 men.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: It has been alleged that they were shot afterward; have you any knowledge of that?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I have no knowledge of that and I also never heard of it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER OTTO KRANZBUHLER (Counsel for Defendant Donitz): Colonel, did you yourself ever discuss the events of 1940 with any of the local inhabitants?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes. At the beginning of 1943 a Russian married couple were living near my regimental headquarters; they lived 800 meters away and they were beekeepers. I, too, kept bees, and I came into close contact with this married couple. When the exhumations had been completed, approximately in 5/1943, I told them that, after all, they ought to know when these shootings had taken place, since they were living in close proximity to the graves. Thereupon, these people told me it had occurred in the spring of 1940, and that at the Gnesdovo station more than 200 Poles in uniform had arrived in railway trucks of 50 tons each and were then taken to the woods in lorries. They had heard lots of shots and screams, too.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Was the wood off limits to the local inhabitants at the time?</P>

<P>AHRENS: We have...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That is a leading question. I do not think you should ask leading questions.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Do you know whether the local inhabitants could enter the woods at the time?</P>

<P>AHRENS: There was a fence around the wood and according to the statements of the local inhabitants, civilians could not enter it during the time the Russians were there. The remains of the fence were still visible when I was there, and this fence is indicated on my sketch and is marked with a black line.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: When you moved into Dnieper Castle did you make inquiries as to who the former owners were?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, I did make inquiries because I was interested. The house was built in a rather peculiar way. It had a cinema installation and its own rifle range and of course that interested me; but I failed to ascertain anything definite during the whole time I was there.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Apart from mass graves in the neighborhood of the castle, were there any other graves found?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I have indicated by a few dots on my sketch, that in the vicinity of the castle there were found a number of other small graves which contained decayed bodies; that is to say, skeletons which had disintegrated. These graves contained perhaps six, eight, or a few more male and female skeletons. Even I, a layman, could recognize that very clearly, because most of them had rubber shoes on which were in good condition, and there were also remains of handbags.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: How long had these skeletons been in the ground?</P>

<P>AHRENS: That I cannot tell you. I know only that they were decayed and had disintegrated. The bones were preserved, but the skeleton structure was no longer intact.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Thank you, that is all.</P>

<P>DR. HANS LATERNSER (Counsel for General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces): Mr. President . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Laternser, you know the Tribunal's ruling.</P>

<P>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, Sir.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have no right to ask any questions of the witness here.</P>

<P>DR. LATERNSER: Mr.President, I just wanted to ask you, in this unusual case, to allow me to put questions...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I said to you that you know the Tribunal's ruling and the Tribunal will not hear you. We have already ruled upon this once or twice in consequence of your objections and the Tribunal will not hear you.</P>

<P>DR.LATERNSER: Mr.President, the Katyn case is one of the most serious accusations raised against the group.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal is perfectly well aware of the nature of the allegations about Katyn and the Tribunal does not propose to make any exceptional rule in that case and it therefore will not hear you and you will kindly sit down.</P>

<P>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I wish to state that on account of this ruling I feel myself unduly handicapped in my defense.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: As Dr. Laternser knows perfectly well, he is entitled to apply to the Commission to call any witness who is called here, if his evidence bears upon the case of the particular organizations for which Dr. Laternser appears. I do not want to hear anything further.</P>

<P>DR.LATERNSER: Mr. President, the channel you point out to me is of no practical importance. I cannot have every witness who appears here called by the Commission.[=]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, you are appearing for the Defendant Donitz, or is it Raeder?</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: Defendant Raeder.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, unless the questions you are going to ask particularly refer to the case of the Defendant Raeder, the Tribunal is not prepared to hear any further examination. The matter has been generally covered by Dr. Stahmer and also by Dr. Kranzbuhler. Therefore, unless the questions which you want to ask have some particular reference to the case of Raeder, the Tribunal will not hear you.</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I had merely assumed that there were two reasons on the strength of which I could put a few questions: First, because the Tribunal itself has stated that within-the framework of the conspiracy all defendants had been participants; and second, that according to the statements by the Prosecution Grossadmiral Raeder, too, is considered a member of the alleged criminal organizations, the General Staff and the OKW. It was for that reason I wanted to ask one or two supplementary questions.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, if there were any allegations that in any way bore on the case against Defendant Raeder, the Tribunal would of course allow you to ask questions, but there is no allegation which in any way connects the Defendant Raeder with the allegations about the Katyn woods.</P>

<P>DR. SIEMERS: I am grateful to the Tribunal for that statement, Mr. President.</P>

<P>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, may r be allowed to ask something else? May I have the question put to the Prosecution, who is to be made responsible for the Katyn case?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I do not propose to answer questions of that sort.</P>

<P>The Prosecution may now cross-examine if they want to.</P>

<P>CHIEF COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE L. N. SMIRNOV (Assistant Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): Please tell me, Witness, since when, exactly, have you been in the Smolensk district territory?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I have already answered that question: since the second half of 11/1941.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer me further, where were you prior to the second part of 1941? Did you in any way have anything to do with Katyn or Smolensk or this district in general? Were you there personally in September and 10/1941?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, I was not there.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say that you were -not there, either in September or in 10/1941, and therefore do not know what happened at that time in the Katyn forest?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I was not there at that time, but I mentioned earlier on that...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am actually only interested in a short question. Were you there personally or not? Were you able to see for yourself what was happening there or not?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: He says he was not there.</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, I was not there.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: He said he was not there in September or 10/1941.</P>

<P>MR.COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>Turning to the witness. Maybe you recall the family names of the Russian women workers who were employed at the country house in the woods?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Those female workers were not working in different houses. They merely worked as auxiliary kitchen personnel in our Dnieper Castle. I have not known their names at all.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That means that the Russian women workers were employed only in the villa situated in Katyn forest where the staff headquarters were located?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I believe that question was not translated well. I did not understand it.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked you whether the Russian women workers were employed exclusively in the villa in Kosig Gory where the staff headquarters were located? Is that right?</P>

<P>AHRENS: The women workers worked for the regimental headquarters as kitchen help, and as kitchen helpers they worked on our premises; and by our premises I mean this particular house with the adjoining housesfor instance, the stables, the garage, the cellars, the boiler room.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will mention a few names of German military employees. Will you please tell me whether they belonged to your unit? First Lieutenant Rex?</P>

<P>AHRENS: First Lieutenant Rex was my regimental adjutant.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me, was he already assigned to that unit before your arrival at Katyn?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, he was there before I came.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He was your adjutant, was he not?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, he was my adjutant.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Lieutenant Hodt? Hodt or Hotht</P>

<P>AHRENS: Lieutenant Hodt is right; but what question are you putting about Lieutenant Hodt?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am only questioning you about whether he belonged to your unit or not.</P>

<P>AHRENS: Lieutenant Hodt was a member of the regiment. Whether . . .</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is what I was asking. He belonged to the regiment which you commanded, to your army unit?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I did not say by that that he was a member of the regimental staff, but that he belonged to the regiment. The regiment consisted of three units.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But he lived in the same villa, did he not?</P>

<P>AHRENS: That I do not know. When I arrived he was not there. I ordered him to report to me there for the first time.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will enumerate a few other names. Corporal Rose, Private Giesecken, Oberfeldwebel Krimmenski, Feldwebel Lummert, a cook named Gustav. Were these members of the Armed Forces who were billeted in the villa?</P>

<P>AHRENS: May I ask you to mention the names individually once again, and I will answer you individually.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Feldwebel Lummert?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Corporal Rose?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And I believe, if my memory serves me correctly, Storekeeper Giesecke.</P>

<P>AHRENS: That man's name was Giesecken.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is right. I did not pronounce this name quite correctly. These were all your people or at least they belonged to your unit, did they not?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you assert that you did not know what these people were doing in September and 10/1941?</P>

<P>AHRENS: As I was not there, I cannot tell you for certain.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I continue? Mr. President, since the witness has stated that he cannot give any testimony concerning the period of September to 10/1941, I will limit myself to very short questions.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Witness, would you please point out the location of the villa and the forest with respect to the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway? Did the estate cover a large area?</P>

<P>AHRENS: My sketch is on a scale of 1 to 100000 and is drawn from memory. I estimate, therefore, that the graves were situated 200 to 300 meters directly west of the road to our Dnieper Castle, and 200 to 300 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk road so that the Dnieper Castle lay a further 600 meters away.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat that?</P>

<P>AHRENS: South of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, approximately 15 kilometers west of Smolensk. According to the scale 1 to 100000, as far as one is able to draw such a sketch accurately from memory, the site of these graves was 200 to 300 meters to the south, and a further 600 meters to the south, directly on the northern bend of the Dnieper, was situated our regimental staff quarters, the Dnieper Castle.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the villa was approximately 600 meters away from the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, that is not correct. What I said...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please give a more or less exact figure. What was the distance between the highway and the villa, please?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I just mentioned it in my testimony, that is to say, the graves were about 200 to 300 meters away, and there were a further 600 meters to the castle, therefore, in all about 900 to 1000 meters. It might have been 800 meters, but that is the approximate distance as can also be seen by this sketch.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I am not following this. Your question, Colonel Smirnov, was: How far was it from the road to what you called the country house? Was it not?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President, I asked how far was the villa from the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What do you mean by the "Villa"?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The headquarters of the unit commanded by the witness in 1941 was quartered in a villa, and this villa was situated not far from the Dnieper River, at a distance of about 900 meters from the highroad. The graves were nearer to the highway. I would like to know how far away were the headquarters from the highway, and how far away from the highway were the graves in Katyn forest.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What you want to know is: How far was the house in which the headquarters was situated from the highway? Is that right?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is exactly what wanted to know, Mr. President.</P>

<P>AHRENS: You put two questions to me: first of all, how far were the graves from the highway; and secondly, how far was the house from the highway. I will repeat the answer once more, the house was 800 to 1000 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One minute, please. I asked you primarily only about the house. Your answer concerning the graves was given on your own initiative. Now I will ask you about the. graves, how far were these mass graves from the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway?</P>

<P>AHRENS: From 200 to 300 meters. It might also have been 350 meters.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the graves were 200 or 300 meters from the main road which connected two important centers? Is that right?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, indeed. They were at a distance of 200 to 300 meters south of this, and I may say that at my time this was the most frequented road I ever saw in Russia.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That was just what I was asking you. Now, please tell me: Was the Katyn wood a real forest, or was it, rather, a park or a grove?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Up to now I have.only spoken about the wood of Katyn. This wood of Katyn is the fenced-in wooded area of about 1 square kilometer, which I drew in my sketch. This wood is of mixed growth, of older and younger trees. There were many birch trees in this little wood. However, there were clearings in this wood, and I should say that from 30 to 40% was cleared. One could see this from the stumps of newly felled trees.</P>

<P>Under no circumstances could you describe this wood as a park at any rate one could not come to such a conclusion. Fighting had taken place in this wood, as one could still see trenches and fox holes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but anyway, you would not call Katyn wood a real forest since it was relatively a small grove in the immediate vicinity of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway. Is that right?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, that is not right. It was a forest. The entire Katyn forest was a regular forest which began near our grove and extended far beyond that. Of this Katyn forest, which was a mixed forest, part of it had been fenced in, and this part, extending over 1 square kilometer, was what we called the little Katyn wood, but it did belong to this entire wooded region south of the highway. The forest began with our little wood and extended to the west.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am not interested in the general characteristics of the wood. I would like you to answer the following short question: Were the mass graves located in this grove?</P>

<P>AHRENS: The mass graves were situated directly west of our entrance drive in a clearing in the wood, where there was a growth of young trees.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but this clearing, this growth of young trees, was located inside this small grove, near the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, is that correct?</P>

<P>AHRENS: It was 200 to 300 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, and directly west of the entrance drive leading from this road to the Dnieper Castle. I have marked this spot on my sketch with, a fairly large white dot.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One more question. As far as you know did the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway exist before the German occupation of Smolensk, or was it constructed only after the occupation?</P>

<P>AHRENS: When I arrived in Russia at the end of 11/1941, everything was covered with snow. Later I got the impression that this was an old road, whereas the road Minsk-Moscow was t newer. That was my impression.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand. Now tell me, under what circumstances, or rather, when did you first discover the cross in the grove?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I cannot tell the exact date. My soldiers told me about it, and on one occasion when I was going past there, about the beginning of 1/1942it could also have been at the end of 12/1941I saw this cross rising above the snow.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This means you saw it already in 1941 or at the latest the beginning of 1942?</P>

<P>AHRENS: That is what I have just testified.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, certainly. Now, please be more specific concerning the date when a wolf brought you to this cross. Was it in winter or summer and what year?</P>

<P>AHRENS: It was the beginning of 1943.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In 1943? And around the cross you saw bones, did you not?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, at first I did not see them. In order to find out whether I had not been mistaken about seeing a wolf, for it seemed rather impossible that a wolf should be so near to Smolensk, I examined the tracks together with a gamekeeper and found traces of scratching on the ground. However, the ground was frozen hard, there was snow on the ground and I did not see anything further there. Only later on, after it had been thawing my men found various bones. However, this was months later and then, at a suitable opportunity I showed these bones to a doctor and he said that these were human bones. Thereupon I said, "Then most likely it is a grave, left as a result of the fighting which has taken place here," and that the war graves registration officer would have to take care of the graves in the same way in which we were taking care of other graves of fallen soldiers. That was the reason why I spoke to this gentlemanbut only after the snow had melted.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: By the way, did you personally see the Katyn graves?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Open or before they were opened?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Open, yes.</P>

<P>AHRENS: When they were open I had constantly to drive past these graves, as generally they were approximately 30 meters away from the entrance drive. Therefore, I could hardly go past without taking any notice of them.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am interested in the following: Do you remember what the depth of the layer of earth was, which covered the mass of human bodies in these graves?</P>

<P>AHRENS: That I do not know. I have already said that I was so nauseated by the stench which we had to put up with for several weeks, that when I drove past I closed the windows of my car and rushed through as fast as I could.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: However, even if you only casually glanced at those graves, perhaps you noticed whether the layer of earth covering the corpses was deep or shallow? Was it several centimeters or several meters deep? Maybe Professor Butz told you something about it?</P>

<P>AHRENS: As commander of a signal regiment I was concerned with a region which was almost half as large as Greater Germany and I was on the road a great deal. My work was not entirely carried out at the regimental battle headquarters. Therefore, in general, from Monday or Tuesday until Saturday I was with my units. For that reason, when I drove through, I did cast an occasional glance at these graves; but I was not especially interested in the details and I did not speak to Professor Butz about such details. For this reason I have only a faint recollection of this matter.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: According to the material submitted to the High Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution, it has been established that the bodies were buried at a depth of 1/2 to 2 meters. I wonder where you met a wolf who could scratch the ground up to a depth of 2 meters.</P>

<P>AHRENS: I did not meet this wolf, but I saw it.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me please, why you started the exhumation on these mass graves in 3/1943 only, after having discovered the cross and learned about the mass graves already in 1941?</P>

<P>AHRENS: That was not my concern, but a matter for the army group. I have already told you that in the course of 1942 the stories became more substantial. I frequently heard about them and spoke about it to Colonel Von Gersdorff, Chief of Intelligence, Army Group Center, who intimated to me that he knew all about this matter and with that my obligation ended. I had reported what I had seen and heard. Apart from that, all this matter did not concern me and I did not concern myself with it. I had enough worries of my own.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And now the last question. Please tell me who were these two persons with whom you had this conversation, and maybe you can recollect the names of the couple who told you about the shootings in the Katyn woods?</P>

<P>AHRENS: This couple lived in a small house about 800 to 1000 meters north of the entrance to our drive leading to the Vitebsk road. I do not recall their names.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you do not remember the names of this couple?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, I do not recall the names.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you heard about the Katyn events from a couple whose names you do not remember, and you did not hear anything about it from other local inhabitants?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Please repeat the question for me.</P>

<P>MR COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, you heard about these Katyn events only from this couple, whose names you do not remember? From none of the other local inhabitants did you hear anything about the events in Katyn?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I personally heard the facts only from this couple, whereas my soldiers told me the stories current among the other inhabitants.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know that during the investigation of the Katyn affair, or rather of the Katyn provocation, posters were placarded by the German Police in the streets of Smolensk, promising a reward to anyone giving any information in connection with the Katyn event? It was signed by Lieutenant Voss.</P>

<P>AHRENS: I personally did not see that poster. Lieutenant Voss is known to me by name only.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And the very last question. Do you know of the report of the Extraordinary State Commission concerning Katyn?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Do you mean the Russian White Paper when you mention this report?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I mean the report of the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission, concerning Katyn, the Soviet report.</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes, I read that report.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, you are acquainted with the fact that the Extraordinary State Commission names you as being one of the persons responsible for the crimes committed in Katyn?</P>

<P>AHRENS: It mentions a Lieutenant Colonel Arnes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, do you wish to re-examine?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, just a little while ago you said that you did not know when First Lieutenant Hodt joined your staff. Do you know when he joined the regiment?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I know that he belonged to the regiment during the Russian campaign and actually right from the beginning.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: That is, he belonged to the regiment from the beginning?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Yes. He belonged to this regiment ever since the beginning of the Russian campaign.</P>

<P>DR.STAHMER: Just one more question dealing with your discussion with Professor Butz. Did Professor Butz mention anything about the last dates on the letters which he found?</P>

<P>AHRENS: He told me about the spring of 1940. He also showed me this diary and I looked at it and I also saw the dates, but I do not recall in detail just which date or dates they were. But they ended with the spring of 1940.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Therefore no documents were found of a later date?</P>

<P>AHRENS: Professor Butz told me that no documents or notes were found which might have given indications of a later date, and he expressed his conviction that these shootings must have taken place in the spring of 1940.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to the witness.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen.Nikitchenko): Witness, can you not remember exactly when Professor Butz discussed with you the date at which, the corpses were buried in the mass graves?</P>

<P>AHRENS: May I ask to have the question repeated?</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): When did Professor Butz speak to you about the mass graves and assert that the burial of the corpses must have taken place in the spring of 1940?</P>

<P>AHRENS: I cannot tell you the date exactly, but it was in the spring of 1943, before these exhumations had startedI beg your pardonhe told me that he had been instructed to undertake the exhumation and during the exhumations he was with me from time to time; therefore it may have been in May or the end of April. In the middle of May he gave me details of his exhumations and told me among other things that which I have testified here. I cannot now tell you exactly on which days Professor Butz visited me.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): So far as I can remember, you stated that Professor Butz arrived in Katyn. When did he actually arrive there?</P>

<P>AHRENS: In the spring of 1940 Professor Butz came to me and told me that on instructions of the army group, he was to undertake exhumations in my woods. The exhumations were started, and in the course of...</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You say 1940? Or perhaps the translation is wrong?</P>

<P>AHRENS: 1943, in the spring of 1943. A few weeks after the beginning of the exhumations. Professor Butz visited me, when I happened to be there, and informed me; or, rather, he discussed this matter with me, and he told me that to which I have testified here. It may have been the middle of 5/1943.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): According to your testimony I understood you to say in answer to a question put by the defense counsel, that Professor Butz asserted that the shootings had taken place in the spring of 1940 before the arrival of the commission for the exhumations. Is that correct?</P>

<P>AHRENS: May I repeat once more that Professor Butz...</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): It is not necessary to repeat what you have already said. I am only asking you, is it correct or not? Maybe the translation was incorrect, or maybe your testimony was incorrect at the beginning.</P>

<P>AHRENS: I did not understand the question just put to me. That is the reason why I wanted to explain this once more. I do not know just what is meant by this last question. May I ask this question be repeated?</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): At the beginning, when you were interrogated by the defense counsel, I understood you to say that Professor Butz told you that the shooting had taken place in the spring of 1940, that is before the arrival of the commission for the exhumations.</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, that has not been understood correctly. I testified that Professor Butz came to me and told me that he was to make exhumations since it concerned my woods. These exhumations then took place, and approximately 6 to 8 weeks later Professor Butz came to meof course, he visited me on other occasions as wellbut approximately 6 to 8 weeks later he came to me and told me that he was convinced that, as a result of his discoveries, he was now able to fix the date of the shootings. This statement which he made to me, refers approximately to the middle of May.</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen.Nikitchenko): Were you present when the diary and the other documents which were shown to you by Professor Butz were found?</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen.Nikitchenko): You do not know where he found the diary and other documents?</P>

<P>AHRENS: No, that I do not know.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: When did you first report to superior authority the fact that you suspected that there was a grave there?</P>

<P>AHRENS: At first, I was not suspicious. I have already mentioned that fighting had taken place there; and at first I did not attach any importance to the stories told to me and did not give this matter any credence. I believed that it was a question of soldiers who had been killed thereof war graves, like several in the vicinity.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You are not answering my question. I am asking you, when did you first report to superior authority that there was a grave there?</P>

<P>AHRENS: In the course of the summer 1942 I spoke to Colonel Von Gersdorff about these stories which had come to my knowledge. Gersdorff told me that he had heard that too, and that ended my conversation with Von Gersdorff. He did not believe it to be true; in any case he was not thoroughly convinced. That I do not know, however.</P>

<P>Then in the spring of 1943, when the snow had melted, the bones which had been found there were brought to me, and I then telephoned to the officer in charge of war graves and told him that apparently there were some soldiers' graves here. That was before Professor Butz had visited me.[=]</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: How am I to understand this question?</P>

<P>DR.STAHMER: Where did you come from?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: We came from Borisov.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. The witness said 20 September. That does not identify the year.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In what year was this 20 September?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: 9/20/1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was Regiment 537 already there at that time?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The staff of Regiment 537 was transferred at about the same time together with the staff of the army group to the place where the headquarters of the army group was. Advance units had already been stationed there previously, in order to set up communication facilities.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: And where was this staff accommodated?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The staff of Army Group Signal Regiment 537 was accommodated in the so-called Dnieper Castle.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Where was the advance unit?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN': The advance unit may have occupied this building, tooor at least a part of this advance unit didto safeguard this building for the regimental staff.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know who was in command of this advance unit?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Lieutenant Hodt was in command of this advance unit.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: When did this advance unit come to Katyn?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Smolensk fell on about 7/17/1941. The army group had planned to put up its headquarters in the immediate vicinity of Smolensk, and, after this group had selected its quarters, this region was seized immediately after the fall of the city. The advance unit arrived at the same time as this area was seized, and that was probably in the second half of 7/1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Therefore the advance unit was there from 7/1941 until 9/20/1941?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: And the entire staff was there from 9/20/1941?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Yes. It may be that part of the staff arrived somewhat later, but the majority of the staff arrived on 20 September.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Are you speaking of the staff of the army group or the staff of the signal regiment?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I am speaking of both staffs, because the moving of large staffs such as that of an army group could not be undertaken in 1 day; usually 2 to 3 days were needed for that. The operations of the signal corps had to be assured, and therefore the regiment had to leave some of the staff behind until the entire staff had been moved.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Where was the advance unit accommodated?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: At least part of the advance unit was accommodated in the Dnieper Castle. Some of the others were in the neighborhood of those places where later on the companies were billeted. The reason for that was to keep the billets ready for this regiment until the bulk of it had been moved.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How about the Regimental Staff 537?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: That was in the Dnieper Castle.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us the names of the officers who belonged to the regimental staff?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: At that time there was Lieutenant Colonel Bedenck, the commanding officer; Lieutenant Rex, adjutant; Lieutenant Hodt, orderly officer; and a Captain Schafer, who was a telephone expert. It may be that one or two others were there as well, but I can no longer remember their names.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The preceding witness has already told us about the tasks of the regimental staff. How were the activities of the regimental staff controlled?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The regiment, which consisted of 10 to 12 companies, had to give an exact report each evening as to what work had been allotted to the various companies. This was necessary as we had to know what forces were available in case of emergency, for undertaking any new tasks.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How far away from the Dnieper Castle were you billeted?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Approximately 4 to 5 kilometers. I cannot give you the exact distance as I always made it by car, but it would be about 4 to 5 kilometers.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you frequently go to Dnieper Castle?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Very frequently when I was off duty, as I had belonged to this regiment and knew most of the officers, with whom I was on friendly terms.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell us about the kind and extent of the traffic to the Dnieper Castle?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN. In order to judge this you have to differentiate between persons and things. So far as people were concerned, the traffic was very lively because the regiment had to be very centrally organized in order to be equal to its tasks. Therefore, many couriers came and commanders of the various companies frequently came to visit the regimental staff.</P>

<P>On the other hand there was a heavy traffic of trucks and passenger cars, because the regiment tried to improve its billets there; and since we remained there for some time all sorts of building alterations were carried out in the house.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear anything about there being three Russian camps with captured Polish officers, 25 to 45 kilometers west of Smolensk, which had allegedly fallen into German hands?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I never heard anything about any kind of Polish officers' camps or Polish prisoner-of-war camps.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did your army group receive reports about the capture of such Polish officers?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: No. I would have noticed that, since the number of prisoners, and especially the number of officers, was always submitted to me in the evening reports of the armies which took these prisoners. It was our responsibility to receive these signal reports and we therefore saw them every evening.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: You did not receive a report to that effect?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I neither saw such a report from an army, which would have issued it, nor did I ever receive a report from an army group which would have had to transmit this report in their evening bulletin to the High Command of the Army (OKH).</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Could a report like that have been handed in from another source or been sent to another office?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The official channel in the Army was very stringent, and the staffs saw to it that official channels were strictly adhered to. In any case the armies were always required to make the detailed reports, following the lines stipulated in the form sheets and this applied especially to the figures concerning prisoners. Therefore, it is quite out of the question that if such a number of officers had fallen into the hands of an army, it would not have reported the matter through the appropriate channel.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: You said, just a little while ago, that you were in particularly close relationship with the officers of this regiment. Did you ever hear that Polish prisoners of war, officers, were shot at some time or other in the Katyn forest at the instigation of Regiment 537 under Colonel Bedenck or under Colonel Ahrens?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I knew nearly all the officers of the regiment, as I myself had been over a year with the regiment, and I was on such-familiar terms with most of the officers that they told me everything that took place, even anything of an unofficial nature. Therefore, it is quite out of the question that such an important matter should not have come to my knowledge. From the nature of the whole character moulding in the regiment, it is quite impossible that there should not have been at least one who would have come to tell me about it immediately.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were all the operational orders for Regiment 537 officially known to you?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The operational orders for this army group Signal regiment were twofold: The orders which concerned only the wireless company and those which applied to the nine telephone companies. Since I was a telephone expert, it was quite natural for me to draft these orders and submit them to my superior, General Oberhauser. Therefore, each order which was issued had either been drafted by me or I had seen it beforehand.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was there ever at any time an order given out by your office to shoot Polish prisoners of war?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Such an order was neither given to the regiment by our office nor by any other office. Neither did we receive a report to this effect, nor did we hear about things like that through any other channel.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: If an order like that came through official channels, it could come only through you?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: This order would have necessitated a great many members of the regiment being taken away from their own duties, which were to safeguard the system of communications. As we were very short of signallers, we had to know what almost every man in the regiment was doing. It would have been quite out of the question for any member of the regiment to have been taken away from such a duty without our knowledge.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kranzbuhler, whom are you appearing on behalf of?</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: For Grossadmiral Donitz, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: There is no charge made against Grossadmiral Donitz in connection with this offense at all.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Mr. President, the exhumations and the propaganda connected with them occurred during the period when Grossadmiral Donitz was Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The Prosecution alleges that at that time Grossadmiral Donitz was a member of the Cabinet and had participated in all acts taken by the Government. Therefore, I must consider him as being implicated in all the problems arising out of the Katyn case.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That would mean that we should have to hear examination from everybody who was connected with the Government. And the Tribunal has already pointed out, with reference to Admiral Raeder, that his case was not connected with this matter. It is only when a case is directly connected with the matter that counsel for the individual defendants are allowed to crossexamine, in addition to the defendant's counsel who calls the witness. If there is any suggestion that you want to make to the counsel who is calling the witness, you can make it to him, but you are not entitled...</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: But I am asking your permission to put two or three questions to this witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: If you have any special questions to put, you may suggest them to Dr. Stahmer, and Dr. Stahmer will put them. Dr. Kranzbuhler, if you want to put any questions, you may put them to Dr. Stahmer, and he will put them to the witness.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Mr. President, I did not quite understand. Shall I propose to Dr. Stahmer to put the questions or...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: If you cannot do it verbally, you may do it in writing, and you may do it later on. But I really do not think there can be any questions which are so difficult to suggest to Dr. Stahmer as all that.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: They can also be put through Dr. Stahmer. I was only thinking that I would save some time by putting the questions myself.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I told you if you wish to ask any questions, you must ask them through Dr. Stahmer.</P>

<P>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBUHLER: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: In the meantime, the Tribunal will go on with the cross-examination, and any questions which you wish to put can be put in re-examination.</P>

<P>Does the prosecution wish to cross-examine?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, I am interested to know your exact function in the army. Were you in charge of teleprinter communications at the headquarters of Army Group Center or were you a wireless expert?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: No, Mr. Prosecutor, you are wrong. I was the telephone expert of Army Group Center, not the wireless expert.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is exactly what I am asking you. The translation was evidently incorrect. So you were in charge of telephone communications, were you not?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Yes; you are right.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Ordinary telegrams, or ciphered telegrams?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The task of a telephone expert connected with an army group consisted in keeping the telephone lines intact . . .</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am not interested in the tasks in a general way. I would like to know whether these were secret ciphered telegrams or the ordinary army mail, army communications which were not secret.</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: There were two kinds of telegrams, open and secret.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were secret telegrams transmitted by you, too?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Both came through me.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, all communications between the Wehrmacht, between Army units and the highest police authorities also passed through you; is that correct?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: The most important telegrams, and especially the secret ones were submitted to the telephone expert.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes. Consequently, the correspondence between the police authorities and the Armed Forces units passed through you; is that correct? I am asking you this question for a second time.</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I must answer with the reservation that the messages did not pass through the telephone expert, but only the most important secret teletype matters were submitted to him not the whole correspondence, because that went also through the mail as well as by courier service.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is clear. Do you know in this case that in September and 10/1941 there were special detachments in Smolensk whose duty, in close co-operation with the Army, was to carry out the so-called purge of the prisoner-of-war camps and the extermination of prisoners of war?</P>

<P>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I must decisively object to this questioning of the witness. This questioning can have only the purpose of determining the relations between the General Staff and the OKW and any commands of the Security Service. Therefore, they are accusing the General Staff and the OKW; and if I, Mr. President, as defense counsel for the General Staff and l.he OKW am not permitted to put questions, then on the basis of equal treatment, the same rules must apply to the Prosecution as well.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I, Mr. President, make a short statement?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, the question is competent.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I beg your pardon.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I said the question was competent. You may ask the question.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like to ask you the following question, Witness. Since all secret teletypes passed through you, did you ever encounter among these telegrams any from the so-called 1st Einsatzgruppe "Bthat was the so-called first commandor from the Special Command "Moscow" which at that time was located at Smolensk and kept in reserve in anticipation of better times? The latter had the order to perpetrate mass murders in Moscow. Both commands were located at Smolensk at that time.</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: No such reports came into my hands. I can fully explain this to you, Mr. Prosecutor. When any detachments of this sort had been established in the area of Army Group Center, these detachments had their own wireless stations. It was only later on in the course of the Russian campaign that these posts had teletype facilities as well; then they used the army group network. However, that only happened later</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the telegrams of those special units which, by order of high police authorities, were assigned to carry out special actions in co-operation with military units, did not pass through your hands in September and 10/1941?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: That is correct. At that time, there were no teletype facilities and offices for such special units, even if they were in that area at all.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, this document was already presented to the Court together with the Extraordinary State Commission Report, Document Number USSR-3. If the High Tribunal will permit it, I should like to present to the Tribunal and to the Defense photostatic copies of one of the documents which was attached to the report of the Extraordinary State Commission. If the Tribunal will look at Page 2 of this document, it w-ill see that the Special Command "Moscow" and the Einsatzgruppe "B" were both located in Smolensk. It says on the first page that these detachments together with units of the Armed Forces, were assigned to carry out mass killings in the camps. If the Tribunal will permit me, I shall submit this document now...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, that is a matter of argument. We shall take judicial notice of it, of course, of everything which is in the Soviet Government's publication. And I understand You to say that this document is a part of the Soviet Government communication or Soviet Government report.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President; but I would like to ask permission to present an original German document, a secret document, which states that in the Smolensk area there were two large special commands whose duties were to carry out mass murders in the camps, and that these actions had to be carried out together with the Armed Forces units which had to co-operate with them.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, is this document which you have just handed up to us a part of the report USSR-3?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr.President, it is a part of the report, Document USSR-3, called "Special Directives of the Hitler Government Concerning the Annihilation of Prisoners of War." I would like to ask the Tribunal to allow me to present one of the original documents even if the report, USSR-3, has been already submitted in full.</P>

<P>It says there that these special units were located in Smolensk and were assigned together with the Armed Forces units to carry out mass killings in the camps.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Colonel Smirnov. This document is already in evidence, if the Tribunal understands correctly.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Consequently, we may consider it as an established fact that the correspondence, the telegraphic messages of these special detachments did not pass through your hands; is that correct?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: He has said that twice already.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Why did you assert with such certainty that there were no reports about the killing of the Poles? You know that the killing of the Polish prisoners of war was a special action, and any report about this action would have to pass through your hands? Is that correct?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I answered the prosecutorrather, I answered Dr. Stahmerthat if in the area of Army Group Signal Regiment 537 killings of that sort had taken place, I would undoubtedly have known about them. I did not state what the prosecutor is now trying to ascribe to me.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, the Tribunal think you had better read this passage from this document, which is in the German language, to the Tribunal so that it will go into the record.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In this document, Mr. President, it is stated...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Colonel Smirnov.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>This document is dated "Berlin, 10/29/1941." It is headed, "The Chief of the Security Police and of the Security Service." It has a classification, "Top Secret; Urgent letter; Operational Order Number-14." Reference is made to decrees of 7/17/1941 and 9/12/1941. I shall now read a few short sentences, and I shall begin with the first sentence:</P>

<P>"In the appendix, I am sending directions for the evacuation of Soviet civilian prisoners and prisoners of war out of permanent prisoner-of-war camps and transit camps in the rear of the Army...</P>

<P>"These directives have been worked out in collaboration with the Army High Command. The Army High Command has notified the commanders of the armies in the rear as well as the local commanders of the prisoner-of-war camps and of the transit camps.</P>

<P>"The task force groups, depending on the size of the camp in their territory, are setting up special commands in sufficient strength under the leadership of an SS leader. The commands are instructed immediately to start work in the camps."</P>

<P>I break off here, and will continue reading the last paragraph:</P>

<P>I emphasize especially that Operational Orders Number 8 and 14 as well as the appendix are to be destroyed immediately in the case of immediate danger."</P>

<P>I shall finish my reading and now I shall only mention the distribution list. On Page 2 I quote the part concerning Smolensk. It says here that in Smolensk the Einsatzgruppe "B" was located, consisting of Special Commands 7a, 7b, 8, and 9; and in addition to this, there was already located in Smolensk a special command, which had been rather prematurely named "Moscow" by its organizers.</P>

<P>These are the contents of the document, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal directs that the whole document shall be translated. We will now recess until 5 minutes past 2 o'clock.</P>

<P>[The Tribunal recessed until 1405 hours.][=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no more questions to put to this witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, do you know who owned that little castle near the Dnieper before the occupation by German troops? Who owned it, who lived there?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: I cannot say that for certain. We noticed that the little castle was astonishingly well furnished. It was very well laid out. It had two bathrooms, a rifle range, and a cinema. We drew certain conclusions therefrom, when the facts became known, but I do not know anything about the previous owner.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The Russian Prosecutor submitted to you a document dated 10/29/1941, "Directives to the Chief of the Sipo for the Detachments in the Stalags." With reference to that document, I want to ask you whether you had an opportunity personally to ascertain the attitude of Field Marshal Kluge, your commander of Army Group Center, regarding the shooting of prisoners of war?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: By chance I became the ear-witness of a conversation between the Commanders Bock and Kluge. That conversation took place about 3 or 4 weeks before the beginning of the Russian campaign. I cannot tell you the exact time. At the time Field Marshal Von Bock was the commander of Army Group Center, and Field Marshal Von Kluge was commander of the 4th Army. The army group was in Posen and the 4th Army at Warsaw. One day I was called by the aide-de-camp of Field Marshal Von Bock, who was Lieutenant Colonel Count Hardenberg. He gave me the order...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: These details are entirely irrelevant, aren't they. All you want to ask him is: What was the attitude of Von Kluge? That is all.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The answer did not come through. I did not understand what you said, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What I said was that all these details about the particular place where Von Kluge met some other army group commander are utterly irrelevant. All you are trying to ask him is: What was Von Kluge's attitude toward the murder of war prisoners? Isn't that all?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Will you answer the question briefly, Witness. Please just tell us what Von Kluge said.</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: Von Kluge told Von Bock, during a telephone conversation, that the order for the shooting of certain prisoners of war was an impossibility and could not be carried out, with regard to the discipline of the troops. Von Bock shared this point of view and both these gentlemen talked for half an hour about the measures which they wanted to adopt against this order.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: According to the allegations of the Prosecution, the shooting of these 11000 Polish officers is supposed to have been carried out sometime in 9/1941. The question now is: Do you consider it possible, in view of local conditions, that such mass shootings and burials could have been carried out next door to the regimental headquarters without you yourself having heard about it?</P>

<P>VON EICHBORN: We were very busy in preparation for the move of the army group to Smolensk. We had assigned a great number of signal troops for setting up perfect installations. On the entire site there was a constant going and coming of troops laying cables and telephone lines. It is out of the question that anything of this kind could have occurred in that particular area without the regiment and I getting knowledge of it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions to put to the witness, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, before calling my third witness, Lieutenant General Oberhauser, may I ask your permission to make the following remarks?</P>

<P>The Prosecution has up to now only alleged that Regiment Number 537 was the one which had carried out these shootings and that under Colonel Ahrens' command. Today again, Colonel Ahrens has been named by the Prosecution as being the perpetrator. Apparently this allegation has been dropped and it has been said that if it was not Ahrens then it must have been his predecessor, Colonel Bedenck; and if Colonel Bedenck did not do it, then apparentlyand this seems to be the third versionit was done by the SD. The Defense had taken the position solely that Colonel Ahrens was accused as the perpetrator and it has refuted that allegation. Considering the changed situation and the attitude adopted by the Prosecution, I shall have to name a fourth witness in addition. That is First Lieutenant Hodt, who has been mentioned today as the perpetrator and who was with the regimental staff right from the beginning and who was, as we have told, the senior of the advance party which arrived at the Dnieper Castle in July. I got the address of First Lieutenant Hodt by chance yesterday. He is at Glucksburg near Flensburg, and I, therefore, ask to be allowed to name as a witness First Lieutenant Hodt, who will give evidence that during the time between July and September such shootings did not occur.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal will consider your application, when they adjourn at half past 3, with reference to this extra witness.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Sir. Then I shall now call Lieutenant General Oberhauser as witness.</P>

<P>[The witness Oberhauser took the stand.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</P>

<P>EUGEN OBERHAUSER (Witness): Eugen Oberhauser.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear by Godthe Almighty and Omniscientthat I will speak the pure truthand will withhold and add nothing.</P>

<P>[The witness repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: General, what position did you hold during the war?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I was the signal commander in an army group, first of all during the Polish campaign, in Army Group North; then, in the Western campaign Army Group B; and then in Russia Army Group Center.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: When did you and your staff reach the neighborhood of Katyn?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Sometime during 9/1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Where was your staff located?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: My staff was located in the immediate vicinity of the commander of the army group; that is to say, about 12 kilometers west of Smolensk, near the railroad station of Krasnibor.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was Regiment Number 537 under your command?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Regiment 537 was directly under my command.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What task did that regiment have?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: That regiment had the task of establishing both telegraph and wireless communications between the command of the army group and the various armies and other units which were directly under its command.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was the staff of the regiment stationed near you?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The staff of that regiment was located about 3, perhaps 4 kilometers west from my own position.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us more detailed information regarding the exact location of the staff headquarters of Number 537?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The staff headquarters of 537 was in a very nice Russian timber house. Commissars were supposed to have been living there before. It was on the steep bank of the Dnieper River. It was somewhat off the road, perhaps 400 to 500 meters away. It was, from my place, 4 kilometers west of the main highway Smolensk to Vitebsk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Who was the commanding officer of the regiment after the capture of Smolensk?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: After the capture of Smolensk, Colonel Bedenck was the commander of the regiment.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: For how long?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Until about 11/1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Who was his successor?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: His successor was Colonel Ahrens.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How long?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Approximately until Septemberit may have been August1943.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were you near Katyn as long as that, too?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I was there until the command of the army group transferred its headquarters farther west.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What were your relations with the commanders of this regiment?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: My relations with the regimental commanders were most hearty, both officially and privately, which is due to the fact that I had been the first commander of that regiment. I myself had formed the regiment and I was most attached to it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you personally visit the little Dnieper Castle frequently?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I went to the Dnieper Castle frequently; I can well say in normal times once or twice a week.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did the commanders visit you in the meantime?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The commanders came to see me more frequently than I went to see them.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you know anything about the fact that near Smolensk, about 25 to 45 kilometers to the west, there were three Russian camps which contained Polish prisoners of war...</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I knew nothing of that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: . . . who had fallen into the hands of the Germans?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I never heard anything about it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was there an order, which is supposed to have come from Berlin, that Polish officers who were prisoners of war were to be shot?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: No, such an order was never issued.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you yourself ever give such an order?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I have never given such an order.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether Colonel Bedenck or Colonel Ahrens ever caused such shootings to be carried out?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I am not informed, but I consider it absolutely impossible.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Why?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: First, because such a decisive order would necessarily have\gone through me, for I was the direct superior of the regiment; and second, because if such an order had been given, for a reason which I could not understand, and transmitted to the regiment through some obscure channel, then the commanders would most certainly have rung me up or they would have come to see me and said, "General, they are asking something here which we cannot understand."</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know First Lieutenant Hodt?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Yes, I know him.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What position did he have in Regiment 537?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Hodt held various posts in the regiment. Usually, he was sent ahead because he was a particularly qualified officerespecially in regard to technical qualificationsin order to make preparations when headquarters was being changed. He was therefore used as advance party of the so-called technical company in order to establish the new command posts; and then he was the regimental expert for the telephone system, dealing with all matters relating to the telephone and teletype system with the command headquarters of the army group. In my staff he was occasionally detailed to fill the positions of any of my officers when they were on leave.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was he also in charge of the advance party during the advance on Katyn?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: That I cannot say. I can only say that I personally heard from my staff signal commander that he had sent an officer ahead, after it had been ascertained how the headquarters were to be laid out, that this officer was acting on my behalf, as at the time I still remained in the old quarters, and he was preparing things in the way I wanted them from the point of view of the signal commander. I do not know who was in charge of that advance party at the time, but it is quite possible that it was First Lieutenant Hodt.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were you in Katyn or the vicinity during the period after the capture of Smolensk, which was, I believe, on or about 7/20/1941, and up to the transfer of your staff to Katyn on 20 September?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I was in the vicinity. I was where the headquarters of the army group wanted to settle down; that is, in the woods west of Smolensk, where Katyn is located.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were you frequently there during that time?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I should say three or four times.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you talk to Hodt on those occasions?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: If he was the officer in charge of the advance party, which I cannot say today, then I must certainly have talked to him. At any rate, I did talk to the officer whom I had sent ahead and also to the one from my regiment.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear anything about shootings occurring during that time?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I heard nothing, nor did I hear anything at all except in 1943, when the graves were opened.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you or Regiment 537 have the necessary technical means, pistols, ammunition, and so on, at your disposal which would have made it possible to carry out shootings on such a scale?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The regiment, being a signal regiment in the rear area, was not equipped with weapons and ammunition as well as the actual fighting troops. Such a task, however, would have been something unusual for the regiment; first, because a signal regiment has completely different tasks, and secondly it would not have been in a position technically to carry out such mass executions.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know the place where these graves were discovered later on?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I know the site because I drove past it a great deal.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you describe it more accurately?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Taking the main road Smolensk-Vitebsk, a path led through wooded undulating ground. There were sandy spaces, which were, however, covered with scrub and heather, and along that narrow path one got to the Dnieper Castle from the main road.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were the places where these graves were later discovered already overgrown when you got there?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: They were overgrown just like the surrounding ground, and there was no difference between them and the rest of the surroundings.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In view of your knowledge of the place, would you consider it possible that 11000 Poles could have been buried at that spot, people who may have been shot between June and 9/1941?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I consider that it is out of the question, for the mere reason that if the commander had known it at the time he would certainly never have chosen this spot for his headquarters, next to 11000 dead.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell me how the graves were discovered?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Officially I had nothing to do with that. I only heard that through local inhabitants or somebody else it had become known that large-scale executions had taken place there years ago.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: From whom did you hear that?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Quite probably from the commander himself, who, because he was located on the spot, had heard more about it than I had. But I cannot remember exactly now.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: So you did not receive official notice about the discovery of the graves, did you?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: No, I never did.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: After the opening of the graves, did you talk to the German or foreign members of the commission?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: I have never talked to any members of that commission.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, you arrived in the region of Katyn in 9/1943?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: 1941, not 1943.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, I meant 9/1941. Is that correct?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Yes, 9/1941.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you contend that you did not know anything either about the camps for Polish prisoners of war or the prisoners in the hands of the German troops, is that so?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I have never heard anything about Polish prisoners of war being in the hands of German troops.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand that this had no relation to your official activity as the commander of a signal regiment. But in spite of this you may perhaps have witnessed that various German troops combed the woods in the vicinity of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway to capture Polish prisoners of war who had escaped from the camps?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I never heard anything about troops going there in order to, shall we say, recapture escaped Polish prisoners of war. I am hearing this here for the first time.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer me. Have you perhaps seen German military units escorting Polish prisoners of war who were captured in the woods?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I have not seen that.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the following question: You were on good terms with Colonel Ahrens, were you not?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I have had good relations with all commanders of the regiment.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And in addition to that, you were his immediate superior?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Right.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Colonel Ahrens found out about the mass graves at the end of 1941 or at the beginning of 1942. Did he tell you anything about his discovery?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot believe that Colonel Ahrens could have discovered the graves in 1941. I cannot imagine thatI especially cannot imagine that he would tell me nothing about it.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In any case do you contend that neither in 1942 nor in 1943 did Colonel Ahrens report to you in regard to this affair?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Colonel Ahrens never told me anything about it, and he would have told me if he had known.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am interested in the following answer which you gave to a question by defense counsel. You remarked that the signal regiment had not enough weapons to carry out shootings. What do you mean by that? How many, and what kind of weapons did the regiment possess?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The signal regiment were mostly equipped with pistols and with carbines. They had no automatic arms.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Pistols? Of what caliber?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: They were Parabellum pistols. The caliber, I think, was 7.65, but I cannot remember for certain.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Parabellum pistols, 7.65, or were there Mauser pistols or any other kind of weapons?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: That varied. Noncommissioned officers, as far as I know, had the smaller Mauser pistols. Actually, only noncommissioned officers were equipped with pistols. The majority of the men had carbines.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to tell us some more about the pistols. You say that they were 7.65 caliber pistols, is that so?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot now, at the moment, give you exact information about the caliber. I only know that the Parabellum pistol was 7.65 or some such caliber. I think the Mauser pistol had a somewhat smaller caliber.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And Walter pistols?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: There were also Walters. I think they had the same caliber as the Mauser. It is a smaller, black pistol; and it is better than the somewhat cumbersome Parabellum pistol which is heavier.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is quite correct. Please tell me whether in this regiment the noncommissioned officers possessed those small pistols.</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: As a rule, noncommissioned officers had pistols but not carbines.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I see. Perhaps you can tell us about how many pistols this signal regiment possessed?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Of course I cannot tell you that now. Let us assume that every noncommissioned officer had a pistol...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And how many noncommissioned officers were there? How many pistols in all were there in your regiment if you consider that every noncommissioned officer had a pistol?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Assuming that every noncommissioned officer in the regiment had a pistol that would amount to 15 per company, a total of 150. However, to give a definite statement about that figure retrospectively now is impossible. I can only give you clues.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why do you consider that 150 pistols would be insufficient to carry out these mass killings which went on over a period of time? What makes you so positive about that?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Because a signal regiment of an army group deployed over a large area as in the case of Army Group Center is never together as a unit. The regiment was spread out from Kolodov as far as Vitebsk, and there were small detachments everywhere, and in the headquarters of the regiment there were comparatively .few people; in other words, there were never 150 pistols in one and the same place.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The main part of the signal regiment was located in the Katyn woods, was it not?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: I did not understand your question.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The main portions of your regiment were located in the Katyn woods, were they not?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: The first company was mainly located between the regimental staff quarters and the actual command post of the army group. That was the company which was handling the communications, the telephone and teleprinted communications for the army group. It was the company, therefore, which was nearest.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One more question. The officers of your regiment were obviously armed with pistols and not with carbines?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Officers had pistols only, and as a rule they only had small ones. Possibly one or the other may have had a Parabellum pistol.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say either a Walter or a Mauser?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you frequently visit the villa where the headquarters of Regiment 537 was located?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Yes, I was there at least once, sometimes twice, a week.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you ever interested as to why soldiers from other military units visited the villa in Kozy Gory and why special beds were prepared for them as well as drinks and food?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: I cannot imagine that there were any large scale visits of other soldiers or members of other units. I do not know anything about that.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am not speaking about a great number. I am speaking of 20 or sometimes 25 men.</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: If the regimental commander summoned his company and detachment commanders for an officers' meeting, then, of course, there would be a few dozen of such officers who normally would not be seen there.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am not talking about officers who belonged to the unit. I would like to ask you another somewhat different question. Would the number 537 appear on the shoulder straps of the soldiers belonging to that regiment?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: As far as I recollect the number was on the shoulder straps, but at the beginning of the war it could be concealed by a camouflage flap. I cannot remember whether during that particular period these covers were used or not. At any rate at the street entrance to the regimental headquarters there was a black-yellow-black flag, which bore the number 537.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am speaking of soldiers who came to the villa in Kozy Gory, and who did not have the number 537 on their shoulder straps. Were you ever interested in finding out what those soldiers did there in September and 10/1941? Did the commander of the unit report to you about this?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: May I ask what year this was supposed to be, 1941?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, 1941, that is the year which is concerned.</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I do not think that at that time there was much coming and going of outsiders at staff headquarters because during that period everything was in course of construction and I cannot imagine that other units, even small groups of 20 or 25 people should have been there. I personally, as I have told you, was there only once or twice weekly, and not before September or October.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Beginning with what date of September did you start visiting there? You said it was in September but not from what date.</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot tell you. The commander of the army group moved at the end of September from Borossilov, shortly before the battle of Vyazma, which was on 2 October, into that district.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, you could start visiting this villa for instance only at the end of September or the beginning of 10/1941?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: It was only then that the little castle was finally occupied, for the regiment did not arrive much earlier than we from the command of the army group.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, is it necessary to go into this detail? Have you any particular purpose in going into so much detail?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr.President, I ask this question for the following reasons: Later we shall interrogate witnesses for the Soviet Prosecution on the same point and particularly the chief of the medico-legal investigation. That is why I would like to ask the permission of the Court to clarify this point concerning the time when the witness visited the villa. That will be my last question to this point.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, very well. Do not go into greater detail than you find absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, at the beginning of September and the first part of 10/1941 you were not in the villa of Katyn woods and you could not be there at the time, is that true?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot remember that exactly. The regimental commander had spotted the little castle and set it up for his staff headquarters. When exactly he moved in I cannot know, because I had other jobs to do.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I asked whether you personally could not have been in the villa during the first part of September. Could you not possibly have been there before 20 September?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I do not think so.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to re-examine, Dr. Stahmer?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Unfortunately, Mr. President, I shall have to come back to the question of time because it was not brought out too clearly during these last questions.</P>

<P>When did Regiment 537 move into the castle?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I assume it was during September.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Beginning or end of September?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: Probably rather more toward the end of September.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Until then only the advance party was there, or . . .</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: The advance party of the regiment was there and my officers whom I had sent ahead.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How many noncommissioned officers were with the advance party?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot tell you exactly how many the regiment sent. I personally had sent one officer. Generally the regiment could not have sent very many. As a rule, as is always the case, the regiment was still operating at the old command post in Borossilov and simultaneously it had to set up the new post. Consequently, during this period of regrouping, on the point of moving a command of an army group, there is always a considerable shortage of men. The old headquarters still has to be looked after, the new post requires men for its construction, so that as always during this period there were certainly too few people.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you not even give us an estimate of the figure of that advance party?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: There were 30, 40, or 50 men.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How many noncommissioned officers?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Probably one or two officers, a few noncommissioned officers, and some men.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The regiment was very widely spread out, was it not?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How far, approximately?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: In the entire area of Army Group Center, shall we say between Orel and Vitebskin that entire area they were widely dispersed.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How many kilometers was that, approximately?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: More than 500 kilometers.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know Judge Advocate General Dr. Konrad of Army Group Center?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether, in 1943, he interrogated the local inhabitants under oath about the date when the Polish officers were supposed to have been shot in the woods of Katyn?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: No, I do not know.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Were there any Einsatzkommandos in the Katyn area during the time that you were there?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Nothing has ever come to my knowledge about that.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Did you ever hear of an order to shoot Soviet commissars?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: I only knew of that by hearsay.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: When?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Probably at the beginning of the Russian campaign, I think.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Before the campaign started or after?</P>

<P>OBERHAUSER: I cannot remember having heard anything like that before the beginning of the campaign.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Who was to carry out that order?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Strictly speaking, signal troops are not really fighting troops. Therefore, they really had nothing to do with that at all, and therefore we were in no way affected by the order.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I did not ask you that. I asked you who had to carry out the order.</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: Those who came into contact with these people, presumably.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Anybody who came in contact with Russian commissars had to kill them; is that it?</P>

<P>OBERHUSER: No, I assume that it was the troops, the fighting troops, the actual fighting troops at the front who first met the enemy. That could only have applied to the army group. The signal regiment never came into a position to meet commissars. That is probably why they were not mentioned in the order or affected by it in any way.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I ask permission to call as witness the former deputy mayor of the city of Smolensk during the German occupation, Professor of Astronomy, Boris Bazilevsky.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, let him come in then.</P>

<P>[The witness Bazilevsky took the stand.]</P>

<P>Will you state your full name, please?</P>

<P>BORIS BAZILEVSKY (Witness): Boris Bazilevsky.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you make this form of oath: I, a citizen of the USSRcalled as a witness in this casesolemnly promise and swear before the High Tribunalto say all that I know about this caseand to add or to withhold nothing.</P>

<P>[The witness repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: With the permission of the Tribunal, I should like to start with my interrogation, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell us, Witness, what your activity was before the German occupation of the city and district of Smolensk and where you were living in Smolensk.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Before the occupation of Smolensk and the surrounding region...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: . . . I lived in the city of Smolensk and was professor first at the Smolensk University and then of the Smolensk Pedagogical Institute, and at the same time I was director of the Smolensk Astronomical Observatory. For 10 years I was the dean of the physics and mathematics faculty, and in the last years I was deputy to the director of the scientific department of the Institute.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many years did you live in Smolensk previous to the German occupation?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: From 1919.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know what the so-called Katyn wood was?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Actually, it was a grove. It was the favorite resort of the inhabitants of Smolensk who spent their holidays and vacations there.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was this wood before the war a special reservation which was fenced or guarded by armed patrols, by watch dogs?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: During the many years that I lived in Smolensk, this place was never fenced; and no restrictions were ever placed on access to it. I personally used to go there very frequently. The last time I was there was in 1940 and in the spring of 1941. In this wood there was also a camp for engineers. Thus, there was free access to this place for everybody.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me in what year there was an engineer camp?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: As far as I know, it was there for many years.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Professor, will you wait a minute, please? When you see that yellow light go on, it means that you are going too fast; and when you are asked a question, will you pause before you answer it? Do you understand?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please repeat your answer, and very slowly, if you please.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: The last time I know that the engineer camp was in the area of the Katyn wood was in 1941.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, if I understand you correctly, in 1940 and 1941 before the beginning of the war at any rateand you speak of the spring of 1941the Katyn wood was not a special reservation and was accessible to everybody?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes. I say that that was the situation.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you say this as an eyewitness or from hearsay?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, I say it as an eyewitness who used to go there frequently.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell the Tribunal under what circumstances you became the first deputy mayor of Smolensk during the period of the German occupation. Please speak slowly.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I was an administration official; and I did not have an opportunity of leaving the place in time, because I was busy in saving the particularly precious library of the Institute and the very valuable equipment. In the circumstances I could not try to escape before the evening of the 15th, but then I did not succeed in catching the train. I therefore decided to leave the city on 16 July in the morning, but during the night of 15 to 16 the city was unexpectedly occupied by German troops. All the bridges across the Dnieper were blown up, and I found myself in captivity.</P>

<P>After some time, on 20 July, a group of German soldiers came to the observatory of which I was the director. They took down that I was the director and that I was living there and that there was also a professor of physics, Efimov, living in the same building.</P>

<P>In the evening of 20 July two German officers came to me and brought me to the headquarters of the unit which had occupied Smolensk. After checking my personalia and after a short conversation, they suggested that I become mayor of the city. I refused, basing my refusal on the fact that I was a professor of astronomy and that, as I had no experience in such matters, I could not undertake this post. They then declared categorically and with threats, "We are going to force the Russian intelligentsia to work."[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thus, if I understand you correctly the Germans forced you by threats to become the deputy mayor of Smolensk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKy: That is not all. They told me also that in a few days I would be summoned to the Kommandantur.</P>

<P>On 25 July a man in civilian clothes appeared at my apartment, accompanied by a German policeman, and represented himself as a lawyer Menschagin. He declared that he came by order of the military headquarters and that I should accompany him immediately to headquarters.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You are spending a lot of time on how he came to be mayor of Smolensk.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please allow me to pass to other questions, Mr. President? Thank you for your observations.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Who was your immediate superior? Who was the mayor of Smolensk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What were the relations between this man and the German administration and particularly with the German Kommandantur?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: These relations were very good and became closer and closer every day.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Is it correct to say that Menschagin was the trustee of the German administration and that they even gave him secret information?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know that in the vicinity of Smolensk there were Polish prisoners of war?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I do very well.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know what they were doing?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know what this is going to prove. You presumably do, but can you not come nearer to the point?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He said that he knew there were Polish prisoners of war in Smolensk; and, with the permission of the Tribunal, I would like to ask the witness what these prisoners of war were doing.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Very well; go on.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer. What were the Polish prisoners of war doing in the vicinity of Smolensk, and at what time?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: In the spring of 1941 and at the beginning of the summer they were working on the restoration of the roads, Moscow-Minsk and Smolensk-Vitebsk.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What do you know about the further fate of the Polish prisoners of war?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Thanks to the position that I occupied, I learned very early about the fate of the Polish prisoners of war.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell the Tribunal what you know about it.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: In the camp for Russian prisoners of war known "Gulag 126" there prevailed such a severe regime that prisoners war were dying by the hundreds every day; for this reason I tried to free all those from this camp for whose release a reason could be given. I learned that in this camp there was also a very well-known pedagogue named Zhiglinski. I asked Menschagin to make representations to the German Kommandantur of Smolensk, and in particular to Von Schwetz, and to plead for the release of Zhiglinski from this camp.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please do not go into detail and do not waste time, but tell the Tribunal about your conversation with Menschagin. What did he tell you?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin answered my request with, "What is the use? We can save one, but hundreds will die." However, I insisted; and Menschagin, after some hesitation, agreed to put this request to the German Kommandantur.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please be short and tell us what Menschagin told you when he came back from the German Kommandantur.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Two days later he told me that he was in a very difficult situation on account of my demand. Von Schwet had refused the request by referring to an instruction from Berlin saying that a very severe regime should prevail with respect to prisoners of war.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What did he tell you about Polish prisoners of war?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: As to Polish prisoners of war, he told me that Russians would at least be allowed to die in the camps while there were proposals to exterminate the Poles.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What else was said?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I replied, "What do you mean? What do you want to say? How do you understand this?" And Menschagin answered "You should understand this in the very literal sense of these words. He asked me not to tell anybody about it, since it was a great secret.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When did this conversation of yours take place with Menschagin? In what month, and on what day?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: This conversation took place at the beginning of September. I cannot remember the exact date.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But you remember it was the beginning of September?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you ever come back again to the fate of Polish prisoners of war in your further conversations with Menschagin?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Can you tell us when?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Two weeks laterthat is to say, at the end of SeptemberI could not help asking him, "What was the fate of the Polish prisoners of war?" At first Menschagin hesitated, and then he told me haltingly, "They have already died. It is all over for them."</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did he tell you where they were killed?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: He told me that they had been shot in the vicinity of Smolensk, as Von Schwetz told him.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did he mention the exact place?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, he did not mention the exact place.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me this. Did you, in turn, tell anybody about the extermination, by Hitlerites, of the Polish prisoners of war near Smolensk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I talked about this to Professor Efimov, who was living in the same house with me. Besides him, a few days later I had a conversation about it with Dr. Nikolski, who was the medical officer of the city. However, I found out that Nikolski knew about this crime already from some other source.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did Menschagin tell you why these shootings took place?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes. When he told me that the prisoners of war had been killed, he emphasized once more the necessity of keeping it strictly secret in order to avoid disagreeable consequences. He started to explain to me the reasons for the German behavior with respect to the Polish prisoners of war. He pointed out that this was only one measure of the general system of treating Polish prisoners of war.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you hear anything about the extermination of the Poles from the employees of the German Kommandantur?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, 2 or 3 days later.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You are both going too fast, and you are not pausing enough. You are putting your questions whilst the answers are coming through. You must have longer pauses, and go slower.</P>

<P>R. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Please continue, but slowly.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know where I was.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked you whether any of the employees of the German Kommandantur told you anything about the extermination of the Poles.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Two or three days later, when I visited the office of Menschagin, I met there an interpreter, the Sonderfuhrer of the 7th Division of the German Kommandantur who was in charge of the Russian administration and who had a conversation with Menschagin concerning the Poles. He came from the Baltic region.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you can tell us briefly what he said.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: When I entered the room he was saying, "The Poles are- a useless people, and exterminated they may serve as fertilizer and for the enlargement of living space for the German nation."[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You are doing exactly what I said just now. You are asking the questions before the translation comes through.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, Mr. President, I will try to speak more slowly.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Did you learn from Menschagin anything definite about the shooting of Polish prisoners of war?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: When I entered the room I heard the conversation with Hirschfeld. I missed the beginning, but from the context of the conversation it was clear that they spoke about this event.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did Menschagin, when telling you about the shooting of Polish prisoners of war, refer to Von Schwetz?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes; I had the impression that he referred to Von Schwetz. But evidentlyand this is my firm beliefhe also spoke about it with private persons in the Kommandantur.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When did Menschagin tell you that Polish prisoners of war were killed near Smolensk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: It was at the end of September.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions to put to this witness, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>MARSHAL: If it please the Tribunal, the Defendant Hess is absent.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, in your testimony, just before recess, you read out your testimony, if I observed correctly. Will you tell me whether that was so or not?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I was not reading anything. I have only a plan of the courtroom in my hand.</P>

<P>DR.STAHMER: It looked to me as though you were reading out your answers. How can you explain the fact that the interpreter already had your answer in his hands?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know how the interpreters could have had my answers beforehand. The testimony which I am giving was, however, known to the Commission beforehandthat is, my testimony during the preliminary examination.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know the little castle on the Dnieper the little villa? Did you not understand me or hear me? Do you know the little castle on the Dnieper, the little villa on the Dnieper?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know which villa you mean. There were quite a number of villas on the Dnieper.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The house which was near the Katyn wood on the steep bank of the Dnieper River.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I still do not quite understand which house you mean. The banks of the Dnieper are long, and therefore your question is quite incomprehensible to me.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know where the graves of Katyn were found, in which 11000 Polish officers were buried?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I was not there. I did not see the Katyn burial grounds.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Had you never been in the Katyn wood?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: As I already said, I was there not once but many times.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know where this mass burial site was located?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: How can I know where the burial grounds were situated when I could not go there since the occupation?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How do you know that the little wood was not fenced in?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Before the occupation of the Smolensk district by the German troops, the entire area, as I already stated, was not surrounded by any barrier; but according to hearsay I knew that after the occupation access to this wood was prohibited by the German local command.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Therefore you have no knowledge of the fact that here in the Katyn wood a sanitarium or a convalescent home of the GPU was located?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I know very well; that was known to all the citizens of Smolensk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Then, of course, you also know exactly which house I referred to in my question?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I, myself, had never been in that house. In general, access to that house was only allowed to the families of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior. As to other persons, there was no need and no facility for them to go there.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The house, therefore, was closed of?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, the house was not forbidden to strangers; but why should people go there if they had no business there or were not in the sanitarium? The garden, of course, was open to the public.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were there not guards stationed there?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I have never seen any.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Is this Russian witness who reported to you about the matter concerning the Polish officers, is this witness still alive?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Mr. Counsel, you probably mean Mayor Menschagin, if I understand you rightly?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: When you read your testimony off, it was not easy for me to follow. What was the mayor's name? Menschagin? Is he still alive?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin went away together with the German troops during their retreat, and I remained, and Menschagin's fate is unknown to me.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, you are not entitled to say to the witness, when you read your testimony off," just now, because he denied that he read his testimony off and there is no evidence that he has read it off.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did this Russian witness tell you that the Polish officers had come from the camp at Kosielsk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean the camp at Kosielsk? Yes?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: The witness did not say that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that place and locality?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean Kosielsk? I do, yes. In 1940, in the month of Augustat the end of AugustI spent my leave there with my wife.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether there were Polish officers at that place in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I know that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Until what time did these prisoners of war remain there?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know that for sure but at the end of 8/1940 they were there. I am quite sure about that.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether this camp, together with its inmates, fell into German hands?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Personally, that is, from my own observation, I do not know it; but according to rumors, it appears to have been the case. That is, of course, not my own testimony; I myself did not see it, but I heard about it only.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear what happened to these prisoners?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I heard, of course, that they remained there and could not be evacuated.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear what became of them?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I have already testified in my answers to the prosecutor that they were shot on the order of the German Command.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: And where did these shootings take place?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Mr. Defense Counsel, you have apparently not heard my answers. I already testified that Mayor Menschagin said that they were shot in the neighborhood of Smolensk, but where he did not tell me.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How many prisoners were involved?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean to say, how many were mentioned in the conversation with Menschagin? I do not understand your question. Do you mean to say according to the reports of Menschagin?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What was the figure given to you by Menschagin?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin did not tell me any number. I repeat that this conversation took place on the last days of 9/1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us the name of an eyewitness who was present at this shooting or anyone who saw this shooting?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I believe that these executions were carried out under such circumstances that I think it scarcely possible that any Russian witnesses could be present.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, you should answer the question directly. You were asked, "Can you give the names of anybody who was there?" You can answer that "yes" or "no" and then you can add any explanations necessary.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I will follow your instructions, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Can you give the name of anybody who saw the executions?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, I cannot name any eyewitness.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What German unit is supposed to have carried out the shootings?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I cannot answer that exactly. It is logical to assume that it was the construction battalion which was stationed there; but of course I could not know the exact organization of the German troops.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did the Poles involved here come from the camp at Kosielsk?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: In general, this was not mentioned in the conversations of that time, but I certainly do not know that; besides these might have been any other Polish prisoners of war who had not been at Kosielsk previously.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you yourself see Polish officers?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: I did not see them myself, but my students saw them, and they told me that they had seen them in 1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: And where did they see them?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: On the road where they were doing repair work at the beginning of summer, 1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In what general area or location?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: In the district of the Moscow-Minsk highway, somewhat to the west of Smolensk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you testify whether the Russian Army Command had a report to the effect that Polish prisoners at the camp at Kosielsk had fallen into the hands of the Germans?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, I have no knowledge of that.</P>

<P>DR.STAHMER: What is the name of the German official or employee with whom you talked at the Kommandantur?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Not in the Kommandantur, but in Menschagin's office. His name was Hirschfeld.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What was his position?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKy: He was Sonderfuhrer of the 7th Detachment of the German Kommandantur in the town of Smolensk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. Presidentjust another question or two, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Were you punished by the Russian Government on account of your collaboration with the German authorities?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: No, I was not.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Are you at liberty?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Not only am I at liberty; but, as I have already stated, I am still professor at two universities.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Therefore, you are back in office.</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, do you wish to re-examine?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to the witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, do you know whether the man, whose name I understand to be Menschagin, was told about these matters or whether he himself had any direct knowledge of them?</P>

<P>BAZILEVSKY: From Menschagin's own words, I understood quite definitely that he had heard those things himself at the Kommandantur, particularly from Von Schwetz, who was the commander from the beginning of the occupation.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I beg the Tribunal to allow me to call as witness Marko Antonov Markov, a Bulgarian citizen, professor at the University of Sofia.</P>

<P>[The interpreter Valev and the witness Markov took the stand.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Are you the interpreter?</P>

<P>LUDOMIR VALEV (Interpreter): Yes, Sir.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give us your full name?</P>

<P>VALEV: Ludomir Valev.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear before God and the Lawthat I will interpret truthfully and to the best of my skillthe evidence to be given by the witness.</P>

<P>[The interpreter repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: [To the witness.] Will you give us your full name, please?</P>

<P>DR. MARKO ANTONOV MARKOV (Witness): Dr. Marko Antonov Markov.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear as a witness in this casethat I will speak only the truthbeing aware of my responsibility before God and the Lawand that I will withhold and add nothing.</P>

<P>[The witness repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</P>

<P>MR. DODD: Mr. President, before this witness is examined, I would like to call to the attention of the Tribunal the fact that Dr. Stahmer asked the preceding witness a question which I understood went: How did it happen that the interpreters had the questions and the answers to your questions if you didn't have them before you? Now that question implied that Dr. Stahmer had some information that the interpreters did have the answers to the questions, and I sent a note up to the interpreters, and I have the answer from the lieutenant in charge that no one there had any answers or questions, and I think it should be made clear on the record.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think so, too.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I was advised of this fact outside the courtroom. If it is not a fact, I wish to withdraw my statement. I was informed outside the courtroom from a trustworthy source. I do not recall the name of the person who told me, I shall have to ascertain it. .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Such statements ought not be made by counsel until they have verified them.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I begin the examination of this witness, Mr. President?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The examination, yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, I beg you to tell us briefly, without taking up the time of the Tribunal with too many details, under what conditions you were included in the so-called International Medical Commission set up by the Germans in the month of 4/1943 for the examination of the graves of Polish officers in the Katyn woods.</P>

<P>I beg you, when answering me, to pause between the question I put to you and your own answer.</P>

<P>MARKov: This occurred at the end of 4/1943. While working in the Medico-Legal Institute, where I am still working, I was called to the telephone by Dr. Guerow.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness must stop before the interpreter begins. Otherwise, the voices come over the microphone together. So the interpreter must wait until the witness has finished his answer before he repeats it.</P>

<P>Now the witness has saidat least this is what I heardthat in 4/1943 he was called on the telephone.</P>

<P>MARKOV: I was called to the telephone by Dr. Guerow, the secretary of Dr. Filoff who was then Prime Minister of Bulgaria. I was told that I was to take part, as representative of the Bulgarian Government, in the work of an international medical commission which had to examine the corpses of Polish officers discovered in the Katyn wood. Not wishing to go, I answered that I had to replace the director of my Institute who was away in the country. Dr. Guerow told me that according to an instruction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who had sent the telegram, it was precisely in order to replace him that I would have to go there. Guerow told me to come to the Ministry. There I asked him if I could refuse to comply with this order. He answered that we were in a state of war and that the Government could send anybody wherever and whenever they deemed it necessary. Guerow took me to the first secretary of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Schuchmanov. Schuchmanov repeated this order and told me that we were to examine the corpses of thousands of Polish officers. I answered that to examine thousands of corpses would take several months, but Schuchmanov said that the Germans had already exhumed a great number of these corpses and that I would have to go, together with other members of the commission, in order to see what had already been done and in order to sign, as Bulgarian representative, the report of the proceedings which had already been drafted. After that, I was taken to the German Legation, to Counsellor Mormann, who arranged all the technical details of the trip. This was on Saturday; and on Monday morning, 26 April, I flew to Berlin. There I was met by an official of the Bulgarian Legation and I was lodged at the Hotel Adlon.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the next question:</P>

<P>Who took part in this so-called International Commission, and when did they leave for Katyn?</P>

<P>MARKOV: On the next day, 27 April, we stayed in Berlin and the other members of the commission arrived there too.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Who were they?</P>

<P>MARKOV: They were the following, besides myself: Dr. Birkle, chief doctor of the Ministry of Justice and first assistant of the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Criminology at Bucharest; Dr. Qiloslavich, professor of forensic medicine and criminology at Zagreb University, who was representative for Croatia; Professor Palmieri, who was professor for forensic medicine and criminology at Naples; Dr. Orsos, professor of forensic medicine and criminology at Budapest; Dr. Subik, professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Bratislava and chief of the State Department for Health for Slovakia; Dr. Hajek, professor for forensic medicine and criminology at Prague, who represented the so-called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; Professor Naville, professor of forensic medicine at the University of Geneva, representative for Switzerland; Dr. Speleers, professor for ophthalmology at Ghent University, who represented Belgium; Dr. De Burlett, professor of anatomy at the University of Groningen, representing Holland; Dr. Tramsen, vice chancellor of the Institute for forensic medicine at Copenhagen University, representing Denmark; Dr. Saxen, who was professor for pathological anatomy at Helsinki University, Finland.</P>

<P>During the investigations of the commission, a Dr. Costeduat was missing; he declared that he could attend only as a personal representative of President Laval. Professor Piga from Madrid also arrived, an elderly gentleman who did not take any part in the work of the commission. It was stated later that he was ill as a result of the long journey.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were all these persons flown to Katyn?</P>

<P>MARKOV: All these persons arrived at Katyn with the exception of Professor Piga.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Who besides the members of the commission left for Katyn with you?</P>

<P>MARKOV: On the 28th we took off from Tempelhof Airdrome, Berlin, for Katyn. We took off in two airplanes which carried about 15 to 20 persons each.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Maybe you can tell us briefly who was there?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Together with us was Director Dietz, who met us and accompanied us. He represented the Ministry of Public Health. There were also press representatives, and two representatives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I beg you to stop with these details and to tell me when the commission arrived in Katyn?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The commission arrived in Smolensk on 28 April, in the evening.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many work days did the commission stay in Smolensk? I stress work days.</P>

<P>MARKOV: We stayed in Smolensk 2 days only, 4/29/1943 and 4/30/1943, and on 1 May, in the morning, we left Smolensk.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many times did the members of the commission personally visit the mass graves in the Katyn wood?</P>

<P>MARKOV: We were twice in the Katyn wood, that is, in the forenoon of 29 and 30 April.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I mean, how many hours did you spend each time at the mass graves?</P>

<P>MAROV: I consider not more than 3 or 4 hours each time.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the members of the commission present at least once during the opening of one of the graves?</P>

<P>MARKOV: No new graves were opened in our presence. We were shown only several graves which had already been opened before we arrived.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, you were shown already opened graves, near which the corpses were already laid out, is that right?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Quite right. Near these opened graves were exhumed corpses already laid out there.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the necessary conditions for an objective and comprehensive scientific examination of the corpses given to the members of the commission?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The only part of our activity which could be characterized as a scientific, medico-legal examination were the autopsies carried out by certain members of the commission who were themselves medico-legal experts; but there were only seven or eight of us who could lay claim to that qualification, and as far as I recall only eight corpses were opened. Each of us operated on one corpse, except Professor Hajek, who dissected two corpses. Our further activity during these 2 days consisted of a hasty inspection under the guidance of Germans. It was like a tourists' walk during which we saw the open graves; and we were shown a peasant's house, a few kilometers distant from the.Katyn wood, where in showcases papers and objects of various sorts were kept. We were told that these papers and objects had been found in the clothes of the corpses which had been exhumed.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you actually present when these papers were taken from the corpses or were they shown to you when they were already under glass in display cabinets?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The documents which we saw in the glass cases had already been removed from the bodies before we arrived.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you allowed to investigate these documents, to examine these documents, for instance, to see whether the papers were impregnated with any acids which had developed by the decay of the corpses, or to carry out any other kind of scientific examination?</P>

<P>MARKOV: We did not carry out any scientific examination of these papers. As I have already told you, these papers were exhibited in glass cases and we did not even touch them.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But I would like you nevertheless to answer me briefly with "yes" or "no," a question which I have already put to you. Were the members of the commission given facilities for an objective examination?</P>

<P>MARKOV: In my opinion these working conditions can in no way be qualified as adequate for a complete and objective scientific examination. The only thing which bore the character of the scientific nature was the autopsy which I carried out.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But did I rightly understand you, that from the 11000 corpses which were discovered only 8 were dissected by members of the commission.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Quite right.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the next question. In what condition were these corpses? I would like you to describe the state in which they were and also the state of the inner organs, the tissues, et cetera.</P>

<P>MARKOV: As to the condition of the corpses in the Katyn graves, I can only judge according to the state of the corpse which I myself dissected. The condition of this corpse was, as far as I could ascertain, the same as that of all the other corpses. The skin was still well preserved, was in part leathery, of a brown-red color and on some parts there were blue markings from the clothes. The nails and hair, mostly, had already fallen out. In the head of the corpse I dissected there was a small hole, a bullet wound in the back of the head. Only pulpy substance remained of the brain. The muscles were still so well preserved that one could even see the fibers of the sinews of heart muscles and valves. The inner organs were also mainly in a good state of preservation. But of course they were dried up, displaced, and of a dark color. The stomach showed traces of some sort of contents. A part of the fat had turned into wax. We were impressed by the fact that even when pulled with brute force, no limbs had detached themselves.</P>

<P>I dictated a report, on the spot, on the result of my investigation. A similar report was dictated by the other members of the commission who examined corpses. This report was published by the Germans under Number 827, in the book which they published.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to answer the following question. Did the medico-legal investigations testify to the fact that the corpses had been in the graves already for 3 years?</P>

<P>MARKOV: As to that question I could judge only from the corpse on which I myself had held a post mortem. The condition of this corpse, as I have already stated, was typical of the average condition of the Katyn corpses. These corpses were far removed from the stage of disintegration of the soft parts, since the fat was only beginning to turn into wax. In my opinion these corpses were buried for a shorter period of time than 3 years. I considered that the corpse which I dissected had been buried for not more than 1 year or 18 months.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, applying the criteria of the facts which you ascertained to your experiences in Bulgaria that is, in a country of a more southern climate than Smolensk and where decay, therefore, is more rapidone must come to the conclusion that the corpses that were exhumed in the Katyn forest had been lying under the earth for not more than a year and a half? Did I understand you correctly?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, quite right. I had the impression that they had been buried for not more than a year and a half.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>[The witness Markov resumed the stand.]</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, when did you, together with the other members of the commission, perform the autopsies of these eight corpses? What date was it exactly?</P>

<P>MARKOV: That was on 30 April, early in the day.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And, on the basis of your personal observations, you decided that the corpses were in the ground 1 year or 18 months at the most?</P>

<P>MARKOV: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Before putting the next question to you, I should like you to give me a brief answer to the following question: Is it correct that in the practice of Bulgarian medical jurisprudence the protocol about the autopsy contains two parts, a description and the deductions?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes. In our practice, as well as in the practice of other countries, so far as I know, it is done in the following way: First of all, we give a description and then the deduction.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was a deduction contained in the record you made regarding the autopsy?</P>

<P>MARKOV: My record of the autopsy contained only a description without any conclusion.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Because from the papers which were given to us there I understood that they wanted us to say that the corpses had been in the ground for 3 years. This could be deduced from the papers which were shown to us in the little peasant hut about which I have already spoken.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: By the way, were these papers shown to you before the autopsy or afterward?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, the papers were given us 1 day before the autopsy.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you were . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, you are interrupting the interpreter all the time. Before the interpreter has finished the answer, you have put another question. It is very difficult for us to hear the interpreter.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you for your indication, Mr. President.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Inasmuch as the objective deduction regarding the autopsy I performed was in contradiction with this version, I did not make any deductions.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently you did not make any deduction because the objective data of the autopsy testified to the fact that the corpses had been in the ground, not 3 years, but only 18 months?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, you must remember that it is a double translation, and unless you pause more than you are pausing, your voice comes in upon the interpreter's and we cannot hear the interpreter.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well, Mr. President.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, that is quite correct.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was there unanimity among the members of the commission regarding the time the corpses had been in the graves?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Most of the members of the delegation who performed the autopsies in the Katyn wood made their deductions without answering the essential question regarding the time the corpses had been buried. Some of them, as for instance, Professor Hajek, spoke about immaterial things; as for instance, that one of the killed had had pleurisy. Some of the others, as for instance, Professor Birkle from Bucharest, cut off some hair from a corpse in order to determine the age of the corpse. In my opinion that was quite immaterial. Professor Palmieri, on the basis of the autopsy that he performed, said that the corpse had been in the ground over a year but he did not determine exactly how long.</P>

<P>The only one who gave a definite statement in regard to the time the corpses had been buried was Professor Miloslavich from Zagreb, and he said it was 3 years. However, when the German book regarding Katyn was published, I read the result of his impartial statement regarding the corpse on which he had performed the autopsy. I had the impression that the corpse on which he had performed the autopsy did not differ in its stage of decomposition from the other corpses. This led me to think that his statement that the corpses had been in the ground for 3 years did not coincide with the facts of his description.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like to ask you to reply to the following question. Were there many skulls found by the members of the commission with signs of so-called pseudocallus? By the way, inasmuch as this term is not known in the usual books on medical jurisprudence and in general criminalistic terminology, I should like you to give us an exact explanation of what Professor Orsos, of Budapest, means by the term pseudocallus.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Would you repeat that question?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were there many skulls with signs of so-called pseudocallus which were submitted to the members of the commission? Inasmuch as this term is not known in the usual books on medical jurisprudence, I should like you to give us a detailed explanation of what Professor Orsos means by the term pseudocallus.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What are you saying the skulls had? You asked if there were many skulls with something or other.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I see this term for the first time, myself, Mr. President. It is pseudocallus. It seems to be a Latin term of some sort of corn which is formed on the outer surface of the cerebral substance.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Can you spell the word in Latin?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[The prosecutor submitted a paper to the President.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What you have written here is p-s-e-r-d-o. Do you mean p-s-e-u-d-o, which means false?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is right, pseudo.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Now then, put your question again, and try to put it shortly.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Were there many skulls with signs of so-called pseudocallus shown to the members of the commission? Will you please give an exact explanation of this term of Professor Orsos.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Professor Orsos spoke to us regarding pseudocallus at a general conference of the delegates. That took place on 30 April, in the afternoon, in the building where the field laboratory of Dr. Butz in Smolensk was located.</P>

<P>Professor Orsos described the term pseudocallus as meaning some sediment of indissoluble salt, of calcium, and other salts on the inside of the cranium. Professor Orsos stated that, according to his observations in Hungary, this happened if the corpses have been in the ground for at least 3 years. When Professor Orsos stated this at the scientific conference, none of the delegates said anything either for or against it. I deduced from that that this term pseudocallus was as unknown to the other delegates as it was to me.</P>

<P>At the same conference Professor Orsos showed us such a pseudocallus on one of the skulls.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like you to answer the following question: What number did the corpse have from which this skull with signs of pseudocallus was taken?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The corpse from which the skull was taken and which was noted in the book bore the Number 526. From this I deduced that this corpse was exhumed before our arrival at Katyn, inasmuch as all the other corpses on which we performed autopsies on 30 April had numbers which ran above 800. It was explained to us that as soon as a corpse was exhumed it immediately received a consecutive number.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me this, please. Did you notice any pseudocallus on the skulls of the corpses on which you and your colleagues performed autopsies?</P>

<P>MARKOV: On the skull of the corpse on which I performed an autopsy, there was some sort of pulpy substance in place of the brain, but I never noticed any sign of pseudocallus. The other delegatesafter the explanation of Professor Orsoslikewise did not state that they had found any pseudocallus in the other skulls. Even Butz and his co-workers, who had examined the corpses before our arrival, did not mention any sign of pseudocallus.</P>

<P>Later on, in a book which was published by the Germans and which contained the report of Butz, I noticed that Butz referred to pseudocallus in order to give more weight to his statement that the corpses had been in the ground for 3 years.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say, that of the 11000 corpses only one skull was submitted to you which had pseudocallus?</P>

<P>MARKOV: That is quite correct.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like you to describe to the Tribunal in detail the state of the clothing which you found on the corpses.</P>

<P>MARKOV: In general the clothing was well preserved, but of course it was damp due to the decomposition of the corpses. When we pulled off the clothing to undress the corpses, or when we tried to take off the shoes, the clothing did not tear nor did the shoes fall apart at the seams. I even had the impression that this clothing could have been used again, after having been cleaned.</P>

<P>There were some papers found in the pockets of the clothing of the corpse on which I performed the autopsy, and these papers were also impregnated with the dampness of the corpse. Some of the Germans who were present when I was performing the autopsy asked me to describe those papers and their contents; but I refused to do it, thinking that this was not the duty of a doctor. In fact I had already noticed the previous day that with the help of the dates contained in those papers, they were trying to make us think that the corpses had remained in the ground for 3 years.</P>

<P>Therefore, I wanted to base my deductions only on the actual condition of the corpses. Some of the other delegates who performed autopsies also found some papers in the clothing of the corpses. The papers which had been found in the clothing of the corpse on which I performed the autopsy were put into a cover which bore the same number as the corpse, Number 827. Later on, in the book which was published by the Germans, I perceived that some of the delegates described the contents of the papers which were found on the corpses.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like to ask you to reply to the following question. On what impartial medico-judicial data did the commission base the deduction that the corpses had remained in the earth not less than 3 years?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you put the question again? I did not understand the question.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked on what impartial medico-judicial data were the deductions of the protocol of the International Medical Commission based, which stated that the corpses had remained in the ground not less than 3 years?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Has he said that that was the deduction he madenot less than 3 years?</P>

<P>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): He has not said that.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: He has not said that at all. He never said that he made the deduction that the corpses remained in the ground not less than 3 years.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He did not make this deduction; but Professor Markov, together with the other members of the commission, signed a report of the International Commission.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I know; but that is why I ask you to repeat your question. The question that was translated to us was: On what grounds did you make your deduction that the corpses had remained in the ground not less than 3 yearswhich is the opposite of what he said.</P>

<P>Now will you put the question again?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] I am not asking you about your personal minutes, Witness, but about the general record of the entire commission. I am asking you on what impartial medico-judicial data were the deductions of the entire commission based, that the corpses had remained in the earth not less than 3 years. On the record of the deductions your signature figures among those of the other members of the commission.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Now, then, Colonel Smirnov, will you put the question again.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] I was asking you on what impartial medico-judicial data were the deductions of the commission based not the individual report of Dr. Markov, in which there are no deductionsbut the deductions of the entire commission, that the corpses had remained not less than 3 years in the ground?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The collective protocol of the commission which was signed by all the delegates was very scant regarding the real medico-judicial data. Concerning the condition of the corpses, only one sentence in the report was stated, namely that the corpses were in various stages of decomposition, but there was no description of the real extent of decomposition. Thus, in my opinion, this deduction was based on the papers found on the corpses and on testimony of the witnesses, but not on the actual medico-judicial data. As far as medical jurisprudence is concerned, they tried to support this deduction by the statement of Professor Orsos regarding the finding of pseudocallus in the skull of corpse Number 526.</P>

<P>But, according to my conviction, since this skull was the only one with signs of pseudocallus, it was wrong to arrive at a definite conclusion regarding the stage of decomposition of thousands of corpses which were contained in the Katyn graves. Besides, the observation of Professor Orsos regarding pseudocallus was made in Hungary; that is to say, under quite different soil and climatic conditions, and withal in individual graves and not in mass graves, as was the case in Katyn.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You spoke about the testimony of witnesses. Did the members of the commission have the opportunity personally to interrogate those witnesses, especially the Russian witnesses?</P>

<P>MARKOV: We did not have the opportunity of having any contact with the indigenous population. On the contrary, immediately upon our arrival at the hotel in Smolensk, Butz told us that we were in a military zone, and that we did not have the right to walk around in the city without being accompanied by a member of the German Army, or to speak with the inhabitants of the place, or to make photographs. In reality, during the time we were there, we did not have any contact with the local inhabitants.</P>

<P>On the first day of our arrival in the Katyn wood, that is to say on 29 April, in the morning, several Russian civilians were brought under German escort to the graves. Immediately upon our arrival at Smolensk some of the depositions of the local witnesses were submitted to us. The depositions were typed. When these witnesses were brought to the Katyn wood, we were told that these witnesses were the ones who gave the testimonies which had been submitted to us. There was no regular interrogation of the witnesses which could have been recorded, or were recorded. Professor Orsos started the conversation with the witnesses and told us that he could speak Russian because he had been a prisoner of war in Russia during the first World War. He began to speak with a man, an elderly man whose name, so far as I can remember, was Kiselov. Then he spoke to a second witness, whose last name so far as I can remember was Andrejev. All the conversation lasted a few minutes only. As our Bulgarian language is rather similar to the Russian, I tried also to speak to some of the witnesses...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Don't you think that should be left to crossexamination? Can't these details be left to cross-examination?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</P>

<P>I would ask you, Witness, to interrupt the reply to this.question and to answer the following one: At the time you signed this general report of the commission, was it quite clear to you that the murders were perpetrated in Katyn not earlier than the last quarter of 1941, and that 1940, in any case, was excluded?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, this was absolutely clear to me and that is why I did not make any deductions in the minutes which I made on my findings in the Katyn wood.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why did you sign then this general report, which was incorrect in your opinion?</P>

<P>MARKOV: In order to make it quite clear under what conditions I signed this report, I should like to say a few words on how it was made up and how it was signed.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, I would like to put a questiOn to you which defines more accurately this matter. Was this report actually signed on 4/30/1941 in the town of Smolensk or was it signed on another date and at another place?</P>

<P>MARKOV: It was not signed in Smolensk on 30 April but was Signed on 1 May at noon, at the airport which was called Bela.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please tell the Tribunal under what conditions it was signed.</P>

<P>MARKOV: The compilation of this record was to be done at the same conference which I already mentioned and which took place in the laboratory of Butz in the afternoon of 30 April. Present at this conference were all the delegates and all the Germans who had arrived with us from Berlin: Butz and his assistants, General Staff Physician Holm, the chief physician of the Smolensk sector, and also other German Army officials who were unknown to me. Butz stated that the Germans were only present as hosts, but actually the conference was presided over by General Staff Physician Holm and the work was performed under the direction of Butz. The secretary of the conference was the personal lady secretary of Butz who took down the report. However, I never saw these minutes. Butz and Orsos came with a prepared draft to this conference, a sort of protocol; but I never learned who ordered them to draw up such a protocol. This protocol was read by Butz and then a question was raised regarding the state and the age of the young pines which were in the clearings of the Katyn wood. Butz was of the opinion that in these clearings there were graves too.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me for interrupting you. Did you have any evidence that any graves were actually found in these clearings?</P>

<P>MARKOV: No. During the time we were there, no new graves were opened. As some of the delegates said they were not competent to express their opinion regarding the age of these trees, General Holm gave an order to bring a German who was an expert on forestry. He showed us the cut of the trunk of a small tree and from the number of circles in this trunk, he deduced the trees were 5 years old.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me; I interrupt you again. You, yourselfcan you state here that this tree was actually cut down from the grave and not from any other place in the clearing?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I can say only that in the Katyn wood there were some clearings with small trees and that, while driving back to Smolensk, we took a little tree with us in the bus, but I do not know whether there were any graves where these trees were standing. As I have already stated, no graves were laid open in our presence.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would request you to continue your reply, but very briefly and not to detain the attention of the Tribunal with unnecessary details.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Some editorial notes were made in connection with this protocol, but I do not remember what they were. Then Orsos and Butz were entrusted with the final drafting of the record. The signing of the record was intended to take place on the same night at a banquet which was organized in a German Army hospital. At this banquet Butz arrived with the minutes and he started reading them, but the actual signing did not take place for reasons which are still not clear to me. It was stated that this record would have to be rewritten, so the banquet lasted until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. Then Professor Palmieri told me that the Germans were not pleased with the contents of the protocol and that they were carrying on telephone conversations with Berlin and that perhaps there would not even be a protocol at all.</P>

<P>Indeed, having spent the night in Smolensk without having signed the record, we took off from Smolensk on the morning of 1 May. I personally had the impression that no protocol at all would be issued and I was very pleased about that. On the way to Smolensk, as well as on our way back, some of the delegates asked to stop in Warsaw in order to see the city, but we were told that it was impossible because of military reasons.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This has nothing to do with the subject. Please keep to the facts.</P>

<P>MARKOV: Around noon we arrived at the airport which was called Bela. The airport was apparently a military airfield because of the temporary military barracks I saw there. We had dinner there and immediately after dinner, notwithstanding the fact that we were not told that the signing of the minutes would take place on the way to Berlin, we were submitted copies of the protocol for signature. During the signing a number of military persons were present, as there were no other people except military personnel on this airfield. I was rather struck by the fact that on the one hand the records were already completed in Smolensk but were not submitted to us for signing there, and on the other hand that they did not wait till we arrived in Berlin a few hours later. They were submitted to us for signing at this isolated military airfield. This was the reason why I signed the report, in spite of the conviction I had acquired during the autopsy which I had performed at Smolensk.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say, the date and the locality which are shown in the protocol are incorrect?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, that is so.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you signed it because you felt yourself compelled to?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, I don't think it is proper for you to put leading questions to him. He has stated the fact. It is useless to go on stating conclusions about it.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well, Mr. President. I have no further questions to put to the witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Does anyone want to cross-examine him?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I should like to ask a question concerning the legal proceedings first. Each side was to call three witnesses before the Court. This witness, as I understand it, has not only testified to facts but has also made statements which can be called an expert judgment. He has not only expressed himself as an expert witness, as we say in German law, but also as an expert. If the Court is to listen to these statements made by the witness as an expert, I should like to have the opportunity for the Defense also to call in an expert.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: No, Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal will not hear more than three witnesses on either side. You could have called any expert you wanted ar any member of the experts who made the German examination. It was your privilege to call any of them.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, how long have you been active in the field of medical jurisprudence?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I have been working in the field of medical jurisprudence since the beginning of 1927 in the faculty for medical jurisprudence of the University in Sofia, first as an assistant and now I am professor of medical jurisprudence. I am not a staff professor at the university. My position can be designated by the German word "Ausserordentlicher Professor" (university lecturer).</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Before your visit to Katyn did your government tell you that you were to participate in a political action without consideration of your scientific qualification?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I was not told so literally, but in the press the Katyn question was discussed as a political subject.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you feel free in regard to your scientific "conscience" at that time?</P>

<P>MARKOV: At what time?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: At the time when you went to Katyn?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The question is not quite clear to me; I should like you to explain it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you consider the task you had to carry out there a political one or a scientific one?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I understood this task from the very first moment as a political one and therefore I tried to evade it.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you realize the outstanding political importance of this task?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes; from everything I read in the press.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In your examination yesterday you said that when you arrived at Katyn the graves had already been opened and certain corpses had been carefully laid out. Do you mean to say that these corpses were not taken from the graves at all?</P>

<P>MARKOV: No, I should not say that, inasmuch as it was obvious that corpses were taken out of these graves and besides I saw that some corpses were still in the graves.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Then, in order to state this positively, you had no reason to think that the corpses inspected by the commission were not taken from these mass graves?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: He did not know where they came from, did he?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Evidently from the graves which were open.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: You have already made statements to the effect that. as a result of the medico-judicial examination by this International Commission, a protocol, a record was taken down. You have furthermore stated that you signed this protocol.</P>

<P>Mr. President, this protocol is contained in its full text in the official data published by the German Government on this incident. I ask that this evidence, this so-called White Book, be admitted as evidence. I will submit it to the Court later.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</P>

<P>[A Recess was taken.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal rules that you may cross-examine this witness upon the report, and the protocol will be admitted in evidence, if you offer it in evidence, under Article 19 of the Charter. That, of course, involves that we do not take judicial notice of the report under Article 21 of the Charter but that it is offered under Article 19 of the Charter and therefore it will either come through the earphones in cross-examination or such parts of the protocol as you wish to have translated.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, was the protocol or the record signed by you and the other experts compiled in the same way in which it is included in the German White Book?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, the record of the protocol which is included in the German White Book is the same protocol which I compiled. A long time after my return to Sofia I was sent two copies of the protocol by Director Dietz. These two copies were typewritten, and I was requested to make necessary corrections and additions if I deemed it necessary, but I left it without corrections and it was printed without any comments on my part.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Just a moment Dr. Stahmer . . .</P>

<P>Mr. President, I believe that there is a slight confusion here. The witness is answering in regard to the individual protocol, whereas Dr. Stahmer is questioning him on the general record. Thus the witness does not answer the proper question.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I would have cleared this matter up on my own account.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Do you mean your autopsy protocol?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I mean the protocol I compiled myself and not the general record.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Now, what about this general protocol or record? When did you receive a copy of it?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I received a copy of the general record in Berlin where as many copies were signed as there were delegates present.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Just a little while ago you stated that Russian witnesses had been taken before the commission in the wood of Katyn, but that, however, there had been no opportunity afforded the experts to talk with these witnesses concerning the question at hand.</P>

<P>Now, in this protocol, in this record, the following remark is found, and I quote:</P>

<P>"The commission interrogated several indigenous Russian witnesses personally. Among other things, these witnesses confirmed that in the months of March and 4/1940 large shipments of Polish officers arrived almost daily at the railroad station Gnjesdova near Katyn. These trains were emptied, the inmates were taken in lorries to the wood of Katyn and never seen again. Furthermore, official notice was taken of the proofs and statements, and the documents containing the evidence were inspected."</P>

<P>MARKOV: As I already stated during the questioning, two witnesses were interrogated on the spot by Orsos. They actually said that they saw how Polish officers were brought to the station of Gnjesdova and that later they did not see them again.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal thinks the witness ought to be given an opportunity of seeing the report when you put passages in it to him.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Haven't you got another copy of it?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I am sorry, Mr. President, I have no second copy; no.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Can the witness read German?</P>

<P>MARKOV: No, but anyhow I can understand the contents of the record.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You mean you can read it?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, I can also read it.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Can the witness read German, do you mean?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, I can read German.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, may I make a suggestion?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, if you have only got one copy, I think you had better have it back. You can't have the book passing to and fro like that.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I should like to make the suggestion that the cross-examination be interrupted and the other witness be called, and I will have this material typed in the meantime. That would be a solution. But there are only a few sentences...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You can read it. Take the book back.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I propose to read only a few short sentences.</P>

<P>[Turning to the witness.] Yesterday you testified, Witness, that the experts restricted or limited themselves to making an autopsy on one corpse only. In this report the following is set downI quote:</P>

<P>"The members of the commission personally performed an autopsy on nine corpses and numerous selected cases were submitted for post-mortem examination." Is that right?</P>

<P>MARKOV: That is right. Those of the members of the commission who were medical experts, with the exception of Professor Naville, performed each an autopsy on a corpse. Hajek made two autopsies.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In this instance we are not interested in the autopsy, but in the post-mortem examination.</P>

<P>MARKOV: The corpses were examined but only superficially during an inspection which we carried out very hastily on the first day. No individual autopsy was carried out, but the corpses were merely looked at as they lay side by side.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I should like to ask you now what is meant in medical science by the concept "post-mortem examination."</P>

<P>MARKOV: We differentiate between an exterior inspection, when the corpse has to be undressed and minutely examined externally, and an internal inspection, when the inner organs of the corpse are examined. This was not done with the hundreds of bodies at Katyn, as it was not physically possible. We were there only one forenoon. Therefore, I consider that there was no actual medico-judicial expert examination of these corpses in the real sense of the word.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: A little while ago you talked about the trees that were growing there on these graves, and you said that an expert explained the age of the trees by the rings counted on a trunk. In the protocol and the report the following is set down. I quote:</P>

<P>"According to the opinion of the members of the commission and the testimony of forest ranger Von Herff, who was called in as an expert on forestry, they were small pine trees of at least 5 years of age, badly developed because they had been standing in the shade of large trees and had been transplanted to this spot about 3 years ago."</P>

<P>Now, I would like to ask you, is it correct that you undertook a local inspection and that you convinced yourself on the spot whether the statements made by the forestry expert were actually correct?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Our personal impression and my personal conviction in this question only refer to the fact that in the wood of Katyn there were clearings where small trees were growing and that the afore-mentioned expert showed us a cross section of a tree with its circles. But I do not consider myself competent and cannot give an opinion as to whether the deductions which are set forth in the record are correct or not. Precisely for that reason it was judged necessary to call in a forestry expert, for we doctors were not competent to decide this question. Therefore, these conclusions are merely the conclusions of a competent German expert.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: But after having had a first-hand view, did you doubt the truth of these statements?</P>

<P>MARKOV: After the German expert had expressed his opinion at the conference of the delegates, neither I nor the other delegates expressed any opinion as to whether his conclusions were correct or not. These conclusions are set down in the record in the form in which the expert expressed himself.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: According to your autopsy report the corpse of the Polish officer which you dissected was clothed and you described the clothing in detail. Was this winter or summer clothing that you found?</P>

<P>MARKOV: It was winter clothing including an overcoat and a woolen shawl around the neck.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In the protocol it says further and I quote:</P>

<P>"Furthermore, Polish cigarettes and matchboxes were found with the dead; in some cases tobacco containers and cigarette holders, and 'Kosielsk' was inscribed thereon." The question is, did you see these objects?</P>

<P>MARKOV: We actually saw these tobacco boxes with the name "Kosielsk" engraved thereon. They were exhibited to us in the glass case which was shown to us in the peasant hut not far from the Katyn wood. I remember them because Butz drew our attention to them.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In your autopsy report, Witness, there is the following remark, and I quote:</P>

<P>"In the clothing documents were found and they were put in the folder Number 827."</P>

<P>Now, I should like to ask you: How did you discover these documents? Did you personally take them out of the pockets?</P>

<P>MARKOV: These papers were in the pockets of the overcoat and of the jacket. As far as I can remember they were taken out by a German who was undressing the corpse in my presence.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: At that time were the documents already in the envelope?</P>

<P>MARKOV: They were not yet in the envelope, but after they had been taken out of the pockets they were put into an envelope which bore the number of the corpse. We were told that this was the usual method of procedure.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What was the nature of the documents?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I did not examine them at all, as I have already !t said, and I refused to do so, but according to the size. I believe that they were certificates of identity. I could distinguish individual letters, but I do not know whether one could read the inscription, for I did not attempt to do so.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In the protocol the following statement is made, and I quote:</P>

<P>"The documents found with the corpses (diaries, letters, and newspapers) were dated from the fall of 1939 until March and 4/1940. The latest date which could be ascertained was the date of a Russian newspaper of 4/22/1940."</P>

<P>Now, I should like to ask you if this statement is correct and whether it is in accordance with the findings that you made?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Such letters and newspapers were indeed in the glass cases and were shown to us. Some such papers were found by members of the commission who were dissecting the bodies, and if I remember rightly, they described the contents of these documents but I did not do so.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In your examination just a little while ago you stated that only a few scientific details were contained in this protocol and that this was probably done intentionally. I should like to quote from this record as follows:</P>

<P>"Various degrees and types of decomposition were caused by the position of the bodies to one another in the grave. Aside from some mummification on the surface and around the edges of the mass of corpses, some damp maceration was found among the center corpses. The sticking together of the adjacent corpses and the soldering together of corpses through cadaverous acids and fluids which had thickened. and particularly the deformations that obtained from the pressure among the corpses, show that the corpses were buried there right from the beginning.</P>

<P>"Among the corpses, insects or remains of insects which might date back to the time of burial are entirely lacking, and from this it may be gathered that the shooting and the burial took place at a season which was cold and free from insects."</P>

<P>Now, I should like to ask you if these statements are correct and if they are in line with your findings.</P>

<P>MARKOV: I stated that little was said on the condition of the corpses, and indeed as can be judged by the quotation which I had in mind, only a general phraseology is used concerning the various degrees of decomposition of the corpses, but no concrete or detailed description of the condition of the corpses is made.</P>

<P>As to the insects and their larvae, the assertion of the general report that none were discovered is in flagrant contradiction to the conclusions of Professor Palmieri, which are recorded in his personal minutes concerning the corpse which he himself dissected. In this protocol, which is published in the same German White Book, it is said that there were traces of remains of insects and their larvae in the mouths of the corpses.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Just a little while ago you spoke of the scientific examination of skulls undertaken by Professor Orsos. The record also refers to this matter, and I quote:</P>

<P>"A large number of skulls were examined with respect to the changes they had undergone, which, according to the background and experience of Professor Orsos, would be of great value in fixing the date of death. In this connection, we are concerned with stratified encrustations on the surface of the mush found in the skull as a residue of the brain. These symptoms are not to be found among corpses which have been in their graves for less than 3 years. Such a condition, among other things, was found in a very decided form in the skull of corpse Number 526, which was found near the surface of a large mass grave."</P>

<P>I should like to ask you now if it is correct that, according to the report of Professor Orsos, such a condition was discovered not only as is said here on the skull of one corpse, but among other corpses also.</P>

<P>MARKOV: I can answer this question quite categorically. We were shown only one skull, the one precisely mentioned in the record under the Number 526. I do not know that other skulls were examined, as the record seems to imply. I am of the opinion that Professor Orsos had no possibility of examining many corpses in the Katyn wood, for he came with us and left with us. That means he stayed in the Katyn wood just as long as I and all the other members of the commission did.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Finally, I should like to quote the conclusion of the summarizing expert opinion, in which it is stated: "From statements made by witnesses, from the letters and correspondence, diaries, newspapers, and so forth, found on the corpses, it may be seen that the shootings took place in the months of March and 4/1940. The following are in complete agreement with the findings made with regard to the mass graves and the individual corpses of the Polish officers, as described in the report." Is this statement actually correct?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I did not quite understand the statement. As I heard you read it, it was something like this: From the statements of witnesses, letters, and so forth . . .</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: ". . . in complete agreement with the findings made with regard to the mass graves and the individual corpses of the Polish officers and described in the report." That is the end of the quotation.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: It doesn't say that the following persons are in complete agreement, but that the following facts are in complete agreement. Is that right?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: No. My question is: "Is this statement approved by you? Do you agree with it?"</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I know, but you read out certain words, which were these: "The following are in complete agreement." What I want to know is whether that means that the following persons are in complete agreement, or whether the following facts are in complete agreement.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Special facts had been set down, and this is a summarizing expert opinion signed by all the members of the commission. Therefore, we have here a scientific explanation of the real facts.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Would you just listen to what I read out from what I took down? "From the statements of witnesses, letters, and other documents, it may be seen that the shooting took place in the months of March and 4/1940. The following are in complete agreement." What I am asking you is this...</P>

<P>[Dr. Stahmer attempted to interrupt.]</P>

<P>Just a moment, Dr. Stahmer, listen to what I say. What I am asking you is: Does the statement mean that the following persons are in complete agreement, or that the following facts are in complete agreement?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: No, no. The following people testify that this fact, the fact that the shootings took place in the months of March and 4/1940, agrees with the results of their investigations of the mass graves and of individual corpses. That is what is meant and that is the conclusion. What has been found here is in agreement with that which has been set down and determined scientifically. That is the meaning.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Is this final deduction in accord with your scientific conviction?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I have already indicated that this statement regarding the condition of the corpses is based on the date resulting from testimony by the witnesses and from the available documents, but it is in contradiction to the observations I made on the corpse which I dissected. That means I did not consider that the results of the autopsies corroborated the presumable date of death to be taken from the testimony or the documents. If I had been convinced that the condition of the corpses did indeed correspond to the date of decease mentioned by the Germans, I would have given such a statement in my individual protocol.</P>

<P>When I saw the signed protocol I became suspicious as to the last sentence of the recordthe sentence which precedes the signatures. I always had doubts whether this sentence was contained in that draft of the protocol which we saw at the conference in Smolensk.</P>

<P>As far as I could understand, the draft of the protocol which had been elaborated in Smolensk only stated that we actually were shown papers and that we heard witnesses; and this was supposed to prove that the killings were carried out in March or 4/1940. I was of the opinion that the fact that the conclusion was not based on medical opinion and not supported absolutely by medical reports and examination, was the reason why the signing of the protocol was postponed and why the record was not signed in Smolensk.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, at the beginning of my examination you stated that you were fully aware of the political significance of your task. Why, then, did you desist from protesting against this report which was not in accord with your scientific conviction?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I have already said that I signed the protocol as I was convinced that the circumstances at this isolated military airfield offered no other possibility, and therefore I could not make any objections.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Why did you not take steps later on?</P>

<P>MARKOV: My conduct after the signing of the protocol corresponds fully to what I am stating here, I repeat. I was not convinced of the truth of the German version. I was invited many times to Berlin by Director Dietz. I was also invited to Sofia by the German Embassy. And in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Foreign Office also invited me to make a public statement over the radio and to the press; and I was requested to say what conclusions we had come to during our investigation. However, I did not do so, and I always refused to do so. Because of the political situation in which we found ourselves at that moment, I could not make a public statement declaring the German version was wrong.</P>

<P>Concerning that matter there were quite sharp words exchanged between me and the German Embassy in Sofia. And when, a few months later, another Bulgarian representative was asked to be sent as a member of a similar commission for the investigation of the corpses in Vinnitza in the Ukraine, the German Ambassador Beckerly stated quite openly to the Bulgarian Foreign Office that the Germans did not wish me to be sent to Vinnitza.</P>

<P>That indicated that the Germans very well understood my behavior and my opinion on that matter. Concerning this question, Minister Plenipotentiary Saratov, of our Foreign Office, still has shorthand records about conversations which, if the Honored Tribunal considers it necessary, can be sent here from Bulgaria.</P>

<P>Therefore, all my refusals, after I had signed the protocol, to carry on any activity for the purpose of propaganda, fully correSpond to what I said here, namely that the conclusions laid down in the collective protocol do not answer my personal conviction. And I will repeat that if I had been convinced that the corpses were buried for 3 years, I would have testified this after having dissected a corpse. But I have left my personal protocol incomplete and this is a quite unusual thing in the case of medico-judicial examination.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The protocol was not signed by you alone, but on the contrary it carries the signatures of 11 representatives of science, whose names you gave yesterday, some of them of world renown. Among these men we find a scientist of a neutral country, Professor Naville.</P>

<P>Did you take the opportunity to get in touch with one of these experts in the meantime with a view of reaching a rectification of the report?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I cannot say on what considerations the other delegates signed the protocol. But they also signed it under the same circumstances as I did. However, when I read the individual protocols, I notice that they also refrained from stating the precise date of the killing of the man whose corpse they had dissected. There was one exception only, as I have already said. That was Professor Niloslavich, who was the only one who asserted that the corpse which he had dissected was that of a man buried for at least 3 years. After the signing of the protocol, I did not have any contact with any of the persons who had signed the collective protocol.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Witness, you gave two versions, one in the protocol which we have just discussed, and another here before the Court. Which version is the correct one?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I do not understand which two versions you are speaking about. Will you please explain it?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In the first version, in the protocol, it is set forth that according to the conclusion which had been made, the shooting must have taken place 3 years ago. Today you testified that the findings were not correct, and between the shooting and the time of your investigations there could only be a space of perhaps 18 months.</P>

<P>MARKOV: I stated that the conclusions of the collective protocol do not correspond with my personal conviction.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: "Did not correspond" or "do not correspond with your conviction"?</P>

<P>MARKOV: It did not and it does not correspond with my opinion then and now.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to this witness.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, were any of the bodies which were examined by the members of this delegation exhumed from the ground in your presence?</P>

<P>MARKOV: The corpses which we dissected were selected among the top layers of the graves which had been already exhumed. They were taken out of the graves and given to us for dissection.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Was there anything to indicate, in your opinion, that the corpses had not been buried in those graves?</P>

<P>MARKOV: As far as traces are concerned, and as far as the layers of corpses were preserved, they were stuck to each other; so that if they had been transferred, I do not believe that this could have been done recently. This could not have been done immediately before our arrival.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You mean that you think the corpses had been buried in those graves?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I cannot say whether they were put into those graves immediately after death had come, as I have no data to confirm this, but they did not look as if they had just been put there.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Is it possible, in your opinion as an expert, to fix the date of March or April or such a short period as that, 3 years before the examination which you have made?</P>

<P>MARKOV: I believe that if one relies exclusively on medical data, that is to say, on the state and condition of the corpses, it is impossible, when it is a question of years, to determine the date with such precision and say accurately whether they were killed in March or in April. Therefore, apparently the months of March and April were not based on the medical data, for that would be impossible, but on the testimony of the witnesses and on the documents which were shown</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: When you got back to Sofia, you said that the protocol was sent to you for your observations and for your corrections and that you made none. Why was that?</P>

<P>MARKOV: We are concerned with the individual protocol which I compiled. I did not supplement it by making any conclusion, I did not add any conclusion because it was sent to me by the Germans and because in general at that time the political situation in our country was such that I could not declare publicly that the German version was not a true one.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean that your personal protocol alone was sent to you at Sofia?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, only my personal protocol was sent to Sofia.</P>

<P>As to the collective protocol, I brought that back myself to Sofia and handed it over to our Foreign Minister.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Is your personal protocol, in the words that you drew it up, incorporated in the whole protocol and signed by all the delegates?</P>

<P>MARKOV: In my personal protocol there is only a description of the corpse and of the clothing of the corpse which I dissected.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: That is not the question I asked.</P>

<P>MARKOV: In the general protocol a rough description only is made, concerning the clothing and the degree of decomposition.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, do you mean that your personal protocol . . .</P>

<P>MARKOV: I consider that the personal protocols are more accurate regarding the condition of the corpses, because they were compiled during the dissection and were dictated on the spot to the stenographers.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Just listen to the question, please. Is your personal protocol, in the words in which you drew it up, incorporated in the collective protocol in the same words?</P>

<P>MARKOV: My own protocol is not included in the general record, but it is included in the White Book which the Germans published together with the general record.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: It is there then, in the report, is it? It is in the White Book?</P>

<P>MARKOV: Yes, quite right. It is included in this book.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire. Yes, Colonel Smirnov, do you have another witness?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President. I beg you to allow me to call as a witness, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence Prosorovski.</P>

<P>[The witness Prosorovski took the stand.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please.</P>

<P>VICTOR IL'ICH PROSOROVSKI (Witness): Prosorovski, Victor Il'ich.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me:</P>

<P>I, citizen of the U.S.S.R.called as a witness in this case solemnly promise and swear before the High Tribunalto say all that I know about this caseand to add and withhold nothing.</P>

<P>[The witness repeated the oath.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, just before questioning you, I beg you to adhere to the following order. After my question, please pause in order to allow the interpreters to make the translation, and speak as slowly as possible.</P>

<P>Will you give the Tribunal very briefly some information about your scientific activity, and your past work as a medico-judicial doctor.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I am a doctor by profession; professor of medical jurisprudence and a doctor of medical science. I am the Chief Medical Expert of the Ministry of Public Health of the Soviet Union. I am the Director of the Scientific Research Institute for Medical Jurisprudence at the Ministry of Public Health of the U.S.S.R.; my business is mainly of a scientific nature; I am President of the Medico-Judicial Commission of the Scientific Medical Council of the Ministry of Public Health of the U.S.S.R.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How long did you practice as a medico-judicial expert?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I practiced for 17 years in that sphere.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What kind of participation was yours in the investigation of the mass crimes of the Hitlerites against the Polish officers in Katyn?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: The President of the Special Commission for investigation and ascertaining of the circumstances of the shootings by the German Fascist aggressors of Polish officers, Academician Nicolai Ilych Burdenko, offered me in the beginning of 1/1944 the chairmanship of the Medico-Judicial Commission of experts.</P>

<P>Apart from this organizational activity, I participated personally.in the exhumations and examination of these corpses.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, perhaps that would be a good time to break off.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE MARSHAL: May it please the Tribunal, the Defendants Hess, Fritzsche, and Von Ribbentrop are absent.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I continue the examination of this witness, Mr. President?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me, how far from the town of Smolensk were the burial grounds where the corpses were discovered?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: A commission of medico-legal experts, together with members of the special commission, Academician Burdenko, Academician Potemkin, Academician Tolstoy, and other members of this commission, betook themselves on 1/14/1944 to the burial grounds of the Polish officers in the so-called Katyn wood. This spot is located about 15 kilometers from the town of Smolensk. These burial grounds were situated on a slope at a distance of about 200 meters from the Vitebsk high road. One of these graves was about 60 meters long and 60 meters wide; the other one, situated a small distance from this first grave, was about 7 meters long and 6 meters wide.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many corpses were exhumed by the commission you headed?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In the Katyn wood the commission of medical experts exhumed and examined, from various graves and from various depths, altogether 925 corpses.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How was the work of exhumation done and how many assistants were employed by you on this work?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Specialists and medico-legal experts participated in the work of this commission. In September and 10/1943 they had exhumed and examined the corpses of the victims shot by the Germans...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Where was the examination of the corpses performed?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: They examined them in the town and the neighborhood of Smolensk. Among the members of this commission were Professor Prosorovski; Professor Smolianinov; the eldest and most learned collaborator of the Medico-Legal Research Institute, Dr. Semenovski; Professor of Pathological Anatomy Voropaev; Professor of Legal Chemistry Schwaikova, who was invited for consultations on chemico-legal subjects. To assist this commission, they called also medico-legal experts from the forces. Among them were the medical student Nikolski, Dr. Soubbotin . . .</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I doubt whether the Tribunal is interested in all these names. I ask you to answer the following question: What method of examination was chosen by you? What I mean is, did you strip the corpses of their clothes and were you satisfied with the customary post mortem examination or was every single one of these 925 corpses thoroughly examined?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: After exhumation of the corpses, they were thoroughly searched, particularly their clothing. Then an exterior examination was carried out and then they were subjected to a complete medico-legal dissection of all three parts of the body; that is to say, the skull, the chest, and the abdomen, as well as all the inner organs of these corpses.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me whether the corpses exhumed from these burial grounds bore traces of a previous medical examination?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Out of the 925 corpses which we examined, only three had already been dissected; and that was a partial examination of the skulls only. On all the others no traces of previous medical examination could be ascertained. They were clothed; and the jackets, trousers, and shirts were buttoned, the belts were strapped, and the knots of ties had not been undone. Neither on the head nor on the body were there any traces of cuts or other traces of medico-legal examination. Therefore this excludes the possibility of their having been subjected to any previous medico-legal examination.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the medico-legal examination which was carried out by your commission, did you open the skulls?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Of course. At the examination of quite a number of corpses the skull was opened and the contents of the skull were examined.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Are you acquainted with the expression pseudocallus?"</P>

<P>PROSORoVSKI: I heard of it when I received a book in 1945 in the Institute of Medico-Legal Science. Before that not a single medical legal expert observed any similar phenomena in the Soviet Union.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Among the 925 skulls which you examined were there many cases of pseudocallus?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Not one of the medico-legal experts who were examining these 925 corpses observed lime deposits on the inner Side of the cranium or on any other part of the skull.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, there was no sign of pseudocallus on any of the skulls.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: No.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was the clothing also examined?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: As already stated, the clothing was thoroughly examined. Upon the request of the Special Commission, and in the presence of its members and of the Metropolitan Nikolai, Academician Burdenko, and others, the medico-legal experts examined the clothing, the pockets of the trousers, of the coats, and of the overcoats. As a rule, the pockets were either turned, torn open, or cut open, and this testified to the fact that they had already been searched. The clothing itself, the overcoats, the jackets, and the trousers as well as the shirts, were moist with corpse liquids. This clothing could not be torn asunder, in spite of violent effort.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, the tissue of the clothing was solid?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, the tissue was very solid, and of course, it was besmeared with earth.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the examination, did you look into the pockets of the clothing and did you find any documents in them?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: As I said, most of the pockets were turned out or cut; but some of them remained intact. In these pockets, and also under the lining of the overcoats and of the trousers we discovered, for instance, notes, pamphlets, papers, closed and open letters and postcards, cigarette paper, cigarette holders, pipes, and so forth, and even valuables were found, such as ingots of gold and gold coins.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: These details are not very relevant, and therefore I beg you to refrain from giving them. I would like you to answer the following question: Did you discover in the clothing documents dated the end of 1940 and also dated 1941?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes. I discovered such documents, and my colleagues also found some. Professor Smolianinov, for instance, discovered on one of the corpses a letter written in Russian, and it was sent by Sophie Zigon, addressed to the Red Cross in Moscow, with the request to communicate to her the address of her husband, Thomas Zigon. The date of this letter was 9/12/1940. Besides the envelope bore the stamp of a post office in Warsaw of 9/1940, and also the stamp of the Moscow post office, dated 9/28/1940.</P>

<P>Another document of the same sort was discovered. It was a postcard sent from Tarnopol, with the post office cancellation: "Tarnopol, 9/12/1940."</P>

<P>Then we discovered receipts with dates, one in particular with the nameif I am not mistakenof Orashkevitch, certifying to the receipt of money with the date of 4/6/1941, and another receipt in his name, also referring to a money deposit, was dated 5/5/1941. Then, I myself discovered a letter with the date 6/20/1941, with the name of Irene Tutchinski, as well as other documents of 'the same sort.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the medico-legal examination of the corpses, were any bullets or cartridge cases discovered?</P>

<P>Please tell us what was the mark on these cartridge cases? Were .they of Soviet make or of foreign make; and if they were foreign make, which one, and what was the caliber?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: The cause of death of the Polish officers was bullet wounds in the nape of the neck. In the tissue of the brain or in the bone of the skull we discovered bullets which were more or less deformed. As to cartridge cases, we did indeed discover, during the exhumation, cartridge cases of German origin, for on their bases we found the mark G-e-c-o, Geco.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One minute, Witness.</P>

<P>I will now read an original German document and I beg the permission of the Tribunal to submit a series of documents which have been offered us by our American colleagues, Document Number 402-PS, Exhibit USSR-507. It concerns German correspondence and telegrams on Katyn, and these telegrams are sent by an official of the Government General, Heinrich, to the Government of the Government General.</P>

<P>I submit the original document to the Court. I am only going to read one document, a very short one, in connection with the cartridge cases discovered in the mass graves. The telegram is addressed to the Government of the Government General, care of First Administrative Counsellor Weirauch in Krakow. It is marked: "Urgent, to be delivered at once, secret.</P>

<P>"Part of the Polish Red Cross returned yesterday from Katyn. The employees of the Polish Red Cross have brought with them the cartridge cases which were used in shooting the victims of Katyn. It appears that these are German munitions. The caliber is 7.65. They are from the firm Geco. Letter follows." signed"Heinrich."</P>

<P>.[Turning to the witness.] Were the cartridge cases and cartridges which were discovered by you of the same caliber and did they bear the mark of the same firm?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: As I have already stated, the bullets discovered the bullet wounds were 7.65 caliber. The cases discovered during the exhumation did indeed bear the trademark of the firm Geco.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I now ask you to describe in detail the condition of the body tissues and of the inner organs of the corpses exhumed from the graves of Katyn.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: The skin and the inner organs of the corpses were well preserved. The muscles of the body and of the limbs had kept their structure. The muscles of the heart had also kept their characteristic structure. The substance of the brain was, in some cases, putrefied; but in most cases, it had kept its structural characteristics quite definitely, showing a clear distinction between the gray and white matters. Changes in the inner organs were mainly a sagging and shrinking. The hair from the head could be easily pulled out.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: From the examination of the corpses, to what conclusion did you come as to the date of death and date of burial?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: On the basis of the experience I have gained and on the experiences of Smolianinov, Semenovski, and other members of the commission...</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One moment, Witness. I would like you to tell the Tribunal briefly what these experiences were and how many corpses were exhumed. Did you personally exhume them or were they exhumed in your presence?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In the course of the great War, I was often medico-legal expert during the exhumation and the examination of corpses of victims who were shot by the Germans. These executions occurred in the town of Krasnodar and its neighborhood, in the town of Kharkov and its neighborhood, in the town of Smolensk and its neighborhood, in the so-called extermination camp of Maidanek, near Lublin, so that all told more than 5000 corpses were exhumed and examined with my personal co-operation.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Considering your experience and your objective observations, to what conclusions did you arrive as to the date of the death and the burial of the victims of Katyn?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: What I have just said applies to me as well as to many of my colleagues who participated in this work. The commission came to the unanimous conclusion that the burial of the Polish officers in the Katyn graves was carried out about 2 years before, if you count from January, the month of 1/1944that is to say that the date was autumn 1941.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did the condition of the corpses allow the conclusion that they were buried in 1940, objectively speaking?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: The medico-legal examination of the corpseS buried in the Katyn wood, when compared with the modifications, changes which were noticed by us during former exhumations on many occasions and also material evidence, allowed us to come to the conclusion that the time of the burial could not have been previous to the autumn of 1941.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, the year 1940 is out of question?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, it is completely excluded.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: If I understood you rightly you were also medico-legal expert in the case of other shootings in the district of Smolensk?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In the district of Smolensk and its environs I have exhumed and examined together with my assistants another 1,173 corpses, besides those of Katyn. They were exhumed from 87 graves.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How did the Germans camouflage the common graves of the victims which they had shot?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In the district of Smolensk, in Gadeonovka, the following method was used:</P>

<P>The top layer of earth on these graves was covered with turf, and in some cases, as in Gadeonovka, young trees were planted as well as bushes; all this with a view to camouflaging. Besides, in the so-called Engineers' Garden of the town of Smolensk, the graves were covered with bricks and paths were laid out.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you exhumed more than 5000 corpses in various parts of the Soviet Union.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What were the causes of death of the victims in most cases?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI In most cases the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head, or in the nape of the neck.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the causes of death at Katyn similar to those met with in other parts of the Soviet Union? I am speaking of mass-shootings.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: All shootings were carried out by one and the me method, namely, a shot in the nape of the neck, at point-blank range. The exit hole was usually on the forehead or in the face.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will read the last paragraph f your account on Katyn, mentioned in the report of the Extraordinary Soviet State Commission:</P>

<P>"The commission of the experts emphasizes the absolute uniformity of the method of shooting the Polish prisoners of war with that used for the shootings of Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet civilians. Such shootings were carried out on a vast scale by the German Fascist authorities during the temporary occupation of territories of the U.S.S.R., for instance, in the towns of Smolensk, Orel, Kharkov, Krasnodar and Voroneszh."</P>

<P>Do you corroborate this conclusion?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, this is the typical method used by the Germans to exterminate peace-loving citizens.</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions to put to this witness, Mr. President.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Where is your permanent residence, Witness?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I was born in Moscow and have my domicile there.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How long have you been in the Commissariat for Health?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I have been working in institutions for public health since 1931 and am at present in the Ministry of Public Health. Before that I was a candidate for the chair of forensic medicine at Moscow University.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: In this commission were there also foreign scientists?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In this commission there were no foreign medico-legal experts, but the exhumation and examination of these corpses could be attended by anybody who was interested. Foreign journalists, I believe 12 in number, came to the burial grounds and I showed them the corpses, the graves, the clothing, and so onin short everything they were interested in.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were there any foreign scientists present?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I repeat again that no one was present apart from Soviet experts of the medico-legal commission.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Can you give the names of the members of the press?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, he was giving a long-list of names before and he was stopped by his counsel.</P>

<P>Why do you shake your head?</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I did not understand, Mr. President, the one list of names. He gave a list of names of the members of the commission. My question is that: The witness has just said that members of the foreign press were present and that the results of the investigation were presented to them. I am now asking for the names of these members of the foreign press.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, go on.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Will you please give me the names of the members of the press, or at least the names of those who were present and to whom you presented the results of the examination?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Unhappily I cannot give you those names now here; but I believe that if it is necessary, I would be able to find them. I shall ascertain the names of all those foreign correspondents who were present at the exhumation of the corpses.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: The statement about the number of corpses exhumed and examined by you seems to have changed somewhat according to my notes, but I may have misunderstood. Once you mentioned 5000 and another time 925. Which figure is the correct one?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: You did not hear properly. I said that 925 corpses had been exhumed in the Katyn wood, but in general I personally exhumed or was present at the exhumation of over 5000 in many towns of the Soviet Union after the liberation of the territories from the Germans.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Were you actually present at the exhumation?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How long did you work at these exhumations?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: As I told you, on 14 January a group of medico-legal experts left for the site of the burial grounds together with the members of a special commission.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Can you not just say how long it tookthe whole exhumation? In other words, to shorten it, can you not say how long it took?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Very well. The exhumation and part of the examination of the corpses lasted from 1/16/1944 to 1/23/1944.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you find only Polish officers?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: All the corpses, with the exception of two which were found in civilian clothing, were in Polish uniforms and were therefore members of the Polish Army.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you try to determine from what camp these Polish officers came originally?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: That was not one of my duties. I was concerned only with the medico-legal examination of the corpses.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: You did not learn in any other way from what camp they came?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In the receipts which were found, dated 1941, it was stated that the money was received in camp 10-N. It can therefore be assumed that the camp number was obviously of particular importance.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you know of the Kosielsk Camp?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Only from hearsay. I have not been there.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that Polish officers were kept prisoners there?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I can say only what I heard. I heard that Polish officers were there, but I have not seen them myself nor have I been anywhere near there.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Did you learn anything about the fate of these officers?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: Since I did not make the investigations, I cannot say anything about the fate of these officers. About the fate of the officers, whose corpses were discovered in the graves of Katyn, I have already spoken.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: How many officers did you find altogether in the burial grounds at Katyn?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: We did not separate the corpses according to their rank; but, in all, there were 925 corpses exhumed and examined.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Was that the majority?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: The coats and tunics of many corpses bore shoulder straps with insignia indicating officers' rank. But even to-day I could not distinguish the insignia of rank of the Polish officers.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: What happened to the documents which were found on the Polish prisoners?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: By order of the special commission the searching of the clothing was done by the medico-legal experts. When these experts discovered documents they looked them through, examined them, and handed them over to the members of the special commission, either to Academician Burdenko or Academician Tolstoy, Potemkin, or any other members of the commission. Obviously these documents are in the archives of the Extraordinary State Commission.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Are you of the opinion that from the medical findings regarding the corpses the time when they were killed can be determined with certainty?</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: In determining the date on which these corpses had presumably been buried, we were guided by the experience which we had gathered in numerous previous exhumations and also found support by material evidence discovered by the medico-legal experts. Thus we were able to establish beyond doubt that the Polish officers were buried in the fall of 1941.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I asked whether from the medical findings you could determine this definitely and whether you did so.</P>

<P>PROSOROVSKI: I can again confirm what I have already said. Since we had great experience in mass exhumations, we came to that conclusion, in corroboration of which we also had much material evidence, which enabled us to determine the autumn of 1941 as the time of the burial of the Polish officers.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: I have no more questions to put to this witness. Mr. President, an explanation regarding the document which was just submitted; I have here only a copy signed by Heinrich; I have not seen the original.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I imagine the original is there.</P>

<P>DR. STAHMER: Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Colonel Smirnov, do you want to reexamine?</P>

<P>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to this witness; but with the permission of the Tribunal, I would like to make a brief statement.</P>

<P>We were allowed to choose from among the 120 witnesses whom we interrogated in the case of Katyn, only three. If the Tribunal is interested in hearing any other witnesses named in the reports of the Extraordinary State Commission, we have, in the majority of cases, adequate affidavits which we can submit at the Tribunal's request. Moreover, any one of these persons can be called to this Court if the Tribunal so desires.</P>

<P>That is all I have to say upon this matter.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the other defendants' counsel want to ask questions?</P>

<P>Then, do the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE ROBERT H. JACKSON (Chief of Counsel for the United States): Defendant, your counsel divided your examination into two parts which he described first as your personal responsibilities, and secondly as the political part of the case, and I will follow the same division.</P>

<P>You have stated a good many of the matters for which you were not responsible, and I want to make clear just what your sphere of responsibility was.</P>

<P>You were not only a member of the Nazi Party after 1932, but you held high rank in the Party, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what was the position which you held in the Party?</P>

<P>SPEER: I have already mentioned that during my pre-trial interrogations. Temporarily in 1934 I became a department head in the German Labor Front and dealt with the improvement of labor conditions in German factories. Then I was in charge of public works on the staff of Hess. I gave up both these activities in 1941. Notes of the conference I had with Hitler about this are available. After 2/8/1942 I automatically became Todt's successor in the central office for technical matters in the Reichsleitung of the NSDAP.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what was your official title?</P>

<P>SPEER: Party titles had just been introduced, and they were so complicated that I cannot tell you at the moment what they were. But the work I did there was that of a department chief in the Reichsleitung of the NSDAP. My title was Hauptdienstleiter or something of the kind.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In the 1943 directory it would appear that you were head of the "Hauptamt fur Technik."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And your rank appears to be "Oberbefehlsleiter"?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, that is quite possible.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Which as I understand corresponds 1 roughly to a lieutenant general in the army?</P>

<P>SPEER: Well, compared to the other tasks I had it was very little.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you attended Party functions from time to time and were informed in a general way as to the Party program, were you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Before 1942 I joined in the various Party rallies here in Nuremberg because I had to take part in them as an architect, and of course besides this I was generally present at official Party meetings or Reichstag sessions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you heard discussed, and were generally familiar with, the program of the Nazi Party in its broad outlines, were you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Of course.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Youthere is some question as to just what your relation to the SS was. Will you tell me whether you were a member of the SS?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, I was not a member of the SS.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You filled out an application at one time, or one was filled out for you, and you never went through with it, I believe, or something of that sort.</P>

<P>SPEER: That was in 1943 when Himmler wanted me to get a high rank in the SS. He had often wanted it before when I was still an architect. I got out of it by saying that I was willing to be an ordinary SS man under him because I had already been an SS man before. Thereupon, Gruppenfuhrer Wolff provisionally filled out an application form and wanted to know what my previous SS activities had been in 1932. It came up during his inquiries that in those days I was never registered as a member of the SS, and because of this they did not insist on my joining as I did not want to become a new member now.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And why did you not want to be a member of the SS, which was after all one of the important Party formations?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, I became well known for turning down all these honorary ranks. I did not want them because I felt that one should only hold a rank where one had responsibility.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you did not want any responsibility in the SS?</P>

<P>SPEER: I had too little contact with the SS, and did not want any responsibility in that connection.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now there has been some testimony about your relation to concentration camps, and, as I understand it, you have said to us that you did use and encourage the use of forced labor from the concentration camps.</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, we did use it in the German armament industry.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I think you also recommended that persons in labor camps who were slackers be sent to the concentration camps, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: That was the question of the so-called "Bummelanten," and by that name we meant workers who did not get to their work on time or who pretended to be ill. Severe measures were taken against such workers during the war, and I approved of these measures.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In fact, in the 10/30/1942 meeting of the Central Planning Board you brought the subject up in the following terms, did you notquoting Speer:</P>

<P>"We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained that the sick list decreases to one-fourth or one-fifth in factories where doctors are on the staff who examine the sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS and Police taking drastic steps and putting those known to be slackers into concentration camp factories. There is no alternative. Let it happen several times, and the news will soon get around."</P>

<P>That was your recommendation?</P>

<P>SPEER: Correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, the workmen stood in considerable terror of concentration camps, and you wanted to take advantage of that to keep them at their work, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: It is certain that concentration camps had a bad reputation with us, and the transfer to a concentration camp, or threat of such a possibility, was bound to reduce the number of absentees in the factories right from the beginning. But at that meeting, as I already said yesterday, there was nothing further said about it. It was one of the many remarks one can make in wartime when one is upset.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: However, it is very clearand if I misinterpret you I give you the chance to correct methat you understood the very bad reputation that the concentration camp had among the workmen and that the concentration camps were regarded as being much more severe than the labor camps as places to be in.</P>

<P>SPEER: That is correct. I knew that. I did not know, of course, what I have heard during this Trial, but the other thing was a generally known fact.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, it was known throughout Germany, was it not, that the concentration camps were pretty tough places to be put?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, but not to the extent which has been revealed in this Trial.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the bad reputation of the concentration camp, as a matter of fact, was a part of its usefulness in making people fearful of being sent there, was it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: No doubt concentration camps were a means, a menace used to keep order.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And to keep people at work?</P>

<P>SPEER: I would not like to put it in that way. I assert that a great number of the foreign workers in our country did their work quite voluntarily once they had come to Germany.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we will take that up later. You used- the concentration camp labor in production to the extent that you were required to divide the proceeds of the labor with Himmler, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: That I did not understand.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you made an agreement finally with Himmler that he should have 5 percent, or roughly 5 percent, of the production of the concentration camp labor while you would get for your work 95 percent?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, that is not quite true.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, tell me how it was. That is what the documents indicate, if I read them aright.</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, it is put that way in the Fuhrer minutes, but I s should like to explain the meaning to you. Himmler, as I said yesterday wanted to build factories of his own in his concentration -camps. Then he would have been able to produce arms without any outside control, which Hitler, of course, knew. The 5 percent arms production which was to have been handed to Himmler was to a certain extent a compensation for the fact that he himself gave up the idea of building factories in the camps. From the psychological ; point of view it was not so simple for me to get Himmler to give up this idea when he kept on reminding Hitler of it. I was hoping that he would be satisfied with the 5 percent arms production we were going to give him. Actually this 5 percent was never handed over. We managed things quietly with the Operations Staff of the OKW and with General Buhle, so that he never got the arms at all.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I am not criticizing the bargain, you understand. I don't doubt you did very well to get 95 percent, but the point is that Himmler was using, with your knowledge, concentration camp labor to manufacture arms, or was proposing to do so, and you wanted to keep that production within your control?</P>

<P>SPEER: Could the translation come through a bit clearer? Would you please repeat that?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You knew at this time that Himmler was using concentration camp labor to carry on independent industry and that he proposed to go into the armament industry in order to have a source of supply of arms for his own SS?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You also knew the policy of the Nazi Party and the policy of the Government towards the Jews, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I knew that the National Socialist Party was anti-Semitic, and I knew that the Jews were being evacuated from Germany.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In fact, you participated in that evacuation, did you not?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I gather that impression from Document L-156, Exhibit RF-1522, a letter from the Plenipotentiary for the Allocation of Labor which is dated 3/26/1943, which you have no doubt seen. You may see it again, if you wish. In which he says...</P>

<P>SPEER: I know it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "At the end of February, the Reichsfuhrer SS, in agreement with myself and the Reich Minister for armaments and munitions, for reasons of state security, has removed from their places of work all Jews who were still working freely and not in camps, and either transferred them to a labor corps or collected them for removal." Was that a correct representation of your activity?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Will you tell me what part you had in that? There is no question that they were put into labor corps or collected for removal, is there?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now you say you did not do it, so will you tell me who did?</P>

<P>SPEER: It was a fairly long business. When, in 2/1942, I took over my new office, the Party was already insisting that Jews who were still working in armament factories should be removed from them. I objected at the time, and managed to get Bormann to issue a circular letter to the effect that these Jews might go on being employed in armament factories and that Party offices were prohibited from accusing the heads of these firms on political grounds because of the Jews working there. It was the Gauleiter who made such political accusations against the heads of concerns, and it was mostly in the Gau Saxony and in the Gau Berlin. So after this the Jews could remain in these plants.</P>

<P>Without having any authority to do so, I had had this circular letter from the Party published in my news sheet to heads of factories and had sent it to all concerned, so that I would in any case receive their complaints if the Party should not obey the instruction. After that the problem was left alone, until September or -October of 1942. At that time a conference with Hitler took place, at which Sauckel also was present. At this conference Hitler insisted emphatically that the Jews must now be removed from the armament firms, and he gave orders for this to be donethis will be seen from a Fuhrer protocol which has been preserved. In spite of this we managed to keep the Jews on in factories and it was only in 3/1943, as this letter shows, that resistance gave way and the Jews finally did have to get out.</P>

<P>I must point out to you that, as far as I can remember, it was not yet a question of the Jewish problem as a whole, but in the years 1941 and 1942 Jews had gone to the armament factories to do important war work and have an occupation of military importance; they were able to escape the evacuation which at that time was.already in full swing. They were mostly occupied in the electrical industry, and Geheimrat Bucher, of the electrical industry that is AEG and Siemensno doubt lent a helping hand in order to get the Jews taken on there in greater numbers. These Jews were completely free and their families were still in their homes.</P>

<P>The letter by Gauleiter Sauckel you have before you was not, of course submitted to me; and Sauckel says that he himself had not seen it. But it is certainly true that I knew about it before action was taken; I knew because the question had to be discussed as to how one should get replacements. It is equally certain, though, that I also protested at the time at having skilled labor removed from my armament industries because, apart from other reasons, it was going to make things difficult for me.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is exactly the point that I want to emphasize. As I understand it, you were struggling to get manpOWer enough to produce the armaments to win a war for Germany.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And this anti-Semitic campaign was so strong that it took trained technicians away from you and disabled you from performing your functions. Now, isn't that the fact?</P>

<P>SPEER: I did not understand the meaning of your question.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your problem of creating armaments to win the war for Germany was made very much more difficult by this anti-Jewish campaign which was being waged by others of your codefendants.</P>

<P>SPEER: That is a certainty; and it is equally clear that if the Jews who were evacuated had been allowed to work for me, it would have been a considerable advantage to me.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, has it been proved who signed that document, L-156? It has got a signature apparently on it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There is a signature on it, I believe the plenipotentiary general for the employment of labor is my thought on it. We will look at that.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps the defendant could tell what the signature is.</P>

<P>The document was shown to the defendant.]</P>

<P>SPEER: I do not know the man. Yes, he must be one of the smaller officials in the offices of the Plenipotentiary for Labor, because I knew all the immediate associates of Sauckel personally no; I beg your pardon, the document comes from the Regierungsprasident in Koblenz, as I see here. Then it is an assistant in the Government District of Koblenz, whom of course I did not know.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In any event, there is no question about the statement as you have explained it?</P>

<P>SPEER: No.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now I want to ask you about the recruiting of forced labor. As I understand it, you know about the deportation of l00000 Jews from Hungary for subterranean airplane factories, and you told us in your interrogation of 10/18/1945 that you made no objection to it. That is true, is it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is true, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you told us also, quite candidly, on that day that it was no secret to you that a good deal of the manpower brought in by Sauckel was brought in by illegal methods. That is also true, is it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I took great care at the time to notice what expression the interrogating officer used; he used the expression "they came ; against their wish"; and that I confirmed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you not say that it was no secret to you that they were brought in an illegal manner? Didn't you add that yourself?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, no. That was certainly not so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, in any event, you knew that at the Fuhrer conference in August of 1942 the Fuhrer had approved of all coercive measures for obtaining labor if they couldn't be i obtained on a voluntary basis, and you knew that that program was carried out. You, as a matter of fact, you did not give any particular attention to the legal side of this thing, did you? You were 'after manpower; isn't that the fact?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is absolutely correct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And whether it was legal or illegal was not your worry?</P>

<P>SPEER: I consider that in view of the whole war situation and j of our views in general on this question it was justified.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, it was in accordance with the policy of the Government, and that was as far as you inquired at the time, was it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes. I am of the opinion that at the time I took over -my office, in 2/1942, all the violations of international law, which laterwhich are now brought up against me, had already been committed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you don't question that you share a certain responsibility for that program for bringing inwhether it is a legal responsibility or not, in factfor bringing in this labor against its will? You don't deny that, do you?</P>

<P>SPEER: The workers were brought to Germany largely against their will, and I had no objection to their being brought to Germany against their will. On the contrary, during the first period, until the autumn of 1942, I certainly also took some pains to see that as many workers as possible should be brought to Germany in this manner.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You had some participation in the distribution of this labor, did you not, as among different plants, different industries, that were competing for labor?</P>

<P>SPEER: No. That would have to be explained in more detailI do not quite understand it like that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you finally entered into an agreement with Sauckel, did you not, in reference to the distribution of the labor after it reached the Reich?</P>

<P>SPEER: That was arranged according to the so-called priority grades. I had to tell Sauckel, of course, in which of my programs labor was needed most urgently. But that sort of thing was dealt with by general instructions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, you established the priorities of different industries in their claim for the labor when it came into the Reich?</P>

<P>SPEER: That was a matter of course; naturally that had to be done.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. Now, as to the employment of prisoners of war, youwhatever disagreement there may be about the exact figures, there is no question, is there, that prisoners of war were used in the manufacture of armament?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, only Russian prisoners of war and Italian military internees were used for the production of arms. As for the use of French and other prisoners of war in this production I had several conferences with Keitel on the subject. And I must tell you that Keitel always adopted the view that these prisoners of war could not be used in violation of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention. I can claim that on the strength of this fact I no longer used my influence to see that these prisoners of war should be used in armament industries in violation of the Geneva Convention. The conception, of course, "production of arms" is very much open to argument. It always depends on what position one takes, whether you have a wide conception of "armaments" or a narrow one.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you succeeded to Dr. Todt's organization, and you had all the powers that he had, did you not?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And one of his directives was dated 10/31/1941, a letter from the OKW which is in evidence here as Exhibit 214, Document EC-194, which provides that the deputies of the Reich Minister for arms and munitions are to be admitted to prisoner-of-war camps for the purpose of selecting skilled workers. That was among your powers, was it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: No. That was a special action which Dr. Todt introduced on the strength of an agreement with the OKW. It was dropped later, however.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, on 4/22/1943, at the thirty-sixth meeting of this Planning Board, you made this complaint, did you not, Herr Speer? Quoting:</P>

<P>"There is a statement showing in what sectors the Russian POW's have been distributed, and this statement is quite interesting. It shows that the armament industry only received 30 percent. I always complained about that." That is correct, is it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I believe that has been wrongly translated. It should not say "munitions industry"; it should say, "The armament industry received 30 percent."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I said "armament."</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes. But this is still no proof that these prisoners of w-ar were employed in violation of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention, because in the sector of the armament industry there was ample room to use these workers for production articles which, in the sense of the Geneva Prisoner of War Agreement, were not armament products. However, I believe that in the case of the Russian prisoners of war, there was not the same value attached to strict observance of the Geneva Convention as in the case of prisoners from western countries.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is it your contention that the prisoners were not usedI now speak of French prisoners of war that French prisoners of war were not used in the manufacture of materials which directly contributed to the war, or is it your contention that although they were used it was legal under the Geneva Convention?</P>

<P>SPEER: As far as I know, French prisoners of war were not used contrary to the rules of the Convention. I cannot check that, because my office was not responsible for controlling the conditions of their employment. During my numerous visits to factories, I never noticed that any prisoner of war from the western territories was working directly on armament products.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Just tell exactly what French prisoners of war did do by way of manufacture. What were they working on?</P>

<P>SPEER: That I cannot answer. I already explained yesterday that the allotment of prisoners of war, or foreign workers, or German workers to a factory was not a matter for me to decide, but was carried out by the labor office, together with the Stalag, when it was a question of prisoners of war. I received only a general survey of the total number of workers who had gone to the factories, and so I could get no idea of what types of labor were being employed in each individual factory. So I cannot give a satisfactory answer to your question.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now let us take the 50000 skilled workers that you said yesterday you removed and put to work in a different location, that Sauckel complained about. What did you put them to work at?</P>

<P>SPEER: Those were not prisoners of war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Let us take those workers. What were you doing with them?</P>

<P>SPEER: Those workers had been working on the Atlantic Wall. From there they were transferred to the Ruhr to repair the two dams which had been destroyed by an air attack. I must say that the transfer of these 50000 workers took place without my knowledge, and the consequences of bringing 50000 workers from the West into Germany amounted to a catastrophe for us on the Atlantic Wall. It meant that more than one-third of all the workers engaged on the Atlantic Wall left because they, too, were afraid they might have to go to Germany. That is why we rescinded the order as quickly as possible, so that the French workers on the Atlantic Wall should have confidence in us. This fact will show you that the French workers we had working for the Organization Todt were not employed on a coercive basis, otherwise they could not have left in such numbers when they realized that under certain circumstances they, too, might be. taken to Germany. So these measures taken with the 50000 workers from the Organization Todt in France were only temporary and were revised later. It was one of those mistakes which can happen if a minister gives a harsh directive and his subordinates begin to carry it out by every means in their</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Are you familiar with Document EC-60, which reports that the labor organization of Todt had to recruit its manpower by force?</P>

<P>SPEER: At the moment I cannot recollect it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I beg your pardon?</P>

<P>SPEER: At this moment I cannot recollect it. Could I see the document?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, if you would like to. I just remind you that the evidence is to the contrary of your testimony on that subject.</P>

<P>Page 42, the paragraph which reads:</P>

<P>"Unfortunately the assignments for the Organization Todt on the basis of Article 52 of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare have for some time decreased considerably, because the larger part of the manpower allocated does not turn up. Consequently further compulsory measures must be employed. The prefect and the French labor exchanges co- operate quite loyally, it is true, but they have not sufficient authority to carry out these measures."</P>

<P>SPEER: I think that I have perhaps not understood correctly. I do not deny that a large number of the people working for the Organization Todt in the West had been called up and came to their work because they had been called up, but we had no means whatsoever of keeping them there by force. That is what I wanted to say. So if they did not want to work, they could leave again; and then they either joined the resistance movement or went into hiding somewhere else.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Very well. But this calling-up system was a system of compulsion, was it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: It was the calling-up of French workers for service in the Reich or in France. But here again I must add something. This report is dated 6/1943. In 10/1943 the whole of the Organization Todt was given the status of a "blocked factory" and thereby received the advantages which other blocked factories had. I explained that sufficiently yesterday. Because of this, the Organization Todt had large offers of workers who went there voluntarily, unless, of course, you see direct coercion in the pressure put on them through the danger of their transfer to Germany, and which led them to the Organization Todt or the blocked factories.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Were they kept in labor camps?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is the custom in the case of such building work.</P>

<P>The building sites were far away from any villages, and so workers' camps were set up to accommodate the German and foreign workers. But some of them were also accommodated in villages, as far as it was possible to accommodate them there. I do not think that on principle they were only meant to be accommodated in camps, but I cannot tell you that for certain.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Has the document been introduced before?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I was just going to give it to you. The document from which I have quoted is United States Exhibit 892.</P>

<P>Now, leaving the question of the personal participation in this . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Is it new, Mr. Justice Jackson?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: No, it has been in.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: It has been in before?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am told that I am wrong about that, and that it is new. 892 is a new number</P>

<P>[Turning to the defendant.] Leaving the part of your personal participation in this program...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Could you tell us what the document is and where it comes from? I see it is EC-60; so it must be captured. But ...</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It is one of the economic documents. It is a very large document.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Could you tell us what it is or who signed it? It is a very long document, apparently, is it?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It is a long document, and it is a report of the OberfeldkommandantL-I-L-L-E is the name of the signer.</P>

<P>Now, coming to the question...</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Let me look at the document, will you?</P>

<P>You see, Mr. Justice Jackson, my attention has been drawn to the point that as far as the record is concerned, we have only this extract which you read. We have not got the date, and we do not have the signature, if any, on the document.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: I was merely refreshing his recollection to get out the facts, and I was not really offering the document for its own sake. I will go into more detail about it, if Your Honor wishes. There is a great deal of irrelevant material in it.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: If you do not want to offer it, then we need not bother about it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: A great part of it is not relevant.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The quotation is adequately verified.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: In that case you may refer to it without the document being used. Then we need not have the document identified as an exhibit.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Turning to the defendant. Leaving the question of your personal participation in these matters and coming to the questions dealt with in the second part of your examination, I want to ask you about your testimony concerning the proposal to denounce the Geneva Convention.</P>

<P>You testified yesterday that it was proposed to withdraw from the Geneva Convention. Will you tell us who made those proposals?</P>

<P>SPEER: This proposal, as I already testified yesterday, came from Dr. Goebbels. It was made after the air attack on Dresden, but before this, from the autumn of 1944 on, Goebbels and Ley had often talked about intensifying the war effort in every possible way, so that I had the impression that Goebbels was using the attack on Dresden and the excitement it created merely as an excuse to renounce the Geneva Convention.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, was the proposal made at that time to resort to poison gas warfare? SPEER: I was not able to make out from my own direct observations whether gas warfare was to be started, but I knew from various associates of Ley's and Goebbels' that they were discussing the question of using our two new combat gases, Tabun and Sarin. They believed that these gases would be of particular efficacy, and ; they did in fact produce the most frightful results. We made these observations as early as the autumn of 1944, when the situation had ! become critical and many people were seriously worried about it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, will you tell us about these two gases and about their production and their effects, their qualities, and the preparations that were made for gas warfare?</P>

<P>SPEER: I cannot tell you that in detail. I am not enough of an expert. All I know is that these two gases both had a quite extraordinary effect, and that there was no respirator, and no protection against them that we knew of. So the soldiers would have been unable to protect themselves against this gas in any way. For the manufacture of this gas we had about three factories, all of which were undamaged and which until 11/1944 were working at full speed. When rumors reached us that gas might be used, I stopped its production in 11/1944. I stopped it by the following means. I blocked the so-called preliminary production, that is, the chemical supplies for the making of gas, so that the gas production, as the Allied authorities themselves ascertained, after the end of December or the beginning of January, actually slowed down and finally came to a standstill. Beginning with a letter which is still in existence and which I wrote to Hitler in 10/1944, I tried through legal methods to obtain his permission to have these gas factories stop their production. The reason I gave him was that on account of air raids the preliminary products, primarily cyanide, were needed urgently for other purposes. Hitler informed me that the gas production would have to continue whatever happened, but I gave instructions for the preliminary products not to be supplied any more.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Can you identify others of the group that were advocating gas warfare?</P>

<P>SPEER: In military circles there was certainly no one in favor of gas warfare. All sensible Army people turned gas warfare down as being utterly insane since, in view of your superiority in the air, it would not be long before it would bring the most terrible catastrophe upon German cities, which were completely unprotected.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The group that did advocate it, however, consisted of the political group around Hitler, didn't it?</P>

<P>SPEER: A certain circle of political people, certainly very limited. It was mostly Ley, Goebbels and Bormann, always the same three, who by every possible means wanted to increase the war effort; and a man like Fegelein certainly belonged to a group like that too. Of Himmler I would not be too sure, for at that time Himmler was a little out of favor with Hitler because he allowed himself the luxury of directing an army group without being qualified.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, one of these gases was the gas which you proposed to use on those who were proposing to use it on others, and I suppose your motive was...</P>

<P>SPEER: I must say quite frankly that my reason for these plans was the fear that under certain circumstances gas might be used, and the association of ideas in using it myself led me to make the whole plan.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And your reasons, I take it, were the same as the military's, that is to say, it was certain Germany would get the worst of it if Germany started that kind of warfare: That is what was worrying the military, wasn't it?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, not only that. It was because at that stage of the war it was perfectly clear that under no circumstances should any international crimes be committed which could be held against the German people after they had lost the war. That was what decided the issue.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, what about the bombs, after the war was plainly lost, aimed at England day after day; who favored that?</P>

<P>SPEER: You mean the rockets?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</P>

<P>SPEER: From the point of view of their technical production the rockets were a very expensive affair for us, and their effect compared to the cost of their output was negligible. In consequence we had no particular interest in developing the affair on a bigger scale. The person who kept urging it was Himmler, in this case. He gave one Obergruppenfuhrer Kammler the task of firing off these rockets over England. In Army circles they were of the same opinion as I, namely, that the rockets were too expensive; and in Air Force circles, the opinion was the same, since for the equivalent of one rocket one could almost build a fighter. It is quite clear that it would have been much better for us if we had not gone in for this nonsense.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Going back to the characteristics of this gas, was one of the characteristics of this gas an exceedingly high temperature? When it was exploded it created exceedingly high temperature, so that there could be no defense against it?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, that is an error. Actually, ordinary gas evaporates at normal atmospheric temperature. This gas would not evaporate until very high temperatures were reached and such very high temperatures could only be produced by an explosion; in other words, when the explosives detonated, a very high temperature set in, as you know, and then the gas evaporated. The solid substance turned into gas, but the effects had nothing to do with the high temperature.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Experiments were carried out with this gas, were they not, to your knowledge?</P>

<P>SPEER: That I can tell you. Experiments must certainly have been carried out with it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Who was in charge of the experimentations with the gases?</P>

<P>SPEER: As far as I know it was the research and development department of the OKH in the Army ordnance office. I cannot tell you for certain.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: And certain experiments were also conducted and certain researches conducted in atomic energy, were they not?</P>

<P>SPEER: We had not got as far as that, unfortunately, because the finest experts we had in atomic research had emigrated to America, and this had thrown us back a great deal in our research, so that we still needed another year or two in order to achieve any results in the splitting of the atom.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The policy of driving people out who didn't agree with Germany hadn't produced very good dividends, had it?</P>

<P>SPEER: Especially in this sphere it was a great disadvantage to us.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I have certain information, which was placed in my hands, of an experiment which was carried out near Auschwitz and I would like to ask you if you heard about it or knew about it. The purpose of the experiment was to find a quick and complete way of destroying people without the delay and trouble of shooting and gassing and burning, as it had been carried out, and this is the experiment, as I am advised. A village, a small village was provisionally erected, with temporary structures, and in it approximately 20000 Jews were put. By means of this newly invented weapon of destruction, these 20000 people were eradicated almost instantaneously, and in such a way that there was no trace left of them; that it developed, the explosive developed, temperatures of from 400 to 500 centigrade and destroyed them without leaving any trace at all.</P>

<P>Do you know about that experiment?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, and I consider it utterly improbable. If we had had such a weapon under preparation, I should have known about it. But we did not have such a weapon. It is clear that in chemical warfare attempts were made on both sides to carry out research on all the weapons one could think of, because one did not know which party would start chemical warfare first.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The reports, then, of a new and secret weapon were exaggerated for the purpose of keeping the German people in the war?</P>

<P>SPEER: That was the case mostly during the last phase of the war. From August, or rather June or 7/1944 on I very often went to the front. I visited about 40 front-line divisions in their sectors and could not help seeing that the troops, just like the German people, were given hopes about a new weapon coming, new weapons and wonder-weapons which, without requiring the use of soldiers, without military forces, would guarantee victory. In this belief lies the secret why so many people in Germany offered their lives, although common sense told them that the war was over. They believed that within the near future this new weapon would arrive. I wrote to Hitler about it and also tried in different speeches, even before Goebbels' propaganda leaders, to work against this belief. Both Hitler and Goebbels told me, however, that this was no propaganda of theirs but that it was a belief which had grown up amongst the people. Only in the dock here in Nuremberg, I was- told by Fritzsche that this propaganda was spread systematically among the people through some channels or other, and that SS Standartenfuhrer Berg was responsible for it. Many things have become clear to me since, because this man Berg, as a representative of the Ministry of Propaganda, had often taken part in meetings, in big sessions of my Ministry, as he was writing articles about these sessions. There he heard of our future plans and then used this knowledge to tell the people about them with more imagination than truth.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When did it become apparent that the war was lost? I take it that your attitude was that you felt some responsibility for getting the German people out of it with as little destruction as possible. Is that a fair statement of your position?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, but I did not only have that feeling with regard to the German people. I knew quite well that one should equally avoid destruction taking place in the occupied territories. That was just as important to me from a realistic point of view, for I said to myself that after the war the responsibility for all these destructions would no longer fall on us, but on the next German Government, and the coming German generations.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Where you differed with the people who wanted to continue the war to the bitter end, was that you wanted to see Germany have a chance to restore her life. Is that not a fact? Whereas Hitler took the position that if he couldn't survive, he didn't care whether Germany survived or not?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is true, and I would never have had the courage to make this statement before this Tribunal if I had not been able to prove it with the help of some documents, because such a statement is so monstrous. But the letter which I wrote to Hitler on 29 March, in which I confirmed this, shows that he said so himself.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, if I may comment, it was not a new idea to us that that was his viewpoint. I think it was expressed in most of the other countries that that was his viewpoint.</P>

<P>Now, were you present with Hitler at the time he received the telegram from Goring, suggesting that Goring take over power?</P>

<P>SPEER: On 23 April I flew to Berlin in order to take leave of several of my associates, andI should like to say this quite franklyafter all that had happened, also in order to place myself at Hitler's disposal. Perhaps this will sound strange here, but the conflicting feelings I had about the action I wanted to take against him and about the way he had handled things, still did not give me any clear grounds or any clear inner conviction as to what my relations should be toward him, so I flew over to see him. I did not know whether he knew of my plans, and I did not know whether he would order me to remain in Berlin. Yet I felt that it was my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again. It was on that day that Goring's telegram to Hitler arrived. This telegram was not to Hitler, but from Goring to Ribbentrop; it was Bormann who submitted it to him.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Submitted it to Hitler?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, to Hitler.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What did Hitler say on that occasion?</P>

<P>SPEER: Hitler was unusually excited about the contents of the telegram, and said quite plainly what he thought about Goring. He said that he had known for some time that Goring had failed, that he was corrupt, and that he was a drug addict. I was extremely -shaken, because I felt that if the head of the State had known this for such a long time, then it showed a lack of responsibility on his part to leave such a man in office, when the lives of countless people depended on him. It was typical of Hitler's attitude towards the entire problem, however, that he followed his statement up by saying: "But let him negotiate the capitulation all the same."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did he say why he was willing to let Goring negotiate the capitulation?</P>

<P>SPEER: No. He said in an offhand manner: "It doesn't matter anyway who does it." He expressed all his disregard for the German nation in the way he said this.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is, his attitude was that there was nothing left worth saving, so let Goring work it out. Is that a fair statement of his position?</P>

<P>SPEER: That was my impression, yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, this policy of driving Germany to destruction after the war was lost had come to weigh on you to such a point that you were a party to several plots, were you not, in an attempt to remove the people who were responsible for the destruction, as you saw it, of your country?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes. But I want to add...</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There were more plots than you have told us about, weren't there?</P>

<P>SPEER: During that time it was extremely easy to start a plot. One could accost practically any man in the street and tell him what the situation was, and then he would say: "This is insane"; and if he had any courage he would place himself at your disposal. Unfortunately, I had no organization behind me which I could call upon and give orders to, or designate who should have done this or_that. That is why I had to depend on personal conversations to contact all kinds of people. But I do want to say that it was not as dangerous as it looks here because actually the unreasonable people who were still left only amounted perhaps to a few dozen. The other 80 million were perfectly sensible as soon as they knew what it was all about.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Perhaps you had a sense of responsibility for having put the 80 million completely in the hands of the Fuhrer Principle. Did that occur to you, or does it now, as you look back on it?</P>

<P>SPEER: May I have the question repeated, because I did not understand its sense.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have 80 million sane and sensible people facing destruction; you have a dozen people driving them on to destruction and they are unable to stop it. And I ask if you have a feeling of responsibility for having established the Fuhrer Principle, which Goring has so well described for us, in Germany?</P>

<P>SPEER: I, personally, when I became Minister in 2/1942, placed myself at the disposal of this Fuhrer Principle. But I admit, that in my organization I soon saw that the Fuhrer Principle was full of tremendous mistakes, and so I tried to weaken its effect. The terrible danger of the authoritarian system, however, became really clear only at the moment when we were approaching the end. It was then that one could see what the principle really meant, namely, that every order should be carried out without criticism. Everything that has become known during this Trial in the way of orders carried out without any consideration, finally provedfor example the carrying-out of the order to destroy the bridges in our own countryto be a mistake or a consequence of this authoritarian system. The authoritarian systemor let me put it like thisupon the collapse of the authoritarian system it became clear what ,E tremendous dangers there are in a system of that kind, quite apart from the personality of Hitler. The combination of Hitler and this system, then, brought about these terrible catastrophes in the world.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, nowHitler is dead; I assume you accept thatand we ought to give the devil his due. Isn't it a fact that in the circle around Hitler there was almost no one who would stand up and tell him that the war was lost, except yourself?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is correct to a certain extent. Among the military leaders there were many who, each in his own sphere, told Hitler quite clearly what the situation was. Many commanders f of army groups, for instance, made it clear to him how catastrophic developments were, and there were often fierce arguments during the discussions on the situation. Men like Guderian and Jodl, for instance, often talked openly about their sectors in my presence, and Hitler could see quite well what the general situation was like. But I never observed that those who were actually responsible in the group around Hitler, ever went to him and said, "The war is lost." Nor did I ever see these people who had responsibility endeavor to unite in undertaking some joint step with Hitler. I did not attempt it for my part either, except once or twice, because it would have been useless, since at this stage, Hitler had so intimidated his closest associates that they no longer had any wills of their own.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, let us take the Number 2 man, who has told us that he was in favor of fighting to the very finish.</P>

<P>Were you present at a conversation between Goring and General Galland, in which Goring, in substance, forbade Galland to report the disaster that was overtaking Germany?</P>

<P>SPEER: No; in that form, that is not correct. That was another conference.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, tell us what there is about General Galland's conversation with Goring, as far as you know it.</P>

<P>SPEER: It was at the Fuhrer's headquarters in East Prussia in front of Goring's train. Galland had reported to Hitler that enemy fighter planes were already escorting bomber squadrons as far as Liege and that it was to be expected that in the future the bomber units would travel still farther from their bases escorted by fighters. After a discussion with Hitler on the military situation Goring upbraided Galland and told him with some excitement that this could not possibly be true, that the fighters could not go as far as Liege. He said that from his experience as an old fighter pilot he knew this perfectly well. Thereupon Galland replied that the fighters were being shot down, and were lying on the ground near Liege. Goring would not believe this was true. Galland was an outspoken man who told Goring his opinion quite clearly and refused to allow Goring's excitement to influence him. Finally Goring, as Supreme Commander of the Air Force, expressly forbade Galland to make any further reports on this matter. It was impossible, he said, that enemy fighters could penetrate so deeply in the direction of Germany, and so he ordered him to accept that as being true. I continued to discuss the matter afterward with Galland and Galland was actually later relieved by Goring of his duties as Commanding General of Fighters. Up to this time Galland had been in charge of all the fighter units in Germany. He was the general in charge of all the fighters within the High Command of the Air Force.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What is the date of that?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I was going to ask.</P>

<P>SPEER: It must have been toward the end of 1943.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, perhaps we had better adjourn now.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, very few were very valuable, were they not?</P>

<P>SPEER: The art treasures were valuable, not the workers.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: To him?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, let me ask you about your efforts in producing, and see how much difficulty you were having. Krupp's was a big factor in the German armament production, was it not?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The biggest single unit, wouldn't you say?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, but notjust to the extent I said yesterday. It produced few guns and armaments, but it was a big concern, one of the most respected ones in the armament industry.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you had prevented, as far as possible, the use of resources and manpower for the production of things that were not useful for the war, is not that true?</P>

<P>SPEER: That is true.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the things which were being created, being built in Krupp's, whether they were guns or other objects, were things which were essential to carrying on the economy or to conducting the war? That would be true, would it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Generally speaking one can say that in the end every article which in wartime is produced in the home country, whether it is a pair of shoes for the workers, or clothing, or coal is, of courseis made to assist in the war effort. That has nothing to do with the old conception, which has long since died out, and which we find in the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, at the moment I am not concerned with the question of the application of the Geneva Convention. I want to ask you some questions about your efforts to produce essential goods, whether they were armament or not armament, and the conditions that this regime was imposing upon labor and adding, as I think, to your problem of production. I think you can give us some information about this. You were frequently at the Krupp plant, were you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I was at the Krupp plant five or six times.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You had rather close information as to the progress of production in the Krupp plant, as well as others?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, when I went to visit these plants, it was mostly in order to see how we could do away with the consequences of air attacks. It was always shortly after air raids, and so I got an idea of the production. As I worked hard I knew a lot about these problems, right down to the details.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Krupp also had several labor camps, did they not?</P>

<P>SPEER: Of course, Krupp had labor camps.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Krupp was a very large user of both foreign labor and prisoners of war?</P>

<P>SPEER: I cannot give the percentage, but no doubt Krupp did employ foreign workers and prisoners of war.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I may say to you that we have investigated the Krupp labor camps, and from Krupp's own charts it appears that in 1943 they had 39245 foreign workers and 11234 prisoners of war, and that this steadily increased until in 9/1944 Krupp had 54990 foreign workers and 18902 prisoners of war.</P>

<P>Now, would that be somewhere near what you would expect from your knowledge of the industry?</P>

<P>SPEER: I do not know the details. I do not know the figures of how many workers Krupp employed in all. I am not familiar with them at the moment. But I believe that the percentage of foreign workers at Krupp was about the same as in other plants and in other armament concerns.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what would you say that percentage was?</P>

<P>SPEER: That varied a great deal. The old established industries which had their old regular personnel had a much lower percentage of foreign workers than the new industries which had just grown up and which had no old regular personnel. The reason for this was that the young age groups were drafted into the Armed Forces and therefore the concerns which had a personnel of older workers still retained a large percentage of the older workers. Therefore the percentage of foreign workers in Army armaments, if you take it as a whole and as one of the older industries, was lower than the percentage of foreign workers in air armaments, because that was a completely new industry which had no old regular personnel.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the foreign workers who were assigned to Krupplet us use Krupp as an examplewere housed in labor camps and under guard, were they not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I do not believe that they were under guard, but I cannot say. I do not want to dodge giving information here, but I had no time to worry about such things on my visits. The things I was concerned about when I went to a factory were in an entirely different sphere. In all my activities as Armament Minister I never once visited a labor camp, and cannot, therefore, give any information about them.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Well now, I am going to give you some information about the labor camp at Krupp's, and then I am going to ask you some questions about it. And I am not attempting to say that you were personally responsible for these conditions. I merely give you the indications as to what the regime was doing and I am going to ask you certain questions as to the effect of this sort of thing on your work of production.</P>

<P>Are you familiar with Document D-288, which is United States Exhibit 202, the affidavit of Dr. Jager, who was later brought here as a witness?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, but I consider that somewhat exaggerated.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: You don't accept that?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you have no personal knowledge of the conditions. What is the basis of your information that Dr. Jager's statement is exaggerated?</P>

<P>SPEER: If such conditions had existed, I should probably have heard of them, since when I visited plants the head of the plant naturally came to me with his biggest troubles. These troubles occurred primarily after air raids when, for example, both the German workers and foreign workers had no longer any proper shelter. This state of affairs was then described to me, so that I know that what is stated in the Jager affidavit cannot have been a permanent condition. It can only have been a condition caused temporarily by air raids, for a week or a fortnight, and which was improved later on. It is clear that after a severe air raid on a city all the sanitary installations, the water supply, gas supply, electricity, and so on, were out of order and severely damaged, so that temporarily there were very difficult conditions.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I remind you that Dr. Jager's affidavit relates to the time of 10/1942, and that he was a witness here. And, of course, you are familiar with his testimony.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well now, I call your attention to a new document, which is D-361, and would become United States Exhibit 893, a document signed by the office chief of the locomotive construction works, describing conditions of his labor supply, foreign labor.</P>

<P>And I am not suggestingI repeat I am not suggesting that this was your responsibility. I am suggesting it is the responsibility of the regime. I should like to read this despite its considerable length. This is dated at the boilermaking shop, 2/25/1942, addressed to Hupe by way of Winters and Schmidt.</P>

<P>"I received the enclosed letter of the 18th of this month from the German Labor Front, sent to my private address, inviting me to the Office of the German Labor Front. I tried to settle the business, which I did not know about, by telephone. The answer from the German Labor Front was that the matter was very important and called for my personal appearance. Thereupon I asked Herr Jungerich of the Department for Social Labor Matters whether I had to go. He answered, 'You probably do not have to, but it would be better if you went.' About 9:50 I went to Room 20 at the place indicated and met Herr Prior.</P>

<P>"The following provided the subject of this conversation, which Herr Prior carried on in a very excited manner, and which lasted about half an hour:</P>

<P>"On the 16th, 23 Russian prisoners of war were assigned to Number 23 Boiler Shop. The people came in the morning without bread and tools. During both breaks the prisoners of war crept up to the German workers and begged for bread, pitifully pointing out their hunger. (For lunch on the first day the factory was able to distribute among the Russians rations which remained over from French POW's. In order to alleviate these conditions, I went to the Weidkamp kitchen on the 17th, on instructions from Herr Theile, and talked to the head of the kitchen, Fraulein Block, about the provision of the midday meal. Fraulein Block promised me the food immediately, and also lent me the 22 sets of eating utensils which I asked for. At the same time I asked Fraulein Block to give any food left over by the 800 Dutchmen messing there to our Russian POW's at noon until further notice. Fraulein Block promised to do this too, and the following noon she sent down a container of milk soup as an extra. The following noon the ration was short in quantity. Since a few Russians had collapsed already, I telephoned Fraulein Block and asked for an increase in the food, as the special ration had ceased from the second day onwards. As my telephone conversation was unsuccessful, I again visited Fraulein Block personally. Fraulein Block refused in a very abrupt manner to give any further special ration.</P>

<P>"Now, regarding the discussion in detail, Herr Prior, two other gentlemen of the DAF and Fraulein Block, head of the Weidkamp kitchen, were present in the room. Herr Prior commenced and accused me, gesticulating, and in a very insulting manner, of having taken the part of the Bolsheviks in a marked way. He referred to the law paragraphs of the Reich Government which spoke against it. I was unfortunately not clear about the legal position, otherwise I would have left the conference room immediately. I then tried to make it clear to Herr Prior, with special emphasis, that the Russian POW's were assigned to us as workers and not as Bolsheviks; the people were starved and not in a position to perform the heavy work with us in the boiler shop which they were supposed to do; sick people are a dead weight to us and not a help to production. To this remark Herr Prior stated that if one was no good, then another was; that the Bolsheviks were a soulless people; and if 100000 of them died, another 100000 would replace them. On my remarking that with such a coming and going we would not attain our goal, namely the delivery of locomotives to the Reichsbahn, who were continually cutting down the time limit, Herr Prior said, 'Deliveries are only of secondary importance here.'</P>

<P>"My attempts to get Herr Prior to understand our economic needs were not successful. In closing, I can only say that as a German I know our relations to the Russian prisoners of war exactly, and in this case I acted only on behalf of my superiors and with the view to the increase in production which is demanded from us."</P>

<P>It is signed, "Sohling, Office Chief, Locomotive Construction Works."</P>

<P>And there is added this letter as a part of the communication, signed by Theile:</P>

<P>"I have to add the following to the above letter:</P>

<P>"After the Russian POW's had been assigned to us on the 16th of this month by labor supply, I got into touch with Dr. Lehmann immediately about their food. I learned from him that the prisoners received 300 gr. of bread each between 0400 and 0500 hours. I pointed out that it was impossible to last until 1800 hours on this ration of bread, whereupon Dr. Lehmann said that the Russians must not be allowed to get used to western European feeding. I replied that the POW's could not do the work required of them in the boiler</P>

<P>shop on that food, and that it was not practical for us to have these people in the works any longer under such conditions. At the same time I demanded that if the Russians continued to be employed, they should be given a hot midday meal, and that if possible the bread ration should be split so that one-half was distributed early in the morning and the second half during our breakfast break. My suggestion has already been carried out by us with the French POW's and has proved to be very practicable and good.</P>

<P>"Unfortunately, however, Dr. Lehmann took no notice of my suggestion, and on this account I naturally had to take matters into my own hands and therefore told Herr Sohling to get the feeding of the Russian POW's organized on exactly the same lines as for the French POW's, so that the Russians could as soon as possible carry out the work they were supposed to do. For the whole thing concerns an increase in production such as is demanded from us by the Minister of munitions and armaments and by the DAF."</P>

<P>Now, I ask you, in the first place, if the position of the chief of the locomotive construction works was not entirely a necessary position in the interests of production?</P>

<P>SPEER: It is clear that a worker who has not enough food cannot achieve a good work output. I already said yesterday that every head of a plant, and I too at the top, was naturally interested in having well-fed and satisfied workers, because badly fed, dissatisfied workers make more mistakes and produce poor results.</P>

<P>I should like to comment on this document. The document is dated 2/25/1942. At that time there were official instructions that the Russian workers who came to the Reich should be treated worse than the western prisoners of war and the western workers. I learned of this through complaints from the heads of concerns. In my document book, there is a Fuhrer protocol which dates from the middle of 3/1942that is, 3 or 4 weeks after this documentin which I called Hitler's attention to the fact that the feeding both of Russian prisoners of war and of Russian workers was absolutely insufficient and that they would have to be given an adequate diet, and that moreover the Russian workers were being kept behind barbed wire like prisoners of war and that that would have to be stopped also. The protocol shows that in both cases I succeeded in getting Hitler to agree that conditions should be changed and they were changed.</P>

<P>I must say furthermore that it was really to Sauckel's credit that he fought against a mountain of stupidity and did everything so that foreign workers and prisoners of war should be treated better and receive decent food.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we will go on with the conditions later. Because I am going to ask you, if you are not responsible and Sauckel is not responsible, v.ho is responsible for these conditions, and you can keep it in mind that is the question that we are coming up to here.</P>

<P>I will show you a new document, which is a statement, D-398, which would be Exhibit USA 894-A, taken by the British-American team in the investigation of this work camp at Krupp's.</P>

<P>Well, D-321. I can use that just as well. We will use Document D-321, which becomes 893.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: 894 was the last number you gaze us. What number is this document that you are now offering?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: 398 was 894. 321 will be 895.</P>

<P>Now, this relates to thethis is an employee of the Reich Railways. None of our investigation, I may say, is based upon the statements of the prisoners themselves.</P>

<P>"I, the undersigned, Adam Schmidt, employed as Betriebswart on the Essen-West Railway Station and residing . . . state voluntarily and on oath:</P>

<P>"I have been employed by the Reich Railways since 1918 and have been at Essen-West Station since 1935. In the middle of 1941 the first workers arrived from Poland, Galicia, and the Polish Ukraine. They came to Essen in trucks in which potatoes, building materials and also cattle had been transported, and were brought to perform work at Krupp's. The trucks were jammed full with people. My personal view was that it was inhuman to transport people in such a manner. The people were packed closely together and they had no room for free movement. The Krupp overseers laid special value on the speed with which the slave workers got in and out of the trucks. It was enraging for every decent German who had to watch this to see how the people were beaten and kicked and generally maltreated in a brutal manner. In the very beginning when the first transport arrived we could see how inhumanly these people were treated. Every truck was so overfilled that it was incredible that such a number of people could be jammed into one. I could see with my own eyes that sick people who could scarcely walk they were mostly people with foot trouble, or with injuries, and people with internal trouble) were nevertheless taken to work. One could see that it was sometimes difficult for them to move. The same can be said of the Eastern Workers and POW's who came to Essen in.the middle of 1942."</P>

<P>He then describes their clothing and their food. In the interest of time, I will not attempt to read the entire thing.</P>

<P>Do you consider that that, too, is an exaggerated statement?</P>

<P>SPEER: When the workers came to Germany from the East, their clothing was no doubt bad, but I know from Sauckel that while he was in office a lot was done to get them better clothes, and in Germany many of the Russian workers were brought to a considerably better condition than they had previously been in in Russia. The Russian workers were quite satisfied in Germany. If they arrived here in rags, that does not mean that that was our fault. We could not use ragged workers with poor shoes in our industry, so conditions were improved.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, now, I would like to call your attention to D-398.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, before you pass from that, what do you say about the conditions of the transports? The question you were asked was whether this was an exaggerated account. You have not answered that except in reference to clothing.</P>

<P>SPEER: Mr. President, I cannot give any information about this transport matter. I received no reports about it.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I will ask you about Exhibit 398, which becomes USA-894. I mean Document 398, which becomes Exhibit 894, a statement by Homer, living in Essen:</P>

<P>"From 4/1943 I worked with Lowenkamp every day in Panzer Shop 4. Lowenkamp was brutal to the foreigners. He confiscated food which belonged to the POW's and took it home. Every day he maltreated Eastern Workers, Russian POW's, French, Italian, and other foreign civilians. He had a steel cabinet built which was so small that one could hardly stand in it. He locked up foreigners in the box, women too, for 48 hours at a time without giving the people food.</P>

<P>"They were not released even to relieve nature. It was forbidden for other people, too, to give any help to the persons locked in, or to release them. While clearing a concealed store he fired on escaping Russian civilians without hitting any of them.</P>

<P>"One day, while distributing food, I saw how he hit a French civilian in the face with a ladle and made his face bleed. Further, he delivered Russian girls without bothering about the children afterwards. There was never any milk for them so the Russians had to nourish the children with sugar water. When Lowenkamp was arrested he wrote two letters and sent them to me through his wife. He tried to make out that he never beat people."</P>

<P>There is a good deal more of this, but I will not bother to put it into the record.</P>

<P>Is it your view that that is exaggerated?</P>

<P>SPEER: I consider this affidavit a lie. I would say that among German people such things do not exist, and if such individual cases occurred they were punished. It is not possible to drag the German people in the dirt in such a way. The heads of concerns were decent people too, and took an interest in their workers. If the head of the Krupp plant heard about such things, he certainly took steps immediately.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, what about the steel boxes? The steel box couldn't have been built? Or don't you believe the steelbox story?</P>

<P>SPEER: No, I do not believe it; I mean I do not believe it is true. After the collapse in 1945 a lot of affidavits were certainly drawn up which do not fully correspond to the truth. That is not your fault. It is the fault ofafter a defeat, it is quite possible that people F lend themselves to things like that.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I would like to have you examine Document 258, and I attach importance to this as establishing the SS as being the guards:</P>

<P>"The camp inmates were mostly Jewish women and girls from Hungary and Romania. The camp inmates were brought to Essen at the beginning of 1944 and were put to work at Krupp's. The accommodation and feeding of the camp prisoners was beneath all dignity. At first the prisoners were accommodated in simple wooden huts. These huts were burned down during an air raid and from that time on the prisoners had to sleep in a damp cellar. Their beds were made on the floor and consisted of a straw-filled sack and two blankets. In most cases it was not possible for the prisoners to wash themselves daily, as there was no water. There was no possibility of having a bath. I could often observe from the Krupp factory, during the lunch break, how the prisoners boiled their under-clothing in an old bucket or container over a wood fire, and cleaned themselves. An air-raid trench served as shelter, while the SS guards went to the Humboldt shelter, which was bombproof. Reveille was at 5 a. m. There was no coffee or any food served in the morning. They marched off to the factory at 5.15 a. m. They marched for three-quarters of an hour to the factory, poorly clothed and badly shod, some without shoes, and covered with a blanket, in rain or snow.</P>

<P>Work began at 6 a. m. The lunch break was from 12 to 12.30. Only during the break was it at all possible for the prisoners to cook something for themselves from potato peelings and other garbage. The daily working period was one of 10 or 11 hours. Although the prisoners were completely undernourished, their work was very heavy physically. The prisoners were often maltreated at their work benches by Nazi overseers and female SS guards. At 5 or 6 in the afternoon they were marched back to camp. The accompanying guards consisted of female SS who, in spite of protests from the civil population, often maltreated the prisoners on the way back with kicks, blows, and scarcely repeatable words. It often happened that individual women or girls had to be carried back to the camp by their comrades owing to exhaustion. At 6 or 7 p.m. these exhausted people arrived back in camp. Then the real meal was distributed. This consisted of cabbage soup. This was followed by the evening meal of water soup and a piece of bread which was for the following day. Occasionally the food on Sundays was better. As long as it existed there was never any inspection of the camp by the firm of Krupp. On 3/13/1945 the camp prisoners were brought to Buchenwald Concentration Camp, from there some were sent to work. The camp commandant was SS Oberscharfuhrer Rick. His present whereabouts is unknown."</P>

<P>The rest of it doesn't matter. In your estimation that, I suppose, is also an exaggeration?</P>

<P>SPEER: From the document...</P>

<P>DR. FLACHSNER: Mr. President . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: May I hear the answer. I thought the defendant said something.</P>

<P>DR. FLACHSNER: May I call the attention of the Court to the document itself, of which I have only a copy? It is headed "Sworn on oath before a military court," and there is an ordinary signature under it. It does not say that it is an affidavit or a statement in lieu of oath, or any other such thing, it says only, "Further inquiries must be made," and it is signed by Hubert Karden. That is apparently the name of the man who was making the statement. Then there is another signature, "Kriminalassistent Z. Pr." That is a police official who is on probation and who may later have the chance of becoming a candidate in the criminal service. He has signed it. Then there is another signature, "C. E. Long, Major, President." There is not a word in this document to the effect that any of these three people want to vouch for the contents of this as an affidavit. I do not believe this document can be used as an affidavit in that sense.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Justice Jackson? Do you wish to say anything?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Ithe document shows for itself. I am notas I have pointed out to this witness, I am giving him the result of an investigation. I am not prosecuting him with personal responsibility for these conditions. I intend to ask him some questions about responsibility for conditions in the camp.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Well, there is a statement at the top of the copy that I have got, "Sworn on oath before a military court."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, they were taken in Essen, in this investigation. And of course, if I were charging this particular defendant with the responsibility there might be some argument about it. They come under the headthey clearly come under the head of the Charter, which authorizes the receipt here of proceedings of other courts.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got the original document here?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</P>

<P>[A document was submitted to the Tribunal.]</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal sees no objection to the document being used in cross-examination.</P>

<P>Did you give it an exhibit number?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should have; it is USA-896.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: [Turning to the defendant.] I now want to call your attention to Exhibit Number 382.</P>

<P>SPEER: I wanted to comment on the document.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, there are some photographs which have been put before us. Are they identified and do they form part of an exhibit?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: They form part of the exhibit which I am now offering.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I see.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But the witness desires to comment on the last document, and I will listen to that before we go ahead.</P>

<P>SPEER: First I should like to say, as you have so often mentioned my non-responsibility, that if in general these conditions had been true, on the basis of my statement yesterday I should consider myself responsible. I refuse to evade responsibility. But the conditions were not what they are said to have been here. There are only individual cases which are quoted.</P>

<P>As for this document I should only like to say from what I have seen of it that this seems to concern a concentration camp, one of the small concentration camps near the factories. The factories could not inspect these camps. That is why the sentence is quite true where it says that no factory representative ever saw the camp. The fact that there were SS guards also shows that it was a concentration camp.</P>

<P>If the question which you asked me before, as to whether the labor camps were guardedthose for foreign workersif that refers to this document, then your conclusion was wrong. For as far as I know, the other labor camps were not guarded by SS or by any other organizations.</P>

<P>My position is such that I feel it is my duty to protect the heads of plants from any injustice which might be done them. The head of a plant could not bother about the conditions in such a camp. I cannot say whether conditions were as described in this camp. We have seen so much material on conditions in concentration camps during the Trial.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now I will ask to have you shown Exhibit Number D-382I should say Document D-382which would be United States Exhibit 897. Now that is the statement of several persons as to one of those steel boxes which stood in the foreign workers' camp in the grounds of Number 4 Armor Shop, and of those in the Russian camp. I do not know that it is necessary to read the complete descriptions.</P>

<P>Is that merely an individual instance, or what is your view of that circumstance?</P>

<P>SPEER: What is pictured here is quite a normal locker as was used in every factory. These photographs have absolutely no value as evidence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Very well. I will ask to have you shown Exhibit D-230. Together with D-230 is an interoffice record of the steel switches, and the steel switches which have been found in the camp will be shown to you. Eighty were distributed, according to the reports.</P>

<P>SPEER: Shall I comment on this?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If you wish.</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes. Those are nothing but replacements for rubber truncheons. We had no rubber; and for that reason, the guards probably had something like this.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is the same inference that I drew from the document.</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, but the guards did not immediately use these steel switches any more than your police use their rubber truncheons. But they had to have something in their hands. It is the same thing all over the world.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we won't argue that point.</P>

<P>SPEER: I am not an expert. I only assume that that is the case. I cannot testify on oath that that was the case. That was only an argument.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Did you give a number to that?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: 898, Your Honor.</P>

<P>Now, 899 would be our Document D-283, which is a 1943 report from the Krupp hospitals taken from the files of Krupp's.</P>

<P>"The subject:</P>

<P>"Cases of Deaths of Eastern Workers.</P>

<P>"Fifty-four Eastern Workers have died in the hospital in Lazarettstrasse, 4 of them as a result of external causes and 50 as a result of illness.</P>

<P>"The causes of death in the case of these 50 Eastern Workers who died of illnesses were the following: Tuberculosis, 36 (including 2 women); malnutrition, 2; internal hemorrhage, 1; disease of the bowels, 2; typhoid fever, 1 (female); pneumonia, 3; appendicitis, 1 (female); liver trouble, 1; abscess of the brain, 1. This list therefore shows that four-fifths died of tuberculosis and malnutrition."</P>

<P>Now, did you have any reports from time to time as to the health conditions of the labor which was engaged in your production program?</P>

<P>SPEER: First I should like to comment on the document. The document does not show the total number of the workers to which the number of deaths refers, so that one cannot say whether that is an unnaturally high proportion of illness. At a session of the Central Planning Board which I read here again, I observed i it was said that among the Russian workers there was a high rate of tuberculosis. I do not know whether you mean that. That was a remark which Weiger made to me. But presumably through the health offices we tried to alleviate these conditions.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: There was an abnormally high rate of deaths from tuberculosis; there is no doubt about that, is there?</P>

<P>SPEER: I do not know whether that was an abnormal death rate. But there was an abnormally high rate of tuberculosis at times.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the exhibit does not show whether the death rate itself was abnormally high, but it shows an abnormal proportion of deaths from tuberculosis among the total deaths, does it not? Eighty percent deaths from tuberculosis is a very high incidence of tuberculosis, is it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: That may be. I cannot say from my own knowledge.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now I would like to have you shown . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Did you give that a number? That would be 899, would it not?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: 899, Your Honor.</P>

<P>Now, let me ask you to be shown Document D-335. This is a report from the files of Krupp, dated at Essen on 6/12/1944, directed to the "Gau Camp Physician, Herr Dr. Jager," and signed by Stinnesbeck:</P>

<P>"In the middle of May I took over the medical supervision of the POW Camp 1420 in the Norggerathstrasse. The camp contains 644 French POW's.</P>

<P>"During the air raid on 27 April of this year the camp was largely destroyed and at the moment conditions are intolerable.</P>

<P>"315 prisoners are still accommodated in the camp. 170 of these are no longer in huts, but in the tunnel in Grunerstrasse on the Essen-Mulheim railway line. This tunnel is damp and is not suitable for continued accommodation of human beings. The rest of the prisoners are accommodated in 10 different factories in Krupp's works.</P>

<P>"Medical attention is given by a French military doctor who takes great pains with his fellow countrymen. Sick people from Krupp's factories must be brought to the sick parade too. This parade is held in the lavatory of a burned-out public house outside the camp. The sleeping accommodations of the four French medical orderlies is in what was the urinal room. There is a double tier wooden bed available for sick bay patients. In general, treatment takes place in the open. In rainy weather it has to be held in this small room. These are insufferable conditions! There are no chairs, tables, cupboards, or water. The keeping of a register of sick is impossible.</P>

<P>"Bandages and medical supplies are very scarce, although people badly hurt in the works are often brought here for first aid and have to be bandaged before being taken to the hospital. There are many strong complaints about food, too, which the guard personnel confirm as being justified.</P>

<P>"Illness and less manpower must be reckoned with under these circumstances.</P>

<P>"The construction of huts for the accommodation of the prisoners and the building of sick quarters for the proper treatment of the sick persons is urgently necessary.</P>

<P>"Please take the necessary steps.</P>

<P>"(Signed) Stinnesbeck."</P>

<P>SPEER: That is a document which shows what conditions can e after severe air raids. The conditions were the same in these cases for Germans and foreign workers. There were no beds, no cupboards, and so forth. That was because the camp in which these things had been provided had been burned down. That the food supply was often inadequate in the Ruhr district during this period was due to the fact that attacks from the air were centered on communication lines, so that food transports could not be brought into the Ruhr to the necessary extent. These were temporary conditions which we were able to improve when the air raids ceased for a time. When conditions became even worse after September or October of 1944, or rather after November of 1944, we made every effort to give food supplies the priority for the first time over armament needs, so that in view of these difficulties the workers would be fed first of all, while armaments had to stand back somewhat.[=]</P>

<P>MR JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, then you did make it your business to get food and to see to the conditions of these workers? Do I understand that you did it, that you took steps?</P>

<P>SPEER: It is true that I did so, and I am glad that I did, even if I am to be reproached for it. For it is a universal human obligation when one hears of such conditions to try to alleviate them, even if it is somebody else's responsibility. But the witness Riecke testified here that the whole of the food question was under the direction of the Food Ministry.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it was an essential part of production, was it not, to keep workers in proper condition to produce? That is elementary, is it not?</P>

<P>SPEER: No. That is wrongly formulated.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you formulate it for me as to what the relation is between the nourishment of workers and the amount of production produced.</P>

<P>SPEER: I said yesterday that the responsibility for labor conditions was divided up between the Food Ministry, the Health Office in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, the Labor Trustee in the office of the Plenipotentiary General for the Allocation of Labor, and J so on. There was no comprehensive authority in my hands. In the Reich, because of the way in which our state machine was built up, we lacked a comprehensive agency in the form of a Reich Chancellor, who would have gathered all these departments together and held joint discussions. But I, as the man responsible for production, had no responsibility in these matters. However, when I heard complaints from factory heads or from my deputies, I did everything to remove the cause of the complaints.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Krupp works . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Shall we break off now?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Any time you say, Sir.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal wish to hear from defendants' counsel what arrangements they have found it possible to make -with reference to the apportionment of time for their speeches.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: I should like first of all to point out that the defendants' counsel, with whom the Tribunal discussed the question of final defense speeches during an earlier closed session, did not inform the other defendants' counsel, since they were under the impression that the Tribunal would not impose any restrictions on the Defense in this respect. I personally, when I raised my objections, had no knowledge of this discussion, as my colleagues who conferred with you earlier have authorized me to explain.</P>

<P>On the suggestion of the Tribunal, counsel for the individual defendants have discussed the decision announced in the session of 6/13/1946, and I am now submitting to the Tribunal the outcome of the discussion; in doing so, however, I shall have to make certain qualifications, since some of my colleagues are either not present or differ in their opinion on the apportionment of time.</P>

<P>The defendants' counsel are of the opinion that only the conscientious judgment of each counsel can determine the form and length of the final defense pleas in this unusual Trial, notwithstanding the generally recognized right of the Tribunal, as part of its responsibility for guiding the proceedings, to prevent a possible</P>

<P>misuse of the freedom of speech. They also believe that, in view 1 of this fundamental consideration and in view of the usual practice</P>

<P>-of international courts, the Tribunal will understand and approve that the defendants' counsel voice their objection to a preventive restriction of the freedom of speech, for a misuse on their part must not simply be taken as a foregone conclusion. This fundamental attitude is, of course, in accord with the readiness of the Defense to comply with the directives and the wishes of the Tribunal as far as is reconcilable with a proper conception of the defense in each</P>

<P>-case. Under this aspect the individual defendants' counsel have been asked to make their own estimates of the probable duration of their final pleas. The result of these estimates shows that, despite the limitations counsel have imposed upon themselves, and with due respect to the wishes of the High Tribunal, a total duration of approximately 20 full days in court is required by the Defense.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, the Tribunal asked Defense Counsel for an apportionment of the 14 days between them.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: I believe, Mr. President, my statement makes clear that it appears impossible to accept that principle. If the Tribunal consider these 14 full days as indisputable, then the entire Defense will submit to that decision. But so far as I know, it will be quite impossible, under such circumstances, to obtain agreement among Defense Counsel, and considerable danger therefore exists that counsel who make their pleas later will be under pressure of time.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think the Tribunal probably fully understands that you think 14 daysyou and your brethren consider that 14 days is too shortbut, as I say, what the Tribunal asked for was an apportionment of the time, and there is nothing in what you have said to indicate that you have made any apportionment at all, either of the 14 days or of the 20 days which you propose.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: The period of 20 days was arrived at when each defendant's counsel had stated the presumed duration of his speech. It would, therefore, be perfectly possible to say that if the Tribunal would approve the duration of 20 days, then we could state our solution for the length of the individual speeches. But it is impossible, in practice, to apportion the time, if the total number of days is only 14. You can rest assured, Mr.President, that we have all gone into the question conscientiously and that we have also reflected on the manner in which individual subjects can be divided among individual defendants' counsel; but the total number of about 20 days appears to us, without wanting to quote a maximum or minimum figure, to be absolutely essential for an apportionment. It is perfectly possible, Mr. President, that in the course of the speeches . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, as I have indicated to you, what the Tribunal wanted to know was the apportionment, and presumably you have some apportionment which adds up to the 20 days which you say is required; and the Tribunal would like, if you have such an apportionment, that you should let them see the apportionment, or if you have no such apportionment, then they would wish to hear from each individual counsel how long he thinks he is going to take. If you have got a list, it seems to the Tribunal that you could hand it in.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: The figures are available and they will be handed to the Tribunal, but some of my colleagues have said that their estimates are only valid on the assumption that no more than a specific number of days was to be granted. That is the point of view of which I said earlier that it differed in some respect. But we all thought that the decision of the Tribunal was only a suggestion, and not a maximum to be apportioned. I hope, Mr. President, that your words now are also to be understood in that way, and that the Tribunal will still consider whether the proposed period of 14 days could not be extended to correspond with the time which we consider necessary.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What the Tribunal wants is an apportionment of the time as between the various counsel. That is what they asked for and that is what they want; and either we would ask you to give it to us in writing now, or we would ask you, each one of you, to state how long you anticipate you will take in your speech.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: I think that I may speak on behalf of my colleagues and say that we shall submit our estimates to the Tribunal in writing.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, the Tribunal feels that it would like to have the apportionment now. It gave notice before, yesterday I think it was, that they were wishing to hear defendants' counsel upon the question of the apportionment this afternoon at 2 o'clock; and they would, therefore, like to have that apportionment now.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: In that case, I can only ask that the Tribunal hear each individual counsel, since naturally I cannot say from memory how each made his estimate.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You could have had it written down; but if k you have not got it written down, no doubt you cannot remember. But perhaps you had better give us what you would take.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: I estimated 7 hours. My colleague Horn, for Ribbentrop, just tells me he requires 6 hours.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We will take each counsel in turn, if you please.</P>

<P>Yes, Dr. Stahmer?</P>

<P>DR. OTTO STAHMER (Counsel for Defendant Goring): Seven hours.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter?</P>

<P>DR. MARTIN HORN (Counsel for Defendant Von Ribbentrop): May I, on behalf of Dr. Siemers and Dr. Kranzbuhler, ask to allot each of them 8 hours?</P>

<P>DR. SAUTER: For the case of Funk, 6 hours, and for the case of Von Schirach, 6 hours.</P>

<P>DR. SERVATIUS: For Sauckel, 5 hours.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. I cannot write as quickly as all this. Who was it that Dr. Horn wished to represent? Siemers and who else? And how many hours was it?</P>

<P>DR. HORN: Dr. Siemers and l)r. Kranzbuhler, 8 hours each.</P>

<P>DR. SERVATIUS: For Sauckel, 5 hours.</P>

<P>D KAUFFMANN: For Kaltenbrunner, approximately 4 to 5 hours.</P>

<P>DR. HANNS MARX (Counsel for Defendant Streicher): For Streicher, 4 hours.</P>

<P>DR. SEIDL: For Hess and Frank, 11 hours together.</P>

<P>DR. OTTO PANNENBECKER (Counsel for Defendant Frick): For Frick, 5 hours. I remember from the list that Dr. Bergold wants 3 hours for Bormann. Dr. Bergold is not present, but I remember that the list said 3 hours.</P>

<P>DR. RUDOLF DIX (Counsel for Defendant Schacht): For Schacht, 5 hours.</P>

<P>PROFESSOR DR. FRANZ EXNER (Counsel for Defendant Jodl): For Jodl, 5 hours.</P>

<P>DR. KUBUSCHOK: For Papen, approximately 5 hours.</P>

<P>DR. STEINBAUER: For Dr. Seyss-Inquart, 5 hours.</P>

<P>DR. FLACHSNER: For Speer, 4 hours.</P>

<P>DR. VON LUDINGHAUSEN: For myself, Mr. President, 8 hours. For Professor Jahrreiss, who before the final pleas will deal with a technical subject, 4 hours.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: What will Professor Jahrreiss speak about</P>

<P>DR.VON LUDINGHAUSEN: About a subject approved by the Tribunal, namely the general question of international law.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>DR. SEIDL: The defense counsel for the Defendant Rosenberg said that he would require 8 hours.</P>

<P>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I would ask the Tribunal to take into consideration that the case of Fritzsche has not yet been presented and that therefore I cannot give exact information; but I estimate approximately 4 hours.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Now, Dr. Nelte, the Tribunal would like to know first of all whether counsel propose to write down and then read their speeches.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: As far as I have been informed, all defense counsel will write down their speeches before delivery. Whether they will actually read every word of the text, or whether they will read parts of it and submit other parts, is not yet certain.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Have they considered whether they will submit them for translation, because, as the Tribunal has already pointed out, it would be much more convenient for the members of the Tribunal who do not read German to have a translation before them. It would not only greatly assist the Tribunal, but the defendants themselves if they do that.</P>

<P>DR. NELTE: This question has not yet been settled. We discussed it, but have so far not come to a final conclusion. We think that the short time now available may perhaps make it impossible to translate the manuscripts into all four languages.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The defendants' counsel, of course, understand that the speeches, if they are submitted for translation, will not be communicated to anybody until the speech is actually made. So they will not be given beforehand either to the Tribunal or the Prosecution or anything of that sort, so that the speech will remain entirely private until it is made. And the second thing is that, of course, a great number of the speeches will be delayed by the counsel who precede them and, therefore, there will be very considerable time during either the 14 days or some longer period, if such a longer period is given, which will enable the speeches to be translated, and Defense Counsel will appreciate that if their speeches are written down they can tell exactly how long they will take to deliver, or almost exactly.</P>

<P>And there is one other thing I want to bring to their attention. There are 20 or 21 defendants, and naturally, there are a variety of subjects which are common to them a}l; and there ought to be, therefore, an opportunity, as it appears to the Tribunal, for counsel to divide up the subjects to some extent between them and not each one to deal with subjects which have been dealt with already, any more than they ought to have been dealt with in evidence over and over again; and I do not know whether Counsel for Defense have fully considered that in making this estimate of the time they laid before us.</P>

<P>Anyway, the Tribunal hopes that they will address their minds to these three matters: First of all, as to whether they can submit their speeches for translation in order to help the Tribunal; secondly, whether they will be able, when they have got their speeches written down, to assess the time accurately; and thirdly, whether they cannot apportion the subjects to some extent among them so that we shall not have to listen to the same subjects over and over again.</P>

<P>I do not know whether the Prosecution would wish to say anything. The Tribunal has said, I think, in the order which we made with reference to this question of limitation of time, that they anticipated that the Prosecution would take only 3 days. Perhaps it would be convenient to hear from the Prosecution whether that is an accurate estimate.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, the Prosecution do not ask for any more than the 3 days. It might conceivably be a little less, but we do not ask for any more than the 3 days.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should like, Your Honor, to call your attention to this. I hope it is not expected that we will mimeograph and run off on our mimeograph machines, 20 days of speeches or anything of that sort. We simply cannot be put under that kind of a burden. I think it isa citizen of the United States is expected to argue his case in the highest court of the land in one hour, and counsel's own clients here have openly scoffed at the amount of time that has been asked. This is not a sensible amount of time to give to this case, and I must protest against being expected to mimeograph 20 days of speeches. It really is not possible.</P>

<P>PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to know whether the Prosecution intend to let them have copies of their speeches at the time that they are delivered.</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: As far as the closing speech of the Attorney General is concerned, we certainly did expect and hope to give the Tribunal copies of the speech.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: And translations?</P>

<P>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, that will be done. My Lord, I just wondered, out of optimismit was Dr. Nelte who said that it would take a long time to translate. I know, as far as translating into English is concerned, we had the problem of a 76 page speech the other day, and that was done by our own translators in one day. So I hope that perhaps Dr. Nelte has been a little pessimistic about that side of the problem.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will consider the matter.</P>

<P>Now, the Tribunal will go on with the cross-examination.</P>

<P>[The Defendant Speer resumed the stand.]</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think perhaps, Your Honor, the photographs in evidence are left a little unintelligible, if the record does not show the description of them. I shall read it briefly.</P>

<P>"Torture cabinets which were used in the foreign workers' camp in the grounds of Number 4 Armor Shop and those in the dirty neglected Russian Camp were shown to us, and we depose the following on oath:</P>

<P>"Photograph 'A' shows an iron cupboard which was specially manufactured by the firm of Krupp to torture Russian civilian workers to an extent that cannot possibly be described by words. Men and women were often locked into a compartment of the cupboard, in which hardly any man could stand up for long periods. The measurements of this compartment are: Height 1.52 meters; breadth and depth 40 to 50 centimeters each. Frequently even two people were kicked and pressed into one compartment. The Russian..."</P>

<P>I will not read the rest of that.</P>

<P>"Photograph 'B' shows the same cupboard as it looks when it is locked.</P>

<P>"Photograph 'C' shows the cupboard open.</P>

<P>"In Photograph 'D' we see the camp that was selected by the Krupp Directorate to serve as living quarters for the Russian civilian workers. The individual rooms were 2 to 2.5 meters wide, 5 meters long, and 2 meters high. In each room up to 16 persons were accommodated in double tier beds." (Document USA-897)</P>

<P>I think that covers it.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, one moment. I think you ought to read the last three lines of the second paragraph, beginning, "At the top of the cupboard..."</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Oh yes, I am sorry.</P>

<P>"At the top of the cupboard there are a few sievelike air holes through which cold water was poured on the unfortunate victims during the ice-cold winter."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I think you should read the last three lines of the penultimate paragraph in view of what the defendant said about the evidence.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: "We are enclosing two letters which Camp Commandant Lowenkamp had smuggled out of prison in order to induce the undersigned Hofer to give evidence favorable to him."</P>

<P>And perhaps I should read the last:</P>

<P>"The undersigned, Dahm,"one of the signers"personally saw how three Russian civilian workers were locked into the cupboard, two in one compartment, after they had first been beaten on New Year's Eve 1945. Two of the Russians ha to stay the whole of New Year's Eve locked in the cupboard, and cold water was poured on them as well."</P>

<P>I may say to the Tribunal that we have upwards of a hundred different statements and depositions relating to the investigation of this camp. I am not suggesting offering them, because I think they would be cumulative, and I shall be satisfied with one more, D-313, which would become Exhibit USA-901, which is a statement by a doctor.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, was this camp that you are referring to a concentration camp?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, it was, as I understand it, a prisoner-of-war camp and a labor camp. There were labor camps and prisoner-of-war camps at Essen. I had not understood that it was a concentration camp, but I admit the distinction is a little thin at times.</P>

<P>This document reads:</P>

<P>"I, the undersigned, Dr. Apolinary Gotowicki, a physician in the Polish Army, was taken prisoner by the Germans on 1/3/1941 and remained as such until the entry of the Americans. I gave medical attention to the Russian, Polish, and French prisoners of war who were forced to work in various places of Krupp's factories. I personally visited the Russian POW camp in the Raumastrasse in Essen, which contained about 1,800 men. There was a big hall in the camp which could house about 200 men comfortably, in which 300 to 400 men were thrown together in such a catastrophic manner that no medical treatment was possible. The floor was cement and the mattresses on which the people slept were full of lice and bugs. Even on cold days the room was never heated and it seemed to me, as a doctor, unworthy of human beings that people should find themselves in such a position. It was impossible to keep the place clean because of the overcrowding of these men who had hardly room to move about normally Every day at least 10 people were brought to me whose bodies were covered with bruises on account of the continual beatings with rubber tubes, steel switches, or sticks. The people were often writhing with agony and it was impossible for me to give them even a little medical aid. In spite of the fact that I protested, made complaints and petitions, it was impossible for me to protect the people or see that they got a day off from work. It was difficult for me to watch how such suffering people could be dragged to do heavy work. I visited personally, with danger to myself, gentlemen of the Krupp administration, as well as gentlemen from the Krupp Directorate, to try to get help. It was strictly forbidden, as the camp was under the direction of the SS and Gestapo; and according to well-known directives I had to keep silent, otherwise I might have been sent to a concentration camp. I have brought my own bread innumerable times to the camp in order to give it to the prisoners, as far as it was possible, although bread was scarce enough for me. From the beginning in 1941 conditions did not get better, but worse. The food consisted of a watery soup which was dirty and sandy, and often the prisoners of war had to eat cabbage which was bad and stank. I could notice people daily who, on account of hunger or ill-treatment, were slowly dying. Dead people often lay for 2 or 3 days on the beds until their bodies stank so badly that fellow prisoners took them outside and buried them somewhere. The dishes out of which they ate were also used as toilets because they were too tired or too weak from hunger to get up and go outside. At 3 o'clock they were wakened. The same dishes were then used to wash in and later for eating out of. This matter was generally known. In spite of this it was impossible for me to get even elementary help or facilities in order to get rid of these epidemics, illnesses, or cases of starvation. There can be no mention of medical aid for the prisoners. I never received any medical supplies myself. In 1941 I alone had to look after these people from a medical point of view; but it is quite understandable that it was impossible for me as the only one to look after all of these people, and apart from that, I had scarcely any medical supplies. I could not think what to do with a number of 1,800 people who came to me daily crying and complaining. I myself often collapsed daily, and in spite of this I had to take everything upon myself and watch how people perished and died. A report was never made as to how the prisoners of war died.</P>

<P>"I have seen with my own eyes the prisoners coming back from Krupp's and how they collapsed on the march and had to be wheeled back on barrows or carried by their comrades. It was in such a manner that the people came back to the camp. The work which they had to perform was very heavy and dangerous and many cases happened where people had cut their fingers, hands or legs. These accidents were very serious and the people came to me and asked me for medical help. But it was not even possible for me to keep them from work for a day or two, although I had been to the Krupp Directorate and asked for permission to do so. At the end of 1941, two people died daily, and in 1942 the deaths increased to three and four per day.</P>

<P>"I was under Dr. May and I was often successful in getting him to come to the camp to see the terrible conditions and listen to the complaints, but it was not possible for him to get medical aid from the Medical Department of the Armed Forces or Krupp's, or to get better conditions, treatment, or food. I was a witness during a conversation with some Russian women who told me personally that they were employed in Krupp's factory and that they were beaten daily in the most bestial manner. The food consisted of watery soup which was dirty and inedible and its terrible smell could be perceived from a distance. The clothing was ragged and torn and on their feet they had rags and wooden shoes. Their treatment, as far as I could make out, was the same as that of the prisoners of war. Beating was the order of the day. The conditions lasted for years, from the very beginning until the day the American troops entered. The people lived in great anxiety and it was dangerous for them to describe to anyone anywhere the conditions which reigned in their camps. The directions were such that they could have been murdered by any one of the guards, the SS, or Gestapo if they noticed it. It was possible for me as a doctor to talk to these people; they trusted me and knew that I was a Pole and would never betray them to anyone.</P>

<P>"Signed: Dr. Apolinary Gotowicki."</P>

<P>[Turning to the defendant.] Now you have explained that some of these conditions were due, in your judgment, to the fact that bombing took place and the billets of the prisoners and workers were destroyed.</P>

<P>SPEER: That is true, but I should like to point out that the conditions described in this affidavit cannot be considered as general; apart from that, I do not believe that this description is correct, but I cannot speak about these things since you will not expect me to be intimately acquainted with what happened in the camps of the firm of Krupp.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, in the first place, was it considered proper by you to billet forced workers and prisoners of war so close to military targets as these prisoners were?</P>

<P>SPEER: I would rather not tell you here things which every German has at heart. No military targets were attacked, and the camps, therefore, could not be near military targets.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: You would not consider the Krupp plants proper targets?</P>

<P>SPEER: The camps were not in the Krupp works, they were near the city of Essen. On principle, we did not construct camps near the works which we expected would be bombed; and we did not want the camps to be destroyed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you notice that one of the photographs in evidence shows the camp directly against the works?</P>

<P>SPEER: May I see it again, please?</P>

<P>[A photograph was shown to the defendant.]</P>

<P>Some large factory is recognizable in the background of this photograph, but that does not affect my statement that in almost all cases we constructed the camps outside the cities. I do not know why this particular instance is different, and I cannot even say whether this is a camp or just a hut for changing clothes, or anything which had to be near the camp. I still believe that these cabinets were cabinets for clothes, and this is one of the many huts which were necessary so that the workers could change clothes before and after their work. Any expert in Germany can tell you that these are wardrobes and not some special cabinets, because they are mass-produced articles; this is also confirmed by the fact that there are air vents at the top, for every wardrobe has these ventilation holes at the top and.bottom.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: As production Minister, you were vitally interested in reducing the sickness rate among workers, were you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: I was interested in a high output of work, that is obvious, and in addition, in special cases. . .</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, special casespart of production is in all cases, is it not, dependent upon the sickness rate of our labor force, and is it not a factas a man engaged in production you will know thisthat the two greatest difficulties in manpower and production are sickness and rapid turnover, and that those factors reduce production?</P>

<P>SPEER: These two factors were disturbing for us, but not as extensively as your words might suggest. Cases of sickness made up a very small percentage which in my opinion was normal. However, propaganda pamphlets dropped from aircraft were telling the workers to feign illness, and detailed instructions were given to them on how to do it. And to prevent that, the authorities concerned introduced certain measures, which I considered proper.</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: What were those measures?</P>

<P>SPEER: I cannot tell you in detail, because I myself did not ,- institute these penalties, nor did I have the power to do so; but as far as I know, they were ordered by the Plenipotentiary General for the Allocation of Labor in collaboration with the Police or State authorities; but the jurisdiction in this connection was with the -authorities responsible for legal action.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, if you did not know what they were, how can you tell us that you approved of them? We always get to this blank wall that nobody knew what was being done. You knew that they were at least penalties of great severity, did you not?</P>

<P>SPEER: When I say that I approved I am only expressing my wish not to dodge my responsibility in this respect. But you must understand that a minister of production, particularly in view of the air attacks, had a tremendous task before him and that I could only take care of matters outside my own field if some particularly important factor forced me to do so. Otherwise, I was glad if I could finish my own work and, after all, my task was by no means -a small one.</P>

<P>I think that if during the German air attacks on England you had asked the British Minister of Production whether he shared the worries of the Minister of Labor and whether he was dealing with them, then he would with justification have told you that he had something else to do at that time, that he had to keep up his production and that he expected the Minister of Labor to manage affairs in his sector; and no one would have raised a direct accusation against the British Minister of Production on that account.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, production was your enterprise, and do you mean to tell me that you did not have any records or reports on the condition of the manpower which was engaged in production, which would tell you if there was anything wrong in the sick rate or anything wrong in the general conditions of the labor?</P>

<P>SPEER: What I knew is contained in the reports of the Central Planning Board; there you will get a picture of what I was told. Although there were many other meetings I cannot tell you in detail what I knew, because these were things outside my sphere of activity. Naturally, it is a matter of course that anyone closely concerned with the affairs of State will also hear of matters not immediately connected with his own sphere, and of unsatisfactory conditions existing in other sectors; but one is not obliged to deal with these conditions and later on one will not remember them in detail. You cannot expect that of me. But if you have any particular passage, I shall be glad to give you information on it.[=]</P>

<P>MR.JUSTICE JACKSON: All right; assume that these conditions had been called to your attention and that they existed. With whom would you have taken it up to have them corrected? What officer of the Government?</P>

<P>SPEER: Normally, a minister would send a document to the Government authorities responsible for such conditions. I must claim for myself that when I heard of such deficiencies I tried to remedy them by establishing direct contact with the authority responsible, in some cases the German Labor Front, where I had a liaison officer, or in other cases my letter was transmitted to Sauckel through my office of manpower deployment. My practice in this respect was that if I ,did not receive a return report I considered the matter settled; for I could not then again pursue those things and make further inquiries whether they had been dealt with or not.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: With Krupp's, then, you would not have taken it up? You think they had no responsibility for these conditions?</P>

<P>SPEER: During visits to Krupp's discussions certainly took place on the conditions which generally existed for workers after air attacks; this was a source of great worry for us, particularly with regard to Krupp. I knew this well, but the reports from Krupp were not different fromI cannot remember ever being told that foreign workers or prisoners of war were in a particularly bad position. Temporarily they all lived under very primitive conditions; German workers lived in cellars during those days, and six or eight people were often quartered in a small basement room.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your statement some time ago that you had a certain responsibility as a Minister of the Government for the conditionsI should like to have you explain what responsibility you referred to when you say you assume a responsibility as a member of the Government.</P>

<P>SPEER: Do you mean the declaration I made yesterday that I . . .</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your common responsibility, what do you mean by your common responsibility along with others?</P>

<P>SPEER: Oh, yes. In my opinion, a state functionary has two types of responsibility. One is the responsibility for his own sector and for that, of course, he is fully responsible. But above that I think that in decisive matters there is, and must be, among the leaders a common responsibility, for who is to bear responsibility for developments, if not the close associates of the head of State?</P>

<P>This common responsibility, however, can only be applied to fundamental matters, it cannot be applied to details connected with other ministries or other responsible departments, for otherwise the entire discipline in the life of the State would be quite confused, and no one would ever know who is individually responsible in a particular sphere. This individual responsibility in one's own sphere must, at all events, be kept clear and distinct.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, your point is, I take it, that you as a member of the Government and a leader in this period of time acknowledge a responsibility for its large policies, but not for all the details that occurred in their execution. Is that a fair statement of your position?</P>

<P>SPEER: Yes, indeed.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think that concludes the crossexamination.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I call on the chief prosecutor, the United States of America.</P>

<P>MARSHAL: May it please the Tribunal, the Defendant Hess is absent.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE ROBERT H. JACKSON (Chief of Counsel for the United States): Mr. President and Members of the Tribunal: An advocate can be confronted with few more formidable tasks than to select his closing arguments where there is great disparity between his appropriate time and his available material. In 8 months a short time as state trials gow have introduced evidence which embraces as vast and varied a panorama of events as has ever been compressed within the framework of a litigation. It is impossible in summation to do more than outline with bold strokes the vitals of this Trial's mad and melancholy record, which will live as the historical text of the twentieth century's shame and depravity.</P>

<P>It is common to think of our own time as standing at the apex of civilization, from which the deficiencies of preceding ages may patronizingly be viewed in the light of what is assumed to be "progress." The reality is that in the long perspective of history the present century will not hold an admirable position, unless its second half is to redeem its first. These two-score years in the twentieth century will be recorded in the book of years as one of the most bloody in all annals. Two World Wars have left a legacy of dead which number more than all the armies engaged in any way that made ancient or medieval history. No half-century ever witnessed slaughter on such a scale, such cruelties and inhumanities, such wholesale deportations of peoples into slavery, such annihilations of minorities. The terror of Torquemada pales before the Nazi Inquisition. These deeds are the overshadowing historical facts by which generations to come will remember this decade. If we cannot eliminate the causes and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization.</P>

<P>Goaded by these facts, we were moved to redress the blight on the record of our era. The defendants complain that our pace is too fast. In drawing the Charter of this Tribunal, we thought we were recording an accomplished advance in international law. But they say we have outrun our times, that we have anticipated an advance that should be, but has not yet been made. The Agreement of London, whether it originates or merely records, at all events marks a transition in international law which roughly corresponds to that in the evolution of local law when men ceased to punish crime by "hue and cry" and began to let reason and inquiry govern punishment. The society of nations has emerged from the primitive "hue and cry," the law of "catch and kill." It seeks to apply sanctions to enforce international law, but to guide their application by evidence, law, and reason instead of outcry. The defendants denounce the law under which their accounting is asked. Their dislike for the law which condemns them is not original. It has been remarked before that: "No thief e'er felt the halter draw with good opinion of the law."</P>

<P>I shall not labor the law of this case. The position of the United States was explained in my opening statement. My distinguished colleague, the Attorney General of Great Britain, will reply on behalf of all the chief prosecutors to the defendants' legal attack. At this stage of the proceedings, I shall rest upon the law of these crimes as laid down in the Charter. The defendants, who except for the Charter would have no right to be heard at all, now ask that the legal basis of this Trial be nullified. This Tribunal, of course, is given no power to set aside or modify the agreement between the Four Powers, to which 18 other nations have adhered. The terms of the Charter are conclusive upon every party to these proceedings.</P>

<P>In interpreting the Charter, however, we should not overlook the unique and emergent character of this body as an International Military Tribunal. It is no part of the constitutional mechanism of internal justice of any of the signatory nations. Germany has unconditionally surrendered, but no peace treaty has been signed or agreed upon. The Allies are still technically in a state of war with Germany, although the enemy's political and military institutions have collapsed. As a military tribunal, this Tribunal is a continuation of the war effort of the Allied nations. As an International Tribunal, it is not bound by the procedural and substantive refinements of our respective judicial or constitutional systems, nor will its rulings introduce precedents into any country's- internal system of civil justice. As an International Military Tribunal, it rises above the provincial and transient and seeks guidance not only from international law but also from the basic principles of jurisprudence which are assumptions of civilization and which long have found embodiment in the codes of all nations.</P>

<P>Of one thing we may be sure. The future will never have to ask, with misgiving, what could the Nazis have said in their favor. History will know that whatever could be said, they were allowed to say. They have been given the kind of a Trial which they, in the days of their pomp and power, never gave to any man.</P>

<P>But fairness is not weakness. The extraordinary fairness of these hearings is an attribute of our strength. The Prosecution's case, at its close, seemed inherently unassailable because it rested so heavily on German documents of unquestioned authenticity. But it was the weeks upon weeks of pecking at this case, by one after another of the defendants, that has demonstrated its true strength. The fact is that the testimony of the defendants has removed any doubt of guilt which, because of the extraordinary nature and magnitude of these crimes, may have existed before they spoke. They have helped write their own judgment of condemnation.</P>

<P>But justice in this case has nothing to do with some of the arguments put forth by the defendants or their counsel. We have not previously and we need not now discuss the merits of all their obscure and tortuous philosophy. We are not trying them for the possession of obnoxious ideas. It is their right, if they choose, to renounce the Hebraic heritage in the civilization of which Germany was once a part. Nor is it our affair that they repudiated the Hellenic influence as well. The intellectual bankruptcy and moral perversion of the Nazi regime might have been no concern of international law had it not been utilized to goosestep the Herrenvolk across international frontiers. It is not their thoughts, it is their overt acts which we charge to be crimes. Their creed and teachings are important only as evidence of motive, purpose, knowledge, and intent.</P>

<P>We charge unlawful aggression but we are not trying the motives, hopes, or frustrations which may have led Germany to resort to aggressive war as an instrument of policy. The law, unlike politics, does not concern itself with the good or evil in the status quo, nor with the merits of the grievances against it. It merely requires that the status quo be not attacked by violent means and that policies be not advanced by war. We may admit that overlapping ethnological and cultural groups, economic barriers, and conflicting national ambitions created in the 1930's, as they will continue to create, grave problems for Germany as well as for the other peoples of Europe. We may admit too that the world had failed to provide political or legal remedies which would be honorable and acceptable alternatives to war. We do not underwrite either the ethics or the wisdom of any country, including my own, in the face of these problems. But we do say that it is now, as it was for sometime prior to 1939, illegal and criminal for Germany or any other nation to redress grievances or seek expansion by resort to aggressive war.</P>

<P>Let me emphasize one cardinal point. The United States has no interest which would be advanced by the conviction of any defendant if we have not proved him guilty on at least one of the Counts charged against him in the Indictment. Any result that the calm and critical judgment of posterity would pronounce unjust would not be a victory for any of the countries associated in this Prosecution. But in summation we now have before us the tested evidences of criminality and have heard the flimsy excuses and paltry evasions of the defendants. The suspended judgment with which we opened this case is no longer appropriate. The time has come for final judgment and if the case I present seems hard and uncompromising, it is because the evidence makes it so.</P>

<P>I perhaps can do no better service than to try to lift this case out of the morass of detail with which the record is full and put before you only the bold outlines of a case that is impressive in its simplicity. True, its thousands of documents and n;ore thousands of pages of testimony deal with an epoch and cover a continent, and touch almost every branch of human endeavor. They illuminate specialities, such as diplomacy, naval development and warfare, land warfare, the genesis of air warfare, the politics of the Nazi rise to power, the finance and economics of totalitarian war, sociology, penology, mass psychology, and mass pathology. I must leave it to experts to comb the evidence and write volumes on their specialities, while I picture in broad strokes the offenses whose acceptance as lawful could threaten the continuity of civilization. I must, as Kipling put it, "splash at a 10-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair."</P>

<P>The Crimes of the Nazi Regime.</P>

<P>The strength of the case against these defendants under the conspiracy Count, which it is the duty of the United States to argue, is in its simplicity. It involves but three ultimate inquiries: First, have the acts defined by the Charter as crimes been committed; second, were they committed pursuant to a Common Plan or Conspiracy; third, are these defendants among those who are criminally responsible?</P>

<P>The charge requires examination of a criminal policy, not of a multitude of isolated, unplanned, or disputed crimes. The substantive crimes upon which we rely, either as goals of a common plan or as means for its accomplishment, are admitted. The pillars which uphold the conspiracy charge may be found in five groups of overt acts, whose character and magnitude are important considerations in appraising the proof of conspiracy.</P>

<P>1. The Seizure of Power and Subjugation of Germany to a Police State.</P>

<P>The Nazi Party seized control of the German State in 1933. "Seizure of power" is a characterization used by defendants and defense witnesses, and so apt that it has passed into both history and everyday speech.</P>

<P>The Nazi junta in the early days lived in constant fear of overthrow. Goring, in 1934, pointed out that its enemies were legion and said:</P>

<P>"Therefore, the concentration camps have been created, where we have first confined thousands of Communists and social democrat functionaries" (2344-PS).[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>In 1933 Goring forecast the whole program of purposeful cruelty and oppression when he publicly announced:</P>

<P>"Whoever in the future raises a hand against a representative of the National Socialist movement or of the State must know that he will lose his life in a very short while" (2494-PS).</P>

<P>New political crimes were created to this end. It was made a treason, punishable with death, to organize or support a political party other than the Nazi Party (2548-PS). Circulating a false or exaggerated statement, or one which would harm the State or even the Party, was made a crime (1652-PS). Laws were enacted of such ambiguity that they could be used to punish almost any innocent act. It was, for example, made a crime to provoke "any act contrary to the public welfare" (1390-PS).</P>

<P>The doctrine of punishment by analogy was-introduced to enable conviction for acts which no statute forbade (1962-PS). Minister of Justice Gurtner explained that National Socialism considered every violation of the goals of life which the community set up for itself to be a wrong perr se, and that the acts could be punished even g though it was not contrary to existing "formal law" (2549-PS).</P>

<P>The Gestapo and the SD were instrumentalities of an espionage system which penetrated public and private life (1680-PS). Goring controlled a personal wire-tapping unit. All privacy of communication was abolished (1390-PS). Party Blockleiter appointed over every 50 householders spied continuously on all within their ken (1893-PS).</P>

<P>Upon the strength of this spying individuals were dragged off to "protective custody" and to concentration camps without legal proceedings of any kind (1956-PS) and without statement of any reason therefor (2533-PS). The partisan Political Police were exempted from effective legal responsibility for their acts (2347-PS).</P>

<P>With all administrative offices in Nazi control and with the Reichstag reduced to impotence, the judiciary remained the last obstacle to this reign of terror (2469-PS). But its independence was soon overcome and it was reorganized to dispense a venal justice (784-PS) Judges were ousted for political or racial reasons and were spied upon and put under pressure to join the Nazi Party (2967-PS). After the Supreme Court had acquitted three of the four men whom the Nazis accused of setting the Reichstag fire, its jurisdiction over treason cases was transferred to a newly established "People's Court" consisting of two judges and five Party officials (2967-PS). The German film of this "People's Court" in operation, which we showed in this chamber, revealed its presiding judge pouring partisan abuse on speechless defendants (3054-PS). Special courts were created to try political crimes, only Party members were appointed judges (2065-PS), and "judges' letters" instructed the puppet judges as to the "general lines" they must follow (D-229).</P>

<P>The result was the removal of all peaceable means either to resist or to change the Government. Having sneaked through the portals of power, the Nazis slammed the gate in the face of all others who might also aspire to enter. Since the law was what the Nazis said it was, every form of opposition was rooted out and every dissenting voice throttled. Germany was in the clutch of a police state, which used the fear of the concentration camp as a means to enforce nonresistance. The Party was the State, the State was the Party, and terror by day and death by night were the policy of both.</P>

<P>2. The Preparation and Waging of Wars of Aggression.</P>

<P>From the moment the Nazis seized power, they set about feverish but stealthy efforts, in defiance of the Versailles Treaty, to arm for war. In 1933 they found no air force. By 1939 they had 21 squadrons, consisting of 240 echelons or about 2,400 first-line planes, together with trainers and transports. In 1933 they found an army of 3 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. By 1939 they had raised and equipped an army of 51 divisions, 4 of which were fully motorized and 4 of which were Panzer divisions. In 1933 they found a navy of 1 cruiser and 6 light cruisers. By 1939 they had built a navy of 4 battleships, 1 aircraft carrier, 6 cruisers, 22 destroyers, and 54 submarines. They had also built up in that period an armament industry as efficient as that of any country in the world (EC-28).</P>

<P>These new weapons were put to use, commencing in September 1939, in a series of undeclared wars against nations with which Germany had arbitration and nonaggression treaties, and in violation of repeated assurances. On 9/1/1939, this rearmed Germany attacked Poland. The following April witnessed the invasion and occupation of Denmark and Norway, and May saw the overrunning of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Another spring saw Yugoslavia and Greece under attack, and in June 1941 came the invasion of Soviet Russia. Then Japan, which Germany had embraced as a partner, struck without warning at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and 4 days later Germany declared war on the United States.</P>

<P>We need not trouble ourselves about the many abstract difficulties that can be conjured up about what constitutes aggression in doubtful cases. I shall show you, in discussing the conspiracy, that by any test ever put forward by any responsible authority, by all the canons of plain common sense, these were unlawful wars of aggression in breach of treaties and in violation of assurances.</P>

<P>The third group of crimes was: Warfare in Disregard of International Law.</P>

<P>It is unnecessary to labor this point on the facts. Goring asserts that the Rules of Land Warfare were obsolete, that no nation could fight a total war within their limits. He testified that the Nazis would have denounced the conventions to which Germany was a party, but that General Jodl wanted captured German soldiers to continue to benefit from their observance by the Allies.</P>

<P>It was, however, against the Soviet people and Soviet prisoners that Teutonic fury knew no bounds, in spite of a warning by Admiral Canaris that the treatment was in violation of international law.</P>

<P>We need not, therefore, for the purposes of the conspiracy Count, recite the revolting details of starving, beating, murdering, freezing, and mass extermination admittedly used against the Eastern soldiery. Also, we may take as established or admitted that the lawless conduct such as shooting British and American airmen, mistreatment of Western prisoners of war, forcing French prisoners of war into German war work, and other deliberate violations of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, did occur, and in obedience to highest levels of authority (R-110).</P>

<P>The fourth group of crimes is: Enslavement and Plunder of Populations in Occupied Countries.</P>

<P>The Defendant Sauckel, Plenipotentiary General for the Utilization of Labor (1666-PS), is authority for the statement that "out of 5,000,000 foreign workers who arrived in Germany, not even 200,000 came voluntarily" (R-124). It was officially reported to Defendant Rosenberg that in his territory "recruiting methods were used which probably have their origin in the blackest period of the slave trade" (294-PS). Sauckel himself reported that male and female agents went hunting for men, got them drunk, and "shanghaied' them to Germany (220-PS). These captives were shipped in trains without heat, food, or sanitary facilities. The dead were thrown out at stations, and the newborn were thrown out the windows of moving trains (054-PS).</P>

<P>Sauckel ordered that "all the men must be fed, sheltered, and treated in such a way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest conceivable degree of expenditure" (054-PS). About two million of these were employed directly in the manufacture of armaments and munitions (016-PS). The director of the Krupp locomotive factory in Essen complained to the company that Russian forced laborers were so underfed that they were too weakened to do their work (D-316), and the Krupp doctor confirmed their pitiable condition (D-288). Soviet workers were put in camps under Gestapo guards, who were allowed to punish disobedience by confinement in a concentration camp or by hanging on the spot (3040-PS).</P>

<P>Populations of occupied countries were otherwise exploited and oppressed unmercifully. Terror was the order of the day. Civilians were arrested without charges, committed without counsel, executed without hearing. Villages were destroyed, the male inhabitants shot or sent to concentration camps, the women sent to forced labor, and the children scattered abroad (3012-PS). The extent of the slaughter in Poland alone was indicated by Frank, who reported, and I quote:</P>

<P>"If I wanted to have a poster put up for every seven Poles who were shot, the forests of Poland would not suffice for producing the paper for such posters" (2032-PS).</P>

<P>Those who will enslave men cannot be expected to refrain from plundering them. Boastful reports show how thoroughly and scientifically the resources of occupied lands were sucked into the German war economy, inflicting shortage, hunger, and inflation upon the inhabitants (EC-317). Besides this grand plan to aid the German war effort there were the sordid activities of the Rosenberg Einsatzstab which pillaged art treasures for Goring and his fellow-bandits (014-PS). It is hard to say whether the spectacle of Germany's Number 2 leader urging his people to give up every comfort-and strain every sinew on essential war work while he rushed around confiscating art by the trainload should be cast as tragedy or comedy. In either case it was a crime.</P>

<P>International law at all times before and during this war spoke with precision and authority respecting the protection due civilians of an occupied country and the slave trade and plunder of occupied countries was at all times flagrantly unlawful.</P>

<P>And the fifth group of crimes is: Persecution and Extermination of Jews and Christians.</P>

<P>The Nazi movement will be of evil memory in history because of its persecution of the Jews, the most far-flung and terrible racial persecution of all time. Although the Nazi Party neither invented nor monopolized anti-Semitism, its leaders from the very beginning embraced it, incited it, and exploited it. They used it as "the psychological spark that ignites the mob." After the seizure of power it became an official state policy. The persecution began in a series of discriminatory laws eliminating the Jews from the civil service, the professions, and economic life. As it became more intense it included segregation of Jews in ghettos, and exile. Riots were organized by Party leaders to loot Jewish business places and to burn synagogues. Jewish property was confiscated and a collective fine of a billion marks was imposed upon German Jewry. The program progressed in fury and irresponsibility to the "final solution." This consisted of sending all Jews who were fit to work to concentration camps as slave laborers, and all who were not fit, which included children under 12 and people over 50, as well as any others judged unfit by an SS doctor, to concentration camps for extermination (2605-PS).[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Adolf Eichmann, the sinister figure who had charge of the extermination program, has estimated that the anti-Jewish activities resulted in the killing of 6 million Jews. Of these, 4 million were killed in extermination institutions, and 2 million were killed by Einsatzgruppen, mobile units of the Security Police and SD which pursued Jews in the ghettos and in their homes and slaughtered them by gas wagons, by mass shooting in antitank ditches and by every device which Nazi ingenuity could conceive. So thorough and uncompromising was this program that the Jews of Europe as a race no longer exist, thus fulfilling the diabolic "prophecy" of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the war (2738-PS).</P>

<P>Of course, any such program must reckon with the opposition of the Christian Church. This was recognized from the very beginning. Defendant Bormann wrote all Gauleiters in 1941 that "National Socialism and Christian concepts are irreconcilable," and that the people must be separated from the churches and the influence of the churches totally removed (D-75). Defendant Rosenberg even wrote dreary treatises advocating a new and weird Nazi religion (2349-PS).</P>

<P>The Gestapo appointed "Church specialists" who were instructed that the ultimate aim was "destruction of the confessional churches" 1815-PS). The record is full of specific instances of the persecution of clergymen (1164-PS, 1521-PS, 848-PS, 849-PS), the confiscation of Church property (1481-PS), interference with religious publications (1498-PS), disruption of religious education (121-PS) and suppression of religious organizations (1481-PS, 1482-PS, R-145).</P>

<P>The chief instrumentality for persecution and extermination was the concentration camp, sired by the Defendant Goring and nurtured under the over-all authority of Defendants Frick and Kaltenbrunner.</P>

<P>The horrors of these iniquitous places have been vividly disclosed by documents (2309-PS, 3870-PS) and testified to by witnesses.</P>

<P>The Tribunal must be satiated with ghastly verbal and pictorial portrayals. From your records it is clear that the concentration camps were the first and worst weapon of Nazi oppression used by the National Socialist State, and that they were the primary means utilized for the persecution of the Christian Church and the extermination of the Jewish race. This has been admitted to you by some of the defendants from the witness stand. In the words of Defendant Frank: "A thousand years will pass and this guilt of Germany will still not be erased."</P>

<P>These, then, were the five great substantive crimes of the Nazi regime. Their commission, which cannot be-denied, stands admitted. The Defendant Keitel, who is in a position to know the facts, has given the Tribunal what seems to be a fair summation of the case on the facts:</P>

<P>"The defendant has declared that he admits the contents of the general Indictment to be proved from the objective and factual point of view (that is to say, not every individual case) and this in consideration of the law of procedure governing the Trial. It would be senseless, despite the possibility of refuting several documents or individual facts, to attempt to shake the Indictment as a whole."</P>

<P>I pass now to the inquiry as to whether these groups of criminal acts were integrated in a Common Plan or Conspiracy.</P>

<P>The Prosecution submits that these five categories of premeditated crimes were not separate and independent phenomena but that all were committed pursuant to a Common Plan or Conspiracy. The Defense admits that these classes of crimes were committed but denies that they are connected one with another as parts of a single program.</P>

<P>The central crime in this pattern of crimes, the kingpin which holds them all together, is the plot for aggressive wars. The chief reason for international cognizance of these crimes lies in this fact. Have we established the Plan or Conspiracy to make aggressive war?</P>

<P>Certain admitted or clearly proven facts help answer that question. First is the fact that such war of aggression did take place. Second, it is admitted that from the moment the Nazis came to power, every one of them and every one of the defendants worked like beavers to prepare for some war. The question therefore comes to this: Were they preparing for the war which did occur, or were they preparing for some war which never has happened? It is probably true that in their early days none of them had in mind what month of what year war would begin, the exact dispute which would precipitate it, or whether its first impact would be Austria, Czechoslovakia, or Poland. But I submit that the defendants either knew or were chargeable with knowledge that the war for which they were making ready would be a war of German aggression. This is partly because there was no real expectation that any power or combination of powers would attack Germany. But it is chiefly because the inherent nature of the German plans was such that they were certain sooner or later to meet resistance and that they could then be accomplished only by aggression.</P>

<P>The plans of Adolf Hitler for aggression were just as secret as Mein Kampf, of which over six million copies were published in Germany. He not only openly advocated overthrowing the Treaty of Versailles, but made demands which went far beyond a mere rectification of its alleged injustices (GB-128). He avowed an intention to attack neighboring states and seize their lands, which he said would have to be won with "the power of a triumphant sword." Here, for every German to hearken to, were the "ancestral voices prophesying war."</P>

<P>Goring has testified in this courtroom that at his first meeting with Hitler, long before the seizure of power, quoting:</P>

<P>"I noted that Hitler had a definite view of the impotency of protest and, as a second point, that he was of the opinion that Germany should be freed of the peace of Versailles. We did not say we shall have to have a war and defeat our enemies; this was the aim, and the methods had to be adapted to the political situation." When asked if this goal were to be accomplished by war if necessary, Goring did not deny that eventuality but evaded a direct answer by saying, "We did not even debate about those things at that time." He went on to say that the aim to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles was open and notorious and thatI quote again"every German in my opinion was for its modification, and there was no doubt that this was a strong inducement for joining the Party." Thus, there can be no possible excuse for any person who aided Hitler to get absolute power over the German people, or who took a part in his regime, to fail to know the nature of the demands he would make on Germany's neighbors.</P>

<P>Immediately after the seizure of power the Nazis went to work to implement these aggressive intentions by preparing for war. They first enlisted German industrialists in a secret rearmament program. Twenty days after the seizure of power Schacht was host to Hitler, Goring, and some 20 leading industrialists. Among them were Krupp von Bohlen of the great Krupp armament works and representatives of I. G. Farben and other Ruhr heavy industries. Hitler and Goring explained their program to the industrialists, who became so enthusiastic that they set about to raise 3 million Reichsmark to strengthen and confirm the Nazi Party in power (EC-433). Two months later Krupp was working to bring a reorganized association of German industry into agreement with the political aims of the Nazi Government (D-157). Krupp later boasted of the success in keeping the German war industries secretly alive and in readiness despite the disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty, and recalled the industrialists' enthusiastic acceptance of "the great intentions of the Fuhrer in the rearmament period of 1933-39" (D-317).</P>

<P>Some 2 months after Schacht had sponsored his first meeting to gain the support of the industrialists, the Nazis moved to harness industrial labor to their aggressive plans. In April 1933 Hitler ordered Dr. Ley "to take over the trade unions," numbering some six million members. By Party directive Ley seized the unions their property and their funds. Union leaders, taken into "protective custody" by the SS and SA, were put into concentration camps (2283-PS, 2271-PS, 2335-PS, 2334-PS, 2928-PS, 2277-PS, 2332-PS 2333-PS). The free labor unions were then replaced by a Nazi organization known as the German Labor Front, with Dr. Ley at its head. It was expanded until it controlled over 23 million members (2275-PS). Collective bargaining was eliminated, the voice of labor could no longer be heard as to working conditions and the labor contract was prescribed by "trustees of labor" appointed by Hitler (405-PS). The war purpose of this labor program was clearly acknowledged by Robert Ley 5 days after war broke out, when he declared in a speech that:</P>

<P>"We National Socialists have monopolized all resources and all our energies during the past 7 years so as to be able to be equipped for the supreme effort of battle" (1939-PS).</P>

<P>The Nazis also proceeded at once to adapt the Government to the needs of war. In April 1933 the Cabinet formed a Defense Council, the working committee of which met frequently thereafter. In the meeting of 5/23/1933 at which Defendant Keitel presided the members were instructed that:</P>

<P>"No document must be lost since otherwise the enemy propaganda would make use of it. Matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they can be denied by us in Geneva" (EC-177).</P>

<P>In January 1934and, Your Honors, dates in this connection are importantwith Defendant Jodl present, the Council planned a mobilization calendar and mobilization order for some 240,000 industrial plants. Again it was agreed that nothing should be in writing so that "the military purpose may not be traceable" (EC-404).</P>

<P>On 5/21/1935, the top secret Reich Defense Law was enacted. Defendant Schacht was appointed Plenipotentiary for War Economy with the task of secretly preparing all economic forces for war and in the event of mobilization, of financing the war (2261-PS).</P>

<P>Schacht's secret efforts were supplemented in October 1936 by the appointment of Defendant Goring as commissioner of the Four Year Plan, with the duty of putting the entire economy in a state of readiness for war within 4 years (EC-408).</P>

<P>A secret program for the accumulation of the raw materials and foreign credits necessary for extensive rearmament was also set on foot immediately upon seizure of power. In September of 1934, the Minister of Economics was already complaining that:</P>

<P>"The task of stockpiling is being hampered by the lack of foreign currency; the need for secrecy and camouflage also is a retarding influence" (EC-128).[=]</P>

<P>Foreign currency controls were at once established. Financing was delegated to the wizard Schacht, who conjured up the mefo bill to serve the dual objectives of tapping the short-term money market for rearmament purposes while concealing the amount of these expenditures (EC-436).</P>

<P>The spirit of the whole Nazi administration was summed up by Goring at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, which included Schacht, on 5/27/1936, when he said,</P>

<P>"All measures are to be considered from the standpoint of an assured waging of war" (1301-PS).</P>

<P>The General Staff, of course, also had to be enlisted in the war plan. Most of the generals, attracted by the prospect of rebuilding their armies, became willing accomplices. The hold-over Minister of War Von Blomberg and the Chief of Staff General Von Fritsch, however, were not cordial to the increasingly belligerent policy of the Hitler regime, and by vicious and obscene plotting they were discredited and removed in January 1938. Thereupon, Hitler assumed for himself Supreme Command of the Armed Forces and the positions of Blomberg and of Von Fritsch were filled by others who became, as Blomberg said of Keitel, "a willing tool in Hitler's hands for every one of his decisions." The generals did not confine their participation to merely military matters. They participated in all major diplomatic and political maneuvers, such as the Obersalzberg meeting where Hitler, flanked by Keitel and other top generals, issued his virtual ultimatum to Schuschnigg (1780-PS).</P>

<P>As early as 11/5/1937 the plan to attack had begun to take definiteness as to time and victim. In a meeting which included the Defendants Raeder, Goring, and Von Neurath, Hitler stated the cynical objective: "The question for Germany is where the greatest possible conquest could be made at the lowest possible cost." He discussed various plans for the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia, indicating clearly that he was thinking of these territories not as ends in themselves, but as means for further conquest. He painted out that considerable military and political assistance could be afforded by possession of these lands and discussed the possibility of constituting from them new armies up to a strength of about 12 divisions. The aim he stated boldly and baldly as the acquisition of additional living space in Europe, and recognized that "the German question can be solved only by way of force" (386-PS).</P>

<P>Six months later, emboldened by the bloodless Austrian conquest, Hitler, in a secret directive to Keitel, stated his "unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by military action in the near future" (388-PS).</P>

<P>On the same day, Jodl noted in his diary that the Fuhrer had stated his final decision to destroy Czechoslovakia soon and had initiated military preparations all along the line (1780-PS). By April the plan had been perfected to attack Czechoslovakia "with lightning swift action as the result of an incident" (388-PS).</P>

<P>All along the line preparations became more definite for a war of expansion on the assumption that it would result in a worldwide conflict. In September 1938 Admiral Carls officially commented on a "Draft Study of Naval Warfare against England": "There is full agreement with the main theme of the study. "1. If according to the Fuhrer's decision Germany is to acquire a position as a world power, she needs not only sufficient colonial possessions but also secure naval communications and secure access to the ocean.</P>

<P>"2. Both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to Anglo-French interests and will limit their positions as world powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by peaceful means. The decision to make Germany a world power therefore forces upon us the necessity of making the corresponding preparations for war.</P>

<P>"3. War against England means at the same time war against the Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well, and a large number of countries overseas; in fact, against one-half to one-third of the whole world.</P>

<P>"It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is prepared economically as well as politically and militarily and waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an outlet to the ocean" (C-23).</P>

<P>This Tribunal knows what categorical assurances were given to an alarmed world after the Anschluss, after Munich, after the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia, that German ambitions were realized and that Hitler had "no further territorial demands to make in Europe." The record of this Trial shows that those promises were calculated deceptions and that those high in the bloody brotherhood of Nazidom knew it.</P>

<P>As early as 4/15/1938 Goring pointed out to Mussolini and Ciano that the possession of those territories would make possible an attack on Poland (1874-PS). Ribbentrop's Ministry on 8/26/1938 was writing:</P>

<P>"After the settlement of the Czechoslovakian question, it will be generally assumed that Poland will be next in turn" (TC-76).</P>

<P>Hitler, after the Polish invasion, boasted that it was the Austrian and Czechoslovakian triumphs by which "the basis for the action against Poland was laid" (789-PS). Goring suited the act to the purpose and gave immediate instructions to exploit for the further strengthening of the German war potential, first the Sudetenland, and then the whole Protectorate (R-133).</P>

<P>By May of 1939 the Nazi preparations had ripened to the point that Hitler confided to the Defendants Goring, Raeder, Keitel, and others his readiness "to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity," even though he recognized that "further successes cannot be attained without the shedding of blood." The larcenous motives behind this decision he made plain in words that echoed the covetous theme of Mein Kampf:</P>

<P>"Circumstances must be adapted to aims. This is impossible without invasion of foreign states or attacks upon foreign property. Living space in proportion to the magnitude of the state is the basis of all powerfurther successes cannot be attained without expanding our living space in the East..." (L-79).</P>

<P>While a credulous world slumbered, snugly blanketed with perfidious assurances of peaceful intentions, the Nazis prepared not as before for a war but now for the war. The Defendants Goring, Keitel, Raeder, Frick, and Funk, with others, met as the Reich Defense Council in June of 1939. The minutes, authenticated by Goring, are revealing evidences of the way in which each step of Nazi planning dovetailed with every other. These five key defendants, 3 months before the first Panzer unit had knifed into Poland, were laying plans for "employment of the population in wartime," and had gone so far as to classify industry for priority in labor supply after "5 million servicemen had been called up." They decided upon measures to avoid "confusion when mobilization takes place," and declared a purpose "to gain and maintain the lead in the decisive initial weeks of a war." They then planned to use in production prisoners of war, criminal prisoners, and concentration camp inmates. They then decided on "compulsory work for women in wartime." They had already passed on applications from 1,172,000 specialist workmen for classification as indispensable, and had approved 727,000 of them. They boasted that orders to workers to report for duty "are ready and tied up in bundles at the labor offices." And they resolved to increase the industrial manpower supply by bringing into Germany "hundreds of thousands of workers" from the Protectorate to be "housed together in hutments" 3787-PS).</P>

<P>It is the minutes of this significant conclave of many key defendants which disclose how the plan to start the war was coupled with the plan to wage the war through the use of illegal sources of labor to maintain production. Hitler, in announcing his plan to attack Poland, had already foreshadowed the slave-labor program as one of its corollaries when he cryptically pointed out to the Defendants Goring, Raeder, Keitel, and others that the Polish population "will be available as a source of labor" (L-79). This was part of the plan made good by Frank, who as Governor General notified Goring that he would supply "at least one million male and female agricultural and industrial workers to the Reich" (1374-PS), and by Sauckel, whose impressments throughout occupied territory aggregated numbers equal to the total population of some of the smaller nations of Europe.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Here also comes to the surface the link between war labor and concentration camps, a manpower source that was increasingly used and with increasing cruelty. An agreement between Himmler and the Minister of Justice Thierack in 1942 provided for "the delivery of antisocial elements from the execution of their sentence to the Reichsfuhrer SS to be worked to death" (654-PS). An SS directive provided that bedridden prisoners be drafted for work to be performed in bed (1395-PS). The Gestapo ordered 46,000 Jews arrested to increase the "recruitment of manpower into the concentration camps" (1472-PS). One hundred thousand Jews were brought from Hungary to augment the camps' manpower (R-124). On the initiative of the Defendant Donitz, concentration camp labor was used in the construction of submarines (C-195). Concentration camps were thus geared into war production on the one hand, and into the administration of justice and the political aims of the Nazis on the other.</P>

<P>The use of prisoner-of-war labor as then planned in that meeting also grew with German needs. At a time when every German soldier was needed at the front and forces were not available at home, Russian prisoners of war w,re forced to man anti.aircraft guns against Allied planes. Field Marshal Milch reflected the Nazi merriment at this flagrant violation of international law, saying: ". . . this is an amusing thing, that the Russians must work the guns" (R-124).</P>

<P>The orders for the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war were so ruthless that Admiral Canaris, pointing out that they would "result in arbitrary mistreatments and killing," protested to the OKW against them as breaches of international law. The reply of Keitel was unambiguous. He said:</P>

<P>"The objections arise from the military conception of chivalrous warfare! This is the destruction of an ideology! Therefore, I approve and back the measures" (C-338).</P>

<P>The Geneva Convention would have been thrown overboard openly except that Jodl objected because he wanted the benefits of Allied observance of it while it was not being allowed to hamper the Germans in any way.</P>

<P>Other crimes in the conduct of warfare were planned with equal thoroughness as a means of insuring victory of German arms. In October 1938, almost a year before the start of the war, the large scale violation of the established rules of warfare was contemplated as a policy, and the Supreme Command circulated a "most secret" list of devious explanations to be given by the Propaganda Minister in such cases (C-2). Even before this time commanders of the Armed Forces were instructed to employ any means of warfare so long as it facilitated victory (L-211). After the war was in progress the orders increased in savagery. A typical Keitel order, demanding the use of the"most brutal means," provided that: ". . . It is the duty of the troops to use all means without restriction, even against women and children, so long as it insures success."</P>

<P>The German naval forces were no more immune from the infection than the land forces. Raeder ordered violations of the accepted rules of warfare wherever necessary to gain strategic successes (C-157). Donitz urged his submarine crews not to rescue survivors of torpedoed enemy ships in order to cripple merchant shipping of the Allied Nations by decimating their crews (D-642).</P>

<P>Thus, the war crimes against Allied forces and the crimes against humanity committed in occupied territories are incontestably part of the program for making the war because, in the German calculations, they were indispensable to its hope of success.</P>

<P>Similarly, the whole group of prewar crimes, including the persecutions within Germany, fall into place around the plan for aggressive war like stones in a finely wrought mosaic. Nowhere is the whole catalog of crimes of Nazi oppression and terrorism within Germany so well integrated with the crime of war as in that strange mixture of wind and wisdom which makes up the testimony of Hermann Goring. In describing the aims of the Nazi program before the seizure of power, Goring said:</P>

<P>"The first question was to achieve and establish a different political structure for Germany which would enable Germany to obtain against the dictate (of Versailles) not only a protest but an objection of such a nature that it would actually be considered."</P>

<P>With these purposes, Goring admitted that the plan was made to overthrow the Weimar Republic to seize power, and to carry out the Nazi program by whatever means were necessary, whether legal or illegal.</P>

<P>From Goring's cross-examination we learn how necessarily the whole program of crime followed. Because they considered a strong state necessary to get rid of the Versailles Treaty, they adopted the Fuhrerprinzip. Having seized power, the Nazis thought it necessary to protect it by abolishing parliamentary government and suppressing all organized opposition from political parties (L-83). This was reflected in the philosophy of Goring that the opera was more important than the Reichstag. Even the "opposition of each individual was not tolerated unless it was a matter of unimportance." To insure the suppression of opposition a secret police force was necessary. In order to eliminate incorrigible opponents, it was necessary to establish concentration camps and to resort to the device of protective custody. Protective custody, Goring testified, meant that:</P>

<P>"People were arrested and taken into protective custody who had committed no crime but who one might expect, if they remained in freedom, would do all sorts of things to damage the German State."</P>

<P>The same war purpose was dominant in the persecution of the Jews. In the beginning, fanaticism and political opportunism played a principal part, for anti-Semitism and its allied scapegoat, mythology, was a vehicle on which the Nazis rode to power. It was for this reason that the filthy Streicher and the blasphemous Rosenberg were welcomed at Party rallies and made leaders and officials of the State or Party. But the Nazis soon regarded the Jews as foremost among the opposition to the police state with which they planned to put forward their plans of military aggression. Fear of their pacifism and their opposition to strident nationalism was given as the reason that the Jews had to be driven from the political and economic life of Germany. Accordingly, they were transported like cattle to the concentration camps, where they were utilized as a source of forced labor for war purposes.</P>

<P>At a meeting held on 11/12/1938, 2 days after the violent anti-Jewish pogroms instigated by Goebbels and carried out by the Party Leadership Corps and the SA, the program for the elimination of Jews from the German economy was mapped out by Goring, Funk, Heydrich, Goebbels, and the other top Nazis. The measures adopted included confinement of the Jews in ghettos, cutting off their food supply, "Aryanizing" their shops, and restricting their freedom of movement (1816-PS). Here another purpose behind the Jewish persecutions crept in, for it was the wholesale confiscation of their property which helped finance German rearmament. Although Schacht's plan to have foreign money ransom the entire race within Germany was not adopted, the Jews were stripped to the point where Goring was able to advise the Reich Defense Council that the critical situation of the Reich exchequer, due to rearmament, had keen relieved "through the billion Reichsmark fine imposed on Jewry, and through profits accrued to the Reich in the Aryanization of Jewish enterprises" (3575-PS).</P>

<P>A glance over the dock will show that, despite quarrels among themselves, each defendant played a part which fitted in with every other, and that all advanced the common plan. It contradicts experience that men of such diverse backgrounds and talents should so forward each other's aims by coincidence.</P>

<P>The large and varied role of Goring was half militarist and half gangster. He stuck his pudgy finger in every pie. He used his SA musclemen to help bring the gang into power. In order to entrench that power he contrived to have the Reichstag burned, established the Gestapo, and created the concentration camps. He was equally adept at massacring opponents and at framing scandals to get rid of stubborn generals. He built up the Luftwaffe and hurled it at his defenseless neighbors. He was among the foremost in harrying Jews out of the land. By mobilizing the total economic resources of Germany he made possible the waging of the war which he had taken a large part in planning. He was, next to Hitler, the man who tied the activities of all the defendants together in a common effort.</P>

<P>The parts played by the other defendants, although less comprehensive and less spectacular than that of the Reichsmarshal, were nevertheless integral and necessary contributions to the joint undertaking, without any one of which the success of the common enterprise would have been in jeopardy. There are many specific deeds of which these men have been proven guilty. No purpose would be servednor indeed is time availableto review all the crimes which the evidence has charged up to their names. Nevertheless, in viewing the conspiracy as a whole and as an operating mechanism, it may be well to recall briefly the outstanding services which each of the men in the dock rendered to the common cause.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to adjourn?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Entirely, Your Honor.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken.]</P>

<P>The zealot Hess, before succumbing to wanderlust, was the engineer tending the Party machinery, passing orders and propaganda down to the Leadership Corps, supervising every aspect of Party activities, and maintaining the organization as a loyal and' ready instrument of power. When apprehensions abroad threatened the success of the Nazi regime for conquest, it was the duplicitous Ribbentrop, the salesman of deception, who was detailed to pour wine on the troubled waters of suspicion by preaching the gospel of limited and peaceful intentions. Keitel, the weak and willing tool, delivered the Armed Forces, the instrument of aggression, over to the Party and directed them in executing its felonous designs.</P>

<P>Kaltenbrunner, the grand inquisitor, took up the bloody mantle of Heydrich to stifle opposition and terrorize compliance, and buttressed the power of National Socialism on a foundation of guiltless corpses. It was Rosenberg, the intellectual high priest of the "master race," who provided the doctrine of hatred which gave the impetus for the annihilation of Jewry, and who put his infidel theories into practice against the Eastern Occupied Territories. His woolly philosophy also added boredom to the long list of Nazi atrocities. The fanatical Frank, who solidified Nazi control by establishing the new order of authority without law, so that the will of the Party was the only test of legality, proceeded to export his lawlessness to Poland, which he governed with the lash of Caesar and whose population he reduced to sorrowing remnants. Frick, the ruthless organizer, helped the Party to seize power, supervised the police agencies to insure that it stayed in power, and chained the economy of Bohemia and Moravia to the German war machine.</P>

<P>Streicher, the venomous vulgarian, manufactured and distributed obscene racial libels which incited the populace to accept and assist the progressively savage operations of "race purification." As Minister of Economics Funk accelerated the pace of rearmament and as Reichsbank president banked for the SS the gold teeth fillings of concentration camp victimsprobably the most ghoulish collateral in banking history. It was Schacht, the facade of starched respectability, who in the early days provided the window dressing, the bait for the hesitant, and whose wizardry later made it possible for Hitler to finance the colossal rearmament program, and to do it secretly.</P>

<P>Donitz, Hitler's legatee of defeat, promoted the success of the Nazi aggressions by instructing his pack of submarine killers to conduct warfare at sea with the illegal ferocity of the jungle. Raeder, the political admiral, stealthily built up the German Navy in defiance of the Versailles Treaty, and then put it to use in a series of aggressions which he had taken a leading part in planning. Von Schirach, poisoner of a generation, initiated the German youth in Nazi doctrine, trained them in legions for service in the SS and Wehrmacht, and delivered them up to the Party as fanatic, unquestioning executors of its will.</P>

<P>Sauckel, the greatest and cruelest slaver since the Pharaohs of Egypt, produced desperately needed manpower by driving foreign peoples into the land of bondage on a scale unknown even in the ancient days of tyranny in the kingdom of the Nile. Jodl, betrayer of the traditions of his profession, led the Wehrmacht in violating its own code of military honor in order to carry out the barbarous aims of Nazi policy. Von Papen, pious agent of an infidel regime, held the stirrup while Hitler vaulted into the saddle, lubricated the Austrian annexation, and devoted his diplomatic cunning to the service of Nazi objectives abroad.</P>

<P>Seyss-Inquart, spearhead of the Austrian fifth column, took over the government of his own country only to make a present of it to Hitler, and then, moving north, brought terror and oppression to the Netherlands and pillaged its economy for the benefit of the German juggernaut. Von Neurath, the old-school diplomat, who cast the pearls of his experience before Nazis, guided Nazi diplomacy in the early years, soothed the fears of prospective victims, and, as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, strengthened the German position for the coming attack on Poland. Speer, as Minister of Armaments and Production, joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the laborers waned in starvation. Fritzsche, radio propaganda chief, by manipulation of the truth goaded German public opinion into frenzied support of the regime and anesthetized the independent judgment of the population so that they did without question their masters' bidding. And Bormann, who has not accepted our invitation to this reunion, sat at the throttle of the vast and powerful engine of the Party, guiding it in the ruthless execution of Nazi policies, from the scourging of the Christian Church to the lynching of captive Allied airmen.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>The activities of all these defendants, despite their varied backgrounds and talents, were joined with the efforts of other conspirators not now in the dock, who played still other essential roles. They blend together into one consistent and militant pattern animated by a common objective to reshape the map of Europe by force of arms. Some of these defendants were ardent members of the Nazi movement from its birth. Others, less fanatical, joined the common enterprise later, after success had made participation attractive by the promise of rewards. This group of latter-day converts remedied a crucial defect in the ranks of the original true believers, for as Dr. Siemers has pointed out in his summation:</P>

<P>". . .There were no specialists among the National Socialists for the particular tasks. Most of the National Socialist collaborators did not previously follow a trade requiring technical education."</P>

<P>It was the fatal weakness of the early Nazi band that it lacked technical competence. It could not from among its own ranks make up a government capable of carrying out all the projects necessary to realize its aims. Therein lies the special crime and betrayal of men like Schacht and Von Neurath, Speer and Von Papen, Raeder and Donitz, Keitel and Jodl. It is doubtful whether the Nazi master plan could have succeeded without their specialized intelligence which they so willingly put at its command. They did so with knowledge of its announced aims and methods, and continued their services after practice had confirmed the direction in which they were tending. Their superiority to the average run of Nazi mediocrity is not their excuse. It is their condemnation.</P>

<P>The dominant fact which stands out from all the thousands of pages of the record of this Trial is that the central crime of the whole group of Nazi crimesthe attack on the peace of the world was clearly and deliberately planned. The beginning of these wars of aggression was not an unprepared and spontaneous springing to arms by a population excited by some current indignation. A week before the invasion of Poland Hitler told his military commanders:</P>

<P>"I shall give a propagandist cause for starting warnever mind whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall not be asked later on whether we told the truth or not. In starting and making a war, it is not the right that matters, but victory (1014-PS).</P>

<P>The propagandist incident was duly provided by dressing concentration camp inmates in Polish uniforms, in order to create the appearance of a Polish attack on a German frontier radio station (2751-PS). The plan to occupy Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg first appeared as early as August 1938 in connection with the plan for attack on Czechoslovakia (375-PS). The intention to attack became a program in May 1939, when Hitler told his commanders that "the Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed forces. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored" (L-79).</P>

<P>Thus, the follow-up wars were planned before the first was launched. These were the most carefully plotted wars in all history. Scarcely a step in their terrifying succession and progress failed to move according to the master blueprint or the subsidiary schedules and timetables until long after the crimes of aggression were consummated.</P>

<P>Nor were the war crimes and the crimes against humanity unplanned, isolated, or spontaneous offenses. Aside from our undeniable evidence of their plotting, it is sufficient to ask whether 6 million people could be separated from the population of several nations on the basis of their blood and birth, could be destroyed and their bodies disposed of, except that the operation fitted into the general scheme of government. Could the enslavement of 5 millions of laborers, their impressment into service, their transportation to Germany, their allocation to work where they would be most useful, their maintenance, if slow starvation can be called maintenance, and their guarding have been accomplished if it did not fit into the common plan? Could hundreds of concentration camps located throughout Germany, built to accommodate hundreds of thousands of victims, and each requiring labor and materials for construction, manpower to operate and supervise, and close gearing into the economycould such efforts have been expended under German autocracy if they had not suited the plan? Has the Teutonic passion for organization suddenly become famous for its toleration of nonconforming activity? Each part of the plan fitted into every other. The slave-labor program meshed with the needs of industry and agriculture, and these in turn synchronized with the military machine. The elaborate propaganda apparatus geared with the program to dominate the people and incite them to a war their sons would have to fight. The armament industries were fed by the concentration camps. The concentration camps were fed by the Gestapo. The Gestapo was fed by the spy system of the Nazi Party. Nothing was permitted under the Nazi iron rule that was not in accordance with the program. Everything of consequence that took place in this regimented society was but a manifestation of a premeditated and unfolding purpose to secure the Nazi State a place in the sun by casting all others into darkness.</P>

<P>The defendants meet this overwhelming case, some by admitting a limited responsibility, some by putting the blame on others, and some by taking the position in effect that while there have been enormous crimes there are no criminals. Time will not permit me to examine each individual and particular defense, but there are certain lines of defense common to so many cases that they deserve some consideration.</P>

<P>Counsel for many of the defendants seek to dismiss the conspiracy or common planning charge on the ground that the pattern of the Nazi plan does not fit into the concept of conspiracy applicable in German law to the plotting of a highway robbery or a burglary. Their concept of conspiracy is in the terms of a stealthy meeting in the dead of night, in a secluded hideout, in which a small group of felons plot every detail of a specific crime. The Charter forestalls resort to such parochial and narrow concepts of conspiracy taken from local law by using the additional and nontechnical term, "common plan." Omitting entirely the alternative term of "conspiracy," the Charter reads that "leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan to commit any of the described crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan."</P>

<P>The Charter concept of a common plan really represents the conspiracy principle in an international context. A common plan or conspiracy to seize the machinery of a state, to commit crimes against the peace of the world, to blot a race out of existence, to enslave millions, and to subjugate and loot whole nations cannot be thought of in the same terms as the plotting of petty crimes, although the same underlying principles are applicable. Little gangsters may plan which will carry a pistol and which a stiletto, who will approach a victim from the front and who from behind, and where they will waylay him. But in planning a war, the pistol becomes a Wehrmacht, the stiletto, a Luftwaffe. Where to strike is not a choice of dark alleys, but a matter of world geography. The operation involves the manipulation of public opinion, the law of the state, the police power, industry, and finance. The baits and bluffs must be translated into a nation's foreign policy. Likewise the degree of stealth which points to a guilty purpose in a conspiracy will depend upon its object. The clandestine preparations of a state against international society, although camouflaged to those abroad, might be quite open and notorious among its own people. But stealth is not an essential ingredient of such planning. Parts of the common plan may be proclaimed from the housetops, as antiSemitism was, and parts of it kept under cover s rearmament for a long time was. It is a matter of strategy how much of the preparation shall be made public, as was Goring's announcement in 1935 of the creation of an air force, and how much shall be kept covert, as in the case of the Nazis' use of shovels to teach "labor corps" the manual of arms (3054-PS). The forms of this grand type of conspiracy are amorphous, the means are opportunistic, and neither can divert the law from getting at the substance of things.</P>

<P>The defendants contend, however, that there could be no conspiracy involving aggressive war because: (1) None of the Nazis wanted war; (2) rearmament was only intended to provide the strength to make Germany's voice heard in the family of nations and (3) the wars were not in fact aggressive wars but were defensive against a "Bolshevik menace."</P>

<P>When we analyze the argument that the Nazis did not want war it comes down, in substance, to this: "The record looks bad indeed objectivelybut when you consider the state of my mindsubjectively I hated war. I knew the horrors of war. I wanted peace." I am not so sure of this. I am even less willing to accept Goring's description of the General Staff as pacifist. However, it will not injure our case to admit that as an abstract proposition none of these defendants liked war. But they wanted things which they knew they could not get without war. They wanted their neighbors' lands and goods. Their philosophy seems to be that if the neighbors would not acquiesce, then they are the aggressors and are to blame for the war. The fact is, however, that war never became terrible to the Nazis until it came home to them, until it exposed their deceptive assurances to the German people that German cities, like the ruined one in which we meet, would be invulnerable. From then on, war was terrible.</P>

<P>But again the defendants claim, "To be sure, we were building guns. But not to shoot. They were only to give us weight in negotiating." At its best this argument amounts to a contention that the military forces were intended for blackmail, not for battle. The threat of military invasion which forced the Austrian Anschluss, the threats which preceded Munich, and Goring's threat to bomb the beautiful city of Prague if the President of Czechoslovakia did not consent to a Protectorate, are examples of what the defendants have in mind when they talk of arming to back negotiation.</P>

<P>But from the very nature of German demands, the day was bound to come when some country would refuse to buy its peace, would refuse to pay danegelt, "for the end of that game is oppression and shame, and the nation that plays it is lost."</P>

<P>Did these defendants then intend to withdraw German demands, or was Germany to enforce them and manipulate propaganda so as to place the blame for the war on the nation so unreasonable as to resist? Events have answered that question, and documents such as Admiral Carl's memorandum, earlier quoted, leave no doubt that the events occurred as anticipated.</P>

<P>But some of the defendants argue that the wars were not aggressive and were only intended to protect Germany against some eventual danger from the "menace of Communism," which was something of an obsession with many Nazis.[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>At the outset this argument of self-defense falls because it completely ignores This damning combination of facts clearly established in the record: First, the enormous and rapid German preparations for war; second, the repeatedly avowed intentions of the German leaders to attack, which I have previously cited; and third, the fact that a series of wars occurred in which German forces struck the first blows, without warning, across the borders of other nations. Even if it could be shownwhich it cannotthat the Russian war was really defensive, such is demonstrably not the case with those wars which preceded it. It may also be pointed out that even those who would have you believe that Germany was menaced by Communism also compete with each other in describing their opposition to the disastrous Russian venture. Is it reasonable that they would have opposed that war if it were undertaken in good-faith self-defense? The frivolous character of the self-defense theory on the facts it is sought to compensate, as advocates often do, by resort to a theory of law. Dr. Jahrreiss, in his scholarly argument for the defense, rightly points out that no treaty provision and no principle of law denied Germany, as a sovereign nation, the right of self-defense. He follows with the assertion for which there is authority in classic international law, that ". . . every state is alone judge of whether in a given case it is waging a war of self-defense."</P>

<P>It is not necessary to examine the validity of an abstract principle which does not apply to the facts of our case. I do not doubt that if a nation arrived at a judgment that it must resort to war in self-defense, because of conditions affording reasonable grounds for such an honest judgment, any tribunal would accord it great and perhaps conclusive weight, even if later events proved that judgment mistaken. But the facts in this case call for no such deference to honest judgment because no such judgment was ever pretended much less honestly made.</P>

<P>In all the documents which disclose the planning and rationalization of these attacks, not one sentence has been or can be cited to show a good-faith fear of attack. It may be that statesmen of other nations lacked the courage forthrightly and fully to disarm. Perhaps they suspected the secret rearmament of Germany. But if they hesitated to abandon arms, they did not hesitate to neglect them. Germany well knew that her former enemies had allowed their armaments to fall into decay, so little did they contemplate another war. Germany faced a Europe that not only was unwilling to attack, but was too weak and pacifist even adequately to defend, and went to the very verge of dishonor, if not beyond, to buy its peace. The minutes we have shown you of the Nazis' secret conclaves identify no potential attacker. They bristle with the spirit of aggression and not of defense. They contemplate always territorial expansion, not the maintenance of territorial integrity.</P>

<P>Minister of War Von Blomberg, in his 1937 directive prescribing general principles for the preparation for war of the Armed Forces has given the lie to these feeble claims of self-defense. He stated at that time:</P>

<P>"The general political situation justifies the supposition that Germany need not consider an attack on any side. Grounds for this are, in addition to the lack of desire for war in almost all nations, particularly the Western Powers, the deficiencies in the preparedness for war in a number of states and of Russia in particular."</P>

<P>Nevertheless, he recommended:</P>

<P>". . . a continuous preparation for war in order to (a) counterattack at any time, and (b) to enable the military exploitation of politically favorable opportunities should they occur"</P>

<P>If these defendants may now cynically plead self-defense, although no good-faith need of self-defense was asserted or contemplated by any responsible leader at that time, it reduces nonaggression treaties to a legal absurdity. They become additional instruments of deception in the hands of the aggressor, and traps for well-meaning nations. If there be in nonaggression pacts an implied condition that each nation may make a bona fide judgment as to the necessity for self-defense against imminent threatened attack, it certainly cannot be invoked to shelter those who never made any such judgment at all.</P>

<P>In opening this case I ventured to predict that there would be no serious denial that the crimes charged were committed, and that the issue would concern the responsibility of particular defendants. The defendants have fulfilled that prophecy. Generally, they do not deny that these things happened, but it is contended that they "just happened," and that they were not the result of a common plan or conspiracy.</P>

<P>One of the chief reasons the defendants say there was no conspiracy is the argument that conspiracy was impossible with a dictator. The argument runs that they all had to obey Hitler's orders, which had the force of law in the German State, and hence obedience could not be made the basis of an original charge. In this way it is explained that while there have been wholesale killings, there have been no murderers.</P>

<P>This argument is an effort to evade Article 8 of the Charter, which provides that the order of the Government or of a superior shall not free a defendant from responsibility but can only be considered in mitigation. This provision of the Charter corresponds with the justice and with the realities of the situation, as indicated in Defendant Speer's description of what he considered to be the common responsibility of the leaders of the German nation:</P>

<P>". . . with reference to utterly decisive matters, there is total responsibility. There must be total responsibility insofar as a person is one of the leaders, because who else could assume responsibility for the development of events, if not the immediate associates who work with and around the head of the State?"</P>

<P>Again he told the Tribunal:</P>

<P>". . . it is impossible after the catastrophe to evade this total responsibility. If the war had been won, the leaders would also have assumed total responsibility."</P>

<P>Like much of Defense Counsel's abstract arguments, the contention that the absolute power of Hitler precluded a conspiracy crumbles in the face of the facts of record. The Fuhrerprinzip of absolutism was itself a part of the common plan, as Goring has pointed out. The defendants may have become the slaves of a dictator, but he was their dictator. To make him such was, as Goring has testified, the object of the Nazi movement from the beginning. Every Nazi took this oath:</P>

<P>"I pledge eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge unconditional obedience to him and the Fuhrers appointed by him" 1893-PS).</P>

<P>Moreover, they forced everybody else in their power to take it This oath was illegal under German law, which made it criminal to become a member of an organization in which obedience to "unknown superiors or unconditional obedience to known superiors is pledged." These men destroyed free government in Germany and now plead to be excused from responsibility because they became slaves. They are in the position of the fictional boy who murdered his father and mother and then pleaded for leniency because he was n orphan.</P>

<P>What these men have overlooked is that Adolf Hitler's acts are their acts. It was these men among millions of others, and it was these men leading millions of others, who built up Adolf Hitler and vested in his psychopathic personality not only innumerable lesser decisions but the supreme issue of war or peace. They intoxicated him with power and adulation. They fed his hates and aroused his fears. They put a loaded gun in his eager hands. It was left to Hitler to pull the trigger, and when he did they all at that time approved. His guilt stands admitted, by some defendants reluctantly, by some vindictively. But his guilt is the- guilt of the whole dock, and of every man in it.</P>

<P>But it is urged that these defendants could not be in agreement on a common plan or in a conspiracy because they were fighting among themselves or belonged to different factions or cliques. Of course, it is not necessary that men should agree on everything in order to agree on enough things to make them liable for a criminal conspiracy. Unquestionably there were conspiracies within the conspiracy, and intrigues and rivalries and battles for power Schacht and Goring disagreed, but over which of them should control the economy, not over whether the economy should be regimented for war. Goring claims to have departed from the plan because through Dahlerus he conducted some negotiations with men of influence in England just before the Polish war. But it is perfectly clear that this was not an effort to prevent aggression against Poland but to make that aggression successful and safe by obtaining English neutrality (TC-90). Rosenberg and Goring may have had some differences as to how stolen art should be distributed but they had none about how it should be stolen. Jodl and Goring may have disagreed about whether to denounce the Geneva Convention, but they have never disagreed about violating it. And so it goes through the whole long and sordid story. Nowhere do we find a single instance where any one of the defendants stood up against the rest and said: "This thing is wrong and I will not go along with it." Wherever they differed, t,heir differences were as to method or disputes over jurisdiction, but always within the framework of the common plan.</P>

<P>Some of the defendants also contend that in any.event there was no conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against  humanity because cabinet members never met with the military to plan these acts. But these crimes were only the inevitable and incidental results of the plan to commit the aggression for Lebensraum purposes. Hitler stated, at a conference with his commanders, that: "The main objective in Poland is the destruction of the enemy and not the reaching of a certain geographical line" (1014-PS). Frank picked up the tune and suggested that when their usefulness was exhausted, ". . . then, for all I care, mincemeat can be made of the Poles and Ukrainians and all the others who run around hereit does not matter what happens" (2233-PS).</P>

<P>Reichskommissar Koch in the Ukraine echoed the refrain: "I will draw the very last out of this country. I did not come to spread bliss..." (1130-PS).</P>

<P>This was Lebensraum on its seamy side. Could men of their practical intelligence expect to get neighboring lands free from the claims of their tenants without committing crimes against humanity? The last stand of each defendant is that even if there was a conspiracy, he was not in it. It is therefore important in examining their attempts at avoidance of responsibility to know, first of all, just what it is that a conspiracy charge comprehends and punishes In conspiracy we do not punish one man for another man's crime. We seek to punish each for his own crime of joining a common criminal plan in which others also participated. The measure of the criminality of the plan and therefore of the guilt of each participant is, of course, the sum total of crimes committed by all in executing the plan. But the gist of the offense is participation in the formulation or execution of the plan. These are rules which every society has found necessary in order to reach men, like these defendants, who never get blood on their own hands but who lay plans that result in the shedding of blood. All over Germany today, in every zone of occupation, little men who carried out these criminal policies under orders are being convicted and punished. It would present a vast and unforgivable caricature of justice if the men who planned these policies and directed these little men should escape all penalty. These men in this dock, on the face of this record, were not strangers to this program of crime, nor was their connection with it remote or obscure. We find them in the very heart of it. The positions they held show that we have chosen defendants of self evident responsibility. They are the very top surviving authorities in their respective fields and in the Nazi State. No one lives who, at least until the very last moments of the war, outranked Goring in position, power, and influence. No soldier stood above Keitel and Jodl, and no sailor above Raeder and Donitz. Who can be responsible for the diplomacy of duplicity if not the Foreign Ministers, Von Neurath and Ribbentrop, and the diplomatic handy man Von Papen? Who should be answerable for the oppressive administration of occupied countries if Gauleiters, protectors, governors and Kommissars such as Frank, Seyss-Inquart, Frick, Von Schirach, Von Neurath, and Rosenberg are not? Where shall we look for those who mobilized the economy for total war if we overlook Schacht and Speer and Funk? Who was the master of the great slaving enterprise if it was not Sauckel? Where shall we find the hand that ran the concentration camps if it was not the hand of Kaltenbrunner? And who whipped up the hates and fears of the public, and manipulated the Party organizations to incite these crimes, if not Hess, Von Schirach, Fritzsche, Bormann, and the unspeakable Julius Streicher? The list of defendants is made up of men who played indispensable and reciprocal parts in this tragedy. The photographs and the films show them again and again together on important occasions. The documents show them agreed on policies and on methods, and all working aggressively for the expansion of Germany by force of</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Each of these men made a real contribution to the Nazi plan. Each man had a key part. Deprive the Nazi regime of the functions performed by a Schacht, a Sauckel, a Von Papen, or a Goring and you have a different regime. Look down the rows of fallen men and picture them as the photographic and documentary evidence shows them to have been in their days of power. Is there one who did not substantially advance the conspiracy along its bloody path toward its bloody goal? Can we assume that the great effort of these men's lives was directed toward ends they never suspected?</P>

<P>To escape the implications of their positions and the inference of guilt from their activities, the defendants are almost unanimous in one defense. The refrain is heard time and again: These men were without authority, without knowledge, without influence without importance. Funk summed up the general self-abasement of the dock in his plaintive lament that: "I always, so to speak, came up to the door, but I was not permitted to enter."</P>

<P>In the testimony of each defendant, at some point there was reached the familiar blank wall: Nobody knew anything about what was going on. Time after time we have heard the chorus from the dock: "I only heard about these things here for the first time."</P>

<P>These men saw no evil, spoke none, and none was uttered in their presence. This claim might sound very plausible if made by one defendant. But when we put all their stories together, the impression which emerges of the Third Reich, which was to last a thousand years, is ludicrous. If we combine only the stories of the front bench, this is the ridiculous composite picture of Hitler's Government that emerges. It was composed of:</P>

<P>A Number 2 man who knew nothing of the excesses of the Gestapo which he created, and never suspected the Jewish extermination program although he was the signer of over a score of decrees which instituted the persecutions of that race;</P>

<P>A Number 3 man who was merely an innocent middleman transmitting Hitler's orders without even reading them, like a postman or delivery boy;</P>

<P>A foreign minister who knew little of foreign affairs and nothing of foreign policy;</P>

<P>A field marshal who issued orders to the Armed Forces but had no idea of the results they would have in practice;</P>

<P>A security chief who was of the impression that the policing functions of his Gestapo and SD were somewhat on the order of directing traffic;</P>

<P>A Party philosopher who was interested in historical research and had no idea of the violence which his philosophy was inciting in the twentieth century;</P>

<P>A governor general of Poland who reigned but did not rule;</P>

<P>A Gauleiter of Franconia whose occupation was to pour forth filthy writings about the Jews, but who had no idea that anybody would read them;</P>

<P>A minister of interior who knew not even what went on in the interior of his own office, much less the interior of his own department, and nothing at all about the interior of Germany;</P>

<P>A Reichsbank president who was totally ignorant of what went in and out of the vaults of his bank;</P>

<P>And a plenipotentiary for the war economy who secretly marshaled the entire economy for armament, but had no idea it had anything to do with war.</P>

<P>This may seem like a fantastic exaggeration, but this is what you would actually be obliged to conclude if you were to acquit these defendants.</P>

<P>They do protest too much. They deny knowing what was common knowledge. They deny knowing plans and programs that were as public as Mein Kampf and the Party program. They deny even knowing the contents of documents they received and acted upon.</P>

<P>Nearly all the defendants take two or more conflicting positions. Let us illustrate the inconsistencies of their positions by the record of one defendantwho, if pressed, would himself concede that he is the most intelligent, honorable, and innocent man in the dock. That is Schacht. And this is the effect of his own testimonybut let us not forget that I recite it not against him alone, but because most of its self-contradictions are found in the testimony of several defendants:</P>

<P>Schacht did not openly join the Nazi movement until it had won, nor openly desert it until it had lost. He admits that he never gave it public opposition, but asserts that he never gave it private loyalty. When we demand of him why he did not stop the criminal course of the regime in which he was a minister, he says he had not a bit of influence. When we ask why he remained a member of the criminal regime, he tells us that by sticking on he expected to moderate its program. Like a Brahmin among untouchables, he could not bear to mingle with the Nazi socially, but never could he afford to separate from them politically. Of all the Nazi aggressions by which he now claims to have been shocked there is not one that he did not support before the world with the weight of his name and prestige. Having armed Hitler to blackmail a continent, his answer now is to blame England and France for yielding.</P>

<P>Schacht always fought for his position in a regime he now affects to despise. He sometimes disagreed with his Nazi confederates about what was expedient in reaching their goal, but he never dissented from the goal itself. When he did break with, them in the twilight of the regime, it was over tactics, not principles. From then on he never ceased to urge others to risk their positions and their necks to forward his plots, but never on any occasion did he hazard either of his own. He now boasts that he personally would have shot Hitler if he had had the opportunity, but the German newsreel shows that even after the fall of France, when he faced the living Hitler, he stepped out of line to grasp the hand he now claims to loathe and hung upon the words of the man he now says he thought unworthy of belief. Schacht says he steadily "sabotaged" the Hitler Government. Yet the most relentless secret service in the world never detected him doing the regime any harm until long after he knew the war to be lost and the Nazis doomed. Schacht, who dealt in hedges all his life, always kept himself in a position to claim that he was in either camp. The plea for him is as specious on analysis as it is persuasive on first sight. Schacht represents the most dangerous and reprehensible type of opportunismthat of the man of influential position who is ready to join a movement that he knows to be wrong because he thinks it is winning.</P>

<P>These defendants, unable to deny that they were the men in the very top ranks of power, and unable to deny that the crimes I have outlined actually happened, know that their own denials are incredible unless they can suggest someone who is guilty.</P>

<P>The defendants have been unanimous, when pressed, in shifting the blame on other men, sometimes on one and sometimes on another. But the names they have repeatedly picked are Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich, Goebbels, and Bormann. All of these are dead or missing. No matter how hard we have pressed the defendants on. the stand, they have never pointed the finger at a living man as guilty. It is a temptation to ponder the wondrous workings of a fate which has left only the guilty dead and only the innocent alive. It is almost too remarkable.</P>

<P>The chief villain on whom blame is placedsome of the defendants vie with each other in producing appropriate epithetsis Hitler. He is the man at whom nearly every defendant has pointed an accusing finger.</P>

<P>I shall not dissent from this consensus, nor do I deny that all these dead and missing men shared the guilt. In crimes so reprehensible that degrees of guilt have lost their significance they may have played the most evil parts. But their guilt cannot exculpate the defendants. Hitler did not carry all responsibility to the grave with him. All the guilt is not wrapped in Himmler's shroud. It was these dead men whom these living chose to be their partners in this great conspiratorial brotherhood, and the crimes that they did together they must pay for one by one.</P>

<P>It may well be said that Hitler's final crime was against the land he had ruled. He was a mad messiah who started the war without cause and prolonged it without reason. If he could not rule he cared not what happened to Germany. As Fritzsche has told us from the stand, Hitler tried to use the defeat of Germany for the self-destruction of the German people. He continued to fight when he knew it could not be won, and continuance meant only ruin. Speer, in this courtroom, has described it as follows:</P>

<P>" . . . The sacrifices which were made on both sides after January 1945 were without sense. The dead of this period will be the accusers of the man responsible for the continuation of that fight, Adolf Hitler, just as much as the destroyed cities, destroyed in that last phase, who had lost tremendous cultural values and tremendous numbers of dwellings.... The German people"he said"remained faithful to Adolf Hitler until the end. He has betrayed them knowingly. He has tried to throw them into the abyss. . ."[=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Hitler ordered everyone else to fight to the last and then retreated into death by his own hand. But he left life as he lived it, a deceiver; he left the official report that he had died in battle. This was the man whom these defendants exalted to a Fuhrer. It was they who conspired to get him absolute authority over all of Germany. And in the end he and the system they created for him brought the ruin of them all. As stated by Speer on crossexamination:</P>

<P>". . . the tremendous danger, however, contained in this totalitarian system only became abundantly clear at the moment when we were approaching the end. It was then that one could see what the meaning of the principle was, namely, that every order should be carried out without any criticism. Everything . . . you have seen in the way of orders which were carried out without any consideration, did after all turn out to be mistakes . . . This systemlet me put it like thisto the end of the system it had become clear what tremendous dangers are contained in any such system, as such quite apart from Hitler's principle. The combination of Hitler and this system, then, brought about this tremendous catastrophe to this world."</P>

<P>But let me for a moment turn devil's advocate. I admit that Hitler was the chief villain. But for the defendants to put all blame on him is neither manly nor true. We know that even the head of the state has the same limits to his senses and to the hours of his days as do lesser men. He must rely on others to be his eyes and ears as to most that goes on in a great empire. Other legs must run his errands; other hands must execute his plans. On whom did Hitler rely for such things more than upon these men in the dock? Who led him to believe he had an invincible air armada if not Goring? Who kept disagreeable facts from him? Did not Goring forbid Field Marshal Milch to warn Hitler that in his opinion Germany was not equal to the war upon Russia? Did not Goring, according to Speer, relieve General Galland of his air force command for speaking of the weaknesses and bungling of the air forces? Who led Hitler, utterly untraveled himself, to believe in the indecision and timidity of democratic peoples if not Ribbentrop, Von Neurath, and Von Papen? Who fed his illusion of German invincibility if not Keitel, Jodl, Raeder, and Donitz? Who kept his hatred of the Jews inflamed more than Streicher and Rosenberg? Who would Hitler say deceived him about conditions in concentration camps if not Kaltenbrunner, even as he would deceive us? These men had access to Hitler and often could control the information that reached him and on which he must base his policy and his orders. They were the Praetorian Guard, and while they were under Caesar's orders, Caesar was always in their hands.</P>

<P>If these dead men could take the witness stand and answer what has been said against them, we might have a less distorted picture of the parts played by these defendants. Imagine the stir that would occur in the dock if it should behold Adolf Hitler advancing to the witness box, or Himmler with an armful of dossiers, or Goebbels, or Bormann with the reports of his Party spies, or the murdered Rohm or Canaris. The ghoulish defense that the world is entitled to retribution only from the cadavers is an argument worthy of the crimes at which it is directed. We have presented to this Tribunal an affirmative case based on incriminating documents which are sufficient, if unexplained, to require a finding of guilt on Count One against each defendant. In the final analysis, the only question is whether the defendant's own testimony is to be credited as against the documents and other evidence of their guilt. What, then, is their testimony worth? The fact is that the Nazi habit of economizing in the use of truth pulls the foundations out from under their own defenses. Lying -has always been a highly approved Nazi technique. Hitler, in Mein Kampf, advocated mendacity as a policy. Von Ribbentrop admits the use of the "diplomatic lie." Keitel advised that the facts of rearmament be kept secret so that they could be denied at Geneva (EC-177). Raeder deceived about rebuilding the German Navy in violation of Versailles. Goring urged Ribbentrop to tell a "legal lie" to the British Foreign Office about the Anschluss, and in so doing only marshaled him the way he was going (2947-PS). Goring gave his word of honor to the Czechs and proceeded to break it (TC-27). Even Speer proposed to deceive the French into revealing the specially trained among their prisoners (R-124). Nor is the lie direct the only means of falsehood. They all speak with a Nazi double talk with which to deceive the unwary. In the Nazi dictionary of sardonic euphemisms "final solution" of the Jewish problem was a phrase which meant extermination "special treatment" of prisoners of war meant killing; "protective custody" meant concentration camp; "duty labor" meant slave labor; and an order to "take a firm attitude" or "take positive measures" meant to act with unrestrained savagery. Before we accept their word at what seems to be its face, we must always look for hidden meanings. Goring assured us, on his oath, that the Reich Defense Council never met "as such." When we produced the stenographic minutes of a meeting at which he presided and did most of the talking, he reminded us of the "as such" and explained this was not a meeting of the Council "as such" because other persons were present. Goring denies "threatening" Czechoslovakia; he only told President Hacha that he would "hate to bomb the beautiful city of Prague." Besides outright false statements and double talk, there are also other circumventions of truth in the nature of fantastic explanations and absurd professions. Streicher has solemnly maintained that his only thought with respect to the Jews was to resettle them on the island of Madagascar. His reason for destroying synagogues he blandly said, was only because they were architecturally offensive. Rosenberg was stated by his counsel to have always had in mind a "chivalrous solution" to the Jewish problem. When it was necessary to remove Schuschnigg after the Anschluss, Ribbentrop would have had us believe that the Austrian Chancellor was resting at a "villa." It was left to cross-examination to reveal that the "villa" was Buchenwald Concentration Camp. The record is full of other examples of dissimulations and evasions. Even Schacht showed that he, too, had adopted the Nazi attitude that truth is any story which succeeds. Confronted on cross-examination with a long record of broken vows and false words, he declared in justificationand I quote from the record:</P>

<P>"I think you can score many more successes when you want to lead someone if you don't tell them the truth than if you tell them the truth."</P>

<P>This was the philosophy of the National Socialists. When for years they have deceived the world, and masked falsehood with plausibilities, can anyone be surprised that they continue their habits of a lifetime in this dock? Credibility is one of the main issues of this Trial. Only those who have failed to learn the bitter lessons of the last decade can doubt that men who have always played on the unsuspecting credulity of generous opponents would not hesitate to do the same, now.</P>

<P>It is against such a background that these defendants now ask this Tribunal to say that they are not guilty of planning, executing, or conspiring to commit this long list of crimes and wrongs. They stand before the record of this Trial as bloodstained Gloucester stood by the body of his slain king. He begged of the widow, as they beg of you: "Say I slew them not." And the Queen replied, "Then say they were not slain. But dead they are..." If you were to say of these men that they are not guilty, it would be as true to say that there has been no war, there are no slain, there has been no crime.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I call upon the chief prosecutor for the United Kingdom of Great Britain.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Would it be agreeable, Your Honors, if Sir Hartley Shawcross should start his address after the recess?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Then we will sit again at a quarter to 2.</P>

<H3>The Key Testimony</H3>



<b>July 24</b><br>

<b>Dr. Bruce Yergin</b>, a pulmonologist with a long interest in smoking-related disease, first saw Grady Carter in February 5, 1991, on a referral from Carter's internist. Carter was coughing up blood, and reported he had stopped smoking about a week before.<p>



Much of Yergin's testimony involved detailed questions about what he suspected about Carter's diagnosis, when he made the diagnosis, what Carter believed and what Yergin told Carter when. The reason for this is that the statute of limitations is four years, and Carter's suit was not filed until four years and two days after his first visit to Yergin. The plaintiff contends the diagnosis of cancer was not made until February 14, 1991. The defense says Carter knew he had cancer no later than February 5.<p>



Carter brought an x-ray with him that revealed a large lesion in the upper left lobe of his lung. This lesion most likely was cancer, but might have been tuberculosis or pneumonia.<p>



Yergin scheduled follow up tests for Carter. On February 12, he did a bronchoscopy and biopsied Carter's lung. A few days later, the pathology report confirmed lung cancer. Carter was told of the diagnosis on February 14. <p>



Yergin scheduled Carter for a bone scan because there was some indication the cancer might have spread to Carter's lymph nodes and bones. The bone scan was negative.<p>



Yergin also followed Carter after (but did not perform) the surgery which removed the entire left lobe of his lung.<p>



Since the surgery, Carter has been cancer-free. There is however a possibility that a new lesion could appear. Yergin said Carter should have follow-up doctor visits every 2-3 months, an annual lung x-ray, and a Cat scan every 2-3 years. The cost of follow-up treatment will be several thousand dollars a year.<p>



Since the surgery, Carter has had one CAT scan. Carter also suffers from mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema -- other smoking-related diseases. Yergin said the lung cancer and COPD were caused by smoking.<p>



Carter smoked from 1947 to 1991. He changed brands in 1972. Yergin testified that Carter's smoking of Lucky Strikes from 1947-72 was a substantial contributing factor to his lung disease, but acknowledged the later smoking also contributed.<p>



The doctor conceded there is no way to tell whether Carter would or would not have gotten cancer if he had quit smoking in any particular year. The plaintiffs cancer could have begun in 1982, but Yergin said it was not likely. Some of the literature suggests most human malignancies originate less than two years before diagnosis, but other sources estimate much longer times. The growth of cancer is affected by a number of factors and it can remain latent for long periods.<p>



Smoking can be an addiction, Yergin said. Although most of his patients would like to quit, only 10-20 percent are successful.<p>



<b>July 25</b><br>



<b>Robert K. Heimann, </b> the former CEO of American Tobacco, testified in a 1986 video deposition that he was aware of various studies linking smoking and cancer in the 1960s and 1970s. Heimann admitted that the company did not warn consumers of the risk of addiction or potential health consequences, and acknowledged that it continued to try to attract new smokers through its advertising and other promotional activities. He conceded the company wanted people to believe smoking was not injurious to health, and insisted that is his belief. He maintained that literature attributing cancer to smoking is wrong --"a reprehensible propaganda campaign based on spurious statistics" -- but admitted a statistical association. He acknowledged that the company conducted no studies of its own.<p>



The jury then heard the deposition testimony of <b>Robert S. Sprinkle III</b>, a chemist who held various positions at American Tobacco before leaving the company as executive vice-president for research. <p>



In the early 1960s, Sprinkle did a chemical analysis of tobacco smoke, and the company conducted studies of the components of tar in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The findings were not made public and the company made no effort to determine whether the constituent compounds of the smoke were addictive or presented human health risks. He first became aware of scientific evidence that nicotine was addictive at the time of the Surgeon General's report in 1964.<p>



The various types of tobacco and each lot of tobacco contains different amounts of nicotine. Sprinkle acknowledged that the company monitored the nicotine levels in its tobacco and controlled the amount of nicotine in its cigarettes by adjusting the tobacco blend used in manufacturing them. He was aware of the company's nicotine fortification of reconstituted tobacco, but did not know where the company obtained nicotine to add.<p>



Sprinkle maintained the causes of heart disease and cancer are unknown, but stated his belief that neither is caused by cigarette smoking. <p>



<b>Dr. Alan Feingold</b>, the Chief of Pulmonary Medicine at South Florida Hospital, treats lung cancer patients on a daily basis. He also previously worked on asbestos cases with plaintiff's attorney Norwood Wilner and co-authored a book with him on the medical/legal issues relating to asbestos.<p>



He has studied the health effects of smoking for 20 years and is testifying for free because he considers it his responsibility to his patients and his community.<p>



Feingold labeled smoking the public health issue of the century and stated that smokers are addicts, unable to rationally evaluate their habit and compelled to smoke by the chemical alterations in their brains.<p>



Feingold said lung cancer was practically unheard of prior to the 1920s. During that decade, he said, people began to see a marked increase in the disease among smokers. The incidence of lung cancer has increased since in a "straight upward line."<p>



The currently accepted figure of 90 percent of lung cancers caused by cigarette smoking was first published in 1936 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. By 1939, a medical article reported that there was "ample evidence" that tobacco contained addictive drugs. At that point, Feingold said the tobacco industry should have begun its own research and warned consumers of the risk -- "before people were trapped."<p>



Animal studies of the health effects of smoking were conducted in the 1940s. Feingold said that by 1941, when the epidemic had just begun, there was a definite conviction that the increase in lung cancer was due to cigarette smoking. "In 1941, people had figured this whole thing out," he said.<p>



He insisted that lung cancer is entirely man-made and the tobacco companies had an overwhelming duty to warn consumers starting in the 1940s.<p>



Feingold's testimony continued to detail studies through the 1950s that confirmed the causal relationship between smoking and cancer and the addictive properties of nicotine and that documented the increasing number of lung cancer deaths. He suggested that the tobacco companies were "criminal" in their efforts to refute the medical evidence.<p>



<b>July 26</b><br>



<b>Dr. Alan Feingold</b> continued to testify about the addictive properties of nicotine.<p>



He elaborated on seven properties of addictive substances -- a psychoactive effect that controls behavior of the user, compulsive use, reinforcing effect, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal and tendency to relapse -- and testified that nicotine produces all seven.<p>



Psychoactive effect: Feingold testified that nicotine use actually causes the creation of special receptors the brain -- the greater the exposure, the more receptors develop -- and these receptors cause a craving for more nicotine.<p>



Compulsive use: The witness noted that people go out in freezing temperatures in the middle of the night to buy cigarettes and opined that smokers, like heroin addicts, would steal if necessary to supply their habit, except that cigarettes are legal and relatively inexpensive.<p>



Reinforcing effect: Nicotine use supplies a pleasurable sensation and stress relief. The witness describes smoking as crack nicotine or free-basing nicotine.<p>



Tolerance: Like other drugs, use of nicotine tends to increase over time. The longer the user is exposed to the drug, the greater the doses he requires.<p>



Dependence: The witness notes the spectacle of smokers trooping outside the building at regular intervals for a nicotine fix and to the fact that smokers have their first cigarette within a half hour of waking--the need to "feed those angry nicotine receptors."<p>



Withdrawal: Smoking cessation produces physical withdrawal symptoms.<p>



Relapse: Only about 25 percent of smokers are successful in their efforts to stop smoking after one year, and the success rate drops to 5-10 percent after five years. Most smokers relapse several times before they are able to stop.<p>



Feingold also disputed the scientific accuracy of a series of American Tobacco Co. press releases from the 1950s and 1960s. He went so far as to characterize them as "criminal lies that caused all these deaths ... that caused Grady Carter's cancer."<p>



He specifically disputed suggestions in the releases that there was scientific information casting doubt on the link between smoking and cancer or that more research is needed to determine whether cigarettes cause cancer.<p>



The 1964 Surgeon General's Report concluded that cigarette smoking was not addictive but a habit supported by pharmacological effect. Nicotine was declared an addictive drug in the 1988 report by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. <p>



And in a victory for the plaintiff, the trial judge ruled that 21 internal Brown & Williamson documents were relevant and could be introduced into evidence during the trial.<p>



The documents include communications from 1963 regarding the advisability of producing research reports, apparently produced by American Tobaccos British parent, to the Surgeon General and the decision not to do so unless a specific request were made.<p>



The documents from 1963 and 1965 also refer to British research confirmation of the "weak carcinogenic effect of smoke, and a research report on the implications regarding cardiovascular disorders. There are also references to an effort to find ways of obtaining "maximum nicotine for minimum tar." <p>





<b>July 29</b><br>

The direct examination of <b>Dr. Alan Feingold</b> concluded with a review of a number of the Brown & Williamson documents. These documents appear to reflect recognition at B&W, beginning in the early 1960s, of the addictive qualities and carcinogenic effect of cigarettes, as well as the existence of company-sponsored research, during the same period, aimed at developing a safer product.<p>



The cross-examination of the witness began with a review of scientific literature, dating from the 1940s and 1950s, that appeared to refute Feingold's contention that there was consensus in the scientific community by 1953 that smoking caused lung cancer.<p>



Feingold testified that he became aware of the B&W documents when the Journal of the American Medical Association published a special edition on them in July 1995. Feingold testified he informed attorney Norwood Wilner about the existence of the documents. The witness testified he then read The Cigarette Papers, a book on the documents published by a professor at the University of California at San Francisco, and obtained and reviewed the documents.<p>



The documents, according to the witness, reflect research, performed in Europe by Battelle but sponsored by British American Tobacco, the parent company of B&W, as well as research performed by BAT at its own research facility near London.<p>



Feingold testified the documents indicate that B&W knew, prior to 1964, that cigarettes were addictive and carcinogenic and that research sponsored by them was years ahead of the rest of the scientific community in understanding the mechanism of nicotine addiction.<p>



The documents also reflect, Feingold testified, that B&W made a calculated decision not to make this information known to the Surgeon Generals committee. In the witness' opinion, the 1964 Surgeon Generals Report would have been very different had the Battelle research been made available to the committee. <p>



Other documents, according to the testimony, reflect BAT animal studies in the mid-1960s establishing the carcinogenic properties of cigarette tars and awareness by BAT scientists that the last third of a cigarette delivers an increased dose of carcinogenic elements.<p>



Feingold said the documents establish that -- contrary to its public pronouncements -- B&W had biological as well as statistical evidence that cigarette smoking caused cancer. The companies knowledge was not revealed until 1995.<p>



According to Feingold, the documents also show that in the early 1960s Battelle was working on filters to remove carcinogenic elements from cigarette smoke and that by the late 1960s the company had developed and patented an almost smokeless cigarette. Work also was being done at this time on a non-inhalable cigarette. Each of these products would have reduced the risks of smoking, Feingold testified, but none were ever marketed.<p>



Feingold offered the opinion that the cigarette warning adopted by Congress in 1966 -- "may be hazardous to your health"-- was grossly inadequate, and he suggested that the warning would have been stronger had B&W's knowledge not been concealed from the Surgeon General, Congress and the scientific community.<p>



Feingold also testified that Grady Carter's cancer was not diagnosed until after the February 12, 1991, bronchoscopy, and that Carter's current life expectancy is reduced from 81 to 75 years simply because he smoked. Feingold also testified that Carter, now 67, has an even shorter life expectancy because he had lung cancer and that his smoking prior to 1972 played a greater role in his disease than his later smoking.<p>



Under cross-examination, Feingold admitted he was aware, but did not point out to the jury on direct examination, that in 1948 -- the year Carter started smoking -- that two scientists published seven articles questioning their 1941 conclusion -- which he had brought to the jury's attention -- that there was proof of an association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.<p>



The witness defended the omission by insisting that the scientists were right in 1941, by suggesting that a co-author on some of the later papers may have been responsible for the repudiation of the earlier conclusion, and by noting that the later articles were focused on treatment while the former was specifically addressed to cause.<p>



Defense attorney Bruce Sheffler also confronted Feingold with statements and articles dating from the 1940s and 1950s by reputable scientists that the causes of lung cancer were unknown, that the association between smoking and cancer was doubtful, and that there was no evidence upon which to base a recommendation to give up smoking.<p>



Feingold responded that there were dozens of studies, some right some wrong, and he questioned the good faith of some of the authors. He continued to vehemently insist that, at that time, there was no controversy about the relationship between smoking and cancer and that there could have been no doubt after 1953 that smoking caused lung cancer.<p>



Sheffler also brought out that the witness is not being compensated by the plaintiff in this case. But Feingold charged B&W $7,000 for his deposition, he earned $2.5 million testifying on behalf of asbestos companies in cases handled by plaintiff's attorney Wilner over the last 10 or 15 years, and he is aware Wilner has a large number of pending tobacco cases.<p>





<b>July 30</b><br>

The defense confronted <b>Dr. Alan Feingold</b> with evidence of a continuing dispute in the scientific community, throughout the 1950s, about the association between lung cancer and smoking.<p>



Defense attorney Bruce Sheffler also confronted Feingold with a number of mass-circulation, national publications from the 1950s that reflected prominent coverage of concerns about smoking and health, suggesting that the American public was well aware of the risks.<p>



The defense also suggested that the type of cancer suffered by Grady Carter may be less likely to result from smoking than other varieties of lung cancer, that nicotine addiction differs from and is more controllable than addiction to narcotics, and that the Brown & Williamson documents offered by the plaintiff had been taken out of context and/or misinterpreted.<p>



The defense played a 1955 tape of a television address by the director of the National Cancer Institute stating that although cancer risk was greater for smokers, scientists were divided about whether smoking was the cause of the disease.<p>



Feingold replied that while opinions among doctors may have differed, the facts all supported the causal link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and that contrary opinions were therefore fanciful.<p>



Feingold continued to insist that the evidence, by 1955, was overwhelming, that the failure of the public health agencies to accept it and to warn the American public was "sad" or "stupid" or corrupt.<p>



Confronted with a series of articles in the popular, national press, dating from the 1950s, that revealed concerns about smoking and disease and that reflected the opportunity to reduce risk by smoking cessation, Feingold countered that public appreciation of the problem was obscured by tobacco advertising and by misinformation disseminated by the industry.<p>



Feingold also asserted that statements by the American Medical Association on the subject were suspect because the organization had accepted $15 million from the tobacco industry. Sheffler insisted that the money funded a research project on chronic disease involving not only the AMA but also the National Cancer Institute, the Public Health Service, and the American Heart Association, but the witness countered that the project was a sham and a boondoggle which produced no research of value.<p>



Feingold dismissed defense suggestions that carcinogens are present in greater quantity in auto exhaust and in food than in cigarette smoke, noting that few people smoke an automobile tailpipe and that food is ingested not inhaled.<p>



The witness also dismissed the suggestions that diet and exercise may have a greater impact on human health than smoking, that smokers who quit can ever reduce their cancer risk to the level of a never-smoker, and that Carter has had greater success controlling his nicotine habit than his diet.<p>



Shefflers cross-examination bogged down for part of the day in dense, highly scientific questions relating to the specifics of Carters disease and theories about the development of various types of lung cancers. The point appeared to be that there is some question about the relationship between smoking and the particular type of cancer suffered by Carter. Feingold would have none of it.<p>



Feingold also gave no quarter on the suggestion that nicotine addiction is of a lesser sort than other addictions.<p>



Sheffler offered other examples of Brown & Williamson internal documents that he suggested gave a different perspective that the one discussed during Feingold's direct testimony. The defense lawyer also suggested that the documents reflect that research B&W decided not to turn over to the Surgeon General was considered to be highly favorable to the company and was withheld because it was incomplete and B&W wanted to avoid charges that it was trying to propagandize the Surgeon General's Committee. Needless to say, Feingold remained adamant that the documents reveal a conspiracy.<p>





<b>July 31</b><br>

<b>Dr. Alan Feingold</b> acknowledged that some doctors were saying in the 1940s and 1950s that they didnt believe smoking and cancer were linked, but he disputed that there can be a scientific controversy without data on both sides. He said there was never any evidence to cast doubt on the link and the evidence supporting the relationship between smoking and lung cancer just continued to grow.<p>



Even if there had been a true scientific controversy, Feingold believes the tobacco companies had a huge responsibility to determine the truth and a duty to warn smokers.<p>



The witness testified that at the same time the press was trying to report on the mounting evidence of health risks from smoking, the tobacco companies were undercutting the message with skillful advertising campaigns and misleading statements.<p>



Feingold testified that there were reductions in cigarette use following the initial publicity about increased death rates for smokers. Then an increase -- in response, he claimed, to a vigorous advertising campaign by the tobacco companies. With another decrease at the time of the Surgeon Generals 1964 report, followed by a slight increase and then a decline with the introduction of warning labels.<p>



The witness testified that there are many carcinogens in cigarette smoke, and that the smokers body is exposed to these chemicals both through direct contact with the lung and through the metabolic process. Some of the worst carcinogens, he said are produced by the combustion of nicotine.<p>



Feingold testified that there are cancer "hot spots" -- locales which have an usually high incidence of certain cancers and that Jacksonville has a high incidence of lung cancer. He attributed this to asbestos exposure at ship yards and paper mills. Asbestos causes lung cancer in conjunction with smoking.<p>



If Grady Carter stopped smoking in 1972, his cancer risk would drop, but not disappear. If he started smoking in 1972, however, his cancer risk would not be substantial until he reached his 90s, so he probably wouldnt live long enough to get the disease. Therefore the witness concluded that Carters smoking of Lucky Strikes was a greater contributing cause of his smoking than his later smoking.<p>



<b>Grady Carter</b> testified about growing up on a Georgia farm which grew tobacco before moving to Jacksonville when he was 13 years old. He began working for the FAA as an air-traffic controller in 1956, and retired in 1990 as a manager.<p>



Carter smoked his first cigarette in 1947, the year he turned 17. He smoked unfiltered Lucky Strikes until he switched to Tarryton for the charcoal filter in 1972. He quit smoking on January 29, 1991.<p>



Carter initially smoked about a half pack a day, built up to a pack a day, then to a pack and a half by the end of the 1950s. He doesnt recall ever smoking more than about a pack and a half a day of Lucky Strikes.<p>



The plaintiff became aware of the risks of smoking in the 1960s and by the early 1970s was concerned about the risks. He was somewhat reassured, however, by tobacco company statements that the incriminating research was flawed and that cigarettes were being unfairly criticized.<p>



Beginning in the 1960s, Carter tried repeatedly to quit smoking. Without cigarettes, however, he felt miserable and couldnt concentrate. He tried switching to a pipe or cigars and quitting cold turkey, using Bantron, using graduated filters and using a special watch. All were unsuccessful. When his second wife became ill, she was advised to quit and she and Carter both tried. Neither succeeded.<p>



In the 1980s Carter went through a nicotine withdrawal clinic, at a cost of more than $150. He received a series of 6-12 injections and took off a week from work because he couldnt function. He was lethargic and nervous. The day he went back to work he was given some cigarette samples and started smoking again.<p>



Carter also tried unsuccessfully to quit smoking with hypnosis and Nicorette gum.<p>



In late January 1991, Carter began spitting up blood. He was afraid he had lung cancer or tuberculosis. He saw his doctor on February 4, and had a chest X-ray. His doctor then referred him to Dr. Bruce Yergin.<P>



Yergin first saw Carter on February 5, and ordered various tests including a bronchoscopy, which was performed on February 12, 1991. Two days later, Yergin told him he had cancer. On February 25, Carter had surgery to remove the upper left lobe of his lung.<p>



Carter had stopped smoking before he went to see Yergin, and Yergin gave him a new prescription for Nicorette. Carter said he still uses the nicotine gum to help him not smoke.<p>



Carter now leads a relatively normal life. There has been no recurrence of his cancer, and he has been told that chances of recurrence from the original disease are slim. He remains fearful, however, and he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild emphysema.<p>



In 1947, Carter was totally unaware that smoking could cause harm of any kind or that he might have trouble quitting. <p>



Carter said he was motivated to sue when he saw the 1994 congressional testimony of tobacco executives continuing to deny that nicotine is an addictive drug. Carter wants to be compensated for the loss of his lung and the misery he has suffered. He believes he is responsible for buying cigarettes and smoking them, but that American Tobacco is responsible for not telling him what they knew.<p>



On cross-examination, Carter said he liked the taste of cigarettes and sometimes used them as a reward.<p>



He read various publications in the 1950s but doesnt recall whether or not he read specific articles about health risks of smoking.<p>



Carter became aware of the surgeon generals findings around the time labels appeared on cigarette packages in 1966, and he was aware that tobacco ads were taken off TV because of health concerns. <p>



Carter said he recalled reading about Dr. C. Everett Koops report in the 1980s. Carter also recalled seeing television spots made by Hamilton Berger and Yul Brenner for the American Cancer Society.<p>



Carter knew that smoking was risky and knew that less tar and nicotine was better than more. <p>



He said his wife and son urged him to quit smoking, but he kept making excuses. He could have declined to smoke again after he stopped for a week. He wanted to smoke because he felt so miserable when he didnt. He was aware one in three smokers dies of smoking related disease, but he was not motivated to quit. He was such a compulsive smoker that it did not matter what anybody said to him.<p>



<b>August 1</b><br>

<b>Grady Carter</b> completed his testimony, claiming that he was aware of information about health risks related to smoking but also knew that tobacco companies disputed that information. He said he was motivated to quit many times. But whenever he tried, he felt miserable and sick. At the time, he didn't know what was happening, he said. Now he understands that he was in withdrawal.<P>



<b>Mildred Carter</b>, testified that her husband Grady's smoking caused problems in their marriage. He promised to quit but couldn't, she said. The couple learned of Grady's lung cancer on Valentine's Day of 1991 and believed he had been handed a death sentence.<P>



Following the surgery, Grady Carter was in considerable pain, she said. For the rest of their lives, she said she and her husband will live in fear of a recurrence of the cancer. Following her testimony, the plaintiff rested.<P>



The defense made a motion for a directed verdict on the grounds that the plaintiff's claim was brought too late and had failed to prove a product defect. <P>



The plaintiff's complaint was filed less than four years after he was diagnosed his lung cancer on Feb. 14, 1991. But the defense argued that Carter knew of his condition earlier, when he began spitting up blood.<P>



The defense also argued that the plaintiff had failed to prove defective design because no alternative design would have prevented Carter's injury.<P>



The motion was denied.<P>



The defense's first witness, <B>Dr. Peter O'Hanley</b>, an epidemiologist, testified that it is impossible, given the current state of scientific knowledge, to determine the cause of Grady Carter's lung cancer.<P>



O'Hanley agrees with the surgeon general's findings of an association between smoking and cancer. But he claims that the cause of Carter's cancer cannot be determined until more is known about the mechanism of the disease.<P>



Under cross-examination, O'Hanley insisted that the cause of any particular cancer will be unknown until science understands the disease well enough to design objective tests for cause. However, he acknowledged that he cannot say smoking did not cause Carter's cancer.<P>

<b>August 2</b><br>
The defendant's first expert, epidemiologist <b>Peter O'Hanley</b>, admitted under cross-examination that smokers face serious health problems, and that he teaches physicians to get their patients to quit, even if the precise mechanism of smoking-related disease is not known.<p>

O'Hanley admitted that he is not an expert in malignancy or in the causation of cancer. He is not an expert in what caused Grady Carter's cancer.<p>

He said he is aware of literature suggesting that a transversion-type change at one specific location on the human gene has been associated with exposure to one of the carcinogens -- benzo(a)pyrene -- found in cigarette smoke, while a transition-type mutation at the same location is believed to be a spontaneous mutation. He is not aware, however, of literature suggesting that the transition-type mutation at that location -- found in tissue from Carter's tumor -- has been linked to a different carcinogen--nicotine-specific nitrosamines-- found in cigarette smoke.<p>

On re-direct examination, O'Hanley testified that mutation of a particular gene does not establish cause, and that we do not yet know whether cancer causes genetic mutation or whether genetic mutation causes cancer.<p>

The witness was asked about the specifics of the article linking nicotine-specific  nitrosamines to the particular transition mutation discussed on cross-examination. He acknowledged that the study involved nicotine injected into mice to test a theory about deep-inhalation of low-yield filtered cigarettes. <p>

O'Hanley asserted that the 1964 Surgeon General's report used the word "cause" in a epidemiological sense and recognizes that statistical analysis cannot be applied to determine cause in an individual patient.<p>

Additional portions of the deposition of <b>Dr. Robert Sprinkle</b>, former vice president for research and development at American Tobacco, then were read by the defense to establish attempts by American Tobacco to develop a safer cigarette. Sprinkle also testified that American Tobacco funded independent medical research on smoking and health.<p>

The second defense witness, <b>Dr. Gary Pearl</b>, a pathologist, testified that the type of lung cancer suffered by Carter is not associated with smoking. <p>

He described the cellular structure of various parts of the human lung, He also described the four major types of lung cancers and their development. Pearl stated that the type of cancer suffered by Carter, peripheral adenocarcinoma, is not associated with smoking.<p>

On cross-examination, attorney Norwood Wilner established that the witness is not an expert in smoking-related disease and that he has never before given his opinion on whether smoking causes a particular disease.<p>

Pearl also acknowledged that his conclusion about Carter's cancer is based on the assumption that only one type of lung cell is affected by cigarette smoke. Pearl agreed that smokers have a 2,236 percent greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers and that 90 percent of all lung cancer is attributable to smoking.<p>

The witness admitted that he can't say Carter's cancer is not due to smoking --  he cannot say either way. He insisted however that while central tumors are clearly associated with smoking that the association is not as clear with peripheral tumors, because inhaled carcinogens do not have the same direct contact with the peripheral cells.<p>

 Pearl said he doesn't know whether carcinogens in cigarette smoke enter the blood stream, but that would be an important fact in determining the mechanism of a non-airway -- or peripheral -- tumor.<p>


<b>August 5</b><br>

A psychiatrist testified that Grady Carter could have quit smoking at any time but was not motivated to do so until 1991.<p>

<b>Dr. John Thompson </b> also testified that he had reviewed a document relating to the Battelle study on nicotine and addiction. In his opinion, knowledge of that study would not have changed the Surgeon General's conclusion in 1964 that nicotine was not addictive.
        
Addiction is not a scientifically precise term now, Thompson testified. In 1964, the definition included a requirement of chronic intoxication which made it more specific. The expansion of the concept of addiction to include dependence, according to the witness, has blurred the distinction between addiction and habituation.<p>

The symptoms Carter attributed to withdrawal may have been anger at pressure to quit from his wife or frustration, rather than true withdrawal, Thompson testified.<p>

Thompson said Carter smoked for as long as he wanted to smoke, quit when he wanted to quit, that is when he spit up blood and the risk became personalized to him. Before that, Thompson testified, Carter believed he'd be one of the lucky ones that smoking-related illness would never happen to him.

In his opinion, Carter was not dependent on nicotine, he was habituated not addicted.<p>

In his opinion, Carter was aware of the risks of smoking and did not want to hear additional information and was not ready to act.  Thompson testified that Carter's decision to smoke despite the risk was similar to other decisions he made -- to fly a plane, ride motorcycles or fail to change his diet despite his doctor's advice.<p>

On cross-examination, Thompson conceded he is not an expert in the pharmacology of nicotine and has not read the Journal of the American Medical Association or Brown & Williamson documents.<p>


<b>August 6</b><br>
The plaintiff continued its cross-examination of Dr. John Thompson who said he believes no one is addicted to nicotine because no one is chronically intoxicated by nicotine. People do not have the same difficulties with nicotine as with other drugs, he added.<p>

The witness admittedly prefers the 1964 Surgeon General's approach to the question of addiction--which excludes nicotine -- to the approach taken in the 1988 Surgeon General's report, and in the DSM IV which focuses on dependency and includes nicotine.<p>

Although Thompson considers the quantity of drug use important in treating his patients, he made no effort to determine Carter's nicotine intake. His evaluation of Carter is based on behavioral factors -- that Carter enjoyed smoking and continued to function at a high level.<p>

The witness admitted he is not an expert in pharmacology and acknowledged that the pharmacological effect of nicotine in the brain is a factor to be considered. Nevertheless, he insisted that the pharmacological effect does not override the ability of someone to stop smoking if they really want to.<p>

Thompson does not accept that nicotine produces compulsive use, rather he believes it is characterized by ''urges.''<p>

The witness admitted he is not aware of the Food & Drug Administration's  proposed rule asserting jurisdiction over nicotine. He testified he believes nicotine is already regulated.<p>

The witness stated that with repeated attempts, many people are able to quit smoking for a year, and that he therefore does not consider there to be a dramatic failure rate for smoking cessation. He agreed that it is difficult for people to quit smoking but pointed out that many people also have difficulty controlling their diets.<p>

Thompson insisted that in his opinion, no warning would have affected Carter's smoking -- that Carter failed to heed the personal warnings from his wife, son and friends. He stated that the risks of smoking were common knowledge in the 1940s and 1950s, but he admitted he is not aware of what information was being disseminated by the tobacco companies at that time.<p>

The defense then introduced deposition testimony from Carter's step-daughter <b>Wendy Lenninger</b>. She said Carter and her warned her about the health risks of smoking. They knew it was bad for their health and would talk about quitting but never did much about it. <p>

<b>August 7</b><br>
The defense rested after reading portions of the deposition of <b>Grady Carter</b>. In rebuttal, Carter's lawyers introduced a tape of 1950s-era television ads for various brands of cigarettes.<p>

In concluding its case, the defense introduced Carter's deposition testimony in which he admitted becoming aware of the Surgeon General's report around the time that warnings were placed on cigarette packs. Carter stated he was aware that the report linked smoking to cancer, heart disease and stroke.<p>

The plaintiff read additional portions of the deposition in which Carter said he doubted the Surgeon General's report because the tobacco companies said it was wrong.<p>

The plaintiff played a compilation of cigarette ads from the 1950s featuring endorsements by Ronald Reagan, Lucille Ball, the Flintstones and other celebrities, along with claims that cigarettes were healthful.<p>

<b>August 8</b><BR>
After closing arguments and instructions to the jury, deliberations began at about 2:30pm ET.

<H3>The Key Testimony</H3>

<b>August 21</b><br>
The state start presenting evidence in the trial of a Atlanta businessman accused of killing his wife and her friend.<p>

During opening statements, <b>prosecutor Penny Penn </b>laid out the state's case but did not offer a motive for the double killings. The state does not, of course,  have to show a motive. However, the law does say that once the defense introduces evidence of justification, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killings were not justified.<p>

Penn simply stated that the evidence will show that Lewis Joyner killed Ruby Joyner and Halima Jones, and that it was not done in self-defense. The state's case appears to rely heavily on the fact that Joyner fled to New York City -- for the seemingly suspicious reason of obtaining a new driver's license -- after the deaths. <p>

Penn contrasted Joyner's actions while the women were missing to the actions of Jones' ex-boyfriend John Dunbar. He immediately contacted the police when he was found out the women were missing, and anxiously urged Joyner to do the same. She concluded her statement by saying that any alleged relationship between Joyner and Lewis was irrelevant in this case.<p>

In stark contrast to Penn, <b>defense attorney Steven Sadow's</b> opening was a high-energy emotional tour of the defense version of events that took place on the evening of November 15, 1995. In what he said was an impulsive move, Sadow began his presentation by introducing the defendant to the jury. He walked Joyner over to the jury box and asked the jurors to take a look at the man they would be judging, to see him as a human being, and to keep an open mind throughout the prosecution's case.<p>

Sadow said Joyner and Jones had  been having a secret affair for months. Ruby Joyner and Dunbar suspected as much, he said.<p>

Then he described the defense version of the events leading to the death of the two women: Joyner met the women the night on November 15 in the parking lot of a bar and restaurant near the
Hartsfield International Airport. Ruby Joyner went into the bar. While she was away, Joyner and Jones embraced and got out some cocaine. Ruby Joyner appeared at the driver's door and offered to drive while her husband and Jones were in the back seat of the van doing cocaine.<p>

At some point, Ruby Joyner stopped the van and got out. Sadow said she took a pistol from her purse and yelled, "you cheating bitch. I caught you with my husband." She then shot Jones through the window.<p>

She then turned the gun on Joyner, who fled into the woods. She followed him, and a violent struggle followed. Ruby Joyner eventually got one of Joyner's fingers in her mouth and would not let go. As he tried to get his finger out of her mouth, she got hit in the head, and she died. He then said that police knew of this version of events early on but did not conduct tests to verify the story.<p>

Sadow also told the jury that they would hear testimony about Ruby Joyner's violent and jealous nature. And he said that the reason she obtained a gun was because she wanted to protect herself after getting mugged in her hotel while on a vacation to Ft. Lauderdale in September of 1995.<p>

<b>Kamilah Torres-Carmona</b>, a co-worker of Ruby Joyner, testified about Ruby Joyner's feelings towards guns. She testified that Joyner had told her that she was terrified of guns. But on cross-examination, she said that the conversation in which Joyner allegedly expressed her fear took place months before the Joyners' trip to Ft. Lauderdale. On redirect-examination, Torres-Carmona described how Joyner looked after she returned from the trip: her eyes were seriously injured, as if she had been beaten. She said Joyner told her she had been mugged. But the witness said she didn't believe Joyner's story.<p>

<b>John Dunbar</b> told the jury about how the Joyners met him and Jones, and how they became friends. His most important testimony concerned the events after the women disappeared. Dunbar said he had  numerous conversations with Joyner and he repeatedly urged him to go to police to file a missing persons report on his wife.<p>

On cross-examination, Dunbar said that he had indeed suspected Jones was having an affair with Joyner. By referring to phone bills, he identified numerous calls made from the Joyners' home to Jones' cell phone, and vice versa, at times when Ruby Joyner was at work. He also testified that he had seen Joyner and Jones use cocaine together.<p>

<b>Lester Page</b>, a friend of the defendant and the victims, testified that Joyner had told him he had checked into a Days Inn in Atlanta on November 16 before flying to New York to get a new driver's license and to be near his family. Page also said that he had urged Joyner to return to Atlanta, and to get in touch with his wife's family.<p>

On cross-examination, Page testified that Joyner had long been paranoid about driving around without a license. He also said Joyner was not a violent person. He identified a copy of the new license that Joyner in fact obtained in New York City on November 17th.<p>

Ruby Joyner's former boss <b>Mary Dukes </b> told the court what Ruby wore to work on the day she died, which included a brown sweater like the one found at the crime scene on Camp Creek Parkway. She also testified that Joyner called on November 16 to say that his wife would not be at work that day and had not come home the night before.<p>

In the most emotional testimony of the day, Ruby Joyner's niece <b>Coretta Thomas </b>broke down in tears as she described her aunt as a kind, supportive, trustworthy person. She also said that although she had made the hotel arrangements for the vacation in Ft. Lauderdale, her aunt never mentioned getting mugged. But her most important testimony was that Joyner had told her not to tell other family members that his wife was missing, saying he didn't want to alarm them. <p>

On cross-examination, Thomas admitted that she had also felt that Lewis Joyner was a kind and supportive person.<p>

<b>Velma Livingston</b>, another niece of Ruby Joyner, also testified about the injuries to her aunt's eyes after the Florida trip. She said her aunt explained it as a bad eye infection. Livingston also testified that when her family urged Lewis Joyner to return to Atlanta in case his wife tried to contact him, he said he never planned to go back, and talked about getting a passport.<p>

On cross-examination, Livingston was asked when she first told anyone about Joyner's passport comments. She did not give a clear answer. She also was asked about her aunt's drinking habits. Livingstone said she was a social drinker who never had more than a glass of wine at a time.<p>

<b>Peachtree City Police Detective William Weston</b> told
the whole story from start to finish about what happened in this case, starting from his first contacts with Lewis Joyner on November 16. Joyner maintained contact with Weston while police searched for the missing women. One of the more compelling areas of testimony was when Weston said that Joyner had told him he had lost his wallet while he was looking for the women. When Weston asked whether Joyner had canceled his credit cards Joyner said he had not.<p>

On cross examination, Sadow questioned Weston about records of conversations and other documents relevant to this case that Weston did not turn over to the prosecution or defense. After the judge told Weston he had to get these items for Sadow, the defense attorney reserved the right to call Weston back to the stand later.<p>

Weston also admitted that he lied to Joyner when he was trying to get him to return to Atlanta, telling him he was not a suspect in the killings. He also admitted that he did this even though Joyner had honestly told him about where he was, what flight he had taken and planned to return on, about his hotel, about the location of his GMC Jimmy at the airport in Atlanta, and about his getting a driver's license in New York.<p>

<b>Georgia Bureau of Investigation Agent Samuel Baity</b>gave the basic run-down of what happened when and where during the investigation for the missing women. He also testified about locating the crime scene off of Camp Creek Parkway. He said several items were found that led police to conclude that the crime had occurred at that location. The items included a sweater like Ruby Joyner's, bullet casings, and a shoe that belonged to Ruby Joyner. Baity was one of two Atlanta-area police who made the trip to New York City to find Lewis Joyner.<p>

On cross examination, Sadow questioned Baity about a series of technical errors made by police and the prosecution team (i.e. a reversed image print in of photo of Joyner's back, and the fact that the videotape from the Days Inn skipped over the time of day that Joyner allegedly checked in). He also responded to questions about examining the crime scenes at night, rather than in daylight, saying that the techniques work just as well at night, and that, in fact, some investigation was done in daylight.<p>

<b>Dekalb County Medical Examiner Paul Kelhofer </b>described the investigation done at the scene where the bodies were found. Defense attorney Sadow questioned Kelhofer about whether Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime scene special agent Sam House was following proper procedure. Kelhofer admitted that when he arrived, House was not wearing the entire uniform that police procedure required.<p>

<b>Atlanta homicide detective Rick Chambers </b> testified about the police meetings with Jeff Lester. Lester eventually called police and asked them to make a deal. That is when he told police what Joyner had told him in Newark, New Jersey. On cross-examination, Sadow asked Chambers why hair was taken from Lester for examination. He said that it had been taken because the piece of hair found on the women initially appeared to be Caucasian.<p>


<b>August 22</b><br>

<B>FBI Agent Peter McFarland </b>, the crime scene specialist who photographed and investigated the Camp Creek Parkway location,  identified the photos and items seized in the early morning hours of November 25. Some of the items included an overcoat, a sweater, Joyner's prescription sunglasses, broken women's glasses belonging to Ruby Joyner,  a rose-colored washcloth with stains on it, shell casings (three were found in the street and two were in the woods where clothing items were located), and one unfired bullet.<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Sadow questioned McFarland on why the bullet casings that were found in the woods were not tested at the GBI crime lab, but the casings found on the street were tested. McFarland said the casings found in the woods appeared older than those found on the street, but that he was not the person who made the decision not to test them. In general, Sadow has attempted to portray the entire police investigation of this case as sloppy. Throughout his questioning, Sadow seemed to be trying to show that police did not do enough to verify Joyner's story.<p>


<b>Brian Kaiser</b>, a licensed optician, verified that the prescription sunglasses found at the Camp Creek Parkway crime scene belonged to Lewis Joyner's. Kaiser also verified that the pieces of broken eyeglasses probably belonged to Ruby Joyner. Sadow's cross was brief and mainly just reiterated the fact that Ruby Joyner's vision would be somewhat fuzzy without her glasses, and that the defendant had very poor eyesight, both for distances and close up.<p>

The most compelling testimony of the day came from pathologist <b>Dr. Gerald Gowitt</b>.

According to Dr. Gowitt, Halima Jones died of a single gunshot wound to the head. The bullet entered her head on the right side, below her ear, and exited on the left side, above her ear. He also said it would be impossible to tell the physical positioning of either Jones or her assailant when Jones was shot. <p>

He also testified that:<P>


@ It was impossible to tell exactly the caliber of the weapon used, although a .380 semi-automatic--which would be consistent with the bullet casings found on the scene--could have produced the wound. <p>

@ The shot to the head would have produced substantial blood loss. <p>

@ The other abrasions on Jones' body could have been caused by her falling  after being shot, or by moving around in the van as it was driven from Camp Creek Parkway to the airport.<p>

Dr. Gowitt testified that the autopsy of Ruby Joyner took considerably longer than that of Jones, because of the complicated nature and large number of wounds. In his opinion, the cause of death was a combination of blunt trauma to the head and some strangulation.<p>

He also made the following points:

@ Ruby Joyner's body was covered with twigs and other foliage when it was brought to his lab.

@ Her shirt, lace undershirt and bra were all raised over her breasts when she was found, and she had large abrasions on her back, and upper body.

@ She had cuts and lacerations all over her hands. Dr. Gowitt said some of the wounds were probably defensive. He said she probably had her hands on her head at some point, as if to ward off blows to her head.<p>

@ She has numerous severe wounds around the head and face although Dr. Gowitt could not say how many times she had been struck.<P>

@ Ruby Joyner was probably rendered unconscious or at least incapacitated at some point from the blows to her head.<p>

@ Her wounds were consistent with being beaten with a handgun. <p>

On cross examination, Dr. Gowitt testified that blood spatter evidence would not necessarily be visible in the van, even if Jones was shot inside the van. If Jones was shot outside the van, blood probably would have gotten on the exterior of the van when her body was dragged into the vehicle. <p>

He also said the direction of the bullet's path through Jones' head could be consistent with her being shot while she sat in the back of the van by a person shooting through the driver's side door.<p>

He also made the following points:<p>

@ Jones had a large amount of cocaine in her system, and probably died within an hour or two of taking the cocaine. <p>

Jones' shoes were almost immaculately clean, indicating she had not walked into the wooded crime scene.<p>

@ Ruby Joyner had a large amount of alcohol in her system, although that may have been the result of decomposition, not consumption of alcoholic beverages. <p>

@ She as probably having her period when she died. (Defense attorney Sadow suggested in his opening statement that this may have contributed to her aggression.) <p>

@ The wounds around her mouth could be consistent with her having someone's (Joyner's) finger in her mouth. The injuries to her hands also could  be consistent with aggressive wounds.<p>

<b>Patrick Angell</b>, a friend and former employee of defendant, was called to testify to establish the fact that Joyner had a habit of always carrying a rag with him to wipe away perspiration. This is relevant because a rose-colored rag with reddish-brown (blood-colored) stains on it was located at the Camp Creek crime scene.<p>

<b>Jeff Lester</b>testified about meeting with Joyner in Newark after the defendant fled to New York. Lester claims Joyner told him that Jones and Ruby Joyner -- who had been using cocaine -- called Joyner and asked him to go for a drive with them near the airport. Ruby Joyner found out about here husband's affair with Jones and she shot Jones in the van. Joyner jumped out of the parked van, and thought his wife was going to shoot him. They fought over the gun and he shot her. <p>

Lester also said Joyner asked him to go to the crime scene because he had left his hat and beeper and his wife's jacket in the area, along the Camp Creek Parkway. Joyner also allegedly told Lester that he had put the gun someplace where no one would find it.<p>

He also testified that he had known for several months that Joyner and Jones were having an affair.<p>

On cross- examination, Sadow tried to show that Lester's memory might not be accurate because of the large amount of alcohol he consumed on the night he spoke with Joyner in Newark, and because Lester made assumptions about things that Joyner didn't actually say. For example, Lester said he remembered Joyner saying he had accidentally shot his wife. But she was not shot. Lester also said Joyner was scratched up and had cuts on his hands when he saw him in Newark.<p>


<b>August 23</b><br>
The day's testimony focused on shell casings found at the crime scene.<p>


A report, prepared by prosecution witness <b>Bernadette Davy</b>, concluded that the casings found at the Camp Creek Parkway probably came from a Bryco or Lorcin semi-automatic handgun. However, Davy also testified at length about which casings were probably fired from the same weapon, which appeared to have been exposed to the elements longer than the others, which were made by the same manufacturers.<p>

She also testified at length that these brands of guns often jam, and demonstrated ways that this could happen. This is important because it could provide prosecutors with a reason for why Joyner didn't just shoot his wife, too, after he shot Halima Jones.<p>

The defense asked that Davy's testimony be stricken from the record because she testified to much more than was indicated in her report. This, the defense contended, was a violation of discovery rules. Defense attorney Steven Sadow said the expert should not be allowed to testify to information not included in her report.<p>

The judge initially ruled against Sadow, but then reserved ruling until hearing arguments Monday morning on the issue.<p>



<b>August 26</b><br>

The state rested its case against presenting testimony from five witnesses. The defense then started its case with testimony from defendant Lewis Joyner. <p>

As he had during his opening argument, defense attorney Steven Sadow had Joyner approach the jury. This time, the defense lawyer asked jurors to touch the defendant -- to examine the welt on his right finger he claims resulted from his wife biting him during the struggle that ended in her death.<p>

The prosecutor also brought the defendant off the stand, asking him on cross-examination to use a dummy to demonstrate on the floor of the courtroom the progression of his altercation with his wife.<p>

At the beginning of today's session, after hearing additional argument, the judge denied a defense motion to strike the testimony of Bernadette Davy.<p>

<b>Samuel House</b>, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime scene specialist, testified that he examined the van and the bodies at the airport. House said that the absence of blood spatter, hair wads and a bullet inside the van indicated that both victims were killed someplace else. He said debris on Halima Jones legs suggested that she, like Ruby Joyner was killed in a wooded or overgrown area. He maintained the debris on Jones could not have been transferred from Joyner.<p>

Toxicologist <b>Joanne Cox</b> testified that cocaine was found in Halima Jones body. She said Jones probably took the drug within 30 minutes of her death.<p>

<b>Frank Kendall</b>, a fingerprint identification specialist, testified that only two of the latents lifted in this case were suitable for comparison and both were negative in comparison to Jeff Lester and Lewis Joyner.<p>

<b>Anthony Garitta</b>, a patrol officer for the New York City Housing Police testified about Joyner's arrest on the Harlem roof top. He said he observed Joyner drinking on the roof of a 21-story building in Harlem and that the defendant ''went nuts'' when he tried to place him under arrest. With the assistance of a number of other officers, he handcuffed Joyner, who was in possession of a small bottle of cocaine powder. The defendant and several officers received minor injuries in the scuffle. The witness said Joyner has lost a great deal of weight since his arrest.<p>

The defense case started after the judge rejected a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.

<b>Lewis Joyner</b> began his testimony denying that he killed Halima Jones, and admitting he killed his wife in self-defense. He testified he became involved with Jones in late 1994, after he had been married to his wife, Ruby, for about 18 years. During his affair with Jones, he and she used cocaine regularly.<p>

Joyner said he was confronted by John Dunbar in March of 1995 and by his wife in June of 1995 about the affair, but he denied it to both.<p>

In September of 1995, Jones decided to move out of Dunbar's apartment and Joyner helped her falsify an application to get a rent-subsidized apartment. She continued to live with Dunbar, however, until late October. Joyner had a key to the apartment. which he kept in his Jimmy.<p>

On October 20, Joyner said he and his wife had several friends over, including Jones. After Jones left, he said, he told his wife that he needed to run and errand and met Jones at her apartment. He got home about 1:30 am, but claimed there was no problems with his wife.<p>

The next day, Saturday, the Joyners went to Florida for a vacation. They planned to stay for several days. But on Sunday, Joyner said he called Dunbar's house and learned Jones abruptly moved out. Joyner said he decided that he needed to go back to Atlanta to find out what was going on so he made an excuse to his wife and flew home.<p>

The next day, Monday, October 23, Joyner claimed his wife was mugged in the hotel room. Her eyes, ankles and legs were bruised, he said. Joyner flew back to Florida that night to be with his wife. The assault was not reported to the hotel or to the police.<p>

After the incident, Ruby Joyner became very fearful,  Joyner said, and asked him to get her a gun. The defendant testified he refused.<p>

On November 15, Joyner testified he met his wife and Jones at a bar near the airport. When the women arrived in Jones' van, Ruby Joyner went inside. Jones was in the driver's seat and Joyner got into the passenger seat. Jones and Lewis Joyner were kissing, when Ruby Joyner came back to the van and knocked on the driver's window.<p>

According to the defendant, his wife suggested the three go to a bar she knew and got into the driver's seat. Jones was sitting on the floor in the back of the van, and she and Joyner began to do cocaine.<p>

After about 15 minutes of driving around, apparently lost, Joyner said his wife pulled over and got out of the van. He said he heard her say ''You cheating, bitch,'' looked up and saw her standing by the open driver's door, pointing a gun at Jones.<p>

Joyner said he heard a shot and jumped out the driver's door, past his wife, possibly knocking her into the side of the van. As he ran he heard at least two more shots.<p>

Joyner said he ran into a wooded area where he tripped and fell face forward. His wife then jumped on him and they struggled. He said he saw the gun pointed at him as he rolled over onto his back still under his wife, and thought he was going to die.<p>

The defendant said he managed to get on top of his wife, but she got the fingers of his right hand into her mouth. The gun was in her right hand and she was hitting and scratching him with her left hand. Joyner said he got his left hand on the gun, which was still in his wife's right hand, and began hitting her about the head. Eventually, he said, he pressed either the gun or his left hand into his wife's throat and she released his right hand.<p>

Thinking his wife was unconscious, Joyner claimed he went back to the van where he found Jones dead. He then went back into the woods and discovered his wife also was dead.<p>

Joyner said he then dragged his wife's body out of the woods and put her in the van. After driving around for a while, Joyner said he covered the bodies with a comforter that was in the back of the van, parked the van at the airport and took a cab back to the bar where he had left his car.<p>

Joyner said  he put the gun back into his wife's purse, which he took with him along with Jones' purse. Then he went home, showered and rested for a while before he called Dunbar to ask him about his wife's whereabouts. Joyner said he called Dunbar to alert him that there were children unattended at Jones' apartment.<p>

Joyner conceded he tried to go back to the crime scene to find his sunglasses, pager, license and cap, but got scared off when he saw an officer running his license plate. Joyner went to buy a new pager, then checked into a Days Inn. He admitted he disposed of the women's purses and his bloody clothes in a dumpster.<p>

The next morning, Joyner flew to New York, where he replaced his driver's license and checked into a hotel. He spoke to police on the telephone and contacted his sister. The defendant claimed he planned to return to Georgia in a few days.<p>

Instead, Joyner said he discovered the police were lying to him, so he consulted a lawyer in New York who advised him not to talk to the police  and not to go home until he had retained a lawyer in Georgia.<p>

Joyner admitted he asked Lester to come to New York and discussed the incident with him. He also conceded they talked about Lester trying to go to the crime scene to retrieve Joyner's possessions. The two were drinking and Joyner said they even discussed hiring a private eye or using blood hounds to find the location.<p>

On the day of his arrest, Joyner said he was drinking and doing cocaine. He had decided to commit suicide when he went up on the roof of a building in Harlem where he was apprehended.<p>

On cross-examination, prosecutor Penny Penn focused on Joyner's lies to his wife about his affair, his lack of gainful employment and his uses of aliases. She also questioned him about the oddities in his account of the Florida trip and had him repeat his account of the killings, demonstrating the fatal struggle with his wife using a dummy on the floor of the courtroom.<p>



<b>August 27</b><br>
The trial came to an end as Lewis Joyner concluded his testimony and the defense presented two other witnesses before resting its case.<p>

The jury now must consider six charges against Joyner -- malice murder, felony murder and aggravated assault in the death of Ruby Joyner and similar charges in the death of Halima Jones.<p>


The prosecution's theory of the case is that Joyner and Jones plotted to murder Ruby Joyner but that Joyner accidentally shot and killed Jones. The state claims the defendant fired at his wife until he ran out of bullets, chased her down, then beat her with the gun and strangled her with his hands. <p>

The jury could convict of malice murder in the death of Jones, because  Georgia law defines the charge as ''deliberate intention unlawfully to take the life of another human being.'' If the jury accepts that Joyner had the intent to kill his wife when he fired the bullet that killed Jones, they can convict of malice murder for the death of Jones.<p>

The prosecution concluded its cross-examination of Joyner by presenting its theory of the case. Joyner denied that he had the gun throughout the incident or that he and Jones schemed to kill his wife. Joyner also denied that he accidentally killed Jones as he was shooting at his wife or that he ran out of bullets before he could shoot Ruby Joyner.<p>

On re-direct examination, Joyner indicated his family was not present in court because defense attorney Steven Sadow told him to ask them not to come to avoid conflict with his wife's family. He stated he was never athletic and indicated he was  afraid to go to police because of his unrelated and unspecified shady dealings.<p>

<b>Cynthia Neely</b>, a former waitress at the Peachtree City Executive Center, testified that she served Joyner with his wife and Jones several times and with only Halima on a number of other occasions. She said she believed Jones was Joyner's wife.<p>

The defense's final witness was <b>Charisse Lewis</b>. The Joyners   were friends of her parents, and she went to work for Lewis Joyner's company in 1990. She attained a position superior to Ruby Joyner's in the business and tension developed between them.<p>

On one occasion, she and Ruby Joyner argued and Ruby came after her, swinging at and striking her. Another employee grabbed Ruby, ending the confrontation. Lewis believed Ruby Joyner was professionally jealous of her and resented her youth and success.<p>

The witness did not observe Ruby Joyner behaving violently on any other occasion, but described her as holding things in . She never saw Lewis Joyner behave violently and considers him to be like a father to her.<p>

In closing arguments, defense attorney Sadow focused on the burden of proof and the requirement that to support a conviction, circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonably hypothesis other than guilt.<p>

Sadow emphasized the distinction between a verdict of not guilty and a belief in innocence, highlighting the charge on bare suspicion--that is, that facts which simply raise suspicion, speculation or conjecture of the defendant's guilt is insufficient to convict.<p>

The defense lawyer also told the jury of the state's burden to disprove Joyner's self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt.<p>

Prosecutor Penny Penn emphasized Joyner's flight after his wife disappeared, his efforts to conceal evidence of his involvement in the deaths of his wife and Jones, his lies to the authorities and others in the days following the disappearance of the women, and the violence of his resistance when he was arrested in New York.<p>

The prosecutor described Ruby Joyner's Florida ''mugging'' as set-up by her husband and as a failed attempt.<p>

Penn suggested that Joyner and Jones set up the November 15, 1995, outing and that both ingested huge amounts of cocaine. She insisted that only  Joyner had the gun and that all three people were outside the van when the assault began.<p>

Penn argued that Jones was shot near the van and fell on the pavement, causing the marks noted on her face. She explained the absence of blood on the pavement as resulting from the passage of time before the scene was located.<p>

The prosecutor maintained that Jones was shot as Joyner tried to shoot his wife, and that after he had fires several rounds his gun jammed. She attributed the live round found on the pavement to Joyner's clearing the jam before he emptied the magazine firing at his wife.<p>

Penn argued Joyner caught up with his wife in the woods and using the butt of the gun like a hammer, viciously beat her. She acknowledged that Ruby Joyner probably did scratch and bite her husband ''fighting for her life.''<p>

The prosecutor argued that the number and severity of Ruby Joyner's wounds were inconsistent with Joyner's claim of self-defense. <p>

<H3>The State's Case</H3>

On January 10, 1995, at approximately 10:15 p.m., Lawrence, Massachusetts police officer William Beck responded to the Holy Family Hospital in Metheun after receiving information about an alleged robbery and stabbing. In the hospital emergency room, he learned that John McIntyre had carried a bleeding Meredith Coppola into the hospital moments earlier. Beck saw blood on McIntyre's hands and pants.<p>

McIntyre, 25, told police at the hospital that he and Coppola, 18, were together in his car before she was stabbed but that he was not  responsible for her death. He told police he left his car to buy some marijuana. And when he returned, he found Coppola bleeding.<p>

McIntyre told Beck that he and his girlfriend had driven together to buy some marijuana and that he had left his car in order to make a deal. McIntyre said that after a hassle over money with the alleged dealers,  he ran back to his car followed by two Spanish males who went to the passenger's side of the car. McIntyre said he got into the car, touched Coppola and noticed she was bleeding.<p>

Two detectives soon arrived at the hospital. McIntyre told the detectives the same story, this time adding that he had been robbed by the two Spanish males who chased him back to the car. He also said he could not identify the men or Coppola's assailant. <p>

Coppola died at approximately 2 am on January 11. McIntyre eventually left the hospital.<p>

When the detectives inspected McIntyre's car in the hospital parking lot, they saw a large amount of blood on the passenger side seat and door. They also observed an empty black knife sheath on the driver's side floor. The car was then impounded.<p>

During their investigation, police discovered that earlier on the night of January 10, Coppola had been visiting some friends. McIntyre showed up soon after and the two had a fight. Just before 10pm, the two left the party arguing. <p>

McIntyre was arrested on January 11.<p>

After he was arraigned, McIntyre's friend Jill Monroe turned over a knife to police. She said that in the early morning hours after the stabbing, McIntyre came to her home and told her that he was in trouble. Monroe said McIntyre washed off blood from a knife he had and left the knife at her home. An analysis of the knife revealed traces of blood and fibers consistent with the sweater Coppola was wesaring when she was stabbed. The knife also fit the sheath found in mcIntyre's car.<p>

Prosecutors also will try to introduce evidence that Coppola obtained a temporary restraining order against McIntyre in 1993. The order lapsed two weeks later when Coppola and McIntyre did not show up for a  final hearing.<p>

And in January 1994, McIntyre was arrested and charged with assault and battery against Coppola. The prosecutors in that case alleged that Coppola reluctantly testified, wanted the case dismissed and minimized the entire incident. McIntyre was acquitted and he continued his relationship with Coppola.<p>


<h3>The Defense Case</H3>

The defense contends McIntyre did not kill Coppola. The defendant is expected to stick to his story that he was shopping for drugs when Coppola was stabbed. The defense also is expected to argue that Coppola's dying declaration cleared McIntyre<p>

<H3>The Key Testimony</H3>


Anthony Riggs was fatally shot in March 1991, less than two weeks after returning home from military service during Operation Desert Storm. The crime was viewed by many as a brutal irony -- Riggs, 22, had survived the war but not the streets of Detroit. The Rev. Jesse Jackson accompanied Toni Cato Riggs to her husband's funeral and his eulogy included a plea to stop the violence.<p>

A week after the funeral, Cato Riggs was arrested after her brother Michael told police that his sister hired him to kill Riggs. The motive was to collect $150,000 in life insurance. He was eventually convicted of the actual shooting and sentenced to life in prison.<p>

The charges against Cato Riggs were dismissed on technical grounds, and it would be more than two years before authorities, armed with new evidence, again would arrest her for murder.<p>

The main evidence during the trial were video and audiotapes in which Cato Riggs told undercover agents, posing as drug kingpins, of her involvement in her husband's death.<p>

After collecting the insurance money, she allegedly got involved in the drug business. In April 1992, she went to Texas with Reginald Gilbert-Rey and Rosita De La Paz to pick up 10 kilograms of cocaine, according to federal authorities. Cato Riggs decided to return home early to take a college exam but her partners were arrested.<p>

De La Paz told Drug Enforcement Administration agents about Cato Riggs, and agents in Detroit subsequently were tipped off about her desire to continue in the drug business despite the close call in Texas. After she unwittingly contacted an informant, DEA agents set up a meeting in a Detroit-area apartment on February 23, 1993.<p>

The agents, posing as leaders of a high level narcotics ring, told Cato Riggs that if she wanted to work for them as a drug courier she had to be honest about everything. It was then that she began to tell them about her husband's death.<p>

During the meeting, Cato Riggs said that when she and her brother went to Ft. Bliss in Texas to meet her husband upon his return from the Persian Gulf, Michael Cato said, "if we do this there's no turning back."<p>

"I know," Cato Riggs responded.<p>

Prosecutors claimed she lured her husband back to Detroit when he didn't want to come. The couple had a history of marital problems and he was planning to grant her a divorce. Cato Riggs told the agents she knew her brother was waiting outside their grandmother's house on the night Anthony Riggs was killed.<p>

During a second meeting on March 28, 1993, Cato Riggs allegedly put out a $10,000 contract for the murder of one of the witnesses in the case. She told DEA agent Richard Crock that she wanted Antonio Shelby "eliminated period. No coming back, no nothing."<p>

The prosecution believed she wanted Shelby dead because he was a potential witness against her. He testified that he lent his gun to Michael Cato several hours before Riggs was shot.<p>

During the trial, defense attorney Anthina Siringas tried to show Cato Riggs was bullied into making the incriminating admissions in order to impress the agents she thought were tough drug dealers. Agent Crock admitted that even though he was running a narcotics operation, he planned to ask Cato Riggs about the murder. She brought up the fatal shooting before he could put his plan into action, he said.<p>

The defense attorneys previously argued the statements were not admissible because Cato Riggs was not read her Miranda rights. But the judge ruled the tapes could be played for the jury because it was part of a separate undercover investigation in which Cato Riggs' rights to have a lawyer present did not apply.<p>

<H3>The Key Testimony</H3>
<b>July 19</b><br>
Several witnesses testified the defendants' fingerprints were not found at the crime scene. But Blades's prints were found in the victim's car.<p>

Memphis police officer <b>Phil Nason</b> said he processed the Fisher house on the day of the murder and did not find any prints. He said he went back the next day and found some partial prints on the banister, a picture frame and a table.<P>

<b>Paulette Sutton</b>, a serologist, said she went to the Fisher house on the day of the murder and found blood everywhere. She said the different blood patterns on the walls, ceilings and floors showed a tremendous struggle had taken place. She said patterns from the victim's bloody hair on the wall indicated she was dragged from room to room; blood spatters on the ceiling showed a bloody knife was being wielded through the air; and a gap in a blood trail showed she was trying to stop the bleeding as she moved through the house. The struggle took place in several rooms. Blood was in the master bedroom on the second floor, on the staircase, in most of the rooms on the first floor.<p>

Sutton said she removed blood samples and sent them to an FBI lab. She did not give the results of the tests. But neither of the defendants' blood was found at the house and one drop of blood matching no one was found.<p>

<b>Bruce Holbrook</b> said he dusted the Fisher's station wagon and found several fingerprints inside and outside the car and on a Palmolive bottle inside the vehicle.<p>

And finally, Andre Nagoski said the prints found in the station wagon matched Blades. He said none of the prints matched Tate. He also said partial prints found at the Fisher home did not match the defendants or any of the Fishers.<p>

<b>July 20</b><br>
Jurors heard from the victim's family, a jail house informant and about the connection between one of the defendants and the victim's son.<p>

<b>Thomas Zimmer</b>, a National Insurance Crime Bureau special agent, testified that Fisher's car was not hot-wired. He said someone unsuccessfully tried to hot-wire and "jimmy" it. Zimmer noted that the only way the car could have been stolen was with the keys -- suggesting the car thief took the keys after killing Fisher. The car was found near the home of the defendants.<p>

The next witness, <b>Al Bond</b>, a neighbor of Blades, said he saw the defendant on the day of the murder walking away from the area where Fisher's car was found. Bond said Blades was carrying a bag similar to Fisher's. Bond said he saw Blades again later that night and that Blades told him he had come up with some money.<p>

Although Bond was a key witness for police early in the investigation, he wasn't very cooperative with prosecutors in court. He originally told police Blades told time he got $150 from a bag that was in a green Taurus. But on the witness stand, Bond said he could not remember where Blades said he got the money or how much he got. Prosecutor Jerry Harris had to cross-examine his own witness by showing his earlier statement and pointing out inconsistencies with his testimony.<p>

On cross-examination, Blades's attorney pointed out that several people walked past Fisher's car that day. Bond said his brother even got arrested for looking in the car. The defense admits Blades was in the car but only after it was abandoned near his house.<p>

Tate's lawyer asked Bond whether he saw Blades with Tate that day. Bond said no, adding Blades and Tate rarely were seen together.<p>

<b>Andrew Johnson</b> was even more uncooperative with prosecutors. He said his earlier statement to police was bogus because he was high on drugs. But the statement was allowed into evidence and was potentially devastating to Blades.<p>

In March of 1995, Johnson told police he saw Blades driving Fisher's station wagon on the night of the murder. In his statement, Johnson said Blades came to his house later that night. He was shaking and nervous and asked for $50. He said his sister's house caught on fire. And he left with another black male in a dark green station wagon.<p>

But on the witness stand, Johnson said he never saw Blades get in the station wagon. He said he had been smoking and shooting dope for four days straight when police questioned him. He said the police mentioned something about cutting down his jail time on another charge and then shoved a picture of the station wagon in his face. Prosecutor Harris pointed out that Johnson signed his name on the back of the picture and wrote, "this is the car I saw Rodney in."<p>

<b>Keith Summerville</b> then offered incriminating testimony against Blades. In the summer of 1995, Summerville was in jail for violating probation and selling drugs. In the holding tank, while waiting to be booked, he met Blades. Summerville said Blades confessed to the murder but wasn't worried because all police had on him was his fingerprints in Fisher's car. <p>

According to Summerville, Blades described the killing: he said they went in through a side door and "one tied the black lady and one was down the stairs with the white lady." He said he slapped her around and asked where the money was and then stabbed her.<p>

Summerville got absolutely nothing in return for his statement. He served his entire sentence. When asked why he ratted on Baldes, Summerville, who lives with his grandmother, said "that could have been my grandparents."<p>

<b>Hubert Fisher</b> cried on the witness stand as he described his wife of 25 years and the mother of his two children. It was through his testimony that jurors learned of the link between the couple's son, Adrian, and Tate. Fisher told the jury that Adrian, 21, had been stealing money from him to support a $250-a-day cocaine habit. He said Adrian went into the family safe and took $9,000 in savings bonds, a $7,0000 Rolex watch and a $1,000 gold chain.<p>

Fisher said he began suspecting his son was taking the money and that he  had a drug problem when he found a bag of white powder in his bedroom. Meanwhile, Adrian began hanging around kids from Klondyke, a run-down drug-ridden neighborhood in north Memphis. One of them was Tate. He once saw Adrian and Tate in his house, where Adrian was arguing with his mother to give him some money. Fisher said he saw Tate three other times in Tate's neighborhood.<p>

<b>Adrian Fisher</b> confirmed for jurors that during the year before his mother's death, he was a hopeless cocaine addict, who cruised the north Memphis drug hangouts and stole thousands of dollars from his parents.<p>

Fisher said he tried to hide his wealth when he hung out in the Klondyke section of Memphis "because that would make me look like a spoiled brat, which I am." He said, "I wasn't trying to let anyone know because that would put my mother's life in jeopardy."<p>

But he cruised around in a red Ford Bronco and told at least two friends about his parents' safe in the upstairs closet. He admitted that he started a friendship with Tate. But he could not remember whether he told Tate about the safe. The two were arrested in 1994 for possession of marijuana.<p>

The witness eventually completed a rehabilitation program and moved to a halfway house in Minneapolis to continue his treatment. He did not go back to Memphis until his mother died. <p>

On cross-examination, Tate's attorney Glenn Wright pointed out that Adrian Fisher had several black friends who came with him to his house. He got the witness to admit that he told people other than Tate about the family safe. Wright asked Adrian to describe several kids from the neighborhood who he knew or had befriended. Some of them were short and young -- 15 or 16-years-old. This is important because one witness described two short, black kids of that age at the Fisher house on the day of the murder. Besides, there was blood found at the murder scene which did not belong to the victims or the defendants. Tate's attorneys contend the state has the wrong man -- just because Tate was friends with Adrian does not make him a  murderer.<P>

<b>July 22</b><br>
The jury saw Leester Redmond, the maid who survived the attack, identify Blades and Tate as the men who fatally stabbed Fisher. But the defense scored some points when a DNA expert testified that several samples taken from the crime scene did not match either victim or the defendants.<p>

<b>Dennis Benjamin</b>, a Memphis police officer, testified that on March 1, 1995, he went to an abandoned house where Blades was staying. He handcuffed Blades and searched the house. He found two sports jackets belonging to Fisher's husband, a bag that belonged to Fisher and the owner's manual to her car in a trash can.<p>

Benjamin also said he later interviewed Keith Summerville, who told the police officer that Blades confessed to him at the jail. Benjamin said Summerville was not the typical jail house informant. He said Summerville did not ask for or receive anything in exchange for his information. Summerville previously testified that he went to authorities because he felt sorry for the victims.<p.

It was through the testimony of Sheriff's Deputy <b>Ronald Goodwin</b>
that the videotaped deposition of Redmond was introduced into evidence. On the tape, Redmond identified Blades and Tate. She said they knocked on the door, came inside, argued with Fisher and then slugged her. Redmond said she reached for the phone but the assailants grabbed her arm and demanded to know where the family safe was kept. She said she grabbed another phone but one attacker tried to tie her up with it and then dragged her down the stairs. But Redmond escaped and ran out the door. She went  to a neighbor's house to call for help.<p>

Defense attorneys were able to cross-examine Redmond during the deposition. But Tate had different lawyers back then, so his current attorneys did not and will not have a chance to question Redmond.<p>

On cross-examination, Blades's attorney established that Redmond could not even remember her own age. The defense theory is that Redmond is too old and senile to be a credible witness.<p>

Redmond has changed her story several times. She sometimes said there were two attackers; she sometimes said there were three. During the deposition, she said police showed her only two pictures -- those of Tate and Blades. But several police officers insisted they showed her six different pictures. In the deposition, she said she was just getting home when the attackers came to the house. But in police statements, she said she was doing the dishes.<p>

<b>Police officer E.R. McCommon</b>testified that he showed Redmond six photographs, from which she picked out Tate and Blades.<p>

Redmond's niece <b>Janeth McChristian</b> was present at the deposition. She said police were very fair when they talked to her aunt and did not tell her who to pick out in the photos. But the defense again showed that Redmond does not know how old she is. Redmond said she was 74, but McChristian said Redmond is actually 94 years old.<p>

<b>Dr. Harold Deadman</b>, a DNA expert formerly with the FBI, said he did DNA tests on blood samples taken from the crime scene. None of them matched the defendants. In fact, three samples belonged to someone other than the defendants or the victims. "Someone is bleeding in that house other than these four individuals," he said.<p>

<b>July 23</b><br>
Prosecutors rested their case after calling the medical examiner, <b>Gerry Francisco</b>. He testified that Emily Fisher was stabbed so many times he lost count after 50. 

<p><b>The Defense Case</B><br>
Both defendants chose not to testify. Tate did not call any witnesses. Blades presented several witnesses to explain why his fingerprints were found in Emily Fisher's car.</P>

<p><b>Haywood Walter, Grace Montgomery</b> and <b>Sandra Leverson</b> live in the Klondyke area where Fisher's car was found. They all said it was not unusual to find abandoned cars parked on the street. The defense theory is that kids in the neighborhood stole Fisher's car and that Blades merely found it abandoned in the street.</P>

<p>Leverson said she saw the car parked on the street from February 28 to March 1. Her testimony contradicts a prosecution witness who testified that he saw Blades driving the car on the night of February 28.</P>

<p><b>Gaylor King</b> and <b>John Williams</b> testified that they were with Blades February 28. They said Blades' sister's home burned down and they drove around in a white chevette. This testimony helped support Blades' claim that he was not driving Fisher's station wagon that night.</P>

<P>The defense's final witness <b>Dr. John Huttson</b>, a clinical psychologist, testified that Redmond was not competent to testify as a witness. Huttson was originally hired by the prosecution to determine Redmond's competence. But the defense capitalized on his opinion that the woman suffers from severely impaired short term memory. Hutton said Redmond could not remember her age and what time of the year the attack took place and other basic facts. He also said she had a tendency to latch onto ideas -- accurate or not -- and stick to them even when confronted with logical inconsistencies.</P>

<p><b>Closing Arguments</b><br>
Both sides were extremely impassioned. Prosecutor Jerry Harris got choked up as he talked about the horror of what happened to Fisher. Tate's attorney Glenn Wright bellowed that Tate and Blades are victims of a rush to judgment by the state. Blades attorney Loyce Lambert vehemently insisted that the state was trying to take the easy way out by charging her client with murder.</P>

<P>Prosecutors argued that they met their burden of proof by introducing Blades' fingerprints in Fisher's car, a jail house informer who said Blades admitted to the murder, and Redmond's taped deposition.</P>

<P>But Lambert argued it was too much of a stretch to conclude that Blades is a killer just because his prints were found in Fisher's car. As for the jail house informer, Lambert dismissed him as a common criminal looking for a deal. She told jurors to disregard Redmond's videotaped deposition, saying she was senile, confused and  couldn't even remember her own age. She said Blades is a "rogue" and a "petty thief," but not a murderer.</P>

<P>Wright accused prosecutors of charging Tate with the murder and then looked for ways to make their allegations stick. </P>

<P>Wright reminded jurors he was not there to defend Blades, pointing out that no evidence connects Blades to Tate. No one saw them that day, and no fingerprints of Tate were found in Fisher's car.</P>

<p>In the state's rebuttal, Harris asked jurors not to dismiss Redmond's deposition because of her age, reminding them that she, too,  is a victim. He went to great length to explain away the blood found in the house, which matches neither the victims or the defendants.</P>

<p>He ended by suggesting that Tate repeatedly stabbed Fisher in the head to assure she died. Harris argued that the one who did that was thinking, "she's not dead and she knows me."</P>

<p><b>July 24</b><br>
In the first day of deliberations, the jury acquitted George Tate and Rodney Blades on all charges.

<h2>The Federal Government and the Death Penalty</h2>

Between 1972, when the Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia struck down the death penalty as then applied and the end of 1993, Congress enacted four death penalty statutes:<P>

<UL>
<LI>(A) Any person engaging in working in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise, or any person engaging in an offense punishable under section 841 (b) (1) (A) or section 960 9b) (1) who intentionally kills or counsels, commands, induces, procures or causes the intentional killing of an individual and such killing results, shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment, which shall not be less than 20 years and which may be up to life imprisonment, or may be sentenced to death; and (B) any person, during the commission of, in furtherance of, or while attempting to avoid apprehension, prosecution or service of a prison sentence for, a felony violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter who intentionally kills or counsels, commands, induces, procures, or causes the intentional killing of any Federal, State or local law enforcement officer engaged in, or on account of, the performance of such officer's official duties and such killing results, shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment, which shall not be less than 20 years, and which may be up to life imprisonment, or may be sentenced to death (21 U.S. C. 848(e)).

<LI>Espionage by a member of the Armed Forces: communication of information to a foreign government relating to nuclear weaponry, military spacecraft or satellites, early warning systems, war plans communications intelligence or cryptographic information, or any other major weapons or defense strategy (10 U.S.C. 906 (a)).

<LI>Destruction of aircraft, motor vehicles, or related facilities resulting in death (18 U.S.C.32-34).

VERIFIED PETITION


The Petition of ROBERT T. JOHNSON shows as
follows:


1. Petitioner is the District Attorney of Bronx County,
responsible for representing the People of the State of
New York in criminal prosecutions in Bronx County.

2. Respondent George E. Pataki is the Governor of the
State of New York. Respondent Pataki issued Executive
Order 27 (Exhibit 1) which instructs respondent Vacco
to supersede petitioner in the criminal prosecution
concerning the murder of New York City Police Officer
Kevin Gillespie.

3. Respondent Dennis C. Vacco is the Attorney General
of the State of New York. Respondent Vacco is
instructed by Executive Order 27 to supersede petitioner
in the criminal prosecution concerning the murder of
New York City Police Officer Kevin Gillespie.

THE MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE STATUTE

4. On March 7, 1995, the New York State Legislature
enacted a comprehensive set of statutes concerning
"Death Penalty -- Imposition and Procedures --
Assignment of Counsel." See 1995 N.Y. Laws, c. 1. This
statutory framework has been codified under various
provisions of New York Law. See, e.g. Penal Law
Sections 60.06, 125.27(1); CPL Sections 250.40, 400.27,
470.30; Judiciary Law Section 35-b; Executive Law
Section 63-d.

5. The statute requires the court to impose, upon a
defendant's conviction of Murder in the First Degree,
one of three possible sentences: imprisonment,
imprisonment for life without parole, or death. See Penal
Law Section 60.06. New York State law had not
previously permitted courts to sentence those convicted
of murder in the first degree to imprisonment for life
without parole or to death.

6. Under the statute, a court cannot impose a sentence
of death unless "the people file with the court and serve
upon the defendant a notice of intent to seek the death
penalty," see CPL Section 250.40(1), and further
provides that any such notice is to be filed within "one
hundred twenty days of the defendant's arraignment
upon an indictment charging the defendant with murder
in the first degree." See CPL Section 250;40(4).

7. The notice may be withdrawn at any time (thereby
eliminating the penalty of death as a sentencing option);
however, once withdrawn, the notice may never be
reinstated. See CPL Section 250.40(2).

8. Notwithstanding the notice provision, the People
may, at any time during the criminal action, determine
that the death penalty shall not be sought, in which case
the penalty may not be imposed. See CPL Section
400.27(1).

9. The statute specifies the circumstances under which
the Attorney General can enter a prosecution where "the
defendant may be subject to the penalty of death." See
Executive Law Section 63-d.

10. The statute makes no provisions about how a district
attorney is to determine whether to seek the death
penalty.

11. The Executive Memorandum, Sponsor
Memorandum, and legislative history that accompany the
statute are silent about how a District Attorney is to
exercise his or her discretion to seek the death penalty.

12. Respondent Pataki signed the statute into law on
March 7, 1995.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

13. On March 7, 1995, petitioner, Robert T. Johnson,
issued a press release (Exhibit 2) in which he expressed a
number of concerns he had about the death penalty and
stated that "it is my present intention not to utilize the
death penalty provisions of the statute." Petitioner made
no statement about how he intended to deal with any
particular case in the future.

14. On November 2, 1995, petitioner was re-elected as
the District Attorney of Bronx County, New York,
receiving 89% of the vote. He originally had been elected
to the office in 1988 and was re-elected in 1991.

15. On December 19, 1995, Michael Vernon was
accused of killing five individuals in a shoe store in The
Bronx.

16. On December 20, 1995, respondent Pataki wrote to
petitioner stating that he had been informed that
petitioner did not intend to seek the death penalty in the
case, and asking "whether that determination was based
on a review of the specific facts in the exercise of your
professional discretion or reflects a policy decision not to
seek the death penalty in any case in Bronx County"
(Exhibit 3).

17. On December 20, 1995, petitioner declined to seek
the death penalty in the prosecution of Mr. Vernon,
responding to respondent Pataki, "I intend to meet my
constitutional and professional responsibility ... by
exercising my statutory discretion to seek a term of
incarceration of life imprisonment without the possibility
of parole" (Exhibit 4).

18. On December 20, 1995, respondent Pataki accepted
petitioner's decision with "grave reservations," noting, "I
am concerned that the laws of the state of New York may
not be so executed" (Exhibit 5).

19. On March 14, 1996, New York City Police Officer
Kevin Gillespie was  murdered in a shootout on the
Grand Concourse in The Bronx. Dressed in plain clothes,
Officer Gillespie and his partner came upon an apparent
carjacking, and attempted to arrest the perpetrators.
Officer Gillespie was gunned down while trying to effect
the arrest, and died a short time later.

20. On March 15, 1996, police officers arrested three
men in connection with the  brutal murder of Officer
Gillespie. One of the men was Angel Diaz, who has been
identified as the killer of Officer Gillespie.

21. On March 19, 1996, respondent Pataki wrote to
petitioner (Exhibit 6):

The facts developed to date have indicated that the case
is one in which the death penalty seems particularly
warranted: the crime was coldblooded, and the alleged
murderer has three prior felony convictions, two for
violent crimes, and was involved in yet another robbery
spree when he ruthlessly took Officer Gillespie's life.

The death penalty is the law in New York State and was
intended to apply in just the sort of circumstances
presented by the murder of Officer Gillespie....

I cannot permit any District Attorney's personal
opposition to a law to stand in the way of its
enforcement.... I must have your assurance that you do
not have a policy against seeking the death penalty....

I must ask the following question: are there
circumstances under which you will seek the death
penalty in Bronx County?

22. In this letter, respondent Pataki instructed petitioner
to answer his question by 1:00 p.m. the next day.

23. On March 20, 1996, petitioner responded (Exhibit
7):

The death penalty is no more the law of New York than
is the penalty of life without parole. The statute in no
way suggests that a sentence of death is the "better" or
"presumptive" choice....

I have not taken a "position in opposition to the death
penalty." Rather, I have enumerated concerns highlighted
by personal experiences about the use and application of
this option.

And, as you certainly know, my original statement --
made over a year ago, and repeated many time since and
still unchanged -- left the door ajar, however slight, to
exercise this option in The Bronx....

You know that by making the death penalty
discretionary the Legislature was giving District
Attorneys another tool, not an order to use it....

Because I wanted my constituents to know my concerns
about the death penalty option before they cast a vote to
re-elect me, you have seen fit to impose deadlines and
ultimatums on me ... and to ask me a question which you
have apparently not asked a single other District
Attorney....

Be assured, if you need to hear it, I will fully comply
with the oath and obligations of my Office.

24. On March 21, 1996, respondent Pataki issued
Executive Order 27, directing respondent Vacco to
supersede petitioner in the prosecution of the killers of
Officer Gillespie.

25. Respondent Pataki explained that he was acting
pursuant to Article IV, Section 3 of the New York
Constitution (which obliges the governor to take care to
ensure that the laws are faithfully executed) and
Executive Law Section 63(2) (which provides that the
attorney general shall, whenever required by the
governor, appear in the supreme court or grand jury for
the purpose of prosecuting a criminal action specified in
the requirement; and, that in such a case, the district
attorney exercises only those powers and duties required
of him by the attorney general). See N.Y. Cons. Art. IV
Section 3; Executive Law Section 63(2).

26. In Executive Order 27, respondent Pataki explained
that he was "compel[led]" to supersede petitioner because
the district attorney has adopted an "impermissible policy
not to seek the death penalty in any case," and because
petitioner had "refused expressly" to answer respondent
Pataki's questions concerning this alleged policy.
Respondent Pataki asserted that petitioner had violated
his "obligation to make informed, reasoned decisions on
a case-by-case basis," and had failed to establish "either
an internal review committee or guidelines for assessing
whether to seek the death penalty." Respondent Pataki
also reiterated that the instant case was one "in which the
death penalty is particularly warranted."

27. The executive order also provides, in accordance
with Executive Law Section 63(2), that all expenses
incurred by respondent Vacco in relation to the
prosecution are chargeable to the County of Bronx.

28. As of the date of respondent Pataki's issuance of
Executive Order 27, no indictment had been handed
down concerning the murder of Officer Gillespie.

29. As of the date of respondent Pataki's issuance of
Executive Order 27, no findings had been made
concerning the form or nature of the legal representation
and expert services to be provided to any of the
defendants, and no request for assistance had been made
by the District Attorney. See Executive Law Section 63-
d.

30. At a televised press conference on March 21, 1996,
respondent Pataki repeated his position that Mr. Diaz
should be sentenced to death for the murder of Officer
Gillespie.

31. On March 21, 1996, petitioner issued a statement
that although he disagreed with respondent Pataki's
decision to supersede him, and intended to challenge that
action in court, he was "putting those differences aside
while I work together with [respondent Vacco] in the
interests of justice" (Exhibit 8).

32. According to published reports, respondent Vacco
has expressed strong opinions in support of the
application of the death penalty in certain cases.

33. By an indictment filed on April 16, 1996, the Grand
Jury of Bronx County accused Angel Diaz of two counts
of Murder in the First Degree and related offenses;
accused Jesus Mendez of Murder in the Second Degree
and related offenses; and accused Ricardo Morales of
Murder in the Second Degree and related offenses
(Indictment Number 2483/96).

34. Defendants' arraignment is scheduled for April 30,
1996, in Part A-1 of the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, Bronx County.

35. For reasons fully set forth in the accompanying
memorandum of law, petitioner asserts that Executive
Order 27 is an unprecedented exercise of the governor's
superseder power; impermissibly substitutes respondent
Pataki's policy regarding the death penalty in place of the
policy duly chosen by the legislature; impermissibly
disenfranchises the independent executive power of
petitioner, an elected, constitutional officer;
unconstitutionally punishes petitioner for exercising his
First Amendment rights; denies petitioner the equal
protection of the laws; and, makes an impermissible end
run around the specific commands and policy concerns
enunciated in Executive Law Section 63-d.

36. No previous application for the relief herein prayed
for has been made.

37. An order to show cause is sought rather than
proceeding by notice of petition because such petition on
notice cannot, as per CPLR Section 7804(c), be made
returnable prior to the next scheduled adjourned dab in
this proceeding, and moreover, the petition contains
issues of grave import which require resolution as
expeditiously as possible.

WHEREFORE, petitioner respectfully requests that this
Court issue an order directing respondent Pataki and
respondent Vacco to show cause why an order should not
be entered herein in the form of mandamus, pursuant to
CPLR Article 78, to compel respondent Pataki to refrain
from enforcing Executive Order 27; in the form of
prohibition, pursuant to CPLR Article 78, to prohibit
respondent Vacco from acting under the order, pursuant

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF BRONX

ROBERT T. JOHNSON, as District Attorney of Bronx
County,

Petitioner.

- against -

GEORGE E. PATAKI, as Governor of the State of
New York, and DENNIS C. VACCO, as Attorney
General of the State of New York,

Respondents.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Pursuant to Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution
and Executive Law Section 63(2), the Governor has
ordered the Attorney General to appear in the Supreme
Court of Bronx County and its Grand Jury for the
purpose of prosecuting crimes arising from and related
to the killing of Police Officer Kevin Gillespie.

Article IV, Section 3 provides that the Governor "shall
take care that the laws are faithfully executed." N.Y.
Cons. Art. IV, Section 3. Executive Law Section 63 sets
forth the general duties of the Attorney General, and
Executive Law Section 63(2) provides that the Attorney-
General shall, whenever required by the Governor,
appear in the supreme court or grand jury for the
purpose of prosecuting a criminal action specified in the
requirement; in such a case, the District Attorney
exercises only those powers and duties required of him
by the Attorney General. Executive Law Section 63(2).

Executive Order 27 must be invalidated. It is an
unprecedented exercise of the governor's superseder
power; impermissibly substitutes respondent Pataki's
policy regarding the death penalty in place of the policy
duly chosen by the legislature; impermissibly
disenfranchises the independent executive power of
petitioner, an elected, constitutional officer;
unconstitutionally punishes petitioner for exercising his
First Amendment rights; denies petitioner the equal
protection of the laws; and, makes an impermissible end
run around the specific commands and policy concerns
enunciated in Executive Law Section 63-d.

A. This Court has the Power to Grant the Requested
Relief

This is an action brought to obtain a declaration that
Executive Order 27 is unconstitutional, see CPLR
Section 3001, to obtain relief in the nature of mandamus
to compel the Governor to refrain from acting on the
order, see CPLR Section 7803(1), and to prohibit the
Attorney General from acting under the order, see
CPLR Sections 6301; 7803(2). In short, Executive Order
27 must be declared an unconstitutional arrogation of
power by the Governor; the Governor must be
compelled to abandon enforcement of this order and all
attempts to enforce it must be prohibited; and the
Attorney General, as designee directed to enforce this
order, must be enjoined from further compliance with it.

CPLR authorizes the declaratory judgment action in
New York, allowing the court to declare "the rights and
other legal relations of the parties to a justiciable
controversy." CPLR Section 3001. This action is
properly invoked to attack unconstitutional and otherwise
illegal acts of the Governor. see, e.g., Klostermann v.
Cuomo, 61 N.Y.2d 525 (1984) (remedies of declaratory
judgment and mandamus available in actions by mental
patients in state institutions whose constitutional and
statutory rights have been violated by failure of state to
provide appropriate residential placement); Matter of
Fullilove v. Carey, 62 A.D.2d 798 (3d Dept. 1978),
aff'd, 48 N.Y.2d 826 (1979) (declaring executive order
providing that all state contractors undertake affirmative
action programs, to be an unwarranted and unauthorized
exercise of legislative power by the Governor and
therefore "unconstitutional and unenforceable"); Rapp v.
Carey, 58 A.D.2d 918, 919 (3d Dept. 1977), aff'd. 44
N.Y.2d 157 (1978) (declaring executive order to be
void, unconstitutional, and unenforceable, and further
declaring that "no persons covered by the Executive
Order need comply with such Order"); Morgenthau v.
Erlbaum, 59 N.Y.2d 143 (1983) (declaratory judgment
available to challenge the propriety of an interlocutory
order in a criminal proceeding even though a writ of
prohibition pursuant to CPLR Section 7803 was not).

Coercive remedies, such as a writ of mandamus to
compel, lie against the Governor and may be employed
in conjunction with the declaratory judgment. See
County of Broome v. Cuomo, 102 A.D.2d 266 (3d Dept.
1984) (affirming lower court's judgment directing
Governor to comply with State Law Section 10), aff'd,
64 N.Y.2d 1051 (1985); see also County of Fulton v.
State of New York, 76 N.Y.2d 675 (1990) (mandamus
lies to direct state to pay local real estate taxes);
Klostermann, 61 N.Y.2d at 539 (writ of mandamus lies
in conjunction with declaratory judgment).

Nor can there be any doubt that the remedies of
prohibition and injunction lie against respondent Vacco
on these facts. See Matter of Schumer v. Holtzman, 60
N.Y.2d 46 (1983); Matter of Johnson v. Collins, 210
A.D.2d 68 (1st Dept. 1994); Ithaca Journal News v. City
Court of Ithaca, 58 Misc. 2d 73 (Sup. Ct., Tompkins
County 1986).

Finally, as the elected representative of the people of
Bronx County, the District Attorney has standing to
assert their rights in this matter as well. See Matter of
Brodsky v. Zagata, 165 Misc. 2d 510, 511 (Sup. Ct.,
Albany County 1995).

In sum, in the context of an application for a judgment
declaring executive action invalid, together with
ancillary injunctive relief, the courts' jurisdiction to
resolve disputes relating to the proper scope of the
executive power is unquestioned. See Bourquin v.
Cuomo, 85 N.Y.2d 781, 784-85 (1995); Clark v. Cuomo,
66 N.Y.2d 185, 186-87, 189-90 (1985); see also CPLR
Section 3017(b).

B. The Governor's Present Use of the Superseder
Power Embodied in Executive Law Section 63(2) is
Unprecedented.

No New York governor has superseded a district
attorney in a criminal prosecution based on a
disagreement over whether to seek a particular sentence.
No New York governor has superseded a district
attorney where there was no fundamental question as to
the district attorney's capacity and willingness to
prosecute a defendant for the appropriate crime and to
obtain a valid judgment of conviction. These historical
facts place in stark relief the radical nature of the
Governor's action.

Prior governors used the power of superseder in
extraordinary circumstances, where there was proof that
the district attorney harbored a fundamental inability or
unwillingness to perform the duties of the office. See,
e.g., Dondi v. Jones, 40 N.Y.2d 8, 15-16 (1976)
(superseder used, to investigate corruption in
enforcement of law and administration of criminal
justice by County officers); In Re B. Turecamo
Contracting Co. v. Bennett, 260 A.D. 253, 254 (2d Dept.
1940) (superseder used to investigate misconduct in
enforcement of law in Kings County), lv. denied, 259
A.D. 1094 (1940); Berger v. Carey, 86 Misc. 2d 727,
728 (Sup. Ct., Suffolk County 1976) (district attorney
superseded "for a particular purpose and at his own
request").

For over one-hundred years, governors have
understood the need to use superseder power judiciously
and appropriately. Governor Flower recognized the
"radical nature" of the superseder power which should
be "conservatively exercised"; he thus opined that the
district attorney should be superseded only where his
"integrity or ability" had been impugned. 1894 Public
Papers of Governor Flower 597-98, 613.[1]

Governor Smith stated in 1919 that the power of
superseder "should be exercised ... only when the
Governor is satisfied beyond question that the interest of
the public demand such exercise, and when the Governor
is satisfied beyond question that the district attorney is
either disqualified or is wil[l]fully neglecting to perform
his duty, or is guilty of corrupt or illegal conduct." 1919
Public Papers of Governor Smith 331. Governor
Franklin Roosevelt underscored that intervention was
appropriate only when allegations of wrongdoing were
specific and reliable: "action by state authorities must be
predicated on definite allegations relating to local
misgovernment and on definite allegations relating to the
failure of local investigations." 1930 Public Papers of
Governor Roosevelt 375.

Governor Dewey remarked that the "action displacing a
local official, particularly an elected one, by a state
representative is not to be resorted to unless there is
compelling evidence that the existing agencies are not
performing or are incapable of performing their proper
functions." 1945 Public Papers of Governor Dewey 369.

In this case, the Governor superseded the District
Attorney solely on the grounds that he believed that the
District Attorney's public statements and acts indicated
an unwillingness to seek a specific sentencing option.
This unprecedented action creates a fault line between
present and past uses of the superseder, and demands the
interest and scrutiny of all New Yorkers.

C. The Governor's Executive Order Impermissibly
Substitutes His Own Policy Regarding the Death Penalty
in Place of the Statutory Scheme Set Forth by the
Legislature.

The Governor's order should be invalidated because it
is an impermissible intrusion on the exclusive power of
the legislature to enact and establish legislation.

In Mulroy v. Carey 43 N.Y.2d 819 (1977), the Court of
Appeals upheld an Appellate Division opinion which
itself upheld an executive order made pursuant to
Executive Law Section 63(2), superseding the district
attorney with the attorney general for the purpose of
investigating improprieties in obtaining public offices
and contracts in Onondaga County. See Mulroy, 43
N.Y.2d at 821, affirming, 58 A.D.2d 207 (4th Dept.
1977).

The Court, however, expressly declined the concurring
justice's invitation to declare that no restrictions of any
kind limited the governor's power to supersede the
district attorney, and in fact expressed "no view" as to
whether "in any and all circumstances" the executive
power to supersede an "elected District Attorney" would
be beyond judicial correction. See Mulroy, 43 N.Y.2d at
821.

The instant order presents a situation where judicial
correction is warranted, because it marks the case as one
in which the Governor is creating law rather than
enforcing it. As the discussion below will prove, here,
the Governor has invented legal obligations for the
District Attorney which are contrary to the express
obligations set forth in the first-degree murder statute,
and then used noncompliance with these nonexistent
obligations to accuse the District Attorney of
wrongdoing and remove him from the case. Such an
exercise of unbridled power, with its accompanying
intent to direct the outcome of future first-degree
murder prosecutions throughout the state, comes at the
direct expense of the legislature, and must be checked by
the judiciary.

An examination of the Governor's order shows that the
Governor's "reason" for superseding the District
Attorney is so hollow as to be no reason at all. The
Governor explains that he is "compel[led]" (p. 4) to
supersede the District Attorney because the District
Attorney has adopted an "impermissible policy not to
seek the death penalty in any case," and because the
District Attorney has "refused expressly" to answer the
Governor's questions concerning this alleged policy (p.
3). More specifically, he notes that the District Attorney
has violated his "obligation to make informed, reasoned
decisions on a case-by-case basis" (p. 2). Particularly
notable is the Governor's observation that the District
Attorney has never "asserted that he has established
either an internal review committee or guidelines for
assessing whether to seek the death penalty" (p. 4). Also
disturbing is that the order labels the instant case as one
"in which the death penalty is particularly warranted" (p.
3), notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Governor
issued the order, no defendant had yet been indicted for
first-degree murder.

While the purpose of a memorandum of law should not
be to convince this Court that the Governor has
misconstrued the public statements and private sentiments
of the District Attorney, it must nevertheless be made
clear that the District Attorney of Bronx County has
never stated that he would never, under any
circumstances, file a notice of intent to seek the death
penalty.2 Instead, he has repeatedly stressed that he will
abide by his oath of office, which requires him
"faithfully to prosecute a person charged with the
violation in his county of any [offense]." See N.Y. Cons.
Article 13, Section 13; County Law Section 700.
Furthermore, it bears noting that not even the Governor
has suggested that the District Attorney did not intend to
prosecute the defendants for the appropriate crimes;
rather, the Governor's action appears to be self-justified
by his opinion that the District Attorney is unwilling to
consider a specific sentencing option.

One galling irony requires special attention. The
Governor's executive order insinuates that the District
Attorney has a blanket policy against seeking the death
penalty; that is, that the District Attorney will not
consider seeking the penalty on a case-by-case basis (p.
2). Obviously, as support for this conclusion, the
executive order lists that the District Attorney
"precipitously announced" that he would not seek the
death penalty in a December 1995 prosecution and six
other prosecutions (p. 2). The Governor's analysis is
self-defeating: if the District Attorney actually had a
blanket policy against seeking the death penalty, there
would be no need to "announce" (precipitously or
otherwise) his intent to seek it in any given case. The
exercise of particularized decisions cannot possibly be
evidence of the existence of a blanket policy, and the
governor's reliance to the contrary disproves his own
argument. Further, it is equally ironic that, while the
executive order decries the speed with which past
announcements not to seek the death penalty were made,
the Governor gives as a reason for superseder that the
District Attorney has refused to answer (in a manner
deemed acceptable by the Governor) a question designed
to elicit a decision in the instant murder case far in
advance of the one-hundred and twenty day deliberative
period provided by the legislature. See CPL Section
250.40(2).

The crux of the Governor's impermissible policy-
making is found in his recitation that the first-degree
murder statute "requires that District Attorneys
determine whether to seek the imposition of the death
penalty after making informed, reasoned decisions on a
case-by case basis" (p. 2). While undoubtedly most
district attorneys (including the District Attorney of
Bronx County) will follow such a practice, it is
inaccurate to say that the statute "requires" such a
process, when it plainly says nothing about how the
decision is to be made. In addition, the Governor's order
contains a host of subsidiary policy-related dictates which
are troubling: his zeal to label cases death penalty cases
even before an indictment has been obtained; his decision
to make a District Attorney's fitness for prosecution
contingent on the Governor's belief as to what sentencing
option the District Attorney will or will not seek; his
demand that a District Attorney publicly announce his
intentions with respect to the sentencing option, even
before an indictment has been obtained3; and, his
intimidating venture into the internal workings of the
office of the District Attorney, a venture which is
embedded in his implicit call for an "internal review
committee or guidelines."

Any one of these "reasons" for superseding the Bronx
District Attorney could be labeled an impermissible
foray into legislative policy making; taken together,
however, only one conclusion is possible: that the
Governor seeks to use the power of his office to impose
on prosecutors throughout the state his beliefs as to the
appropriateness of the death penalty, both in general, and
in any given case.4  By superseding the District Attorney
based on policy considerations wholly foreign to the
relevant legislation, the Governor has exceeded his
powers. See Broidrick v. Lindsay 39 N.Y.2d 641, 645-
46 (1976) (governor may not create policy under the
guise of enforcement); Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1,
9, 12 (1987) (executive branch may not use its authority
as a license to correct whatever societal evils it perceives,
and may not execute legislation in such a way as to act
solely upon the executive's own ideas of sound public
policy).

Taken as a whole, the Governor's "reasons" amount to
one super-policy which the Governor clearly would like
to see added to the first-degree murder legislation: that
the penalty of death should presumptively be sought in
every first-degree murder case, or at least in every first-
degree murder case involving the killing of a police
officer; and that the presumptive nature of the
punishment should lead prosecutors to declare their
intention to seek the penalty at the earliest possible point
in time, perhaps even before the suspect has been
indicted for capital murder.

Contrary to the purpose and effect of the Governor's
instant executive order, nothing indicates that the first-
degree murder legislation intended to give the Governor
the power to direct the discretion of the district
attorneys, or to require the district attorneys to engage in
any particular process (or any process at all) with respect
to implementation of this sentencing option. To the
contrary, before the statutes were enacted, one of the
chief legislative sponsors of the first-degree murder bill,
Assemblyman Vitaliano addressed the concern that
"district attorneys in the City of New York have spoken
that they are against the death penalty," by answering
that "nothing ... obliges a district attorney to seek the
death penalty under this bill." See N.Y. Assm. Rec. A.
4843, at 413-14 (colloquy of Ms. Clark and Mr.
Vitaliano). The clear import of these words is that
nothing obliges a district attorney ever to seek the death
penalty.

In keeping with Assemblyman Vitaliano's opinion, no
statute passed by the legislature explicitly or implicitly
requires the prosecuting attorney to make an informed,
reasoned, case-by-case decision whether to seek the death
penalty. The Governor's discussion of the need for an
"internal review committee or guidelines" (p. 4) is even
farther from any arguable legislative decree. The
Governor is faulting the District Attorney for failing to
perform an act which the legislation neither requires him
to do nor expects him to do.

Indeed, to the extent that the legislation expresses any
preference for "seeking" the death penalty, the
preference is clearly a negative one. The authorized
punishments for first-degree murder are a sentence of
death, life imprisonment without parole, or a term of
imprisonment. See Penal Law Sections 60.06; 125.27; No
preference for the death sentence is expressed. To the
contrary, the preference implied is otherwise because,
unlike any other penalty, the district attorney must
timely file a written notice of an intent to seek the death
penalty before it can ever be imposed. Further, while
this notice can be withdrawn at any time, once
withdrawn, it can never be reinstated. See CPL Section
250.40; see also CPL Section 400.27(1) ("nothing. . shall
be deemed to preclude the people at any time from
determining that the death penalty shall not be sought in
a particular case"). None of these provisions are required
to be in a "death penalty statute," yet each-presents a
substantial obstacle to the "seeking" of the death penalty.

In addition, once the death sentence is imposed, the
statute continues its negative preference: the Court of
Appeals is given plenary interest of justice jurisdiction to
reverse the sentence. See CPL Section 470.30(1)
(granting to Court of Appeals power, normally vested
only in intermediate appellate courts, to reverse sentence
in the interest of justice pursuant to CPL Section
470.15); see also Correction Law Section 655 (giving
governor power of reprieve).

In sum, the "death penalty statutes" are silent as to the
means by which this sentencing option is chosen, and
repeatedly insistent that it may be abandoned at any time,
and without any enunciated reason.5

The legislature could have included in the first-degree
murder statutes the obligation that district attorneys must
make informed, reasoned, case-by-case decisions about
whether to seek the death penalty on the basis of specific
factors (indeed, the legislature could have limited the
district attorney's discretion and required that the death
penalty must be "considered" in every possible case).6
The legislature has, in the past, exercised its power to
direct the form and content of discretionary acts related
to sentencing; however, such an exercise of legislative
power is clear and forthright. See, e.g., Penal Law
Section 70.02(2)(c)(i) (upon conviction for certain
offenses, court must impose indeterminate sentence or a
definite sentence of at least one year, unless court finds
"on the record" that sentence would be unduly harsh, and
that alternative sentence is "consistent with public safety
and does not deprecate the seriousness of the crime");
Penal Law Section 70.06(7), CPL Section 410.91(3)
(court may sentence certain defendants to parole
supervision instead of term of imprisonment, upon
making certain specified findings); CPL Section
210.40(1), (3) (directing that trial court, before
dismissing a count of an indictment, or the indictment
itself, must "examine and consider, individually and
collectively" a set of ten listed factors, and, further, that
it "must set forth its reasons therefor upon the record").

Similarly, the legislature could have mandated that
district attorney state reasons for seeking the death
penalty either in general, or in a particular case, or both.
The legislature could also have directed that district
attorneys establish an "internal review committee or
guidelines" to make such decisions. Instead, the
legislature simply presented the death penalty as a single
sentencing option, while at the same time surrounding it
with provisions which serve as practical barriers to its
selection, regardless of whether or not the option is
considered in an informed, reasoned, case-by-case basis;
regardless of whether the district attorney formulates or
expresses any office policy as to the death penalty; and,
regardless of whether the District Attorney creates an
internal review committee.

For his part, the Governor is strictly prohibited from
using Executive Law Section 63(2) to engraft a new
policy upon that of the legislature. See Broidrick v.
Lindsay, 39 N.Y.2d 641, 645-56 (1976) (while executive
is accorded flexibility in determining the proper methods
of enforcing legislative policy, a flexibility which varies
according to the nature of the problem to be remedied,
governor may not create a different policy under the
guise of enforcement); see also Rapp v. Carey, 44
N.Y.2d 157, 163 (1978) (where it would be practicable
for the legislature itself to set precise standards, the
executive's flexibility is and should be quite limited); see
generally Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1, 9, 12 (1987)
(executive branch may not use its authority as a license to
correct whatever societal evils it perceives).

Indeed, the instant executive order is readily
distinguishable from the one recently upheld by the
Court of Appeals for the exact reason that the latter did
not "formulate a specific policy" or assume a
"substantive content." See Bourquin v. Cuomo, 85
N.Y.2d 781, 787 (1995); see also People ex rel. Saranac
Land & Timber Co. v. Extraordinary Special and Trial
Term of Supreme Court. 220 N.Y. 487, 491-92 (1917)
(noting that the executive proclamation creating special
trial terms is permissible because it did not attempt to
direct any specific outcomes, but simply created a forum
for review).

The Governor is employing Executive Law Section 63(2)
to create at least one, or more, specific policies which the
legislature did not include in its enactments. Moreover, it
seems clear that the Governor's ultimate goal is to
establish the death penalty as the presumptive punishment
for first-degree murder cases.7  The Governor's use of
Executive Law Section 63(2) to achieve these objectives
is impermissible and must be invalidated.

A final note is warranted concerning the Governor's
assertion in his executive order that superseder is
necessary because he seeks to avoid the possibility that
future sentences of death would be invalidated as
"disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar
cases" (p. 2). This proportionality argument is given
separate treatment here because, on its face, it appears to
be a legitimate reason for superseder: certainly one
district attorney could not be permitted to dismantle an
entire statutory scheme, any more than one governor
could be permitted to create one. When scrutinized,
however, the governor's proportionality argument
proves without foundation.

First, no defendant has been convicted of first-degree
murder, and no death penalty has been imposed
anywhere in the state. There is no assurance that a court
or a jury will ever impose the sentence, or that an
imposed sentence would, notwithstanding any
proportionality claim, withstand direct of collateral
review by state or federal appellate courts.

Second, while the statute calling for proportionality has
never been interpreted, it would appear that its prime
objective is to ensure proportional treatment across
racial lines. See CPL Section 470.30(3)(b).[8] Racial
fairness being the only enumerated factor, it is
premature for the Governor to assume that even a
"blanket policy" against the death penalty existing in
some counties will become a factor in this analysis.
Indeed, the fact that a local district attorney may elect to
extend mercy to first-degree murderers would seem
fundamentally unrelated to the concept of proportionality
and to the legislature's call for proportional treatment in
"similar cases." See CPL Section 470.30(3)(b).[9] Ex
ante, there is reason to believe that the concept of
proportionality will, within the meaning of New York
law, not take cognizance of a district attorney who
refuses to seek the death penalty. For example,
proportionality could apply only to counties which have
not excluded themselves from seeking the death penalty.
This result seems likely given not only the legislature's
negative inference against the imposition of the death
penalty generally, but also the express statement by one
of the legislation's chief sponsors, that nothing in the
laws obligates a district attorney to seek the death
penalty. See N.Y. Assm. Rec. A. 4843, at 413-14.

Third, recent reports indicate that any proportionality
argument would face grave independent obstacles
because no organization is tracking the total number of
eligible murder offenses. See Edward A. Adams, No
Data Kept on All Eligible Capital Cases. N.Y. Law J.,
April 1, 1996, at 1, colt 3. While any analysis of the
proportionality issue is premature, it would seem certain
that a proportionality-based attack on the first-degree
murder statute would, almost by definition, involve a
statistical analysis of the sentences imposed in eligible
cases. In that it appears that no reliable data is being
gathered to permit this analysis, the Governor's concern
about proportionality passes from the premature into the
fanciful. If the Governor were primarily concerned with
proportionality, his first step would not be to supersede a
local district attorney, but, rather, it would be to
establish an apparatus to gather useful data. Thus, while
the Governor's proportionality argument may have some
superficial appeal, it proves, upon analysis, to be weak
and speculative.10

In conclusion, it cannot be doubted that the Governor
has invested a great deal of effort into bringing the death
penalty back to New York. See, e.g., 1995 Governor's
Annual Message to the Members of the Legislature, cited
in McKinney's Session Law News of New York, April
1995, No. 1, at A-27 ("As for criminals who commit the
ultimate crime, the crime of murder, they should expect
to be punished by the ultimate sanction, the death
penalty"); see also Executive Memoranda accompanying
L. 1995 c. 1, cited in McKinney's Session Law News of
New York, April 1995, No. 1, at A-35 ("For eighteen
years the legislature overwhelmingly supported capital
punishment.... That long journey is now over").
Unfortunately for the Governor, the "long journey" has
not ended at the place where the Governor believes it
has. Now, this Court must correct the Governor's view
of the first-degree murder statutes by protecting the
accuracy of the statutes actually enacted into law.

D. The Governor's Executive Order Impermissibly
Invades the Independent Executive Power of the District
Attorney, an Elected, Constitutional Office.

The judiciary is bound to enforce the balance of power
between the branches of government. See, e.g., Bourquin
v. Cuomo, 85 N.Y.2d 781 (1995). It should be similarly
bound to enforce the balance of power between
independent executive sub-branches, namely between the
governor (a constitutional, elected officer) and the
district attorney (a constitutional, elected officer).

Therefore, even if this Court determines that Executive
Order 27 does not wrongfully impinge on the legislative
prerogative, it should nevertheless invalidate the order
on the ground that it violates the independence of the
District Attorney. Cf. Mulroy v. Carey, 43 N.Y.2d 819,
821 (1977) (declining to hold that Executive Law Section
63[2] imposes no limits on the governor's power to
supersede a district attorney).

A brief history of the powers of the attorney general
and of the district attorney will show the district
attorney's evolution from an appendage of the attorney
general into a freestanding office of independent power;
simultaneously, it will show the rise of restrictions on the
power of the attorney general to engage in criminal
prosecutions and, necessarily, on the power of the
governor to direct the attorney general to supersede the
district attorney pursuant to Executive Law Section
63(2). The conclusion to be reached is inescapable: as an
elected, constitutional officer, the district attorney
possesses a zone of independence which the governor
must respect, and which the courts must protect.

1. The historic powers of the attorney general

In ancient England, the attorney general, as the
representative of the sovereign, possessed the exclusive
power to prosecute criminal offenses. In the English
colony of New York, the attorney general was modeled
on the English office, and was designated by the English
governor. People v. Kramer, 33 Misc. 209, 213 (Ct. of
Gen. Sessions, New York County 1900).

New York State's first constitution, enacted in 1777,
made no provision for an attorney general, although the
office was filled upon an appointment by the
constitutional convention. Thus, as of 1777, the attorney
general was the only officer who could represent the
People in prosecuting crime in the State of New York.
The attorney general remained the sole state officer
assuming the common law role of the People's
representative in criminal prosecutions until 1796. Id., at
213-14.

The first forerunner of Executive Law Section 63(2) is
found in the Laws of 1796, which created the office of
assistant attorney general to relieve the attorney general
of the obligation of personally attending all criminal
prosecutions in the State of New York (L. 1796 c. 8).
Specifically, the Legislature provided for the
appointment of assistant attorneys general to take charge
of prosecutions in districts outside New York City, and
namely in prosecutions in the courts of oyer and
terminer and general sessions.11 Kramer, 33 Misc. at
214. The attorney's general personal attendance could
nevertheless be required by the governor, or by a judge
of the supreme court. Kramer. 33 Misc. at 214 (citing L.
1796 c. 8). It has been observed that the assistant
attorney generals were the "prototype" of the later-
created district attorneys. Their powers in no way
detracted from the plenary power of the attorney
general. Kramer, 33 Misc. at 214; see also People v.
Tru-Sport Pub. Co., Inc., 160 Misc. 628, 637, 639 (Sup.
Ct., Saratoga County 1936) (the rise of the office of
district attorney is traceable as the outgrowth of the early
offices of assistant attorney general; historically, district
attorney is an assistant to the attorney general; attorney
general has not been shorn of any ancient powers).

The office of the district attorney was created by statute
in 1801 (L. 1801 c. 146). Kramer. 33 Misc. at 214. As
before, the law provided that the "person administering
the government of this State, or any judge of the
supreme court" could compel the attorney general's
personal appearance notwithstanding the attendance of
the district attorney. Kramer' 33 Misc. at 214 (quoting
L. 1801 c. 146). In such a situation, the function of the
district attorney was to aid the attorney general in
prosecuting the case. Kramer, 33 Misc. at 215. See
generally Tru-Sport. 160 Misc. at 637-39 (the
establishment of the office of district attorney is
traceable to the growth of population and the
development of settlement and industry throughout the
far flung portions of the state; fundamentally, the district
attorney is a state officer, performing a state function
within the district or county, and taking the place of the
attorney general, upon whom at the outset these duties
have been laid) (citing Spielman Motor Sales Co., Inc., v.
Dodge. 295 U.S. 89, 92 [1935]).

The 1801 statute continued to evolve, but did not
fundamentally change.12   In 1951, Executive Law of
1951, Article V, Section 63(2) was enacted (L. 1951 c.
800). This section remains in force today, unchanged
since 1951.

2. The creation of the district attorney as a
constitutional officer

The office of the district attorney was first
constitutional) recognized in 1821. The constitution
mandated that district attorneys be appointed by the
county courts, rather than appointed by the governor.
See N.Y. Cons. 1821 Article 4 Section 8; Robert M.
Pitler, Superseding the District Attorneys in New York
City-- The Constitutionality and Legality of Executive
Order No. 55, 41 Fordham L. Rev. 517, 520 (1973);
Lawrence T. Kurlander and Valerie Friedlander,
Perilous Executive Power-- Perspective on Special
Prosecutors in New York. 16 Hofstra L. Rev. 35, 42
(1987). Certainly, providing for the district attorney's
appointment by the court, rather than by the governor,
marks the first separation of power between the district
attorney and the governor (along with the attorney
general), and represents the beginning of the district
attorney's independence from the governor and the
attorney general.

The constitution of 1846 provided for the election of a
district attorney, but made no mention of the office's
duties or powers. See N.Y. Cons. 1846 Article 10
Section 1; Kurlander, p. 42; Kramer. 33 Misc. at 214-15.
Relatedly, the Constitution of 1846 made the attorney
general an elected, state-wide official, and expressly
provided that the office should have the duties then in
effect. Kurlander and Friedlander, supra. at 42-43;
Kramer. 33 Misc. at 21315.

Initially, courts considered the constitutional status of
the district attorney to be meaningless; in other words,
notwithstanding his constitutional status, the district
attorney remained an appendage of the attorney general,
in whom the plenary power to prosecute all crimes still
resided. See, e.g., People ex. rel. Gardenier v. Board of
Supervisors of the County of Columbia. 134 N.Y. 1, 5
(1892) (the fact that the office of the district attorney has
become a constitutional one "adds nothing to the nature
and extent of [its] powers"); People v. Brennan, 69 Misc.
548, 548-49 (Kings County Ct. 1910) (attorney general
has retained all of that office's common law powers).

In a series of cases in the 1940s, however, the power of
the attorney general to prosecute crimes, as identified in
Executive Law Section 63(2), came to be interpreted in a
different manner. The attorney's general power was seen
to be dormant; it could not be self-activated, and waited
upon the governor's activation through Executive Law
Section 63(2). Moreover, once called upon, the attorney
general wielded not the common law plenary power, but
instead only the authority conferred by the governor's
order. See, e.g., People v. Goonan, 265 A.D. 973 (2d
Dept. 1942); People v. Hopkins, 182 Misc. 313, 314-17
(Ct. of Gen. Sessions, New York County 1944); People
v. Dorsey, 176 Misc. 932, 937-38 (Queens Count Ct.
1941); Matter of Cranford Material Corp., 174 Misc.
154, 158-60 (Sup. Ct., Kings County 1940).

The inevitable conclusion followed: the attorney
general's common law powers were abrogated, limiting
that office to its constitutional and statutory powers. In
the criminal realm, the attorney general could extend
those powers only as specifically directed by the
governor and the legislature; the plenary power of the
attorney general as an agent of the sovereign was now
extinguished. See People v. Goldswer, 78 Misc.2d 910,
913 (Schoharie County Ct. 1974) (power of attorney
general to prosecute any criminal offense in any court
has been specifically restricted by statute, and may be
exercised only when the conditions precedent as
described in the legislation are fulfilled); see also
Dorsey, 176 Misc. at 938 (powers of attorney general
are only those granted by state constitution and
enactments of legislature); Additional Jan. 1979 Grand
Jury of the Albany Supreme Court v. Doe. 50

N.Y.2d 14, 18 (1980) (grant of authority to attorney
general pursuant to Section 63[2] extends only to those
matters set forth in the governor's order); Dondi v.
Jones. 40 N.Y.2d 8, 19 (1976) (same).

Necessarily, the district attorney became the beneficiary
of the attorney general's loss of power. See, e.g., Matter
of Cranford, 174 Misc. at 159 (noting that there is no
longer any general legislative recognition of any assistant
relationship of the district attorney to the attorney
general). Notably, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
has abandoned the view that the attorney general's
historical common law powers over district attorneys has
survived the creation of the district attorney as an
independently elected, constitutional officer.
Pennsylvania v. Schab, 477 Pa. 55, 383 A.2d 819, 822
(1978) ("It would be incongruous to place the district
attorney in the position of being responsible to the
electorate for the performance of his duties while actual
control over his performance was, in effect, in the
Attorney General.")

Presently, the Constitution provides for the election,
term of office, grounds and procedure for removal, and
oath of office for the office of district attorney. See New
York Constitution Article 13 Sections 1, 13. The County
Law charges the district attorney with the duty to
prosecute crimes within the jurisdiction of the county for
which he or she has been elected. See County Law
Section 700, 927.

3. The district attorneys zone of independence

While courts have noted the elected, constitutional status
of the district attorney, see, e.g., Drake v. City of
Rochester, 96 Misc. 2d 86, 94 (Sup. Ct., Monroe County
1978), aff'd, 74 A.D.2d 996 (4th Dept. 1980), the
office's independent status has never been precisely
delineated. Still, a number of cases indicate that the
district attorney possesses a zone of independence which
must be respected by the governor and protected by the
courts.

First, Mulroy v. Carey, 43 N.Y.2d 819 (1977), affirms
that the district attorney may state a claim for relief in
challenging the governor's superseder order (even
though the claim was rejected in the case). See Mulroy,
43 N.Y.2d at 821. The district attorney's ability to state a
claim proves that the office is no longer simply an
appendage of the attorney general. If the district attorney
possessed no independent powers, he would not have had
the right to sue to protect them. Second, Mulroy is
significant because it expressly mentions the "elected
District Attorney." Mulroy, 43 N.Y.2d at 821 (emphasis
added). While saying no more on the matter, the Court's
recognition of the district attorney as an elected
representative of the county is a tacit, albeit undeveloped,
acknowledgment of independence.

A number of other cases also point to the district
attorney's autonomy as derived from his status as an
elected constitutional officer. In People v. Jackson. 48
N.Y.S.2d 401 (Kings County Ct. 1944), the court
invalidated as unconstitutional a statute which provided
that an assistant district attorney would assume the duties
of office since the district attorney had left the county
for military service. Jackson, 48 N.Y.S.2d at 404-06.
The court found that the statute impermissibly sought to
create a second office of district attorney, an act
prohibited by the constitution's provision for only one
district attorney per county. The court further noted that
the powers and duties inhered in the office itself, to be
performed by the one chosen for that purpose under the
constitutional authorization. See Jackson, 48 N.Y.S.2d at
405 06. Similarly, in People ex rel. Eldred v. Palmer,
154 N.Y. 133 (1897), the court declared unconstitutional
a law which retroactively altered the term of office of an
already elected district attorney, noting, "it would be
contrary to all precedent that the electors should not be
advised, before casting their votes, of the duration of the
term of the officers to be elected," and further noting
that the legislature was prohibited from shortening the
length of term of an elected, constitutional officer under
circumstances "wholly foreign" to the "true interests" of
the electorate. See Eldred, 154 N.Y. at 139. Both these
cases indicate that the district attorney's independence
springs from this constitutional status, and from the "true
interests" of his or her constituency. Both of these
decisions cast light on the significance of Mulroy's
attachment of the word "elected" to the office of the
district attorney.

The case of People ex rel. Wogan v. Rafferty, 208 N.Y.
451 (1913) is distinguishable from the instant one, in that
it involves a power struggle between the county clerk, an
elected constitutional officer, and the legislature;
however, its analysis is highly relevant to the instant
power struggle between the district attorney, also an
elected constitutional officer, and the governor. Rafferty
held that the legislature had impermissibly deprived the
county clerk of his office by providing for the
appointment of a "deputy" who in fact acted as chief
clerk. See Rafferty. 208 N.Y. at 455, 462. In dicta, the
Court noted that the legislature was without power to
"infringe[] upon the constitutional mode of appointment,"
because in such instance, "the constitutional provision for
a choice by the electors would be completely nullified."
The Court further asserted that this conclusion was not
altered by the fact that the powers of the office (as with
the district attorney) were not enumerated in the
constitution. See Rafferty 208 N.Y. at 456-57, 459, 461-
62 (quoting Warner v. People ex rel. Conner. 2 Denio
272, 281 [1845]). As with the cases cited in the preceding
paragraph, Rafferty makes clear that an office's
constitutional status confers upon it powers which must
be recognized and protected. Further, the case stands for
the principle that where the constitution establishes a
specified office, or recognizes its existence and
prescribes the manner in which it shall be filled, the
office is necessarily endowed with a special status -- a
zone of independence -- which cannot be blithely
disregarded. See Rafferty. 208 N.Y. at 456.

4. The concomitant interest of the people of The Bronx

Of course, the district attorney's status as an elected,
constitutional office does not exist in itself and for itself.
Indeed, any incursion onto the powers of the district
attorney is a similar incursion into the interests of the
electorate, interests which similarly must receive
deference and protection. This conclusion is brought
forth by Eldred, 154 N.Y. at 136, 139 (legislative branch
may not abridge term of elected constitutional office in a
manner "wholly foreign" to the "true interests of the
electorate"), and by Rafferty. 208 N.Y. at 459
(legislature is without power to nullify constitutional
provision for choice by electorate), and is further
developed here.

The right to vote is the right to vote effectively. See
Williams v. Rhodes. 393 U.S. 23, 30 (1968). If the
district attorney has no independence, if he or she may
prosecute a case only at the whim of the governor, then a
vote for the district attorney is, ultimately, an empty
exercise. This cannot be the case. See Kramer v. Union
Free School District. 395 U.S. 621, 629 (1969) (once
state determines that certain public officers will be
chosen by electors, their right to vote must be protected
against unlawful incursions); Powell v. McCormack, 395
U.S. 486, 547-48, 550 (1969) (holding that house of
representatives was without power to exclude duly
elected representative and noting that it is a fundamental
right of the people to choose who should govern them);
N.Y. Cons Article I Section 1 ("no member of this state
shall be disenfranchised").

Obviously, the governor is an elected official, and the
state-wide voters for the office of governor must be
afforded deference. However, the preference of those
voters cannot override the authority of the district
attorney without at least some degree of deference to the
voters for this local office. See Pennsylvania v. Schab,
383 A.2d at 822 ("to countenance such a separation of
accountability and control undermines self-government")
(citing Pennsylvania v. Fudeman, 396 Pa. 236, 152 A.2d
428 [1959]).

5. The courts' duty to protect the district attorney's
zone of independence

Given that a constitutional, elected officer-holder
possesses independent powers, and given that the office
may sue in court to protect those powers, it becomes
clear that any litigation between the governor and the
district attorney must be treated, to some degree, as a
contest between similarly situated powers. Given that the
district attorney is protected by a zone of independence,
it follows that the governor's power to intrude must
necessarily be limited and subject to review by the
courts.

As mentioned above, if the judiciary will not enforce
the balance of power between independent executive sub-
branches, then the district attorney's zone of
independence would be meaningless.

ID this context, analysis of the Court of Appeals
decision in Mulroy not to adopt the concurring opinion
of Judge Cooke becomes critical. In his concurrence,
Judge Cooke opined that, "there is no warrant for our
restriction of the scope of legislation in a manner that
would thwart the constitutional and statutory policy or
engraft restrictions on the executive department where
none exist," and indicated that court-intervention would
only be appropriate where, because of exigent
circumstances, the political process was rendered unable
to "combat an abuse of the governor's power." Mulroy,
43 N.Y.2d at 822-23. Clearly, the Court declined to
adopt this reasoning as the law of the state. As such,
although some courts have used extremely broad
language, declaring that the district attorney may be
superseded "when the governor believes such action is
warranted," see Berger v. Carey, 86 Misc. 2d 727, 728
(Sup. Ct., Suffolk County 1976), such expressions are
clearly not precise statements of law. Cf. Matter of
Guden v. Dike. 171 N.Y. 529, 536 (1902) (whether
sheriff should be removed from office "rest[s] solely
upon the governor").

The only possible conclusion is that the governor's
power to supersede the district attorney pursuant to
Executive Law Section 63(2) is limited and subject to
judicial review. The question, then, is what limits, and
what standard of judicial review of those limits, must be
applied. Cf. In Re Di Brizzi, 303 N.Y. 206, 215-16
(1951) (governor's exercise of power upheld where
there exists "reasonable relation" between action directed
by governor and the proper discharge of the executive
function); In Re B. Turecamo Contracting Co. v.
Bennett. 260 A.D. 253, 258 (2d Dept. 1940) (superseder
appropriate where district attorney's conduct was
"reasonably called into question"), lv. denied. 259 A.D.
1094 (1940); Pennsylvania v. Schab, 383 A.2d at 823-24
("in view of the fact that the District Attorney is
statutorily and constitutionally responsible for law
enforcement at the local level ... the Attorney General
must establish good cause for the supersession").

Rather than attempting to identify a precise standard of
review, it might be best to suggest one with which no
reasonable person could disagree: that the governor must
have an objective reason for superseding the district
attorney which is grounded on the failure of the district
attorney to faithfully discharge the duties of office, and
that the lack of such a reason will serve as a basis for the
judicially to invalidate the superseder.

A stark example will prove the point: the governor
could not supersede a district attorney merely because
the district attorney was a member of a different political
party. Such an act would lack a motive which could be
explained or defended in intelligence or by common
human experience. Such an act would transgress even the
least exacting demand for order and the rule of law. A
governor acts lawlessly when he or she intrudes upon the
district attorney's zone of independence based on a
whim, caprice, or personal conviction which is
unsupported by objectivity. See generally, Rapp v.
Carey, 44 N.Y.2d 157, 162 (1978) (noting that there are
limits to the breadth of executive power, and that where
power is delegated to one person the power must always
be guided and limited by standards); accord In Re
Shelley, 332 Pa. 358, 364-65, 2 A.2d 809, 812-13 (1938)
(nominally absolute power of attorney general to
supersede the district attorney may be abused; attorney
general must exercise discretionary powers "upon the
foundation of reason, as opposed to prejudice, personal
motivations, caprice or arbitrary action").13  See also
Pennsylvania v. Schab, 383 A.2d at 822. More
importantly for our purposes, while superseder for the
above-stated "reason" might violate any number of laws,
it must also be true that the superseder order itself would
be invalid.

A potential rebuttal to this line of argument is that the
court lacks the power to evaluate the reasoning of the
governor; that is, the court could look to the effect of an
executive order, but not its cause. See, e.g., Berger, 86
Misc. 2d at 728 (governor may supersede district
attorney whenever "the governor believes such action is
warranted"). Such rebuttal is really nothing more than an
argument that no limits are imposed upon a governor's
actions in the first instance. Moreover, investigation into
the stated purpose of the governor's action would be the
necessary first step of any review, regardless of what
standard of review will be applied to determine if that
purpose and the resulting actions are a valid exercise of
power. Cf. Di Brizi, 303 N.Y. at 215-16 (where Court
looked to purpose of governor's order to evaluate its
validity).

Indeed, in a Court of Appeals case cited in Judge
Cooke's dissent, the Court was careful to note that the
purpose, and not just the effect, of a governor's
executive order will determine its validity. See People ex
rel. Saranac Land & Timber Co. v. Extraordinary
Special and Trial Term of Supreme Court, 220 N.Y. 487
(1917). In Saranac, the governor appointed a special trial
court to hear and decide motions for new trials (and to
preside at any subsequent trials) in realtor actions.
Rejecting the plaintiffs claim that this order supplanted
the judicial function and nullified various civil statutes,
the Court noted that the order "makes no attempt to
control the action of the court ... [i]t merely creates a
term at which there will be an opportunity for a
hearing.... The power of the judge who sits in judgment
is not affected by executive... decree." See Saranac, 220
N.Y. at 489, 491-92. Clearly, the Court scrutinized the
governor's actions carefully to ensure no hidden or
impermissible purpose was at work. Such scrutiny would
similarly be necessary in a review of executive action
under Executive Law Section 63(2).

In the instant case, as discussed earlier in the context of
the governor's infringing on the legislative prerogative,
an examination of the Governor's order shows that the
Governor's "reason" for superseding the District
Attorney is so hollow as to be no reason at all. Rather,
the Governor is proceeding based on his version of the
first-degree murder law, and is implementing a policy
which cannot be justified by the statute.

The Governor's superseder order is thus not based on
objective reason, but merely on his incorrect
interpretation of what the law requires. Thus, even if this
Court determines that the executive order does not
infringe on the Legislature's exclusive powers or on a
specific legislative enactment, it should still invalidate the
order as wrongfully infringing on the District Attorney's
zone of independence.

E. The Executive Order Unconstitutionally Punishes the
District Attorney for Exercising his First Amendment
Rights and Denies him Equal Protection of the Laws.

A district attorney may not be superseded for
exercising rights guaranteed by the United States
Constitution, such as the First Amendment right to
freedom of expression. See Connick v. Meyers, 461 U.S.
138 (1983); Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S.378 (1987).

In its explanation of why the Governor has chosen to
replace the District Attorney, the Executive Order is
replete with references to public statements made by the
District Attorney,14 as well as references to the failure
of the District Attorney to issue certain statements in
response to questions propounded by the Governor. The
Executive Order also refers to various murder cases in
which the District Attorney has not sought the death
penalty, and the speed with which those decisions were
made, as establishing "facts" and "actions" that compelled
the Governor to supersede the District Attorney.
However, an examination of those "facts" and "actions"
reveals that they are a mere camouflage -- a device that
seeks to keep hidden from open view a previously
undiscussed goal of the Executive Order: to "chill" any
expression of opinion by elected district attorneys that
contravenes the opinion of the Governor.

The statements made by the District Attorney are
undoubtedly on a matter of grave and substantial public
concern, namely, the death penalty. Speech on matters of
public concern is that speech which lies "at the heart of
the First Amendment's protection." First National Bank
v. Belloth, 435 U.S. 765,776(1978). Moreover, nothing
could be of greater public concern than matters as to
which "free an open debate is vital to informed decision
making by the electorate." Pickering v. Board of
Education. 391 U.S. 563, 571-72 (1968). Here, there
can be no question that the District Attorney's statements
occupy the "highest rung of the hierarchy of First
Amendment values." Carey v. Brown. 447 U.S. 455,
466-67 (1980).

As a constitutionally elected officer, the District
Attorney's statements on the use of the death penalty as a
vehicle of criminal justice seek to inform his electorate
on a great issue of our time. They fulfill the highest
obligation of a candidate for elective office and of an
officeholder in a democracy. It is indeed difficult, if not
impossible, to envision speech that "more substantially
involved matters of public concern." Connick, 461 U.S.
at 152.

Moreover, the context in which the first statement to
draw the Governor's attention was made is significant.
See Connick 461 U.S. at 153. The District Attorney
made his initial pronouncement that he had no "present
intention" to utilize the death penalty only after the law
that authorized it was signed into law (March 7, 1995).
That year, 1995, was the year in which the District
Attorney was re-elected to his third term of office. The
death penalty option would be in effect during that term
of office. The use of that option was placed in the direct
control of the District Attorney (see CPL Section
250.40). Notwithstanding all those facts, the Governor
seeks to use unquestionably protected expression as a
basis for exercising the extraordinary power of
superseder. Even if a District Attorney could be
superseded for any reason or for no reason at all (but see
People v. Mulroy, 43 N.Y.2d 819, 821 [.1977] [declining
to hold that executive power to supersede an elected
district attorney is unbridled]), the superseder order
would be unlawful if it were issued, even in part because
the District Attorney exercised his constitutional right to
freedom of expression. See Rankin, 483 U.S. at 383-84.
This First Amendment protection could only be
overcome if the legitimate interest of the Governor in
insuring that the laws of the State are faithfully executed
(N.Y. Const. Art. 4, Section 3) struck a balance in favor
of the Governor. Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.

The reasons recited in the Executive Order, aside from
the statements of the District Attorney, which
purportedly justify the superseder are insufficient to
strike the balance in favor of the Governor. The order
recites that the law in question "requires that District
Attorneys determine whether to seek the imposition of
the death penalty ... on a case-by case basis," but points
to no specific statutory provision which prohibits a
different approach. The order claims that the District
Attorney has "a blanket policy not to seek the death
penalty." Yet, as has already been shown, such a
conclusion is based on surmise and conjecture. None of
the "facts" listed in the order establish that the cited
decisions were not made on a case-by-case basis. The
order accuses any district attorney who has such a
blanket policy of violating "his [sic] sworn obligation to
uphold the laws of this State." However, as has already
been shown, neither the laws of this State nor the District
Attorney's oath of office require that the decision as to
whether to seek the death penalty be arrived in the
manner ordained by the Governor. The examples of
murder cases in which the District Attorney has not
sought the death penalty provide no justification for the
Governor's order. The Governor refers to a total of
seven such cases ("the Vernon case" plus six others). In
none does the Governor reveal in which, if any, it was
"improper" not to seek the death penalty. His repeated
references to the number of and speed with which the
decisions were made as support for his belief of a
"blanket policy" is illogical. As mentioned above, a
"blanket policy" not to seek the death penalty would
obviate the need to announce decisions on such a case-by-
case basis; the speed of those decisions does not detract
from the fact that the District Attorney has, in each case,
decided and announced that the death penalty will not be
sought. Nor does the numerical fact that the District
Attorney has not sought the death penalty in seven out of
seven cases reveal anything of substance. As of the date
the Executive Order was issued (March 21, 1996), no
District Attorney in New York City had yet announced
an intention to seek the death penalty in any death penalty
eligible murder case.15  Yet, this District Attorney was
the only one threatened with superseder if his statements
were not modified to conform with the wishes of the
Governor. The only possible conclusion is that the
District Attorney has been singled out based on the
content of his speech. Since the Governor has seen fit to
supersede petitioner in this case based on the specific
content of petitioner's speech, it can be presumed that the
governor will similarly scrutinize other statements by
other district attorneys. In effect, the Governor's threat
and superseder has created a "Don't ask, don't tell"
policy over the sixty-two elected district attorneys of this
state. It is a policy in which those who do express
themselves on this issue in any manner contrary to the
Governor's views risk inquiry and superseder, while
those who remain silent apparently do not. When such a
policy does not promote a "compelling interest" of
government, it violates the First Amendment. See Able
v. United States' 880 F.Supp. 968, 973 (E.D.N.Y 1995).

In order to meet this need for a "compelling interest,"
the Governor's order recites that a blanket policy
"threatens the validity of death sentences imposed in
cases prosecuted in other counties, because [the law
codified as CPL Section 470.30(3)(b)] requires the Court
of Appeals to determine whether a sentence of death is
excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in
similar cases." However, neither the Executive Order
nor any other pronouncements by the Governor explain
how the District Attorney's statements regarding a
"present intention" not to use the death penalty and his
reasoned reservations over its use constitute a blanket
policy that threatens a future proportionality analysis.
Certainly, a speculative concern based on surmise cannot
constitute the kind of compelling governmental interest
that justifies an order superseding a district attorney that
"chills" First Amendment expression of the highest
magnitude, namely, speech by a candidate or elected
official that informs an electorate of his or her stand on
an issue of life and death that is directly within the
sphere of control of that official's office.

Moreover, it is clear that this Executive Order "chills"
only statements that express grave reservations about
seeking the death penalty, whereas it does not discourage
district attorneys from expressing contrary opinions, i.e.,
that they entertain no reservations about seeking the
death penalty. In this way, the order wrongfully
impinges on the District Attorney's right to equal
protection of the laws. See U.S. Cons. Amend. 14; N.Y.
Cons. Art. I Section 11. Thus, judicial review of the
Governor's order is governed by a strict scrutiny
standard because the executive action "impermissibly
interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right."
Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S.
307, 312 (1976). Therefore, the Governor is required to
show that the order is "tailored to serve a substantial
governmental interest." Police Department of the City of
Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99 (1972). See
generally Seaman v. Fedourich, 16 N.Y.2d 94, 102
(1965) (New York courts are vested with jurisdiction of
actions brought to vindicate equal protection rights,
rights which, under state law, are as broad as the federal
equal protection rights). The Governor's belief that there
exists a blanket policy not to seek the death penalty or
that such a policy violates a law fails to make the
required showing. Similarly, a belief that a blanket
policy would undermine all death sentences under this
State's proportionality statute is so speculative that it also
does not justify a policy discriminating against persons
who express their opinions in ways that do not agree
with the Governor's preferences for stating those
opinions. This form of punishment by superseder is
especially unjustified when the person discriminated
against is an elected official who is duty bound to inform
his electorate of his opinion on a matter of the highest
public concern: "'The office of public prosecutor is one
which must be administered with courage and
independence."' Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 423-
24 (1976) (quoting Pearson v. Reed, 6 Cal.App.2d 277,
287, 44 P.2d 592, 597 [1935]). This Executive Order
infringes upon constitutional rights and diminishes that
independence without advancing any substantial
government interest. Superseder should, therefore, be
prohibited.

By Using Executive Law Section 63(2) to Require the
Attorney General to Prosecute the Instant Case. the
Governor has Made an Impermissible End Run Around
the Specific Commands and Policy Concerns Enunciated
in Executive Law Section 63-d.

The Governor's executive order inexplicably, and
impermissibly, ignores Executive Law Section 63-d, a
provision enacted in 1995 as an integral part of the
legislative scheme which revived the death penalty in
New York, which is entitled, "Attorney-general; death
penalty prosecutions." See Executive Law Section 63-d.
This amendment to the existing Executive Law Section
63 governs entry by the attorney general into
prosecutions where the defendant may be subject to the
death penalty. Since it was drafted as an integral part of
the entire legislative scheme that enacted the death
penalty legislation, it must be read to define the extent to
which the attorney general is authorized to participate in
the prosecution of cases charging Murder in the First
Degree. Long recognized rules of statutory construction
compel this construction of Executive Law Section 63 as
amended by Chapter 1 of the Laws of 1995.

First, since the former Executive Law Section 63,
which did not expressly limit the attorney's general
participation in criminal prosecutions at the governor's
direction pursuant to Section 63(2), was specifically
amended by adding executive Law Section 63-d, the
purpose of the legislative amendment will be construed
"usually to make an old statute express and conform to a
more recent legislative intention ...." McKinney's
Statutes Vol. 1 Section 368 p. 536. Second, since Chapter
1 of the Laws of 1995 was a single piece of legislation,
albeit one that amended several different areas of the
consolidated laws, "[t]he different parts of the same act,
though contained in different sections, are to be
construed together as it they were all in the same section,
and the meaning of a single section may not be
determined by splitting it up into several parts."
McKinney's Statutes Vol. 1 Section 97 p. 216. Third, "all
parts of an enactment shall be harmonized with each
other as well as with the general intent of the whole
enactment, and meaning and effect given to all provisions
of the statute." McKinney's Statutes Vol 1. Section 98 pp.
220-21. When the language of Executive Law Section
63-d is viewed in the context of the death penalty
legislation, the legislative intent becomes absolutely
clear. When the charge is Murder in the First Degree,
the attorney general's authority to participate in the
prosecution is limited to assisting the elected district
attorney.

In language strikingly similar to Section 63(2), Section
63-d states that the attorney general shall, at the direction
of the governor and "after a request of the governor by a
district attorney" direct that the resources of the
department of law (whose head is the attorney general,
see Executive Law Section 60) be used to assist the
district attorney in a prosecution or appeal of "any case
where the defendant may be subject to the penalty of
death." See Executive Law Section 63d (emphasis added).
However, this statute conditions the grant of assistance on
the existence of either one of two circumstances: that the
defendant has been provided adequate resources for his
defense pursuant to Judiciary Law Section 35-b; or,
conversely, that the defendant has mustered so many
resources that his resources have become "substantially
greater" than those "reasonably available" to the district
attorney. See Executive Law Section 63d(1)(i-ii).

Thus, on its face, Executive Law Section 63-d indicates
that the attorney general may enter a prosecution where
the defendant may be subject to the death penalty either
because the defendant has enough resources so that the
presence of the attorney general and his attendant
resources will not overwhelm the defense (Executive
Law Section 63-d[1][i]); or, because the attorney's
general presence is necessary to balance the resources
which have tilted unfairly in favor of the defendant
(Executive Law Section 63-d[1][ii]). In either
circumstance, however, the attorney general can proffer
the resources of his office only if the district attorney
makes a request of the governor. See Executive Law
Section 63-d(1).

This point bears repeating: in a prosecution where the
defendant may face the death penalty, the attorney
general may enter only if the district attorney requests
his assistance. Since the district attorney in the instant
case has made no such request, the attorney general is
prohibited from entering. To this end, it bears noting
that the power of the attorney general to prosecute a
criminal case is strictly limited by statute. See People v.
Goldswer, 78 Misc. 2d 910, 913 (Schoharie County Ct.
1974) (power of attorney general to prosecute any
criminal offense in any court has been specifically
restricted by statute, and may be exercised only when the
conditions precedent as described in the legislation are
fulfilled); see also People v. Dorsey, 176 Misc. 932, 938
(Queens County Ct. 1941) (powers of attorney general
are only those granted by state constitution and
enactments of legislature); Additional Jan. 1979 Grand
Jury of the Albany Supreme Court v. Doe, 50 N.Y.2d
14, 18 (1980) (grant of authority to attorney general
pursuant to Section 63[2] extends only to those matters
set forth in the governor's order); Dondi v. Jones, 40
N.Y.2d 8, 19 (1976) (same). Further, the powers of the
governor are limited by the very laws he is bound to
enforce. See Rapp v. Carey, 44 N.Y.2d 157, 166-67
(1978) (noting that governor "has only those powers
delegated to him by the Constitution"). Thus, in the
instant case, the only possible conclusion is that the
Governor has exceeded his power, and that the Attorney
General is powerless to act upon the instant executive
order.

It is no answer that the Governor is employing his
superseder power pursuant to Executive Law Section
63(2), rather than his power pursuant to Executive Law
Section 63-d. Executive Law Section 63(2) is a provision
of general application, concerning the attorney general's
entry into criminal prosecutions, and falling under the
heading of the attorney's general "general duties." See
Executive Law Section 63(2). Whatever general duties
and powers the attorney general may have with regard to
prosecuting crimes (and whatever power the governor
has to activate those powers) is a question quite separate
from what powers the attorney general possesses with
respect to the more specific case provided for by
Executive Law Section 63-d, namely, "death penalty
prosecutions." See Executive Law Section 63-d (title). Of
course, it is settled law that statutes enacted for a "special
purpose" take precedence over earlier legislation which
is general in scope and application. See Martinis v.
Supreme Court. 15 N.Y.2d 240, 249 (1965); see also
People v. Walker. 81 N.Y.2d 661, 664 (1993) (specific
provisions of a statutory scheme override the general). It
is difficult to imagine a recent statutory scheme which
serves a more "special purpose" than that concerning the
death penalty.

Further, Executive Law Section 63-d seeks to
guarantee, within broad parameters, a balance of power
between the prosecution and the defense in cases which
may involve the death penalty. Pursuant to this
guarantee, the statute acknowledges that in any given case
this balance could tilt in favor of either party. Along
these lines, the statute recognizes that the coupling of the
resources of the district attorney and the attorney general
presents concerns unique to a prosecution which may
involve the death penalty. By contrast, Executive Law
Section 63(2) permits the coupling of these two offices16
without any concern for the balance of resources. Since
Executive Law Section 63-d clearly evinces the intent
that "death penalty prosecutions" be treated differently
than other prosecutions on this very issue of
guaranteeing the fair balancing of resources, and since
Executive Law Section 63(2) wholly fails to incorporate
this legislative concern, Executive Law Section 63(2)
cannot apply to cases where "the defendant may be
subject to the penalty of death." See Executive Law
Section 63-d.

Thus, it cannot be argued that Executive Law Section
63-d places no limits on the powers exercised under
Executive Law Section 63(2) because Executive Law
Section 63-d concerns the attorney general assisting the
district attorney, whereas Executive Law Section 63(2)
concerns the attorney general superseding the district
attorney, thereby rendering the provisions conceptually
and categorically distinct.17 This argument (that Section
63-d applies exclusively when the district attorney
requests assistance and that Section 63[2] applies
exclusively when the governor orders a superseder) fails,
because the overarching principle of Executive Law
Section 63-d demands that any concern for preserving
the balance of resources in all prosecutions which may
involve the death penalty be addressed only at the request
of a district attorney. The statute implicitly recognizes
that the district attorney is in the best position to assess
whether the resources of that office are being
overwhelmed by the defense resources.

Moreover, this is not to suggest that in capital cases
involving a district attorney's malfeasance or corruption,
the governor is helpless. Initially, the governor would
still retain the powers to remove such a district attorney
from office (N.Y. Const., Art. 13, Section 13). Further,
construing these two provisions as well as the remainder
of New York's capital punishment scheme together, it is
perfectly consistent to suggest that the governor's
authority under Executive Law Section 63(2) to
supersede a district attorney in the exercise of a capital
sentencing option is limited by Executive Law Section
63-d, but that a different result might ensue were
malfeasance or corruption involved. Of course, that issue
is not before this Court.

In conclusion, the request of the district mechanism
which calls the powers of the attorney general into being
in a special class of cases: prosecutions where "the
defendant may be subject to the penalty of death," and
where the need for balance of resources between the
district attorney and the defendant makes such action
appropriate. See Executive Law Section 63-d. Because
there was no such request in this case, the Governor's
executive order is invalid.

END NOTES


1. All reference materials will be furnished to the
Court upon request.

2. At the time the statute was signed into law and the
District Attorney was standing for re-election, the
District Attorney informed his constituency that he had
no "present" intention of utilizing the death sentence. He
has also expressed his reservations about the use of the
death penalty on other occasions.

3. To take this policy to its farthest extreme, a governor
might require district attorneys to announce their
position after a murder had been committed, but before a
suspect had even been identified or arrested.

4. In particular, the Governor's suggestion that the
District Attorney should establish an internal review
committee marks an odd policy choice. Notably, the
Governor's predecessor in office designated an internal
review committee within his office to consider each case
in which a special prosecutor was requested. See
Lawrence T. Kurlander and Valerie Friedlander,
Perilous Executive Power-- Perspective on Special
Prosecutors in New York 16 Hofstra L. Rev. 35, 62
(1987). However, Executive Law Section 63(2) no more
requires respondent Pataki to preserve this internal
committee to avoid unwarranted superseder orders than
it requires petitioner to establish one to fend off such
orders.

5. By way of comparison, if a district attorney elected
to seek the death penalty, but then, pursuant to CPL
Section 400.27(1) declared that he or she wished to
reverse that decision, could the governor require the
district attorney to state the reasons for such reversal or
face superseder?

6. See, e.g., North Carolina v. Case. 330 N.C. 161, 163
410 S.E.2d 57, 58 (1991) (under North Carolina scheme,
"the decision as to whether a case of murder in the first
degree should be tried as a capital case is not within the
district attorney's discretion").

7. Of course, the constitutionality of a presumptive
death penalty statute is not posed in the instant case and is
not indicated by the acts of the legislature; however, such
a statutory scheme would clearly face serious challenge
under the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
See McCleskey v. Kemp. 481 U.S. 279, 303 (1987)
(indicating that decision to impose death penalty which
does not focus on the particular nature of the crime and
particular characteristics of the individual defendant
risks violating the Eighth Amendment).

8. CPL Section 470.30(3)(b) provides that the Court of
Appeals "shall" determine "whether the sentence of death
is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in
similar cases" considering both the crime and the
defendant. "In conducting such review the court, upon
request of the defendant, in addition to any other
determination, shall review whether the sentence of death
is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in
similar cases by virtue of the race of the defendant or a
victim of the crime for which defendant was convicted."

9. Cf. Gregg v. Georgia 428 U.S. 153, 199 (1976) ("At
each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice
system makes a decision which may remove a defendant
from consideration as a candidate for the death
penalty.... Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the
decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates
the Constitution.") (plurality opinion).

10. Indeed, as mentioned above (p. 14 n. 7), the
Governor's pronouncements and actions may have
created a problem of reverse proportionality. Certainly,
all local district attorneys will now be on guard against
superseder, perhaps to the point of seeking the death
penalty against their own better judgment. Furthermore,
the Governor's declarations may prevent the Attorney
General from exercising independent judgment in the
case, even though the Attorney General is an
independent, elected officer. Cf. In Re Shelley, 332 Pa.
358, 367, 2 A.2d 809, 814 (1938) (noting temptation of
appointed attorney general to succumb to will of
governor).

11. The term "oyer and terminer" means stated term or
periodical session, and is derived from the ancient
English requirement that the High Court of Justices in
various English counties be held at stated sessions. See
MacDaniel Brothers Const. Co. v. Jordy, 183 So.2d 501,
504-505 (Miss. 1966).

12. See L. 1813 c. 66; L 1818 c. 283; L. 1827 c. 8;
Revised Statutes 1989 c. 8, tit. 5 Section 5; L. 1892 c.
683 Section 52; L. 1894 c. 68; L. 1895 c. 821; L. 1909 c.
23 Section 62; L. 1911 c. 14.

13. Courts in other jurisdictions have held that the
exercise of superseder power is subject to judicial review
even when that power is nominally absolute. See Kemp
v. Stanley. 204 La. 110, 120-21, 15 So.2d 1, 4 (1943).

14. In a press release from the Governor's Office,
attention is called to additional statements made by the
District Attorney on the issue of the death penalty
(Exhibit 9).

15. A recent article in the New York Law Journal has
reported that, of the 371 murder cases from the period
of Sept. 1, 1995 (the date the first degree murder laws
went into effect) through March 26, only 18 have
resulted in first-degree murder indictments, and in only
three are prosecutors seeking the death penalty. See
Edward A. Adams, No Data Kept on All Eligible Capital
Cases. N.Y. Law J., April 1, 1996, at 1, colt 3.

16. Under Executive Law Section 63(2), the district
attorney performs duties and functions at the direction of
the attorney general; thus, the offices are legally coupled
when the governor employs Executive Law Section 63(2)
to activate the attorney's general latent power.

17. On a more elementary level the argument that these
two provisions are conceptually unrelated is belied by the
fact that they sit side-by-side in the Executive Law.

COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND MONETARY RELIEF
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND JURY DEMAND


Preliminary Statement

1. This is an action against National Public Radio and two of its
managing officials for monetary damages, declaratory judgment,
injunctive relief and specific performance to compensate plaintiff
Mumia Abu-Jamal, an inmate on Pennsylvania's Death Row, for the
injuries he has suffered as a result of NPR's cancellation of his
contract to appear as a regular Commentator  on its "All Things
Considered" program and its refusal to broadcast and to return to him
and the Prison Radio Project audio tapes of commentaries that Mr.
Jamal prepared and delivered and the Prison Radio Project produced
and recorded for inclusion on "All Things Considered."  Bruce
Drake, NPR's Managing Editor, cancelled Mr. Jamal as a regular
Commentator on "All Things Considered" on the eve of NPR's first
broadcast of his commentaries in response to pressure exerted by
Senator Robert Dole, the Fraternal Order of Police, and other
conservative opponents of the political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal has
expressed and that he symbolizes in the public arena.

Defendants' actions violated Mr. Jamal's right to be free from
governmental censorship under the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution, plaintiffs' rights not to be deprived of their
property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment to
the United States Constitution, and plaintiffs' rights to be free from
arbitrary or capricious governmental action under the Fifth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition, by
refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, NPR willfully
breached its contract with Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project,
and by refusing to return the tapes of the commentaries to plaintiffs,
NPR abrogated plaintiffs' common law rights against the wrongful
withholding and conversion of their property.

Jurisdiction

2. This court has original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28
U.S.C. 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over related claims
under 28 U.S.C. 1367. Venue is proper in this jurisdiction under
28 U.S.C. 1391(b) and (e) because defendants reside in the District
ofColumbia, a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit
occurred in this District, and NPR is an agency or instrumentality of
the United States Government and Messrs. Drake and Buzenberg are
federal officials or employees.

Parties

3. Mumia Abu-Jamal is an African-American citizen of the United
States currently residing at the Pennsylvania State Correctional
Institute at Greene. He is an internationally known and award-
winning journalist, writer, political activist, cultural commentator,
and death row prisoner. He has dedicated the greater portion of his
adult life to engaging in political and professional activities to expose
and oppose racism and social oppression in the United States. In 1968,
Mr. Jamal became a founding member and Minister of Information of
the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party, at which time he
also became subject to years of Federal Bureau of Investigation
surveillance under its covert COINTELPRO counter-insurgency
program. In the 1970s he worked as a radio reporter in the
Philadelphia area and was widely known as a journalist willing to
investigate, expose and denounce racist, brutal and illegal practices of
the Philadelphia Police Department. His reports were aired on
National Public Radio, the Mutual Black Network, the National
Black Network, as well as local radio stations. At the time of his
arrest in 1981, Mr. Jamal was the President of the Philadelphia
Association of Black Journalists, a well-known supporter of the MOVE community,
and a vocal critic of the Philadelphia Police Department, particularly
with respect to its violent 1978 siege of the MOVE community's
Powelton Village home by more than 600 heavily armed police
officers.

4. The Prison Radio Project, a project of the Quixote Center, is a
public interest organization committed to helping powerless and
largely silenced groups in American society, particularly prisoners,
voice their views and perspectives through the medium of radio
broadcasts. It maintains its principal place of business at 3502
Varnum Street, Brentwood, Maryland 20722. Its activities include
producing radio broadcasts and serving as a research and
development resource for various media outlets interested in covering
prisons. It has achieved unique expertise in recording at a high level
of  broadcast quality from within prisons. At the time of the events
giving rise to this suit, Noelle Hanrahan was the Director of the
Prison Radio Project and had the legal authority to act on its behalf.
At all times relevant to this complaint, Ms. Hanrahan had explicit
authorization from Mr. Jamal to act as his agent and representative
with respect to the subject of the recording and broadcasting of his
commentaries.

5. National Public Radio ("NPR") is a non-profit, public
broadcasting radio network incorporated under the laws of the
District of Columbia, with its principal place of business at 635
Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001-3753. The
registered agent of NPR is Lee Satterfield, 635 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20001.

6. Bruce Drake was at the time of the events giving rise to this
Complaint and continues to be the Managing Editor of NPR. His
business address is 635 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20001-3753. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Mr. Drake
acted within the scope of his employment and in furtherance of
NPR's interests. As Managing Editor, he had policymaking
authority over programming decisions at NPR.

7. William Buzenberg was at the time of the events giving rise to this
suit and continues to be the Vice-President for News and Information
of NPR. His business address is 635 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20001-3753. At all times relevant to this
Complaint, Mr. Buzenberg acted within the scope of his employment
and in furtherance of NPR's interests. As Vice-President for News
and Information, he had policymaking authority over programming
decisions at NPR.

Factual Allegations

8. Mr. Jamal was convicted in 1982 of killing Daniel Faulkner, a
Philadelphia police officer. Since his arrest in December, 1981, Mr.
Jamal has consistently maintained that he did not kill Officer Faulkner
and that he is innocent of the crime of murder. His conviction has
been the subject of intense legal and public protest centering around
the fundamental unfairness of his trial, including the lack of
competent counsel, the systematic exclusion of African-Americans
from his jury, police intimidation of witnesses and fabrication of
evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, and the prejudicial introduction
of inflammatory evidence of Mr. Jamal's past political statements and
associations, including his involvement with the Black Panther Party.
His execution has been stayed pending the resolution in Pennsylvania
courts of post-conviction petitions for a new trial based on these and
other violations of his right to a fair trial process.

9. Mr. Jamal's arrest, conviction, and death sentence have become
the focus for worldwide attention to the issues of racism in the
criminal justice system and the immorality of the death penalty. The
unfairness of his trial, incarceration, and death sentence has been
denounced by various well-known statesmen, artists, cultural figures
and intellectuals, including Nelson Mandela, Ossie Davis, Mario Van
Peebles, Whoopi Goldberg, Ed Asner, Harry Belafonte, E.L.
Doctorow, Alice Walker, Stephen Jay Gould, Tony Benn, John
Edgar Wideman, and twenty-two Members of the Congressional
Black Caucus. In addition, a wide range of domestic and
international organizations have called for a new trial for Mr. Jamal,
including the National Conference of Black Lawyers and, by
unanimous vote, the European Parliament of the European Union.
Popular rallies on his behalf have been held as far away as Germany
and Australia.

10. Mr. Jamal has also been the object of widespread public
condemnation and denunciation by proponents of the death penalty
and by various supporters of the Philadelphia Police Department,
including the National and Philadelphia Chapters of the Fraternal
Order of Police and Senator Robert Dole (R-Kansas).

11. At the time of the events giving rise to this suit and until January
13, 1995, Mr. Jamal was incarcerated at the State Correctional
Institution at Huntingdon ("Huntingdon"). During the period of his
incarceration at Huntingdon, Mr. Jamal continued to express views
against racism and bias in the criminal justice system and against the
mistreatment of prisoners in the United States through writings and
broadcast commentaries and reports. His writings have been
published in various publications, including The Nation and the Yale
Law Journal. Mr. Jamal is the author of a collection of essays, Live
from Death Row, published in 1995.

12. In July, 1992, the Prison Radio Project began recording and
producing radio commentaries written and delivered by Mr. Jamal
from his incarceration on death row for broadcast on public radio
stations in the United States and abroad.

13. On or about February 14, 1994, acting with the consent of and
on behalf of Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project, Ms. Hanrahan
met with Ellen Weiss, the Executive Producer of "All Things
Considered," for the purpose of auditioning Mr. Jamal as a possible
Commentator for the "All Things Considered" program.

14. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Ms. Weiss was acting as
a representative of NPR with actual and apparent authority to enter
into legally binding agreements for NPR with respect to the
commissioning of commentaries for the "All Things Considered"
program.

15. On or about February 14, 1994, after hearing a sample of Mr.
Jamal's radio commentaries, Ms. Weiss told Ms. Hanrahan that Mr.
Jamal offered a "unique perspective" that "my audience needs to
hear."  Ms. Weiss expressly promised Ms. Hanrahan that NPR's
decision whether to air his commentaries would not be affected by
the facts that Mr. Jamal was on death row, that he had been convicted
of killing a police officer, or that the broadcast of his commentaries
could create intense public controversy. Ms. Weiss stated to Ms.
Hanrahan that she was almost certain that NPR wanted to record and
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, but that as a "pro forma" matter
she needed to clear her decision with others in NPR management. In
reliance on these representations, at the conclusion of the meeting
Ms. Hanrahan left a notebook of Mr. Jamal's writings with Ms.
Weiss for consideration as part of the series of commentaries that Mr.
Jamal would record for "All Things Considered."

16. As a result of the February 1994 meeting and later in the same
month, Ms. Weiss told Ms. Hanrahan that NPR management had
agreed with her decision to broadcast commentaries by Mr. Jamal on
"All Things Considered."  Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan agreed that
NPR would broadcast on the "All Things Considered" program a
series of commentaries about prison life, racial justice and crime,
written and delivered by Mr. Jamal and produced and recorded by the
Prison Radio Project.

17. In February, 1994, Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan expressly
agreed that Mr. Jamal would write several new commentaries to fit
the format for Commentator contributions on "All Things
Considered," that NPR would assist the Prison Radio Project in
recording Mr.Jamal reading his commentaries, that the Prison Radio
Project would attend to administrative matters involved in conducting
such a recording session with Mr. Jamal, produce the commentaries,
and contribute its technical expertise in recording a death row
prisoner for broadcast, and that NPR would pay specified expenses
incurred by the Prison Radio Project.

18. During the same conversation referenced in paragraph 17 above,
Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan agreed that, in consideration for the
work that Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project were contributing,
NPR would broadcast at least six commentaries on "All Things
Considered," at the rate of one a month, provided that the recordings
were of sufficient technical quality to satisfy NPR's broadcast
standards. NPR further agreed to compensate Mr. Jamal according
to NPR's usual and customary rates for compensating
Commentators.

19. The terms and conditions described in paragraphs 17 and 18
above, constituted a binding contract between and among NPR, Mr.
Jamal, and the Prison Radio Project.

20. NPR's promise to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries on its
"All Things Considered" program represented a unique opportunity
for Mr. Jamal to communicate his views. NPR's "All Things
Considered" program has the widest audience of any non-
commercially produced public affairs radio program produced in the
United States, reaching some seven to ten million listeners
worldwide through NPR's network of broadcast affiliates.

21. In reliance on their agreement with NPR, Mr. Jamal and the
Prison Radio Project agreed to forego any attempts to have the
commentaries in question aired on any other broadcast outlet which
were available at the time that Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project
entered into their contract with NPR.

22. By letter to Mr. Jamal dated March 10, 1994, Ms. Weiss
confirmed the agreement that she and Ms. Hanrahan reached with
respect to the commentaries that Mr. Jamal would create and that the
Prison Radio Project would produce and record, and expressly
promised that NPR would broadcast one commentary a month for six
consecutive months.

23. Pursuant to the above-described agreement, between March 24,
1994, and April 10, 1994, Mr. Jamal's agent delivered a group of
five written commentaries to Laura Westley, an Assistant Editor of
"All Things Considered."

24. During the period between March 24, 1994 and April 10, 1994,
representatives of NPR selected ten of Mr. Jamal's written
commentaries to record and broadcast on "All Things Considered."

25. Pursuant to the contract described in paragraphs 17 and 18,
above, on April 15, 1994, Ms. Hanrahan, Ms. Westley, and Patricia
Gordon Hammond, an NPR engineer, met Mr. Jamal at the State
Correctional Institution in Huntingdon and recorded his reading of
the ten commentaries that NPR had selected for broadcast.
Following the recording session, Ms. Westley stated that Mr. Jamal
was "one of the three best commentators we have ever recorded."

26. On April 18, 1994, Ms. Westley called Ms. Hanrahan and
notified her that the recordings were of good technical quality and
would be broadcast on the "All Things Considered" program as NPR
previously agreed.

27. On one occasion between April 18, 1994 and April 25, 1994,
Ms. Weiss called Ms. Hanrahan and advised her that "we are very
excited about our new Commentator" and that the publicity
department would promote the commentaries for about a month
before NPR would begin to air them.

28. On or about April 25, 1994, NPR issued a press release
announcing that Mr. Jamal's commentaries would be broadcast on
"All Things Considered" and began general promotion of Mr.
Jamal's commentaries.

29. On or about May 10, 1994, Ms. Westley called Ms. Hanrahan to
notify her that NPR assigned a specific air date of May 16, 1994, for
the debut of Mr. Jamal's commentaries on "All Things Considered"
in order to facilitate promotion of Mr. Jamal's appearance on the
program.

30. Beginning on or about May 12, 1994, and continuing through
May 15, 1994, the National and Philadelphia Chapters of the
Fraternal Order of Police began issuing public denunciations of
NPR's decision to air Mr. Jamal's commentaries and engaged in
concerted and coordinated actions to contact state and federal officials
and urge them to pressure NPR not to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries by threatening to restrict the funds of NPR and its
affiliate stations.

31. Upon information and belief, police officers employed by the
Philadelphia Police Department and other police departments around
the United States engaged in concerted action to pressure NPR not to
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries and to prevent Mr. Jamal from
airing his political and social views, including but not limited to
calling local and national talk radio programs expressing derogatory
opinions about Mr. Jamal, urging people to cease contributing to
NPR and its affiliates, and contacting various elected officials for the
purpose of  engaging them in a campaign to threaten NPR with
funding reductions if it broadcast Mr. Jamal's views.

32. Upon information and belief, Senator Dole and other Members
of Congress and various federal and state governmental officials
contacted NPR on or before May 15, 1994, to demand that NPR not
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries.

33. Upon information and belief, the actions described in paragraphs
31 and 32 above were taken because of political and ideological
disagreement with the views that Mr. Jamal expressed and the
viewpoints that he symbolized with respect to the death penalty,
police brutality and racism in Philadelphia, and police brutality and
racism in the United States more generally.

34. On or about May 15, 1994, NPR officials, including Messrs.
Drake and Buzenberg, decided to cancel the scheduled broadcast of
Mr. Jamal's commentaries on "All Things Considered," and, upon
information and belief, directed Mr. Drake, Mr. Buzenberg and
others to issue public statements-offering false and pretextual
justifications for NPR's abrupt cancellation of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries.

35. Soon thereafter, NPR permanently cancelled Mr. Jamal's
appearance as a Commentator on its "All Things Considered"
program, and refused to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, in
violation of the contract set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 above.

36. NPR's actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and cancelling Mr. Jamal's appearance as
Commentator on "All Things Considered" were motivated by
improper considerations concerning the content of Mr. Jamal's
speech, his political viewpoints, and his political associations, and
were caused directly and proximately by the pressure exerted by
Senator Dole and other conservative opponents of the political
viewpoints that Mr. Jamal has expressed.

37. On May 15, 1994, and at various times since that date, Messrs.
Drake and Buzenberg and other NPR employees and officials issued
statements to the press that disparaged the quality of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and offered false and pretextual grounds for NPR's
actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, all of
which directly and proximately caused damage to the professional
reputations of Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project.

38. On May 17, 1994, in a speech given on the floor of the United
States Senate, Senator Dole denounced NPR and threatened closer
Congressional oversight and reduction of NPR's funding because of
NPR's initial decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's  commentaries.

39. On May 17, 1994, Ms. Weiss called Ms. Hanrahan and told her
that she was "in shock" about the cancellation of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and that she had not considered congressional
opposition to NPR's decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries
at the time NPR had initially agreed to broadcast his commentaries.
She further stated "this never set off any red flags for us. We had no
idea it would be censored."

40. On June 14, 1994, Ms. Weiss refused Ms. Hanrahan's request
that the audio tapes, or a broadcast quality copy of the audio tapes,
containing the commentaries that NPR recorded on April 15, 1994,
be returned to the Prison Radio Project or to Mr. Jamal.

41. In July 1994, during an interview on WNYC-AM's "On the
Media", John Dinges, then NPR's Editorial Director, admitted that
NPR cancelled Mr. Jamal's commentaries based on the content of his
speech. He stated, "[w]e in fact made a decision not to go ahead
with those commentaries because we thought it was not good
journalism to put somebody on the air in the role of a kind of
Anthony Lewis on public radio."  He went on to say that Mr. Jamal's
"unique political position because of his crime and because of his
political associations" caused NPR not to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries.

42. As a result of the above-described censorship of Mr. Jamal by
NPR and the attendant publicity over Mr. Jamal's scheduled
appearance on "All Things Considered," Pennsylvania prison
officials have terminated virtually all electronic press contact for Mr.
Jamal and have refused to allow him to continue recording
commentaries for radio broadcast.

43. On June 9, 1995, in a speech delivered on the Senate floor,
Senator Dole asserted that NPR's abrupt reversal of its decision to air
Mr. Jamal's commentaries was due to pressure brought to bear by
Members of Congress, including himself.

44. Since the above-described events and continuing to the present,
Ms. Weiss and NPR have refused to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and have refused to return to Mr. Jamal or the Prison
Radio Project the audio tapes or copies of the tapes embodying the
commentaries that were recorded on April 15, 1994, despite repeated
requests made on behalf of Mr. Jamal that the tapes be aired or
returned.

45. Upon information and belief, NPR has not subjected any other
Commentator with whom it has contracted to this type of arbitrary
and capricious cancellation of his or her contract with NPR. NPR's
actions constituted an arbitrary and capricious departure from prior
NPR policy and accepted broadcast norms.

FROM GOVERNMENTAL CENSORSHIP PURSUANT TO THE
FIRST AND FIFTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.

46. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 45 above.

47. Mr. Jamal is entitled to freedom of expression and freedom from
governmental censorship of his speech under the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

48. The views contained in the commentaries at issue in this suit
constitute political speech and are entitled to the highest degree of
First Amendment protection.

49. At all times relevant to this complaint, NPR and its agents and
representatives were acting as an agency or instrumentality of the
United States government within the meaning of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

50. At all times relevant to this complaint, NPR received a
substantial portion of its funding from state and federal governmental
sources, including but not limited to direct or indirect Congressional
appropriations, grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
and funding from State-owned public radio broadcast affiliates and
member organizations.

51. NPR was created by the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting,
an agency or instrumentality of the United States  Government, in
order to fulfill the policies and objectives of  the United States
Government and pursuant to Congressional direction as embodied in
the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. 396.

52. NPR is supervised and controlled by the United States
Government and its agencies, instrumentalities, and officials.

53. There is a significant and substantial nexus between NPR and
the governments of the United States and individual States and
significant and substantial involvement with and influence over the
management of NPR by the governments of the United States and
individual States.

54. The actions taken by NPR and its agents and representatives in
refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries were based on the
political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal expressed and symbolized and
constitute viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

55. NPR's continuing refusal to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and to return the tapes or copies of them to Mr. Jamal
constitute attempts to suppress his political views and the viewpoints
that he publicly symbolizes, in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

56. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
encouraged and/or authorized by agencies, instrumentalities, and
officials of the governments of the United States and individual
States.

57. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
taken under color of federal law.

58. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
taken pursuant to a policy, practice or custom requiring the
censorship and exclusion from NPR programming of political views
and commentaries that offend conservative Members of Congress
and other groups which NPR officials have concluded can and do
influence the funding of NPR.

59. At the time that defendants NPR, Buzenberg and Drake excluded
Mr. Jamal's speech from its programming, the right of a speaker to
be free from viewpoint discrimination by governmental actors was
clearly established under the First Amendment and judicial precedent.

60. The actions of defendants in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries manifested a reckless indifference to, and willful and
wanton disregard of, Mr. Jamal's clearly established constitutional
rights, and directly and proximately caused plaintiffs injury,
including the suppression of plaintiff's political views, the loss of
opportunities to communicate with the audience of "All Things
Considered," the loss of  opportunities to seek other broadcast outlets
for the commentaries, and damage to plaintiffs' professional
reputations. NPR's actions enumerated herein also caused economic
loss to the Prison Radio Project.


PROPERTY WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION UNDER THE
FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.

61. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 60 above.

62. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have the right under the
takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution not to be deprived of their property without just
compensation.

63. The commentaries written and delivered by Mr. Jamal and
recorded on April 15, 1994, through the production skill and
expertise of the Prison Radio Project, embody significant property of
Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project in the nature of common law
or statutory copyright interests.

64. NPR's appropriation of the audio tapes of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and its continuing refusal to return them to plaintiffs
constitute a taking of plaintiffs' property without just compensation,
which directly and proximately caused plaintiffs substantial harm.

COUNT THREE -- VIOLATION OF RIGHTS AGAINST THE
DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE
PROCESS OF LAW UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.

65. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 64 above.

66. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have the rights under the
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution not to be deprived of liberty or property without due
process of law, and not to be subjected to arbitrary or capricious
government action.

67. As a result of their express contractual agreement with NPR,
plaintiffs had a crystallized and reasonably justifiable expectation that
they would enjoy the benefit of having their work broadcast on
NPR's "All Things Considered" program.

68. Mr. Jamal had a significant liberty interest not to be denied by
the government the right to express his political viewpoints on an
arbitrary or capricious basis.

69. Plaintiffs' rights not to be treated in an arbitrary and capricious
manner by government actors were clearly established under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution and judicial precedent at all times
relevant to this complaint.

70. Defendants' actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries were arbitrary, capricious, and without reasonable
basis.

71. Defendants' actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries were taken with reckless indifference to, and in willful
and wanton disregard of, plaintiffs' rights, and directly and
proximately caused plaintiffs injury, including the loss of opportunity
to communicate with the audience of "All Things Considered," the
loss of opportunities to seek other broadcast outlets for the
commentaries, and damage to the professional reputations of Mr.
Jamal and the Prison Radio  Project.

72. Defendants' violation of plaintiffs' fundamental constitutional
right to due process caused them substantial harm.

COUNT FOUR --  BREACH OF CONTRACT AND BREACH OF
THE COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING.

73. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 72 above.

74. The promises exchanged in February 1994 between NPR and
Noelle Hanrahan, who was acting on behalf of the Prison Radio
Project and Mr. Jamal, established an express contract between
NPR, the Prison Radio Project and Mr. Jamal.

75. Under the terms of the above-described contract, the Prison
Radio Project agreed to produce broadcast quality audio recordings
of Mr. Jamal's commentaries produced in the Huntington Prison on
April 15, 1994. Mr. Jamal agreed to write several new commentaries
and to permit NPR to select a number of commentaries from among
those he had already composed, to deliver the selected and
commissioned commentaries orally for recording by Prison Radio
Project on April 15, 1994, and to permit NPR to broadcast the
commentaries according to its usual and customary format and
scheduling of commentaries on the "All Things Considered"
program.

76. In exchange for the promises made by Mr. Jamal and the Prison
Radio project, NPR promised to send an engineer and producer to
SCI Huntingdon on April 15, 1994, to assist the Prison Radio
Project in recording Mr. Jamal delivering the commentaries that it had
chosen and/or commissioned from Mr. Jamal, to pay Mr. Jamal the
usual and customary fee for Commentators on "All Things
Considered," and to broadcast the recorded commentaries on the "All
Things Considered" program at the rate of one Commentary per
month for at least six months.

77. In agreeing to these arrangements, the Prison Radio Project and
Mr. Jamal relied on NPR's promises that its decision whether to air
the commentaries would be based solely on an evaluation of the
technical quality of the commentaries and would not be influenced by
or based upon the facts that Mr. Jamal is on death row, that he has
been convicted of killing a police officer, or that he was a
controversial public figure.

78. By the end of the day on April 15, 1994, the Prison Radio
Project and Mr. Jamal performed all of their obligations under their
contract with NPR.

79. The commentaries that were produced and recorded on April 15,
1994, satisfied any and all requirements and/or conditions that NPR
had asserted with respect to its technical sound quality requirements.
Once NPR determined that the audio tapes satisfied its technical
requirements, NPR came under a duty pursuant to the contract
between it and Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project to broadcast
the commentaries on the "All Things Considered" program.

80. Defendants' decision on May 15, 1994, not to broadcast Mr.
Jamal's commentaries because of disagreements on the part of the
National and Philadelphia Chapters of the Fraternal Order of Police,
Senator Dole, and others, with the political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal
had previously expressed, and the political viewpoints Mr. Jamal
symbolized, constituted a willful, malicious, and bad faith breach of
its obligations under the terms of the express contract between NPR,
Mr. Jamal, and the Prison Radio Project, and also constituted a
breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

81. NPR's refusal to broadcast the commentaries as promised was
in willful and wanton disregard of plaintiffs' contractual rights, and
directly and proximately caused Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio
Project injury, including the loss of the unique opportunity to air Mr.
Jamal's views to the "All Things Considered" audience, the loss of
opportunities to market Mr. Jamal's commentaries to other broadcast
outlets, and damage to the professional reputations of Mr. Jamal and
the Prison Radio Project.

82. Monetary damages cannot fairly compensate plaintiffs for the
wrongful denial of an opportunity to communicate their views to the
audience of "All Things Considered," as NPR promised, since such
an opportunity is a unique and irreplaceable benefit of the parties'
contractual agreement for which no comparable market substitute is
available. Monetary damages cannot adequately compensate
plaintiffs for the harm they have suffered and continue to suffer as a
result of defendants' wrongful actions.

COUNT FIVE --  CONVERSION

83. Plaintiff incorporates as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 82 above.

84. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have a property interest
in the nature of a common law or statutory copyright in Mr. Jamal's
unique delivery of his commentaries.

85. The audio tapes in the possession of NPR represent the only
embodiments of the creative and artistic expression of Mr. Jamal in
delivering the commentaries that are the subject of this suit.

86. On its own behalf and on behalf of Mr. Jamal, the Prison Radio
Project has repeatedly requested of NPR that the tapes, or copies
thereof, be returned to the Prison Radio Project and/or Mr. Jamal.

87. Defendants have willfully refused to return the audio tapes or
copies thereof to plaintiffs and continue to wrongfully detain the
property, which denies and repudiates the lawful rights of plaintiffs
to ownership and possession of the commentaries.

88. Defendants' actions in converting the property of plaintiffs to
their own use and refusing plaintiffs access to their property, in
willful and wanton disregard of plaintiffs' property rights, has
directly and proximately caused plaintiffs injury, including the denial
of any opportunity to broadcast the commentaries embodied in the
audio tapes by alternative means.

Requested Relief

NOW, WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays this court for the following
relief:

1. Issuance of a declaratory judgment declaring that defendants'
suppression of Mr. Jamal's political expression violates his
constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution and plaintiffs' rights to due process under
the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution;

2. Issuance of an order enjoining defendants NPR, Drake and
Buzenberg from suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views and
requiring that they broadcast the commentaries at issue in this suit on
NPR's "All Things Considered" program, at the frequency and times

views;

3. Issuance of an order enjoining defendants NPR, Drake and
Buzenberg from retaining the audio tapes of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and requiring that NPR immediately return the audio
tapes, or broadcast quality copies thereof, to plaintiffs;

4. An award to plaintiffs of compensatory and consequential
damages in an amount appropriate to the proof presented at trial, but
in no event less than $500.000:

5. An award to plaintiffs of punitive damages in the amount of
$1,500,000;

6. Granting of specific performance of NPR's promise to broadcast
the commentaries at issue in this suit on NPR's "All Things
Considered" program, at the frequency and times of day that it
originally planned, prior to its censorship of his views;

7. An award to plaintiffs of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; and

employees and business partners. The company's plan follows a rigorous 
review by Texaco of its human resources and business partnering 
programs. The review was undertaken as a result of events over the past 
six weeks and was conducted as part of Texaco's commitment to ensure 
that its employment and business partnering practices enhance its ability to 
compete even more successfully in the complex global market.  In its plan, 
the company outlined detailed programs and initiatives for all employees, 
including minorities and women, working for and with Texaco.

Texaco Inc. Chairman and CEO Peter I. Bijur said, "Based on our review, 
we have set forth comprehensive employment and business partnering 
initiatives that are well-balanced and beneficial to all our employees and 
bring us a critical competitive advantage in the constantly changing and 
increasingly diverse environment in which we operate.  Our review 
encompassed every aspect of employee recruitment, hiring, retention and 
promotion; workplace environment; and business partnering efforts.  We 
sought input from our employees, numerous organizations and individuals, 
and we looked at the best practices in industry.  The result is a broad 
program that we believe will ensure a fair and open environment in which 
all employees and business partners can contribute to the full measure of 
their abilities. 

"The goals of our program," Mr. Bijur continued, "were set by 
determining what the demographics of Texaco's workforce are likely to be 
in the year 2000.  And, to be clear, these are goals -- they are not quotas.  
Goals focus and guide the efforts of a committed organization.  Quotas 
arbitrarily impose rigid results and do not recognize fairness or judgement.  
We will continue to hire the best qualified candidates for all positions, 
based on merit and capability. 

"And let me underscore another point: this plan was designed specifically 
to meet Texaco's unique business strategies and, as such, singularly 
applies to our company. This program is good business for Texaco," Mr. 
Bijur said. 

He added, "This plan builds on a number of strong programs already in 
place that have yielded progress in recent years.  But we are moving ahead 
quickly with new and enhanced efforts, because we believe that we must 
continue to expand our perspectives and make full use of resources that 
generate the creativity and innovation to meet our goals for success in 
today's competitive marketplace." 

Texaco will track the progress of all of the new and enhanced programs 
outlined in this review and report on these efforts. 


Review Addressed Recruitment, Hiring And Development, Along With 
Workplace Environment 

Recruitment And Hiring.  Texaco's global competitiveness depends, first 
and foremost, on its ability to attract and retain a highly capable workforce 
that reflects the diverse talents of its competitive marketplace throughout 
its organization.  To help achieve this goal, Texaco will in 1997: 

*  Enhance the interviewing, selection and hiring skills of its managers, in 
order to better enable them to identify and bring to Texaco the best 
possible and most capable candidates to help the company reach its 
operating goals; 

*  Expand its overall college recruitment so that the company can draw 
upon a broader talent pool; 

*  Use search firms that have a demonstrated record of recruiting from a 
wide, diverse range of men and women with key competencies for Texaco; 
and 

*  Undertake, as previously announced, a new, nationwide scholarship and 
internship program in partnership with INROADS Inc. to develop 
minority students for management careers in disciplines important to 
Texaco, such as engineering, the physical sciences, information systems 
and international business. 

Through its previous efforts to improve performance by diversifying its 
workforce, Texaco increased total minority employment from 16% in 
1991 to 23% today.   As part of its effort to enhance its marketplace 
competitiveness through the implementation of the above programs, the 
company expects that it will reach a level of 29% by the end of the year 
2000.  Also by that time, Texaco expects that its African-American 
employment will increase from 9% to 13% of total employment, and 
employment of women from 32% to 35%. These increases will take place 
in the context of modest overall employment growth during this period. 

Retention And Career Development.  Texaco believes it can continue to 
enhance its performance and lower its costs by strengthening career 
development and promoting the retention of employees.  A series of 
enhanced and new programs will be implemented by mid-1997, under 
which the company will: 


*  Develop and implement a new set of core skill and behavior standards 
required of managers to help ensure that leaders are able to maximize the 
performance of their teams over the long term; 

*  Establish a mentoring process that will link managers and senior 
professionals with aspiring employees to provide them with feedback and 
advice on career success; and 

*  Enhance its global succession planning system to improve the 
identification, selection and development of individuals from all sources 
using a dynamic, rigorous and disciplined approach. 


These programs will provide managers and supervisors with the 
information and improved skills they need to ensure that promotions are 
fair and equitable throughout the company. 

Workplace Initiatives.  Texaco will launch several programs by mid-1997 
that will enhance the efficiency of its team-based approach and, as a result, 
help reduce cycle times and improve productivity.  They will do so by 
creating a more open and inclusive environment, which will promote 
better understanding, cooperation and teamwork among all employees.  
The company will seek to: 


*  Implement a redesigned diversity learning experience, launched last 
year for Texaco managers and supervisors, to encompass all U.S.-based 
employees.  This experience will help all employees evaluate interpersonal 
skills and behaviors, especially in a more diverse environment, and enable 
them to communicate and cooperate more effectively; 

*  Ensure that the decisions of Human Resource Committees are aligned 
as closely as possible with the company's broadened business imperatives 
by including women and minorities on all such Committees throughout the 
company; 

*  Introduce a comprehensive, core learning program to support all Texaco 
managers and supervisors with improved skill and knowledge in change 
management, selecting and developing a world class team, communicating 
and coaching; and 

*  Implement an Alternative Dispute Resolution process to include 
mediation and arbitration, and introduce an ombuds program in which 
employees may also make use of a confidential outside counselor -- both 
of which should help create a more positive, productive work 
environment. 


Accountability And Oversight.   Texaco is committed to achieving its 
immediate and long-term goals and will continue to hold all employees, 
especially managers and senior executives, responsible for the success of 
these programs.  The company will establish rigorous reporting structures 
to increase accountability and also will: 


*  Expand the company's 360-degree feedback process for 1997 to include 
all managers and supervisors.  The employees, peers and supervisor of 
each manager will complete a confidential questionnaire annually to help 
evaluate how well that manager demonstrates expected leadership 
behavior; 

*  Revise further the company's performance evaluation system to ensure 
alignment between individual and organizational goals, and more closely 
link managers' compensation to their performance in creating openness 
and inclusion in the workplace as a means of fostering improved team 
performance; and 

*  Redesign the company's employee opinion survey, to be conducted 
annually beginning in 1997, to help managers and teams improve overall 
performance and monitor the success of Texaco's change efforts. 


Texaco To Expand Business Partnering Efforts 

Texaco believes that, by broadening its base of vendors and suppliers of 
services, it will be able to draw upon additional resources that will 
contribute to the company's competitive position. The company noted that 
the accelerated and expanded programs being implemented at this point in 
its review process are consistent with its existing business plans, are 
expected to help the company achieve or exceed its goals, and will not 
negatively impact profitability. 

The review identified the following areas in which the company will 
strengthen its business partnering efforts: 


Purchasing, Contracting And Services.
Texaco's goal is to increase its overall purchasing activities with minority- 
and women-owned businesses, including providers of professional 
services, from $135 million in 1996 to a cumulative total of more than $1 
billion over the next five years, with the expectation that it will reach at 
least 6%.  The program to accelerate purchasing activities is already 
underway and will encompass the following areas: 


*  Expanding the scope and focus of programs with minority- and women-
owned vendors, suppliers, engineering and construction firms, 
environmental remediation companies and sub-contractors; and 

*  Increasing the amount of work Texaco does with minority- and women-
owned professional service firms in the areas of law, advertising, 
accounting, tax, government and public relations.  Texaco also intends to 
increase its use of women and minority professionals at other firms.  In 
addition, the company has already started to contract with minority-owned 
advertising agencies, and this program will be expanded in 1997. 


Finance.  In order to broaden the range of its financial relationships, the 
company will seek to increase financial activities with minority- and 
women-owned banks and money managers from $32 million to $200 
million. 


*  Texaco is already increasing the number of women and minority banks 
with which it does business from 21 to 50 and increasing deposits in those 
banks.  Texaco will work to expand its use of other banking services with 
minority- and women-owned financial firms in key marketplaces. 

*  Texaco will increase the number of women and minority fixed-income 
and equity managers of its pension fund from 1 to 8, and the funds under 
management will increase from $31 million to $186 million, or 13% of the 
fund. 

*  Texaco intends to increase its involvement with minority and women 
businesses by investing $10 million in 1997 in a minority-managed 
domestic emerging market fund investing in such companies. 


Insurance.  Texaco will increase insurance coverage from minority- and 
women- owned insurance companies from $25 million to $200 million.  
Texaco will seek women- and minority-owned companies to write 
property and liability coverage for contractors. 


Improving Retail Performance In A Diverse Marketplace 

Texaco's wholesale and retail operations must be responsive to the shifting 
demands of the marketplace.  The company will accelerate its program to 
diversify wholesalers/retailers in key markets.  These efforts include: 


*  Wholesalers:  Texaco's goal is to double the number of minority- and 
women-owned wholesaler marketers from 43 to 85 (from 5.5% to over 
11%) within a five- year period.  The company also plans to encourage 
wholesalers to maintain the number of minority and women retail 
operators at the current level of at least 20% of their more than 10,000 
retail outlets and to increase the number of under-represented minority 
retail operators. 

*  Independent/ Lessee Retailers:  Texaco will work to maintain women 
and minority independent retail owner and lessee operators at the current 
level of at least 45% of retail outlets in this category.  Within five years, it 
will work to more than triple African-American-owned retail outlets from 
35 to 117 (from 2% to 6% of the total). 

*  Texaco Owned/Operated Outlets:  Texaco will work to maintain its 
current level of at least 70% of minority and women managers at 
company-owned and -operated retail outlets, and will seek to increase its 
under-represented minority retail and store managers from 67 to 100 
(7.4% to 12% of the total). 

*  Lubricants:  Texaco will strive to double the number of minority- and 
women- owned lubricant distributors from 29 to 58 (from 4.5% to 9% of 
the total), and to double the number of lube outlets from 52 to 104 (from 
8.7% to 17% of the total). 

*  Financing:   The company will make available financing support for the 
development and expansion of minority and women wholesale marketers 
and retailers, as set forth in Texaco's goals.  This financing will also 
support the development of Texaco-owned or Texaco-branded retail 
outlets in urban core areas.  The company will assist minority 
entrepreneurs in the start up of business operations for branded outlets in 
these areas, which represent under-developed opportunities for business 
expansion. 


Community Programs.  Texaco has long recognized and acted upon the 
critical importance of local community outreach and support, and has in 
particular established a strong record of local volunteerism by its 
employees.  Texaco will evaluate in the coming months its level of support 
for all programs, including women and minority organizations, that 
complement its business focus and further promote community 
improvements.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
 
For Immediate Release

Public Information Officer 
(212) 791-1937

PRESS RELEASE 
 
MARY JO WHITE, the United States Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York, announced the arrest today of RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, 
the former senior coordinator of personnel services of the Finance 
Department of Texaco, Inc., on charges of obstruction of justice.  
 
The complaint filed today in White Plains federal court charges that, in 
connection with a race discrimination lawsuit filed against Texaco in the 
Southern District of New York, Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., the attorneys for 
the plaintiffs learned during an August 1994 deposition of LUNDWALL 
that LUNDWALL and other officials in Texaco's Finance Department 
kept certain records relating to Texaco's promotion and development of 
minority employees. After LUNDWALL revealed the existence of those 
documents, the attorneys for the plaintiffs requested Texaco to produce 
them.  
 
The complaint also charges that, in the days following his deposition, 
LUNDWALL met with other members of the Texaco Finance Department 
to review the materials requested by the Roberts plaintiffs, which 
LUNDWALL admitted went to the "crux" of the Roberts plaintiffs' claims 
against Texaco. At this meeting, LUNDWALL and other Finance 
Department officials agreed to "hide" documents from the Roberts 
plaintiffs. LUNDWALL later admitted that he and others "shredded" 
documents requested in the lawsuit; handwritten comments contained on 
certain documents were deleted; and certain Finance Department officials 
who had their own copies of the documents were told, in words or 
substance, to say that they did not retain their own copies.  
 
The complaint also charges that a tape recording of LUNDWALL's 
August 1994 meeting with other Finance Department officials -- which 
was turned over to the FBI after LUNDWALL was terminated from 
Texaco -- corroborates LUNDWALL's admissions regarding his 
participation, together with others, in the destruction and concealment of 
documents relevant to the Roberts lawsuit.  
 
The complaint also charges that in the recorded meeting the participants, 
including LUNDWALL, agreed to withhold and shred a certain document 
because "[a]ll it could do is get us in trouble."  
 
LUNDWALL, 55, who lives in Danbury, Connecticut, was presented 
today on the complaint in White Plains federal court before United States 
Magistrate Judge LISA M. SMITH.  
 
If convicted, LUNDWALL faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine.  
 
Ms. WHITE praised the work of the FBI for their efforts in the 
investigation, which is ongoing.  
 
Assistant United States Attorneys STANLEY J. OKULA, JR. and 
THOMAS ARENA are in charge of the case.  
 
The charges contained in the complaint are merely accusations and the 
defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Before: 
HONORABLE LISA MARGARET SMITH 
United States Magistrate Judge 
Southern District of New York 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
v. 
 
RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, 
 
Defendant. 
 
SEALED COMPLAINT 
 
Violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503 
 
 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ss.: 
 
JOSEPH MANGAN, being duly sworn, deposes and says that he is a 
Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charges as 
follows:  
 
COUNT ONE 
 
From in or about July 1994 through August 1996, in the Southern District 
of New York and elsewhere, RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, the defendant, 
unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly did corruptly influence, obstruct, and 
impede, and endeavor to influence, obstruct, and impede, the due 
administration of justice, in that RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, the 
defendant, then an employee of Texaco, Inc., corruptly destroyed, 
concealed, and withheld documents requested by attorneys for plaintiffs in 
a civil lawsuit styled Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., 94 Civ. 2015 (CLB), which 
was pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York.  
 
(Title 18, United States Code, Section 1503)  
 
The bases for deponent's knowledge and for the foregoing charges are, in 
part, as follows:  
 
1.  I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI").  
I am familiar with the facts and circumstances set forth below from my 
conversations with various witnesses and from my review of documents 
and tape recordings gathered in the investigation.  Because this affidavit is 
being submitted for a limited purpose, I have not included details of every 
aspect of this investigation. Where conversations or statements are related 
herein, they are related in substance and in part unless stated otherwise.  
 
2.  I have been an FBI Agent for approximately fifteen years.  During that 
time, I have participated in the investigation and prosecution of numerous 
cases involving violations of federal law, including cases relating to fraud.  
In addition to my own personal law enforcement training and experience, I 
have had numerous discussions with other law enforcement officers 
concerning the investigation of cases involving white collar crime.  
 
3.  Pursuant to my interview of an attorney for the Roberts plaintiffs, and 
my review of certain documents and tape-recordings, I have learned the 
following.  In or about March 1994, a number of African American 
employees of Texaco, Inc., filed a civil employment discrimination 
lawsuit against Texaco in the White Plains division of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In that lawsuit, filed 
as a class action and styled Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., 94 Civ. 2015 (CLB), 
the plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that Texaco engaged in race 
discrimination by failing to promote and adequately compensate African 
American employees of Texaco's Finance Department.  
 
4.  In order to aid the Roberts plaintiffs' ability to make appropriate 
requests for production of documents relating to the past employment 
practices in Texaco's Finance Department, the attorneys for the plaintiffs 
took a deposition of RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, who, at that time, was 
employed by Texaco as senior coordinator of personnel services within 
Texaco's Finance Department.  During that deposition, which took place 
on August 5, 1994, LUNDWALL testified that, at least twice a year, he 
met with certain senior officers of Texaco's Finance Department -- 
including Texaco's Treasurer and Senior Assistant Treasurer -- to discuss 
"the development of women and minorities: within the Finance 
Department and the Finance Department's "track record to date" with 
respect to those development efforts.  
 
5.  LUNDWALL further testified at his deposition that, in connection with 
each of the aforementioned twice-a-year meetings, the Finance 
Department prepared a "Masterbook," which served as the agenda and 
which was distributed, in advance of the meetings, to each of the senior 
officers who attended.  The "Masterbook" contained, among other things, 
minutes of previous meetings, statistical data that was going to be used at 
the meeting, and certain documents relating to the Finance Department's 
"long range planning" for the development of minority employees.  
LUNDWALL further testified that the senior officers of the Finance 
Department maintained documents relating to those employees considered 
to have the "potential for executive management positions" at Texaco.  
 
6.  Because the attorneys for the Roberts plaintiffs considered the Finance 
Department "Masterbook" and other documents referred to by RICHARD 
A. LUNDWALL at his deposition to be highly relevant to the plaintiffs 
claims of discrimination, the attorneys made several specific requests of 
Texaco to produce the "Masterbook" and related documents.  Thus, during 
LUNDWALL's deposition on August 5, 1994, an attorney for the plaintiffs 
requested an attorney for Texaco to produce the "Masterbook" and other 
documents to which LUNDWALL had referred.  Thereafter, by letter 
dated August 9, 1994, an attorney for the plaintiffs requested outside 
counsel for Texaco to produce the "Masterbook" and related documents.  
In addition, on August 12, 1994, attorneys for the plaintiffs served a 
formal document request pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure calling for the production by Texaco of the "the Finance 
Department Masterbook and all documents concerning or ever contained 
in such Masterbook."  
 
7.  In March 1995, Texaco produced what its attorneys represented as all 
of the documents relating to the finance Department's "Masterbook."  
 
8.  On or about August 1, 1996, RICHARD A. LUNDWALL, the 
defendant, telephoned an attorney for the Roberts plaintiffs, Cyrus Mehri, 
and told Mehri, among other things, that LUNDWALL was in possession 
of a great deal of information that would prove helpful to the plaintiffs' 
lawsuit against Texaco.  LUNDWALL also told Mehri that he was being 
down-sized out of his job at Texaco and that he would be leaving Texaco 
by the end of August 1996.  
 
9.  On or about August 9, 1996, RICHARD A. LUNDWALL telephoned 
Mehri again and told him that he was in possession of tape recordings of 
certain Finance Department meetings, which were held in order to discuss, 
among other things, the development and promotability of minorities 
within Texaco's finance Department.  On August 12, 1996, LUNDWALL 
met with Mehri in Connecticut and explained that one of the tape-
recordings, created after the commencement of the Roberts litigation, 
revealed that he and other senior Finance Department officials had 
tampered with documents that were at "the crux of the [Roberts] case." 
LUNDWALL made clear to Mehri at this meeting that he had participated 
in the destruction of certain documents requested by the Roberts plaintiffs 
and highly relevant to the plaintiffs' claims.  
 
10.  Following the August 12, 1996 meeting, RICHARD A. LUNDWALL 
retained counsel and, in September 1996, turned over copies of two tapes 
to attorneys for the Roberts plaintiffs.  On October 25, 1996, 
LUNDWALL met with the attorneys for the plaintiffs, including Cyrus 
Mehri, who played portions of the two tapes that LUNDWALL's attorney 
had provided to the attorneys for the Roberts plaintiffs. After listening to 
those portions, LUNDWALL indicated that the conversations captured on 
the tapes occurred shortly after his deposition in August 1994, and that the 
allusions on the tapes to "books" refers to the Finance Department 
Masterbooks.  In addition, LUNDWALL admitted that one of the purposes 
of the meeting captured on the tapes was to review the materials that the 
Roberts plaintiffs had requested at LUNDWALL's deposition prior to 
producing any of those documents to the plaintiffs.  LUNDWALL further 
admitted that one of the purposes of the meeting was to "hide" documents 
form the Roberts plaintiffs.  LUNDWALL further admitted that (1) he and 
others had "shredded" portions of the Masterbooks requested by the 
attorneys for the plaintiffs; (2) handwritten comments were deleted from 
certain documents; and (3) certain Finance Department officials who had 
copies of the Masterbook were told, in words or substance, to say that they 
did not retain their own copies.  
 
11.  On or about November 6, 1996, I obtained from LUNDWALL's 
attorney the aforementioned two tape recordings made by LUNDWALL.  
After certain enhancements of the tapes, I listened to the tapes and 
determined that those tapes corroborate LUNDWALL's admissions 
regarding his participation, together with other Finance Department 
officials, in an effort to corruptly destroy, conceal, and withhold 
documents requested by the Roberts plaintiffs. For instance, after the 
Treasurer of Texaco indicated to LUNDWALL during the August 1994 
meeting that LUNDWALL should not turn over a "restricted" version of a 
document that was part of the "Masterbook," LUNDWALL agreed, noting 
that there was "really no point in keeping" that version of the document 
any more because "[a]ll it could do is get us in trouble."  LUNDWALL 
thereafter stated, "Let me shred this thing and any other restricted versions 
like it."  At another point of the conversation, when a Finance Department 
official referred to a "restricted" version of minutes of prior Finance 
Department meetings, which were part of a Masterbook, LUNDWALL 
indicated that that document would not be turned over, stating, "Oh no, 
they're not getting this."  
 
12.  None of the restricted versions of the Masterbook documents referred 
to by LUNDWALL and the other Texaco Finance Department officials 
during the August 1994 conversation were turned over to the Roberts 
plaintiffs in response to the plaintiffs' discovery demands.  
 
WHEREFORE, deponent prays that a warrant he issued for the arrest of 
the above-named individual and that he be arrested and imprisoned or 
bailed as the case may be.

CONFIDENTIAL

FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY

AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO SETTLE

This document constitutes an agreement in principle, effective
November 15, 1996, between defendant Texaco, Inc. ("Texaco") and
the named plaintiffs, both individually and in their capacities as
class representatives, and their counsel, in Roberts, et al v.
Texaco Inc., 94 Civ 2015 (S.D.N.Y.), to settle the individual and
class claims (hereinafter "the claims") asserted against Texaco in
that action on the terms and conditions set forth below which,
among other terms and conditions, are to be included in a final,
definitive, binding settlement agreement ("Agreement") between the
parties. Upon execution of this document, however, the parties are
obligated to use their best efforts within 30 days thereof (1) to
document and execute such a final, definitive, binding settlement
agreement, and (2) to submit it to the Court for preliminary
approval under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.

Upon execution of this document, as a condition of this agreement
in principle, (1) the plaintiffs agree to withdraw their pending
motion for a default judgment against Texaco without prejudice,
and (2) the parties agree simultaneously to request that  (a) the
hearing on that motion, presently scheduled for November 22, 1996,
and all discovery related thereto, and (b) Texaco's additional
class certification motion scheduled for December 6, 1996,
respectively, be adjourned without date pending the parties'
submission of a final, definitive, binding settlement agreement to
the Court for preliminary approval. In the event such settlement
agreement is not submitted within 30 days of execution of this
document, or that such settlement agreement is disapproved by the
Court, either preliminarily or finally, the parties agree to use
their best efforts to reschedule the adjourned hearing, related
discovery, and the submission of the additional class
certification brief in a manner that the reasonably accommodate
the litigation interests of both the plaintiffs and Texaco.

1. Settlement Class. Solely for purposes of settlement, the
parties agree to stipulate to certification of a class consisting
of all African-Americans employed in a salaried position in the
United States by Texaco or its subsidiaries at any time from March
23, 1991 through and including November 15, 1996.

2.  Texaco's Obligations. Texaco will undertake the following
obligations in complete settlement and satisfaction of the claims
asserted against it and any other obligations it might otherwise
have to pay for class notice, the cost of administering the
payment of claims, and the cost of suit, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, under 15 U.S.C. Sections 15 and 26.

(a) Cash Fund. Within five business days of the execution of
this Agreement in principle to settle, Texaco will deposit $115
million into a joint escrow account maintained by counsel for
plaintiffs and counsel for Texaco ("the Fund"), bearing interest
at a rate no less than that payable on 6-month Treasury Bills, to
be used for the benefit of the class, including the payment of (I)
all claims for damages and compensation; (ii) the cost of class
notice; (iii) the cost of suit, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses including expert fees and expenses, as approved
by the Court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, and (iv) any other purpose
the Court may order. If the settlement submitted by Texaco and the
plaintiffs is disapproved by the Court, either preliminarily or
finally, the Fund (including accrued interest), but excluding the
cost of administration already expended, will revert to Texaco.

     If the settlement receives final approval by the
Court, payment of class members' claims shall be made out
of the Fund in accordance with a Court-approved plan of
allocation submitted by plaintiffs.  Texaco will have no
responsibility for or involvement with developing or
administering this plan of allocation and any payments made
thereunder to class members.

     (b) Salary Increases.  As a condition of the Agreement
and upon final approval of the settlement by the Court, the
salaries of all class members employed by Texaco as of the
date of this Agreement shall be increased, as of January 1,
1997, by the greater of 10 percent or such other percentage
as in the aggregate would total annual salary increases of
$4,000,000.  Upon final approval of the settlement by the
Court, the salary increase will be paid retroactive to
January 1, 1997.  This increase shall be in addition to and
not in lieu of or replacement of any other pay increase
presently scheduled for April, 1997 provided in the
ordinary, customary or usual course of employment.

     (c) Programmatic Relief.  The parties understandings
regarding this relief are specified in Exhibit 1.

     (d)  Class Notice.  The parties will agree in the
final settlement agreement upon notice to the class that
satisfies the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2), and
that includes, among other things, a description of the
action and the settlement, the right and procedure to opt
out, the consequences of not opting out, the procedure to
claim against the Fund, and the scheduled hearing date for
objections to the settlement and final approval Texaco
shall provide class counsel the names and last known
addresses of all class members.

     (e) Costs and Attorneys' Fees.  The named plaintiffs
in this action have agreed to and will, in the settlement
stipulation, waive any and all rights to payment of
attorneys' fees and costs directly by Texaco.  Upon
application of plaintiffs' counsel and Court approval under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, the cost of suit, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses including incentive fees to
plaintiffs, fees and expenses of experts, will be paid out
of the Fund.  Since Texaco's creation of the Fund will
fully discharge any obligation it might otherwise have for
such fees, costs, and expenses, Texaco agrees not to oppose
the application of plaintiffs' counsel or class
representatives' incentive awards.

     4.  Texaco's Right to Withdraw.  Texaco will have a
right to withdraw from the settlement if in its discretion,
it deems the number of class members who opt out of the
settlement to pursue their own claims to be substantial. 
Such right shall be exercised within a reasonable period of
time (to be defined in the final definitive binding
settlement agreement) following the end of the opt-out
period.

     5.  Releases.  Upon final approval by the Court, (a)
all class members who have not opted out of the settlement
and, therefore, are bound thereby, will release Texaco
(including its subsidiaries) from, and covenant not to sue
it on, any and all claims under federal or state law that
have been, or could have been, asserted against Texaco
arising out of or relating to claims of employment
discrimination, racially disparate treatment or impact in
their employment by Texaco prior to November 16, 1996; and
(b) judgment will be entered dismissing with prejudice all
such claims.

============================================================

EXHIBIT 1

PROGRAMMATIC RELIEF

Statement of Equality and Tolerance Objectives

Texaco, Inc. is affirmatively committed to the fullest extent to 
an environment of inclusion to eradicate all forms of prejudice 
within the company, to promote and foster complete equality of 
job opportunities within the company to all applicants and 
employees regardless of race, gender, religion, age, national 
origin and disability, and to ensure tolerance, respect and 
dignity for all people.

The Task Force

Texaco and plaintiffs agree to create an independent Equality and 
Tolerance Task Force ("Task Force") to determine revisions and 
additions to Texaco's current human resource programs and to 
oversee, in conjunction with Texaco's President of the Human 
Resources Division, the implementation by Texaco of the human 
resource program changes agreed to or resulting from the term of 
the settlement of Roberts v. Texaco, Inc. ("the Agreement"), 
including but not limited to the specific programmatic changes 
described below.

The Task Force will have authority for a period of five years, 
under Court supervision, to determine the policies and practices 
that should be developed, restructured or implemented to meet the 
programmatic relief objectives of the Agreement. The Task Force 
will have reasonable access to all relevant books, data [FN1] 
documents and other sources of information, in whatever form they 
are maintained in the ordinary course of business, necessary or 
appropriate to the exercise of their authority. Given the need of 
the Task Force to review confidential  business information of 
Texaco, each member will sign an appropriate Confidentiality 
Order agreed to by the parties.

Texaco will be responsible for implementation of all programmatic 
relief under the terms of the Agreement, except as otherwise 
provided in the Agreement. Texaco is, however, not precluded from 
developing and implementing its own inclusion programs as it may 
find appropriate.  In formulating its determinations, the Task 
Force will take such programs into account. 

The Task force will consist of three Texaco appointees, three 
plaintiffs' appointees, and one independent appointee who serves 
as Chairperson:  to be agreed upon by the parties.  With the 
exception of the Chairperson and one other member of the Task 
Force for each of Texaco and the plaintiffs, no appointee will be 
an attorney.

The Task Force will evaluate all existing employment policies and 
practices and develop and design, in conjunction with the 
President of the Human Resources Division, procedures, practices 
and methodologies to achieve the programmatic relief objectives 
of the Agreement as well as to measure and demonstrate program 
progress and results.  The determinations of the Task Force will 
apply to all salaried non-officer job positions at all grade 
levels, in all departments, divisions and subsidiaries 
nationwide.  Texaco will provide all funding necessary to fulfill 
the work of the Task Force, including the reasonable compensation 
of the Task Force members, and the cost of reasonable staff, 
consultants, statisticians, and other appropriate experts.

Within the first six months of the Agreement or at such other 
reasonable time as is agreed upon by the Task Force, Texaco will:

* Adopt and implement a company-wide diversity and sensitivity 
training program.

* Adopt and implement a company-wide mentoring program.

* Insure that EEO and Diversity Performance is included in 
management objectives and in determining management compensation.

* Develop and implement an ombudsperson program.

* Implement national job posting through at least pay grade 18, 
and commence evaluation of posting at higher grade level 
positions.

* Develop recommendations for the creation and implementation of 
a mechanism to minimize the fear of retaliation in connection 
with complaints of employment discrimination.

During this period, the Task Force will, and the President of the 
Human Resources Division may also, begin:

* Evaluate and revise or replace the Performance Management 
Program including the PMP Appeal Process to ensure that the 
Program accurately measures employee performance and, among other 
things, that the standards for performance objectives are 
specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time bound and 
documented.

* Evaluate and revise or replace methods for determining the 
appropriate competencies needed for a job position or positions.  
Once accepted, Texaco will begin implementation of the changed 
methods within sixty days.  Such implementation will include, if 
appropriate, job analysis to identify, but not be necessarily 
limited to, critical job tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities.

* Review AAPs developed under EO 11246 to ensure they are 
properly constructed.  The Task Force, the Chairman and the Board 
of Directors shall be informed of the compliance performance of 
each establishment covered by these plans.  The Task Force may 
recommend appropriate action where deemed necessary. 

* Evaluate and revise or replace the promotion and employee 
development process, including High Potential List procedure, 
including making known to all employees objective Promotability 
Criteria.

* Establish an Employment Selection and Performance Management 
Oversight/ Monitoring System.

* Evaluate and revise job positing procedures.

* Develop and implement centralized monitoring of employee 
compensation to ensure no disparate treatment or impact based on 
race.  Review appropriate data to ensure actual fairness.  Data 
provided may be furnished in such a form as to protect the 
identity of individuals.

The Task Force will, and the President of the Human Resources 
Division may also, review and revise, as appropriate, the 
Company's policies and practices for:

* Recruitment

* Hiring

* Training

* Special Opportunities

* Assignments

* Promotion

The Task Force will, within one year, complete its own review and 
evaluation of all current employment policies and practices, 
through, among other means, the use of surveys and employee 
interviews conducted through Texaco.  Subject to the terms of the 
Agreement, Texaco will implement such changes or additions as the 
Task Force deems necessary and appropriate to achieve the 
Equality and Tolerance Objectives and the terms of the Agreement.

Similarly, the Task Force will, within one year or less, complete 
its initial determinations in all of the areas set forth.   
Thereafter, for the duration of the Agreement, the Task Force 
will be responsible for continuing the review and evaluation of 
all ongoing employment policies and practices of the Company, as 
well as monitoring the impact and effectiveness of the 
implementation of its determinations.  The Task Force will 
continue during this time to determine revisions or modifications 
to ongoing employment policies and practices in order to achieve 
the Equality and Tolerance Objectives and the terms of the 
Agreement.

	The Task Force will establish the timetable for the
implementation and completion of compliance with any of its
determinations, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

	The President of the Human Resources Division will
implement each final determination of the Task Force unless
within seven business days after receiving a determination,
Texaco files an objection with the Court that the Task Force's
determination, in whole or in part, involves the application
of unsound business judgment or is technically not feasible.

	In the event Texaco files an objection with the Court
to a determination of the Task Force, plaintiffs' counsel will
participate in the proceedings with the Court in support of
the determination of the Task Force objected to by Texaco. All
reasonable fees and expenses of plaintiffs' counsel in so doing
will be paid by Texaco.

Monitoring

	Every six months, beginning on the day of establishment
of the Task Force and continuing through the fifth anniversary,
the Task Force will provide the Court, the Chairman of Texaco,
the Board of Directors of Texaco, and plaintiffs' counsel,
information which reflects the impact of this Agreement.

Reporting

	At the end of each year, the Task Force will submit a
detailed report to the Court and plaintiffs' counsel, reviewing
and evaluating Texaco's employment policies and practices, the
determinations made by the Task Force, and the impact of the
actions taken in achieving the Equality and Tolerance Objectives
and the terms of the Agreement. The report will also identify
what remains to be done by the Task Force and by the Company,
why it needs to be done, and a timetable for accomplishing it.

	The work of the Task Force and the supervision of the
Court will continue for a period of five years unless, upon
good cause shown, the period is shortened or extended by the
Court.

----------------

FN1: If there is a disagreement between the task Force and Texaco 
as to the accuracy and/or completeness of any Texaco data, an 
independent accounting firm (selected by the Task Force from 
among the six nationally recognized accounting firms) will be 
appointed to certify its accuracy and/or completeness at Texaco's 
expense.

Civil Action No. 96 Civ.

VERIFIED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT

Jury Trial Demanded


Plaintiffs Edith Citron and Martin H. Philip, by their attorneys, for
their complaint, allege upon personal knowledge as to themselves and
their own acts, and as to all other matters, upon information and
belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation made by and through
their attorneys, which investigation included a review of pleadings
and news articles, as follows:


INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF ACTION

1. This is a shareholder's derivative action brought pursuant to the
common law, by individuals who are now and at all times relevant
hereto have been shareholders of Texaco Inc. ("Texaco" or the
"Company"). This action is brought in the name and for the benefit of
the Company against certain of its directors, officers and employees
(the "Individual Defendants"). It complains of a course of conduct in
which the Individual Defendants have participated directly or
indirectly in violation of their respective fiduciary duties and
duties of loyalty owed to Texaco, and other applicable law.

2. As set forth in greater detail below, this complaint alleges that
the Company, through its officers and directors, has grossly
mismanaged and failed to properly supervise its various divisions,
subsidiaries, employees, agents and affiliates, and has made decisions
relative to the business, operations and corporate governance of both
the Company itself and its affiliates which have exposed the Company
to substantial liability, significantly threatened its assets, and
breached fiduciary duties owed by the Individual Defendants to the
Company's shareholders. The Individual Defendants breached their
fiduciary duties, and acted in gross, reckless, or intentional
disregard of the injury and risk of loss they were inflicting upon the
Company and/or aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duty.
Among the many instances of wrongful conduct by the Individual
Defendants is the fact that the Company's employees and
representatives, directly under the supervision and control of the
Individual Defendants, blatantly disregarded their obligations under
Federal and State Civil Rights statutes, thus threatening the Company,
which is a Federal Contractor, with severe penalties by the Federal
Government and with potential liability from litigation for violations
of civil rights.

3. As result of this gross mismanagement and negligence, and other
action and inaction by senior officers, directors and employees of
Texaco, the image, reputation and financial condition of Texaco have
been damaged, it has been exposed to substantial financial liability,
it was the target of an extensive investigation by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") regarding possible
violations of the federal and state civil rights laws, as well as been
named in several litigations alleging violations of the civil rights
statutes.


PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. (a) Plaintiff Edith Citron, a resident of Florida, is and was at
all times relevant to the complaint a stockholder of Texaco.

(b) Plaintiff Martin H. Philip, a resident of Pennsylvania, is and was
at all times relevant to the complaint a stockholder of Texaco.

Plaintiffs bring this action derivatively on behalf of Texaco.

5. (a) Defendant Texaco is a publicly traded oil and gas company
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
its principal place of business at 2000 Westchester Avenue, White
Plains, New York, 10650. It operates through the parent company and
its various subsidiaries including the Heddington Insurance Company
and Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc.

(b) Texaco is named as a nominal defendant herein. This action is
brought on its behalf and no claims are asserted against it.

6. At all times relevant to this complaint, the following defendants
(the "Individual Defendants") held the following positions at Texaco:


Name...........................Position

Thomas S. Murphy...............Director (1977-present)

Edmund M. Carpenter............Director (1991-present)

Charles H. Price II............Director (1989-present)

John Brademas..................Director (1989-present)

Robert A. Beck.................Director (1984-present)

Michael C. Hawley..............Director (July 1995-present)

Willard Carlisle Butcher.......Director (1981-present)

William C. Steere, Jr. ........Director (1992-present)

Allen J. Krowe.................Vice Chairman, Director

--.............................(1993-present)

Robin B. Smith.................Director (1992-present)

William Wrigley................Director (1974-present)

Peter I. Bijur.................Chairman of the Board/CEO,

--.............................Director (on Board since

--.............................February 1996)

Alfred C. DeCrane, Jr. ........Former Chairman of the Board/CEO

--.............................(retired in 1996)

Thomas A. Vanderslice..........Director (1980-present)

Franklyn G. Jenifer............Director (1993-present)

Robert Ulrich..................Former Treasurer

J. David Keough................Former Senior

--.............................Assistant Treasurer

Richard A. Lundwall............Former Senior Coordinator

--.............................for Personnel Services


7. The Individual Defendants are all of the current directors of
Texaco and were directors of Texaco at all times relevant to this
action, with the exceptions of Michael C. Hawley and Peter I. Bijur,
who came to the Board in 1995 and 1996, respectively, and defendants
Ulrich, Keough and Lundwall, who were executives of Texaco at times
relevant to this action. None of the Individual Defendants are
domiciled or reside in the state of Florida or Pennsylvania. All of
the Individual Defendants engaged in regular frequent business
activities in New York, and have committed tortious acts in New York
out of which this action arises.

8. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 1332. Plaintiffs and the Individual Defendants are citizens of
different states and the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or
value of $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

9. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 1391 because the principal offices of Texaco are within this
district, thus Texaco resides in this district, transacts business and
affairs and is found.and/or has agents in this district.


DERIVATIVE ALLEGATIONS

10. Plaintiffs bring this action derivatively in the right of and for
the benefit of Texaco to redress injuries suffered and to be suffered
by the Company as a direct result of the violations of law and
breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate mismanagement, waste of
corporate assets, and abuse of control by the Individual Defendants.

11. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of
Texaco in enforcing and prosecuting its rights.

12. This action is brought to remedy violations of applicable state
common law.

13. Any demand on the Texaco Board to institute this action would be a
futile and useless act for the following reasons:

(a) The Board participated in the wrongful acts at issue, or the
wrongful acts at issue are the direct and proximate result of the
reckless or grossly negligent failure of the members of the Board to
adequately inform themselves as to the Company's affairs and institute
adequate systems of internal controls and supervision, with regard to
their equal employment opportunity policies for employees as required
of all Federal contractors.

(b) All of the directors have long known of the wrongful acts at issue
and have done nothing to remedy the harm to the Company.

(c) The wrongful acts at issue constitute violations of law and the
fiduciary duties of the Board, and these acts are thus not subject to
the business judgment rule.

(d) The directors of Texaco cannot be relied upon to reach a truly
independent and objective decision as to whether to commence and
prosecute this action against themselves for wrongful acts at issue,
because that would require them to sue themselves and their fellow or
current or former directors and allies in the top ranks of the
Company. Many of the directors have developed personal, social and
business ties with other directors. Many of the other companies on
which the members of the Texaco Board serve as directors have business
relationships with Texaco. Bringing this action would prejudice and
harm those relationships, and, as a consequence, the directors have an
inherent bias against bringing or vigorously prosecuting this action.

(e) To the extent that Texaco presently maintains or previously
maintained officers' and directors' liability insurance coverage, that
insurance would be the primary or principal source of any recovery
against the defendants, and would be rendered void if the Company
commenced proceedings against such defendants, as these policies
uniformly contain provisions which void coverage if the Company brings
suit in its own name. ,

(f) Many of the directors serve on the boards of directors of other
corporations, as a consequence of which they receive substantial
financial benefits and prestige, both of which would be seriously
jeopardized if they brought this action against themselves.

(g) The directors receive payments, benefits, and other emoluments by
virtue of their membership on the Board and their control of Texaco.
They have thus benefitted from the wrongdoing herein alleged and have
engaged in such conduct to preserve their positions of control and the
perquisites thereof, and are incapable of exercising independent
objective judgment in deciding whether to bring this action.

(h) In Texaco's 1995 Annual Report, the Company's directors
misrepresented that their "commitment to diversity is an inclusive
process, grounded in our core value of respect for the individual and
in our long-standing policies of equal opportunity for all employees.
And we are making substantial gains toward achieving a more diverse
workforce with broader avenues for career development." The directors
signed their names to the Annual Report and issued a report in 1995
entitled "Equal Opportunity and Texaco: A Report." This report
supposedly details their "progress", in the "important area" of
achieving diversity in the Company's workforce. Having issued these
reports, the directors are not in a position to bring this action
because to do so would be an acknowledgement of their
misrepresentations.

(i) In addition, Texaco's directors recommended in 1995 that
shareholders vote against a stockholder proposal relating to
employment opportunity because, according to the directors, it was
"redundant and wasteful of corporate resources."


FACTUAL BACKGROUND

14. On March 23, 1994, Bari-Ellen Roberts, et al., filed a civil
rights class action claim against Texaco ("Roberts Action" or "Roberts
Complaint") alleging that the Company engages in racially
discriminatory employment policies in violation of the Civil Rights
Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 (as amended in 1981), the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e, et seq.
("Title VII"), and the New York Human Rights Law on behalf of all
African-American persons employed at Texaco at any time form March 23,
1991 to the present (the "Roberts Class Period"), who have "held or
who have tried to obtain a managerial, supervisory, or professional
position and who have been, continue to be, or may in the future be
adversely affected by Texaco's racially discriminatory policies and
practices." (Roberts Complaint Para. 15). In Roberts' First Amended
Complaint, plaintiffs allege that in every salary group utilized by
Texaco, there is a low representation of African-American employees
than in the rest of the gas and oil industry, and that as salary
ranges increase, the disparity of representation of African-American
employees at Texaco also increases. The complaint also alleges that
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ("OFCCP") recently
reprimanded Texaco for the significant disparate impact and treatment
caused by its employment policies and practices at Texaco's Houston,
Texas facility. The OFCCP's 1994 compliance audit resulted in Texaco's
citation for violations of Executive Order 11246 as well as for
violations of the OFCCP's affirmative action program at the Houston
facility. (Roberts Complaint Para. 3).

15. The more generalized allegations in the Roberts Complaint center
around Texaco's discriminatory employment practices. Texaco's pattern
and practices of discrimination includes: (1) denying employees the
opportunity for promotion and refusing to promote qualified
African-American employees; (2) denying employees comparable salaries,
raises and other compensation given to Caucasian employees; (3)
preventing African-Americans from acquiring the experience and
opportunities necessary to obtain the qualifications to be promoted;
and (4) retaliating against employees who assert their civil rights
through intimidation, diminishment of work responsibilities, and
termination of employment. (Roberts Complaint Para. 20). Inadequate
Internal Controls

16. One of the more pervasive and troubling oversights on the part of
the Board is its failure to establish basic, fundamental policies
concerning promotion practices throughout Texaco, in blatant disregard
for the requirements imposed on the Company as a Federal contractor.
Instead, what exists are ad hoc, overwhelmingly subjective criteria
which are not uniformly applied to African-Americans and Caucasian
employees. (Roberts Complaint Para. 21). There are inadequate written
policies, procedures or guidelines at Texaco for the promotion of
employees. The Company's grading system, employed under its
Performance Management Program ("PMP"), changes frequently, and thus
employees necessarily find themselves judged by a varying set of
standards. The system is arbitrary and is used as a pretext for
denying qualified minority employees promotions to which they are
otherwise entitled. (Roberts Complaint Para. 23). In addition, the
Company's pattern of discrimination, which is greatly encouraged and
facilitated by its complete lack of internal controls with regard to
employment practices, includes the following: (a) filling supervisory,
managerial or professional level job openings through word-of-mouth
recruitment which is subjective and unfairly restricts the promotion
of qualified African-Americans; (b) generally failing to publicly post
job openings for supervisory, managerial and certain professional
positions; (c) failing to maintain an objective system for creating
new jobs, including title, salary and responsibilities; (d) employing
a system for appealing contested PMP reviews that provides no
meaningful way to address an unjust review (for example, under the PMP
appeal process, an employee must appeal a PMP review primarily to the
same individuals who prepared the original review); (f) failing to
select African-American employees for promotions on the basis of
criteria which have been shown to be relevant and necessary to job
performance as required by 29 C.F.R. 1607; and (f) failing to promote
. African-Americans to higher level managerial, supervisory or
professional jobs. (Roberts Complaint Paras. 24a-f).

17. The other glaring example of the Board's complete failure to
govern the Company can be seen in the racist culture it has allowed to
flourish at Texaco. Recent media accounts have shown these attitudes
to be all too prevalent in the Company. The Roberts Complaint alleges
that for Texaco, racist, discriminatory treatment of African-Americans
is virtually part of the corporate culture. The named plaintiffs in
the Roberts Action had been subjected to numerous racist remarks from
Caucasian Texaco employees, including remarks made by supervisors.
Illustrative of Texaco's attitudes towards minorities is the comment
one senior Texaco representative made when confronted with the issue
of the lack of diversity on its then Board of Directors. At a meeting
on February 10, 1993, Texaco's Corporate Secretary, Mr. Carl Davidson,
proclaimed: are not simply seeking skirts or a black face to put on
oUr board.'"

18. When the lawsuit was filed, and even after the BEOC performed its
preliminary investigation and granted the plaintiffs a right-to-sue
letter, the Company steadfastly denied that any problem existed: "We
believe that the complaint lacks merit...If it goes to court, we will
prove it." said Texaco Spokesman David Dickson. (Black Enterprise,
August 1994)

19. This was not the first time the Company had been sued for its
discriminatory practices;.nor was it the first time it attempted to
deceive the public and its shareholders about its complicity. In 1991,
Janella Sue Martin sued the Company for refusing to promote her
because of her gender. A Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded her
$20 million dollars in damages. When Texaco appealed the case, they
called Ms. Martin's sanity into question, saying that she was
"imagining conspiracy, discrimination and retaliation around every
corner." Los Angeles Times, November 5, 1996.

20. As recent new stories have shown, it turns out that Ms. Martin
wasn't imagining anything. On November 4, 1996, the New York Times
printed excerpts of a conversation taking place during a meeting among
several Texaco senior executives in August 1994. The executives were
discussing the Roberts Complaint and the documents that they would
produce in response to the plaintiffs' request. During the
conversations, the executives referred to African-American employees
as "black jelly beans" and made disparaging comments about Kwaanza,
lamenting: "I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah. Now we have
Kwaanza."

21. In addition to practicing their racial slurs, the executives also
conspired to illegally destroy documents requested by the plaintiffs:
Robert Ulrich, formerly a treasurer of the Company stated, "You know,
there is no point in even keeping the restricted version anymore. All
it could do is get us in trouble. That's the way I feel. I would not
keep anything." Richard A. Lundwall, senior coordinator for personnel
services replied, "Let me shred this thing and any other restricted
version like it."

22. The "black jelly bean" comment was far from an isolated incident.
According to several newspaper articles, relying on interviews and on
affidavits filed in this Court, African-American employees have been
made to suffer unimaginable indignities in their place of work. Black
employees stated that they were referred to as "Aunt Jemima,"
orangutans and "porch monkeys," and were the butt of racist jokes. It
seems as if the Company has never left behind its Jim Crow mentality,
in which it advised its franchisees to "'Hire yourself a cheerful
colored boy, the bigger and darker the better,' and then send him
around town in white coveralls with the station name on the back."
Wall Street Journal, November 11, 1996.

23. The Board's failure to govern the policies of Texaco has resulted
in a company which blatantly disregards the law and makes no attempt
to implement the plethora of "policies" that it has to address
minority hiring and retention. It is clear that the Board has
undergone no serious effort in the past to ensure that a non-racist,
equal opportunity place of employment exists. What is even more
frightening, however, is that it is managers of Mr. Ulrich's ilk that
the Board charges with the responsibilities of implementing their
purported equal opportunity programs. It is managers similar in
position to Mr. Ulrich who decide whether the equal opportunity goals
are being met with virtually no guidance, or, more importantly,
control from the Board.


Potential Liability

24. Texaco's pattern of racist behavior has left the Company extremely
vulnerable to liability. Damages in the Roberts Action are estimated
at $71 million dollars for back pay alone. If the case goes to a jury,
each plaintiff could receive $300,000 in damages, resulting in
liability exceeding $500 million. It is likely that any settlement of
the Roberts Action will cost Texaco at least tens of millions of
dollars.

25. The Company is also threatened with criminal liability. According
to the Wall Street Journal, the United States Attorney's Office is
expected to file criminal charges against at least one of the
individuals on the tape and is investigating a possible obstruction of
justice charge against Texaco.

26. Through their negligence, the Company and the Board of Directors
have completely mismanaged the Roberts Action. Instead, they left it
in the hands of executives who defied this Court's orders and
attempted to purge documents that would expose Texaco's discriminatory
practices. Their only apparent check, as evidenced by the tape
transcripts, was the fear of exposure: "I don't want to be caught in a
cover-up. I don't want my own Watergate here." The laws concerning
obstruction of justice were of no concern to the Company. Until
recently, neither was the Roberts Action.

27. In addition, the actions of the Company and the Board of Directors
have led the Rev. Jesse Jackson to call for a boycott of Texaco, which
would cause substantial harm to the Company.

28. As a result of the lawsuits and the pending United States
Attorney's Office investigations, Texaco has suffered irreparable harm
to its image and reputation, and has been exposed to tremendous
financial liability.


COUNT I FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY

29. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1
through 28 above as if fully set forth herein.

30. The Individual Defendants owed to the Company the highest duties
of loyalty, honesty and diligence in conducting its affairs in a
lawful manner. The Individual Defendants knowingly, recklessly, or
culpably breached their fiduciary duties by, inter alia, failing to
establish internal controls sufficient to ensure that the Company's
employment activities were carried on in a lawful manner and that its
reputation and the financial assets were preserved.

31. The Individual Defendants, individually and in concert, engaged in
the aforesaid conduct as set forth above in knowing or intentional
and/or reckless disregard of their fiduciary duties which they owed to
the Company, as officers and/or directors and/or employees thereof, or
acted with such gross negligence or indifference to their
responsibilities that they may be held personally liable for the
wrongs complained of.

32. The Individual Defendants, by their conduct, have caused the
Company to waste its valuable assets and otherwise unnecessarily
expend its corporate funds and to have its reputation and credibility
impaired, as a result of which the Company has been and continues to
be substantially damaged both in its reputation and financially, and
otherwise. The Company also is exposed to liability in the lawsuits as
a result of defendants' conduct.

33. Texaco has been injured by reason of the Individual Defendants'
breach and/or culpable disregard of their fiduciary duties as set
forth above.

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs request relief as follows:

A. declaring that the directors and officers and employees named as
Individual Defendants herein have breached their fiduciary duties as
alleged herein;

B. requiring the Individual Defendants to pay to Texaco the amounts by
which it has been damaged or will be damaged by reason of the conduct
complained of herein;

C. requiring the Individual Defendants to remit to the Company all of
their salaries and other compensation received for the periods when
they breached their duties;

D. ordering that the Individual Defendants and those under their
supervision and control refrain from any further such unlawful
activities as are alleged herein and implement corrective measures
including a system of internal controls and procedures sufficient to
prevent the repetition of the acts complained of herein which will
rectify all such wrongs as have been committed and prevent their
recurrence;

E. awarding plaintiffs reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees and
other reasonable costs and expenses; and

F. granting such other and further relief as this Court may deem just
and proper.

TEXACO RELEASES FINDINGS OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION
RELATED TO RACIAL EPITHETS

FOR RELEASE:  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1996.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Nov. 11  -  Texaco Inc. today released the
findings of independent investigator Michael Armstrong into taped
conversations among four current and former employees of Texaco
released last week.  Transcripts of the conversations were contained
in an affidavit filed by plaintiffs in the Roberts v. Texaco race
discrimination lawsuit.  [Note: copies of the report and corrected
transcript are attached.]

Mr. Armstrong, former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, was retained by Texaco to investigate taped
conversations and determine whether Texaco officials heard on the
tapes uttered racial epithets and destroyed or withheld documents.

The report released today is confined to the issue of racial epithets
only.  Mr. Armstrong's investigation into the possible destruction or
withholding of documents is ongoing.

Peter I. Bijur, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Texaco, said,
"These preliminary findings merely set the record straight as to the
exact words spoken in the conversations, but they do not change the
categorically unacceptable context and tone of those conversations. 
Nor do these findings change at all Texaco's unwavering responsibility
and commitment to eradicate discrimination thoroughly from our
company, wherever and however it exists.

"We remain unalterably committed to using this agonizing glare of the
spotlight as a catalyst to make Texaco a model in creating opportunity
and a tolerant workplace for all.  Our clear, focused and critical
mission is to leave absolutely no doubt that all our people are
accorded the equal opportunity, dignified treatment and individual
respect to which every woman and man is entitled."

Re:  INTERIM REPORT OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL


INTRODUCTION

On Friday, November 1, 1996, I was retained by Texaco as Independent
Counsel to investigation allegations made in an affidavit filed by
Plaintiffs on October 28, 1996 in the Roberts vs. Texaco race
discrimination lawsuit. Attached to Plaintiffs' affidavit was a 9 page
transcript purporting to contain excerpts from taped conversations
surreptitiously recorded by Texaco finance department manager Richard
Lundwall during conversations between Lundwall and Texaco finance
department officials. I was retained to ascertain the truth or falsity
of allegations in the taped transcript excerpts that Texaco officials
(1) uttered racial epithets and (2) obstructed the document discovery
process in the Roberts litigation.

To assist in this project, I retained Decision Strategies
International, Inc., an investigative firm headed by Bart M. Schwartz,
former Chief of the Criminal Division in the United States Attorney's
office for the Southern District of New York.

We have been able to reach certain conclusions with respect to the
first of these assignments. You have asked me to report those
conclusions in this interim report.

The transcript filed by Plaintiffs contains four instances of remarks
with apparent racial connotations: (1) a statement characterizing
African-Americans as "fucking niggers"; (2) a statement, "you know how
black jelly beans agree***", followed by other remarks relating to
jelly beans; (3) references to an event at which African-Americans
allegedly sat through the playing of the United States National Anthem
while standing for a song presented as the Black National Anthem; and
(4) references to Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.

Public attention has focused almost exclusively on the first two of
these transcript references. With respect to these two references, our
investigation concludes: (1) that the words "fucking niggers" are not
on the tape and (2) that the references to jelly beans are in some
respects inaccurately recorded on Plaintiffs' transcripts and, in
context, do not constitute a racial slur.

1.  Analysis of the Tapes

On Tuesday, November 5, 1996, Texaco was provided with copies of the
tapes from which the excerpts in the Plaintiffs' transcript were
derived. An additional version of the tapes was provided on Wednesday,
November 6. We concluded that the audibility of each of these copies
was unsatisfactory and undertook to obtain high quality copies which
could be professionally enhanced for maximum audibility.

On Thursday, November 7, we were given access by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to the original microcassettes, which the Government had
obtained from the Plaintiffs. We retained Paul Ginsburg, President of
Professional Audio Laboratories, Inc., who, in the presence of a
Special Agent form the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the FBI's
offices in New Rochelle, New York, made a complete digital copy of the
tapes from the original. This digital copy was processed by Mr.
Ginsburg, who is a court-qualified expert in the enhancement, forensic
authentication and transcription of electronic tape recorded evidence.
Mr. Ginsburg is well known in the area of tape recording enhancement.
He has been retained, at various times, by many Federal investigative
agencies, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Senate Special Committee
on Investigations, as well as agencies in the intelligence community.
Mr. Ginsburg was employed by the U.S. Department of Justice to enhance
the Branch Davidian FBI tapes. Mr. Ginsburg has also been a consultant
with all three major broadcasting networks and 25 news gathering
agencies and studios.

Mr. Ginsburg enhanced the recordings by using state of the art digital
processing techniques, including slowing the tape and electronically
restoring pitch to normal so as to improve the audibility and removing
ambient sounds that tended to mask the conversations and interfere
with the clarity of the recordings. These techniques in no way altered
the content of the tapes. The enhanced tapes were transcribed by a
team of stenographers, and portions were reviewed by Mr. Ginsburg.
Copies of the relevant portions of the tapes, together with
corresponding passages from the transcript filed by Plaintiffs, are
annexed hereto as Exhibit A.

2. The Specific Racial Epithet

The most inflammatory allegation in this investigation is the charge
that a Texaco executive, an a business meeting, used the epithet
"fucking niggers." The transcript of the taped conversation filed with
Plaintiffs' motion contains the following quote: "I'm still having
trouble with Hanukkah. Now we have Kwanzaa...(laughter by FIRST).
Fucking niggers they shitted all over us with this." (Plaintiffs'
Transcript, p.8).

The enhanced tapes reveal that Plaintiffs' transcript is in error. The
actual words on the tape are: "*** I'm still struggling with Hanukkah
and now we have Kwanzaa, I mean I lost Christmas, poor St. Nicholas,
they shitted all over his beard."

There is no use of the words "nigger" or "niggers" anywhere else in
the tapes.

3. References to Jelly Beans

Plaintiffs' transcript includes the following segment:

ULRICH: (Inaud.) ... I agree. This diversity thing. You know how black
jelly beans agree ....

LUNDWALL: That's funny. All the black jelly beans seem to be glued to
the bottom of the bag.

ULRICH: You can't have just we and them. You can't just have black
jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.

LUNDWALL: Yeah. But they're perpetuating the black jelly beans.
(Plaintiffs' Transcript, p.7).

This passage has been publicly characterized as a derogatory reference
to African-Americans as "black jelly beans". The underlined phrase,
"you know how black jelly beans agree***" seems to support an
interpretation that the speaker was lumping African-Americans together
and gratuitously characterizing them as "jelly beans".

Mr. Ulrich, through his attorney Jonathan Rosner, a former Assistant
United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, has
stated to us that the reference on the tape was not in any way
intended to be a racial slur. Mr. Rosner points out that the term
jelly bean is not, in and of itself, known to be a pejorative term,
and Mr. Ulrich did not have any reason to think that the reference
carried any such connotations. Mr. Rosner states that Mr. Ulrich's
reference to jelly beans was prompted by a speech given by an
African-American at a conference at which the speaker, advocating
integration and opposing separatist philosophies, illustrated his
remarks by analogizing to jars of jelly beans of many colors.

While Mr. Ulrich could not remember the name of the speaker to whom he
referred, we have identified Doctor R. Roosevelt Thomas, Jr. as the
probable source of the remarks alluded to by Mr. Ulrich. Dr. Thomas is
the founder and former President of the American Institute for
Managing Diversity, located at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia. He
is currently President of R. Thomas & Associates. Dr. Thomas confirms
that in his speeches he customarily uses a jelly bean analogy, similar
to the one described by Mr. Ulrich, as a means of explaining the
concept of diversity. In his lecture, Dr. Thomas customarily uses
slide illustrations of different colored jelly beans in jars to
illustrate his points. Dr. Thomas remembers using this analogy during
a speech at which Texaco officials were, to his knowledge, in
attendance.

Dr. Thomas has also published articles containing this analogy. For
example, in an article written by Dr. Thomas entitled "Managing
Diversity: Utilizing the Talents Of The New Work Force" contained in
The Portable MBA in Management by Allan R. Cohen, published in 1993,
Dr. Thomas discusses his jelly bean analogy and reproduces his
illustrative slides. Attached as Exhibit B are excerpts from Dr.
Thomas's article and copies of his slides, as reproduced in this
article.  Dr. Thomas also produced a video for American Media Inc.
located in Des Moines, Iowa, entitled "Dynamics of Diversity" in which
he employed the jelly bean analogy.

The enhanced tape supports Mr. Rosner's interpretation of his client's
remarks. While the Plaintiffs' transcript refers to a supposed
statement that black jelly beans "agree," the enhanced tape reveals
that the phrase in question is; "I*** I've heard that diversity thing.
We don't have black jelly beans or green ***" After an interruption,
Mr. Ulrich continues "*** you can't, you can't, you can't just have
'we' and 'them'. You can't have black jelly beans and other jelly
beans. *** it doesn't work."

There is nothing inherently derogatory in any of the references to
jelly beans on the enhanced tape. The remark by Mr. Lundwall, who was
taping the conversation, to black jelly beans being "glued to the
bottom of the bag" is an ambiguous reference, but may be a reference
to inequities imposed upon African-Americans by society, rather than a
criticism. Mr. Lundwall has not made himself available for interview.

4. References to the National Anthem, Kwanzaa and Hanukkah

The remaining two categories of references relating to racial subjects
do not appear to be different, in relevant part, in the enhanced tapes
as opposed to the Plaintiffs' transcripts.

CONCLUSION

We conclude, on the basis of professionally enhanced copies of the
tape recordings at issue, that the words "fucking niggers" were not
spoken during the recorded conversations of Texaco executives, and the
references to "jelly beans" do not appear to us to have been intended
as a racial slur.

94 Civ. 2015 (CLB) (MDF)


AFFIDAVIT OF CYRUS MEHRI IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS
CERTIFICATION AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

Cyrus Mehri, being duly sworn, states and avers as follows:

1. I am an associate in the law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &
Toll, P.L.L.C., one of the firms representing plaintiffs in this
action. This affidavit is made in support of plaintiffs' Motion for
Class Certification and plaintiffs, Order to Show Cause Why Sanctions
Should Not Be Imposed On Defendant Texaco Inc. ("Texaco" or the
"Company"). I have full knowledge of the acts set forth herein.

2. As set forte more fully below, the Order to Show Cause is necessary
because plaintiffs have recently obtained evidence that senior
officers at Texaco withheld and may have destroyed evidence expressly
requested under plaintiffs' Fed.R.Civ.P. 34 document requests relating
to class certification issues. The Order to Show Cause is based upon
the Court's inherent power to regulate litigation and to sanction
litigants for abusive practices. No previous application for similar
relief has been made.


Plaintiffs' Requests for Documents - Relating to Class Certification

3. Pursuant to an Order of the Court entered May 16, 1994, the parties
were permitted first to conduct discovery concerning issues relating
to potential certification of a class in this action merits discovery
is to follow the Court's decision on Plaintiffs' Motion for Class
Certification. Thus, as part of this class discovery, on August 5,
1994, plaintiffs took the deposition of Richard A. Lundwall, the
senior coordinator of personnel services within Texaco's Finance
Department. The Finance Department is located in Harrison, New York
and is the department in which two of the named plaintiffs in this
action, Bari-Ellen Roberts and Sil Chambers, work. The primary purpose
of the deposition was to determine what documents Texaco and, in
particular the Finance Department, prepared and maintained in the
ordinary course of business that related to equal employment matters.
During his deposition, Mr. Lundwall testified that his job
responsibilities were "pretty much to free up management from routine
everyday administration, making sure we are within parameters of
company policies." Deposition of Richard A. Lundwall ("Dep.") at 15
(relevant pages annexed hereto as Exhibit A).

4. At his deposition, Mr. Lundwall testified that "at least" twice a
year, the most senior officers in the Finance Department met to
discuss the "development of women and minorities" within the
Department and the Department's "track record to date" with respect to
those developmental efforts. Id. at 91. As Mr. Lundwall explained, the
subject matters that were discussed at these meetings were directly
relevant to plaintiffs' claims:


[the topic of these meetings is] what can we do to enhance Texaco's
position in minority representation at higher position grades,
managers and supervisory levels ... As regards women and minorities,
where we have been and where we hope to be. Where we are now in the
way of women and minorities in managerial and professional
[positions], and where we hope to be.


Id. at 91-92. Among the senior officers who attended these meetings
were: Robert W. Ulrich, the Treasurer of Texaco and a senior corporate
officer of the Company who was head of the Finance Department; J.
David Keough, Texaco's Senior Assistant Treasurer, who reported
directly to Ulrich; and the division heads within the Department,
including Peter Meade, Brian Ashley, Pete Wissel and Steve Carlson.
Id.

5. Mr. Lundwall testified that the Finance Department prepared a
"Masterbook" for each of these meetings, which served as the agenda
and which was distributed to each senior officer in advance. Id. The
Masterbook contained, inter alia, minutes of previous meetings; any
statistical "data" that was "going to be used at a meeting;" and
documents relating to the Finance Department's "long-range planning"
for the development of minority employees. Id. at 88-92; 100-03.
Lundwall also testified that the Finance Department maintained records
of applicants for job openings, including documents that would enable
the Department to "answer why of any number of applicants, an
applicant received a given position over another." Id. at 86.

6. Mr. Lundwall also testified that the senior officers in the Finance
Department maintained documents relating to those employees considered
by these senior officers to have the "potential for executive
management positions" at the Company. Id. at 58-60. These documents
contained information concerning the "kind of development a person
might need to develop that [executive management] potential." Id.
Lists of the names of these "high potential" employees within the
Finance Department were provided to Texaco's Executive Human Resources
Committee ("EHRC") for consideration during meetings of that highly
select Committee.

7. All these documents obviously were highly germane to plaintiffs'
claims of discrimination. They all were called for by plaintiffs,
initial Rule 34 document requests, which were served on May 13, 1994,
(approximately three months before Mr. Lundwall's deposition); yet,
none were produced (a copy of Plaintiffs' First Set of Document
Requests is annexed hereto as Exhibit 3; see request nos. 2, 3, 5 and
14.) Therefore, during Mr. Lundwall's deposition, I requested, on the
record, that Texaco produce the documents that Mr. Lundwall
identified. Dep. at 86. After defense counsel requested that
plaintiffs make this request in writing, on August 9, 1994, I sent a
letter to defense counsel requesting production of these documents.
(see Exhibit C). On August 11, 1994, defense counsel responded in a
letter which stated that the information plaintiffs had requested was
"currently being reviewed and we will notify you when production is
available." See Exhibit D.

8. Thereafter, on August 12, 1994, plaintiffs served a second Rule 34
document request, that specifically sought, inter alia:


Request No. 23

All documents pertaining to the following matters referred to by
Richard Lundwall in his deposition of August 5, 1994:

(a) EEO Audit Reports;

(b) the Finance Department Masterbook and all documents concerning or
ever contained in such Masterbook; and

(c) all agendas, minutes or notes of any meeting attended by Mr.
Lundwall and any of the following individuals: Messrs. Ulrich, Keough,
Faber, Wissel, Ashley, Carlson or Meade, where the performance,
compensation, bonuses or merit raise, or promotability of any Finance
Department employee was discussed, including but not limited to
discussions concerning candidates for potential Executive Management.


Exhibit E.

9. Although production of these documents was due within thirty days
after service of plaintiffs' second request, that is; by September 12,
1994, Texaco did not produce any responsive documents by that time. On
October 3, 1994, I again sent a letter to defense counsel requesting
production of the aforementioned documents. See Exhibit F.

10. From October 1994 through December 1994, the parties engaged in a
mediation under the auspices of the United States Department of
Justice in an attempt to resolve their dispute. All discovery and
other proceedings were stayed during this time. The mediation
concluded unsuccessfully and litigation resumed in February 1995. On
February 17, 1995, plaintiffs served yet another Rule 34 document
request, which again requested "[a]ll documents pertaining to the
matters referred to by Richard Lundwall in his deposition of August 5,
1994." Exhibit G; Request no. 19. It was not until March 1995 that any
of the documents which Mr. Lundwall had testified about were actually
produced.


Admissions that Texaco Destroyed (or Withheld) Relevant Documents to
Avoid Their Production to Plaintiffs

11. On August 1, 1996, I received an unsolicited telephone call from
Mr. Lundwall. He stated that he had certain information- that he
believed would be helpful to plaintiffs' case and that he wished to
speak with plaintiffs' counsel about such information. Mr. Lundwall
stated that his employment had been terminated by Texaco, effective as
of August 31, 1996. Mr. Lundwall also stated that he was no longer
working at Texaco, but as currently at home on vacation which would
last until his official termination. On August 9, 1996, Mr. Lundwall
telephoned me again and told me that, as part of his business duties,
he often tape-recorded certain meetings of senior officials within
Texaco's Finance Department, the purpose of which was to discuss the
development and promotability of women and minorities within the
Finance Department.

12. On August 12, 1996, I briefly met with Mr. Lundwall in Danbury,
Connecticut. He told me that certain meetings that he tape recorded
occurred after this litigation had commenced and involved senior
Finance Department officials tampering with documents that were "at
the crux of the case." I had no further discussions with Mr. Lundwall
at that meeting and suggested that he consider obtaining counsel to
represent him.

13. On August 28, 1996, I received a telephone call from a Peter Gass,
who advised me that he was an attorney who had been retained by Mr.
Lundwall to represent him. Mr. Gass stated that Mr. Lundwall had given
him certain audio cassette tapes which Mr. Lundwall represented
contained recordings that he had made at Texaco.

14. In early September 1996, I spoke with Mr. Gass again. He stated
that he had listened to the cassette tapes and represented that, on
the tapes, senior Texaco officers could be heard to discuss "purging"
and "shredding" documents that had been requested by plaintiffs. Mr.
Gass also told me that senior officers within the Finance Department
could be heard on the tapes using racially offensive language. Mr.
Gass stated that Mr. Lundwall was willing to give plaintiffs' counsel
the tapes. Accordingly, at my request, Mr. Gass made copies of the
tapes that Mr. Lundwall had provided him. On September 13, 1996,
Steven B. Singer, an associate with the firm of Bernstein Litowitz
Berger & Grossmann LLP, traveled to Mr. Gass's office in White Plains
and received personally from Mr. Gass two micro cassette audio tapes.
Mr. Gass represented that these were copies of the cassette tapes that
Mr. Lundwall had given him. Mr. Gass also gave Mr. Singer a document
that Mr. Gass represented was a transcript of certain excerpted
portions of the audio tapes that had been prepared by Mr. Lundwall.

15. Thereafter, under Mr. Singer's direction, plaintiffs' counsel
retained a firm to enhance the quality of the cassette tape
recordings. After the sound quality was enhanced, plaintiffs' counsel
prepared transcripts of the cassette tapes from the enhanced
recordings.

16. On or around October 7, 1996, I contacted Mr. Gass and requested
permission to meet with his client to authenticate the tapes, identify
the voices on the tapes and to confirm the accuracy of the
transcripts. After speaking with his client, Mr. Gass gave me
permission to do so and, accordingly, I arranged for a meeting between
plaintiffs' counsel and Mr. Lundwall.

17. On October 25, 1996, Mr. Lundwall met with me and other
plaintiffs' counsel in Danbury, Connecticut. At this meeting, Mr.
Lundwall stated that, while at Texaco, he often recorded meetings of
the Finance Department Human Resources Committee. He said that he kept
a micro cassette recorder in his office and would put it in his pocket
and turn it on before going into these meetings. He said that taking
minutes of these meetings was part of his responsibilities and he
recorded the meetings to ensure accurate minutes. Mr. Lundwall stated
that he did not inform the other participants at these meetings that
he was recording and, as far as he knows, they were unaware of it.

18. Mr. Lundwall stated that once he tape-recorded the meetings, he
maintained exclusive possession of the tapes and kept them either in
his office or at home. Mr. Lundwall stated that in March 1996, he
listened to the tape recordings and identified certain ones -- two
micro cassettes -- that he believed contained recorded conversations
relevant to this case. Mr. Lundwall stated that he gave these two
original micro cassettes that he identified to his counsel, Mr. Gass.

19. Also at the meeting on October 25, 1996, we played Mr. Lundwall
the portions of the audio tapes that are annexed hereto as Exhibit H.
Mr. Lundwall confirmed that these were the recordings that he had made
and were from the cassettes he had provided to his counsel. Then, Mr.
Lundwall identified the voices on the tapes as those belonging to
himself, Mr. Ulrich, Mr. Keough and Mr. Meade. Mr. Lundwall also
confirmed that the meetings recorded on these tapes occurred shortly
after his deposition and no later than the fall of 1994. One tape was
labeled "August 14, 1994" and Mr. Lundwall stated that he believes
that that tape was recorded on that day. Mr. Lundwall further stated
that the purpose of the meetings recorded was to review the materials
that plaintiffs had requested at his deposition, taken on August 5,
1994, before producing them to plaintiffs. Mr. Lundwall stated that
one purpose of the meetings, as reflected in the conversations
recorded, was to "hide" documents from plaintiffs. For example, Mr.
Lundwall identified Mr. Ulrich, Texaco's former Treasurer and the head
of the Finance Department, as being the employee who is heard on the
tapes declaring that "we're gonna purge the shit out of these books,
though. We're not going to have any damn thing that ... we don't need
to be in them." Exhibit H at 4.

20. Mr. Lundwall explained that the allusions to "these books" on the
tapes refers to the Finance Department Masterbooks. At the meeting,
Mr. Lundwall further stated that (1) portions of the Masterbooks and
other documents plaintiffs requested were "shredded"; (2) individuals
who had copies of the Masterbook were told to say that they did not
retain them; and (3) handwritten comments were deleted from documents.
Mr. Lundwall also identified Mr. Ulrich as the voice on the tapes
stating: "I don't want to be caught up in a cover-up. I don't want to
be my own Watergate." Exhibit H at 4.

21. Mr. Lundwall also identified Mr. Ulrich as the speaker on the
tapes who is heard describing African-Americans as "black jelly beans"
and stating "I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah. Now we have
Kwanzaa ... fucking niggers, they shifted all over us with this." 
Exhibit H at 8.

EXCERPTED PORTIONS OF TRANSCRIPTS OF TAPES 

* * *

LUNDWALL: Well, lock, I'm inclined -- I'm not going to search any more
for my books prior to, prior to '93. I've looked enough. If other
managers have them, I'm not going to go bugging them for them. If the
...

KEOUGH: You're not responsible for what the managers hold in their
desks --

LUNDWALL: What they hold in their desk, right. So I'm just going to,
I'm just going to respond that my files contain only these '92 and '93
and the one we had in '94, so far. Which we haven't gotten the minutes
yet by the way, he's still sitting on them (inaudible) ... from about
a month, two months, during whatever (inaudible) ...

KEOUGH: (Inaud.) ...

LUNDWALL: Well, we have to, because we got to respond to this. So in
any event, so with that, I think that's the tack we'll take. If they
want to fish more, fine, let them fish. Anyway, these are the two
books for '93.

KEOUGH: If you ask me, I'm over here, I only keep my latest books. If
I kept everything that ever happened to me around here, I'd be
drowning in paper.

LUNDWALL: Well, there's no sense duplicating what we're doing over
here. I've got two years worth. That should be sufficient. I don't
really care what happened in 1991.

KEOUGH: Yeah, well, right --

LUNDWALL: '92 I care. That's why I have '92s and is. Now, we had three
meetings in '92 and we had two in '93. And I went through the -- these
two books. And I just want to point out certain things. I mean, we do
have a lot of names in here

For example, here look at this chart. You know, I'm not really quite
sure what it means. This chart is not mentioned in the agenda, so it's
not important that we even have it in there. I don't know that we have
to have -- they would never know it was here. The agenda is silent on
this chart comparing

KEOUGH: They'll find it when they look through it.

LUNDWALL: Not if I take it out they won't.

* * *

KEOUGH: Is this women and minorities or is this the company?

LUNDWALL: The company's women and minorities -- I don't know. But the
fact that the minutes are silent on this -it was probably put in there
at the last minute. They have them under Tab 4. I'm inclined to remove
them ... Roster of women and minorities, change (inaudible) nines and
... title, target. Minority data and chart, that's something else.

KEOUGH: Are you sure that's not the minority data chart?

LUNDWALL: No, it's not. That's this thing here. Which is simply
listing women and minorities.

KEOUGH: If we can't explain this thing, I mean, it shouldn't be in
there, you know. Maybe it's just the same chart?

LUNDWALL: Basically the same chart.

KEOUGH: Now we see the final...this is a draft...(Inaud.)...

LUNDWALL: Yes; nor can I--

KEOUGH: --the company or us. If it was a favorable chart, you'd want
to retain it-

LUNDWALL: Yeah.

KEOUGH: --but--

LUNDWALL: I don't know that it is.

* * *

LUNDWALL: The only other issue is do they know who was at these
meetings? Generally, they are our seniors. Now we can say, "Yeah, all
I have are my '93 forward."

ULRICH: We're not responsible for our records.

LUNDWALL: You know, but if you really had an attorney who had anything
on the ball you'd say, "Well, okay, Richard, did each of these
attendees have a briefing book?" Yes, they did.

KEOUGH: If they had one but you don't know.

LUNDWALL: Of course they did, I gave them to them. Now, okay, they
directed them directly. I remember -- a million other possibilities --

ULRICH: You're not responsible for those individuals.

LUNDWALL: And that's fine. The point is, we keep it here. If it goes
that far, fine, we'll live with it. And we work with it then. But it
is a possibility, that's only thing I ask.

ULRICH: But I don't want to be caught up in a coverup. I don't want to
be my own Watergate.

LUNDWALL: Well, the point is --

ULRICH: If you go around ... how people ...

LUNDWALL: We're not going to, that's it. If they have the brain power
to --

ULRICH: They came to you and you don't have them. That's all you have.

LUNDWALL: That's all I have. And I'm not going to go try to dig them
up from other people.

ULRICH: That's why we don't have them. Those are the people
responsible ... keep shit going back to the dark ages. If they come
after guys like that, we'll just tell them at this time we don't have
them.

LUNDWALL: If push comes to shove ...

KEOUGH: Where we're going these days, where everyone is pushing as
hard as they can in every area to get as much as they can in every
area and they're going to have so much stuff that --

ULRICH: We're gonna purge the shit out of these books, though. We're
not going to have any damn thing that ... we don't need to be in them
...

* * *

LUNDWALL: As a matter of fact, I just want to be reminded of what we
discussed. You take your data and

KEOUGH: You look and make sure it's consistent to what we've given
them already for minutes. Two versions with the restricted and that's
marked clearly on top.

LUNDWALL: It's got the body counts, ins and outs, year to year.

* * *

KEOUGH: Why don't I just give them my book and we'll go through and
make them the same ...

LUNDWALL: Okay.

* * *

KEOUGH: It's strange, these restricted versions ... are there other
restricted versions? ... they're gonna want to know.

LUNDWALL: Oh no, they're not getting this. I mean, here's the one they
get, this one here. My point is he's concerned about these things. I
don't know it's valid to ... him. He could comment.

* * *

LUNDWALL: We've been doing pretty much two versions, too. This one
here, this is strictly my book, your book, ...

ULRICH: Boy, I'll tell you, that one, you would put that and you would
have the only copy. Nobody else ought to have copies of that

LUNDWALL: Okay?

ULRICH: You have that someplace and it doesn't exist.

LUNDWALL: Yeah, okay.

ULRICH: I just don't want anybody to have a copy of that.

LUNDWALL: Good. No problem.

ULRICH: You know, there is no point in even keeping the restricted
version any more. All it could do is get us in trouble. That's the way
I feel. I would not keep anything.

LUNDWALL: Let me shred this thing and any other restricted version
like it --

ULRICH: Why do we have to keep the minutes of the meeting anymore?

LUNDWALL: You don't, you don't.

ULRICH: We don't?

LUNDWALL: Because we don't, no we don't because it comes back to haunt
us like right now.

* * *

ULRICH: I mean, the pendulum is swinging the other way, guys.

LUNDWALL: They are perpetuating an us/them atmosphere. Last week or
last Friday I told ...

ULRICH : . . . (Inaud.)

LUNDWALL: Yeah, that's what I said to you, you want to frag grenade?
You know, duck, I'm going to throw one. Well, that's what I was
alluding to. But the point is now that's not bad in itself but it does
perpetuate us/them ... And if you're trying to get away and get to the
we ... you can't do that kind of scuff.

ULRICH: (Inaud.) ... I agree. This diversity thing. You know how black
jelly beans agree ...

LUNDWALL: That's funny. All the black jelly beans seem to be glued to
the bottom of the bag.

ULRICH: You can't have just we and them. You can't just have black
jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.

LUNDWALL: Yeah. But they're perpetuating the black jelly beans.

* * *

LUNDWALL: All I know is during April, which is National Odin Month in
Norway, I'm wearing my Viking hat and I don't want anybody to say
anything like on my own horns, ... I'm celebrating my heritage.

PETER MEADE: (Inaud.) ... I think Friday was National Clean Up Your
Desk Day. I wish I knew that. I would have posted a sign on a couple
of people to say ...

LUNDWALL: ... When they came in with these African things.

ULRICH: ... I refused to go to that one ... when last year, out of
curiosity. I ...

LUNDWALL: I walked out during, I'm sorry, when they did their version
...

ULRICH: Of the National Anthem ...

LUNDWALL: When they sat during "ours", listen to me, during "ours", as
though they're not included, and stood for their modified one, I won't
apologize to nobody for walking out of there. I really would not. Now
we have two friggin national anthems.

(Pause)

ULRICH: I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah. Now, we have
Kwanzaa.... (laughter by FIRST). Fucking niggers, they shifted all
over us with this.

(Cross talk.)

MV: Well, it's not a Menorah.

MV: It looks like a Menorah.

LUNDWALL: There are seven candles, the Menorah has eight. There are
three representing the three days coming in and then there's one black
candle in the center. The three days represent what you've done ...

ULRICH: And that one's bigger than the other candies

LUNDWALL: The three days represent where we are and the red candles
represent where we're going. The reason I know this is that my
daughter who teaches, she was a little bit annoyed, she had to give a
class where she was discussing with her fourth graders Kwanzaa. And
she was telling me all this.

additional opt-outs that the settling defendants would withdraw from 
the settlement

* that, because of reductions in benefit levels, all Lindsey class 
members now have an option to exclude themselves from the class and 
thereby be able to pursue, if they choose, litigation on an 
individual basis

* that Lindsey class members may, alternatively, remain in the class 
for the time being, with statutes of limitation and repose being 
suspended until they decide on what action to take

* that, to reduce the extent of ratcheting of benefits that would 
otherwise occur, a revised "claims-made" settlement program is being 
offered by Bristol, Baxter, 3M, McGhan, and Union Carbide to some--
though not all--members of the Lindsey class

* of your potential benefits, rights, and options, if eligible, under 
this revised settlement program

* of these important dates under the revised settlement program:

   April 1, 1996   deadline to register under revised settlement
                   program for those who have not previously
                   registered with Claims Office but want to
                   preserve their "Second Opt-Out Right"

   Dec. 16, 1996   deadline to file forms preserving status as
                   "Current Claimant" and to claim "rupture" benefits 
                   under revised settlement

   Dec. 15, 2010   end of 15-year period of revised settlement 
                   program

* that eligible implant-recipients who previously opted out of the 
Lindsey class may rejoin the class and accept benefits of the revised 
settlement program

THE LITIGATION              

1. Cases.

Thousands of lawsuits seeking damages for death or injuries allegedly 
resulting from breast implants are pending in many state and federal 
courts. The federal cases are coordinated in the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama ("the Court") 
before Chief Judge Sam C. Pointer, Jr., in a Proceeding known as In 
re Silicone Gel Breast Implant Products Liability Litigation, MDL No. 
926, Case No. CV 92- P-10000-S. Over a dozen breast implant cases 
have already been tried, with considerable expense and time, in state 
and federal courts--with some verdicts favorable to plaintiffs and 
with some favorable to defendants.

THE "GLOBAL" SETTLEMENT

2. Settlement Approved.

In April 1994 Judge Pointer preliminarily approved a proposed 
"global" settlement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) on behalf of a 
broad class of persons with respect to pending or potential claims 
against the then settling defendants for present or future personal 
injury or death caused by or involving breast implant products. On 
September 1, 1994--after extensive notice to potential class members; 
after opportunity to object, comment, and "opt out"; and after 
several days of hearings--Judge Pointer approved this settlement. The 
settlement order was entered in a case identified as Lindsey, et al. 
v. Dow Corning Corporation, et al., Case No. CV 94- P-11558-S, and 
the class was generally referred to as the "Lindsey" class.

3. Opt-Outs from Global Settlement. ("First" or "Initial" Opt-Out)

A major question while the proposed global settlement was pending was 
whether the number of persons electing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2) 
to "opt out" (or exclude themselves) from the proposed settlement 
would be so large that the then settling defendants would exercise 
their reserved option not to proceed with a settlement that might 
obligate them to pay more than $4.2 billion to the remaining class 
members. Although a substantial number of potential class members 
(over 10,000) did opt out, the then settling defendants concluded to 
proceed nevertheless with the settlement. Those who did not opt out 
were enjoined by the Court from pursuing or instituting lawsuits 
against the then settling defendants pending implementation of the 
settlement.

4. Registrations and Claims.

Lindsey class members were advised that, if they wanted to make 
claims under the "Current Disease Compensation Program" of the global 
settlement, they were required to submit claim forms (with supporting 
documentation) to the Claims Office by September 16, 1994. Later 
orders of the Court extended to October 17, 1994, the deadline for 
submitting supporting documentation, and to March 1, 1995, the 
deadline for domestic class members to register with the Claims 
Office to avoid being treated as "late registrants." (Under terms of 
the settlement and notice, late registrants would receive benefits 
only if and to the extent settlement funds were not exhausted by 
benefits paid to class members who timely registered.) Eligible 
"foreign" class members who did not register with the Claims Office 
by March 1, 1995, were precluded from obtaining benefits under the 
settlement or from proceeding with litigation in courts in the United 
States, but retained their full rights to pursue claims in the 
judicial and administrative tribunals of their own countries.

5. "Current Disease Compensation Claims" and
   "Ratcheting" under Global Settlement.

At the time the global settlement was approved, it could not be known 
whether, or to what extent, the benefits that might be approved under 
the Schedule of Benefits for Current Disease Compensation Claims 
(ranging from $105,000 to $1,400,000 for domestic claimants) would 
exceed the $1,200,000,000 to be set aside under the settlement for 
such benefits. For that reason, the settlement provided that the 
amounts shown in the Schedule were subject to potential reduction (or 
"ratcheting") but that, in such event, all registered class members 
would be so notified and be given a second opt-out right in order to 
pursue litigation rather than accept reduced benefits. The defendants 
would, however, then have an option to withdraw from the settlement 
because of the number of such additional opt-outs.

Promptly after the settlement was approved, the Claims Office began 
processing registrations and evaluating those with "current claims." 
However, because of the large number of registrations (approximately 
260,000 were mailed by September 16, 1994) and because of the large 
number of those with current claims (projected to be about 100,000), 
it became apparent that far more time would be required to evaluate 
all current claims than had been initially anticipated and that 
benefit levels would definitely have to be ratcheted. In order not to 
unduly delay the determination about the extent of ratcheting, the 
opportunity for opting out, or the possible withdrawal by defendants, 
samples of these claims were selected for evaluation in a manner as 
to allow reasonably accurate predictions about the extent of 
ratcheting.

This study, a summary of which the Claims Office announced to class 
members in June 1995, demonstrated that, given the large amount of 
current claims that would be approved under the disease and severity 
criteria of the global settlement, the scheduled Disease Compensation 
benefits would be severely reduced--to perhaps less than 5% of the 
amounts shown in the schedule. Additionally, by that time, Dow 
Corning, which was obligated to make almost half of the contributions 
to the settlement funds, had become the Debtor in bankruptcy 
reorganization proceedings, and its continued participation in the 
settlement was uncertain. These facts led the Court to conclude not 
only that thousands of additional class members would opt out of the 
class, but also that the defendants would withdraw from the 
settlement as a result of these opt-outs.

6. Efforts to Reduce Ratcheting.

As required by the global settlement, Plaintiffs' Settlement Class 
Counsel and representatives of the more financially solvent 
defendants not in bankruptcy engaged in extensive conferences during 
the Summer and Fall of 1995 and explored various methods and options 
to reduce the extent of ratcheting, while preserving the rights of 
registered class members to opt out as had been guaranteed under the 
global settlement. Ultimately in November 1995 the Court was 
presented with a proposed revised settlement program approved by 
Bristol, Baxter, 3M, McGhan, and Union Carbide.

Although still providing substantially less compensation than the 
Schedule of Benefits contained in the original notice of settlement, 
this program is, in the view of the Court, far superior--for those 
eligible to participate--to the distribution of a conditional offer 
of severely-ratcheted benefits based on percentages of grid amounts 
in that original notice. The benefits to most participants with only 
Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implants under the revised settlement will be 
greater than the ratcheted amounts than would have been presented to 
class members under the original settlement. More importantly, those 
ratcheted amounts would, because of the projected opt- outs and 
withdrawal by the defendants, never have been paid to any class 
member, whereas the benefits offered under the revised settlement are 
not subject to any withdrawal right by the settling defendants even 
if a large number of persons opt out of the revised settlement.

Plaintiffs' Settlement Class Counsel have not approved the terms of 
the revised settlement offer and, indeed, believe that the settling 
defendants should have been willing to offer greater benefits, and to 
more members of the Lindsey class. They do not, however, object to 
class members individually having an opportunity to consider and 
possibly accept an offer of settlement where the terms of that offer 
are clear and understandable--even if less than what Class Counsel 
personally believe would represent a fair settlement value. Nor do 
they dispute that, for those eligible to participate, the revised 
settlement provides an opportunity for settlement without litigation 
that, because of the defendants' right to withdraw due to additional 
opt-outs, would not have been provided by sending notices of 
ratcheting under the original benefit schedule. While Class Counsel 
have not agreed to the terms of the revised offer, paragraph 18 of 
the original notice did not require agreement to a revision, such as 
this, that reduces the extent of ratcheting which would otherwise 
occur.

SECOND OPT-OUT RIGHT

7. Opt-Out Right.

Because of the reduction in potential benefits, members of the 
Lindsey class now have a second right to opt out of the class and 
thereby be able, if desired, to pursue or institute litigation 
(including any rights to seek punitive or statutory multiple damages) 
against those who were settling defendants or released parties under 
the global settlement. This opt-out right is provided to all Lindsey 
class members--whether or not eligible to participate in the revised 
settlement--except for those who do not register until after April 1, 
1996, or who, having previously opted out, elect to rejoin the 
Lindsey class.

   (a) To opt out now, the individual (or her court- appointed 
       representative) must sign and return to the Claims Office the 
       Election Form (included with this Notice), with box 2C or 3A 
       marked. The form can also be completed and signed by the 
       individual's attorney. In the event of conflict between an 
       election signed by a class member and an election signed by 
       the person's attorney, the former will control.

   (b) Those who elect to opt out now should understand that statutes 
       of limitation and repose--which have been suspended during the 
       pendency of the Lindsey case and, for most class members, 
       during the pendency of the earlier-filed Dante class action--
       will resume running 30 days after the Claims Office receives 
       this election. Resumption of the running of such statutes 
       could adversely affect the litigation rights of persons who 
       have not already filed lawsuits or who are not prepared to 
       file any lawsuits within that 30-day period. Accordingly, the 
       Court cautions class members against making an immediate opt-
       out election unless they are sure they won't be adversely 
       affected by such statutes.

   (c) There is no fixed deadline for such persons to opt out. 
       Registered class members can wait to make the decision whether 
       or not to opt out until 45 days after they are individually 
       sent a Notification of Status letter by the Claims Office 
       explaining their potential eligibility for benefits under the 
       revised settlement. These individual Notifications will be 
       mailed by the Claims Office during 1996 as registrations and 
       claims are processed and reviewed. Statutes of limitation and 
       repose will continue to be suspended until that decision is 
       made, and indeed for many class members as much as 6 months 
       after such an opt-out election is made. For this reason--and 
       to assure the most informed decision by those who may be 
       eligible to participate in the revised settlement--the Court   
       strongly recommends that most Lindsey class members delay any  
       decision about opting out until they are sent this 
       Notification by the Claims Office.

   (d) Persons who opt out should understand that their rights to 
       institute or pursue litigation claims against Mentor, 
       Bioplasty, and Dow Corning are subject to certain 
       restrictions. See 15-17 below. Also, they should understand 
       that the companies that are parties to the new settlement 
       program are prohibited from now engaging in settlement 
       negotiations and discussions (except on a case-by-case basis 
       involving cases that were brought by persons who earlier opted 
       out of the global settlement or cases that may be specifically 
       set for trial or court-sponsored mediation or arbitration), 
       and that any recoveries through separate litigation or 
       settlement are subject to potential sharing in the cost of 
       services performed by counsel for the "common benefit" of all 
       having breast implant claims. See 28 below.

   (e) Persons wanting to obtain the Advance Payment and payment of 
       other benefits at the earliest possible date can waive this 
       second opt-out right.

REVISED SETTLEMENT PROGRAM

8. General Description.

The revised settlement program can be described as a "claims-made" 
program. Rather than the settling defendants offering to make a 
prescribed payment into a settlement fund that then would be divided 
in some manner among class members electing to participate (and 
perhaps being subject to cancellation if too many class members elect 
not to participate), the amounts to be paid to individual 
participants are essentially unconditional, fixed, and unaffected by 
the number or amount of benefits paid to other participants, and the 
total amount to be paid by the various settling defendants will be 
determined by the number of, and the payments to, the persons 
participating in the settlement.

   (a) This revised settlement is being offered by some, but not all,
       of the manufacturers and suppliers involved in the original 
       settlement; and, as described in 10 below, not all Lindsey 
       class members are eligible to participate in the revised
       settlement.

   (b) The benefits provided are substantially less than the amounts
       shown in the Disease Compensation Schedule of the original 
       settlement (which, before ratcheting, could have been as high 
       as $1,400,000 for some class members). The maximum benefits 
       payable under the revised settlement are $253,000 ($250,000 
       under Long-term Benefits Schedule plus $3,000 for 
       explanation). Such benefits would be payable, for example, to 
       a qualified participant who in May 1993 developed Systemic 
       Lupus with a compensation level "A" under the criteria of the 
       revised settlement program, and whose only implants, 
       manufactured by Baxter/Heyer-Schulte, were removed in May
       1994.

   (c) At the lower range of benefits, however, the amount payable to 
       some eligible participants under the revised settlement may 
       actually exceed that described under the global settlement. 
       For example, an "Advance Payment" of $1,000 would be payable 
       to a qualified participant with a Baxter/Heyer-Schulte implant 
       who did not make a Current Disease Compensation Program claim 
       under the global settlement and who does not in future years 
       either have her implants removed or develop a disease or 
       symptomology covered under the criteria of either settlement 
       program. Also, the amount payable ($3,000) to those who 
       qualify for explantation benefits but who would not otherwise 
       qualify for any benefits may exceed the amount that might have
       been payable to such persons under the global settlement.

   (d) For other qualified participants, benefits should fall between  
       these limits, depending on factors such as (1) the 
       manufacturer(s) of the implant(s), (2) the severity and 
       disease/symptomology criteria under the global settlement and 
       the revised settlement, (3) the time when a claim and 
       supporting documentation are filed, (4) whether there is proof 
       of rupture, and (5) the time when an implant is removed.

9. Settling Defendants under Revised Settlement.

A full listing of the settling defendants participating in the 
revised settlement is contained in Exhibit B1. In this Notice, 
however, the following short descriptions of these defendants are 
sometimes used for convenient reference:

   * "Bristol", meaning Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Medical Engineering 
     Corp. (MEC), and their affiliates, including breast implants 
     sold under the "Surgitek" name.

   * "Baxter", meaning Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Baxter 
     International Inc., American Hospital Supply Co. (Heyer-Schulte) 
     and their affiliates.

   * "3M", meaning Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., McGhan
     Medical Corp. (Dela.) and their affiliates. (For purposes of 
     this program, "3M implants" are 3M/McGhan implants manufactured 
     wholly or partly before 8/3/84.)

   * "McGhan", meaning McGhan Medical Corporation (Calif.) and INAMED 
     Corporation. (For purposes of this program, "post 8/84 McGhan" 
     implants are silicone-gel breast implants manufactured at or by 
     McGhan wholly after 8/2/84.)

   * "Union Carbide", meaning Union Carbide Chemical & Plastics Co., 
     Union Carbide Corporation, and their affiliates

See Exhibit G for various brand names of implants.

10. Eligibility.

   (a) A person who does not timely opt out will be eligible to 
       participate in the revised settlement program if she satisfies 
       each of the following requirements:

      (1) is not a "foreign" claimant (see 18);

      (2) has not released through settlement all claims against each 
          of the settling defendants whose implants were implanted in 
          the person (or had such claims resolved by final judgment);
          and

      (3) before June 1, 1993, either--

         (A) was implanted with one or more breast implants 
             manufactured by Bristol, Baxter, or 3M, or

         (B) was implanted only with one or more "post 8/84 McGhan" 
             silicone-gel breast implants (or only with one or more 
             such implants and with one or more breast implants 
             manufactured by Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI, or Mentor).

   (b) An implant recipient who would otherwise be eligible but for 
       having earlier opted out of the global settlement may 
       participate in the settlement (but without opt-out rights 
       under 7 above) by filing with the Claims Office an Election 
       Form before the person proceeds to trial against any of the 
       settling defendants. If the form is filed after December 16, 
       1996, the person will be classified as a "Late Registrant."

   (c) As under the global settlement, participation by an implant 
       recipient also constitutes participation by that person's 
       estate and family members with respect to any derivative or 
       representative claims. However, any claims by children of 
       implant recipients with respect to their own personal injury 
       are not covered by the revised settlement, and the pursuit of 
       any such claims is not barred by this settlement.

11. Registration; Proof of Manufacturer Form;
    Classification of Participants.

   (a) Persons eligible to participate in the revised settlement who 
       have already registered with the Claims Office do not have to 
       re-register (whether or not they filed any claim under the 
       global settlement). However, they should complete and file 
       with the Claims Office the "Election Form" (included with this 
       Notice) when they are prepared to make a decision regarding 
       possible participation in the settlement, and the failure to 
       file this form by December 16, 1996, would preclude an 
       otherwise eligible participant from obtaining the special 
       benefits and protections afforded to "Current Claimants".

   (b) Persons eligible to participate in the revised settlement who 
       have not already registered with the Claims Office may still 
       participate as "Late Registrants" under the revised 
       settlement, but must file with the Claims Office the "Election 
       Form" (included with this Notice) by April 1, 1996, in order 
       to preserve certain rights to opt out later.

   (c) All persons who are eligible and may want to participate in 
       the revised settlement must also complete and file with the 
       Claims Office the Proof of Manufacturer Form (included with 
       this Notice). Although there is no fixed deadline for filing 
       this form, benefits cannot be paid under the revised 
       settlement until the participant has filed this form with 
       supporting documentation, and failure to file this form and 
       proof by December 16, 1996, would preclude otherwise eligible 
       participants from obtaining the special benefits and 
       protections accorded to "Current Claimants".

   (d) The benefits, options, and protections given participants 
       under the revised settlement vary based on the following 
       classifications of participants:

       * "Current Claimants": eligible participants who, under terms 
         of the global settlement, (1) mailed to the Claims Office by 
         September 16, 1994, a signed Registration Form and (2) 
         mailed to the Claims Office by October 17, 1994, a 
         substantially complete Current Disease Compensation Form 
         with sufficient documentation to be classified by the Claims 
         Office under the global settlement as a current claimant 
         (without regard to whether any deficiencies in documentation 
         would be classified as minor or major).

       * "Other Registrants": eligible participants who are not 
         "Current Claimants" as defined above, but (1) who registered 
         with Claims Office by March 1, 1995, or (2) who, having 
         previously opted out of the global settlement, withdraw 
         their exclusion and register with Claims Office by 
         December 16, 1996.

       * "Late Registrants": all other eligible participants who  
         register with the Claims Office but are neither "Current 
         Claimants" nor "Other Registrants" as defined above. There 
         presently is no deadline for registration, but the Court may 
         in the future impose a final deadline for registration, and 
         the "Second Opt-Out Right" under 7 above is not provided to 
         persons who register after April 1, 1996.

12. Benefits for Participants Who Have Had at
    least one Bristol, Baxter, or 3M Breast Implant.

Participants with at least one Bristol, Baxter, or 3M breast implant 
are eligible to receive explantation benefits under 12(a), plus 
either long-term benefits under 12(b) or fixed payment benefits under 
12(c). They are also entitled to receive an "Advance Payment" under 
12(d) that will be credited against benefits under 12(b) or 12(c).

   (a) Explantation Benefit: A one-time payment of $3,000 will be 
       paid to participants (other than "Late Registrants") on proof 
       of removal of a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant after April 1, 
       1994, and before December 15, 2010 (end of 15-year program). 
       Payment is in addition to payments under 12(b) or 12(c) below. 
       The settling defendants' obligations to pay their respective 
       shares of these payments are unconditional and do not depend 
       on how many or how few participants elect to participate and 
       qualify for benefits. The Explantation Claim Form enclosed 
       with this Notice contains detailed explanations and 
       instructions for submitting and documenting such claims.

   (b) Long-term Benefits. Participants with at least one Bristol, 
       Baxter, or 3M implant will be paid benefits under the above 
       schedule upon proof, during the 15 years of the program 
       (before December 15, 2010), of having developed a disease or 
       symptomology, at the indicated compensation level, as defined 
       in revised settlement. (See Exhibit E1.) These criteria are 
       more restrictive than those in the original settlement 
       program.

      (1) Benefits of $100,000 or less will be paid in single lump 
          sum payment; larger benefits may be paid in 2 or 3 annual 
          installments. (Defendants are not required to pay more than 
          $100,000 to a recipient in any given year.)

      (2) If before the end of the 15-year period of program a 
          participant documents a condition that would entitle her to 
          a larger payment than previously received, she would at 
          that time be paid the difference between the new amount and 
          any amount previously paid under this schedule.

      (3) Bristol's, Baxter's, and 3M's obligations are unconditional 
          and unlimited in amount (i. e., not affected by how many or 
          how few persons accept the revised settlement or by how 
          much money they must pay under the settlement) with respect 
          to their respective shares of benefits approved under the 
          Long-term Benefit Schedule (other than under 12(b)(2))--

         (A) for GCTS, PM, or DM benefits payable to a Current 
             Claimant who had any claim under the global settlement 
             that would have been either approved or treated as 
             having only minor deficiencies, and

         (B) for SS/SLE benefits to a Current Claimant who had a 
             claim for SS/SLE under the global settlement that would 
             have been either approved or treated as having only 
             minor deficiencies.

      (4) Except as stated in (3) above, the obligations of Bristol, 
          Baxter, and 3M to pay their respective shares of payments 
          under the above schedule are subject to certain maximum      
          limitations. See 20(b) below. However, any failure by them 
          to make payments will at that time give affected 
          participants (other than "Late Registrants") a right to opt 
          out and pursue litigation against the defendants. See 20(e) 
          below.

   (c) Special Options. Benefits. and Protections for "Current 
       Claimants." As an alternative to benefits under 12(b) above, 
       "Current Claimants" (defined in 11(d) above) who have had a 
       Bristol, Baxter, or 3M breast implant may elect to receive a 
       fixed payment under the following Fixed Amount Benefit 
       Schedule based on disability/severity levels specified in the 
       Disease Schedule of the global settlement for diseases 
       described in that Schedule (rather than under the more 
       restrictive criteria of the revised settlement).

Benefits under this Fixed Amount Benefit Schedule constitute "one-
time" settlement compensation, and will not be increased if, after 
being paid benefits under this schedule, a recipient should later 
develop a medical condition that would otherwise qualify for higher 
benefits under this schedule (other than for "rupture" under (2) 
below) or for higher benefits under the "long- term benefit schedule" 
of 12(b).

      (1) Benefits of $25,000 or less will be paid in single lump sum 
          payment; larger benefits will be paid in 2 equal annual 
          installments.

      (2) The increase in benefit level for rupture is limited to 
          "rupture" of a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M silicone-gel implant 
          that is established by explantation and documented by 
          December 16, 1996.

         (A) A Rupture Claim Form is enclosed with this Notice for 
             use in submitting claims for rupture benefits. To 
             qualify for benefits, the participant must complete and 
             mail this form, with proof of the rupture, to the Claims 
             Office in time to be received by the Claims Office by 
             December 16, 1996.

         (B) For further details, including definition of "rupture" 
             and types of acceptable documentation, see the 
             instructions and explanation on back of Rupture Claim 
             Form.

      (3) At the time of being sent their Notification of Status, 
          Current Claimants will be asked to chose between schedules 
          12(b) and 12(c) and they must make this choice before they 
          will be paid benefits under either schedule. Those who 
          choose compensation under schedule 12(c) may not later seek 
          compensation under schedule 12(b). Those who choose 
          compensation under schedule 12(b) may, before being paid 
          benefits under schedule 12(b), elect to return to schedule 
          12(c) but, in such event, the benefits under 12(c) as shown 
          above will be reduced by 25 % .

      (4) The obligations of Bristol, Baxter, and 3M to pay their 
          respective shares of benefits under 12(c) are unconditional 
          and unlimited in amount--not affected by how many or how 
          few persons accept the revised settlement or by how much 
          money they must pay under the settlement. As an additional 
          protection to Current Claimants, the obligations of 
          Bristol, Baxter, and 3M to make payments under schedule 
          12(b) to certain Current Claimants, as described in 
          12(b)(3) above, are unconditional and not subject to any 
          maximum limitations.

   (d) Advance Payments. As soon as the Claims Office can determine 
       that a participant (other than a "Late Registrant") has 
       submitted satisfactory proof of manufacture of a Bristol, 
       Baxter, or 3M breast implant to be eligible to participate and 
       has waived or not timely elected to exercise her "Second Opt-
       Out Right", the participant will be paid $5,000 if a "Current 
       Claimant" or $1,000 if an "Other Registrant", as those terms 
       are defined in 11(d) above. These are "advances" in that they 
       will be credited against (and reduce) amounts later determined 
       to be payable under 12(b) and 12(c) above but will not 
       otherwise be refundable (in the absence of fraud).

13. Benefits for Participants Qualifying because of
    "post 8/84 McGhan" Silicone-gel Breast Implants.

Breast implant recipients who have never received a Bristol, Baxter, 
or 3M implant but are eligible to participate because of having 
received only "post 8/84 McGhan" silicone-gel breast implants (or 
only such implants and Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI, or Mentor implants) 
are eligible to participate, but with more limited benefits than 
provided recipients with a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant. These more 
limited benefits will be paid by McGhan (20%), 3M (40%), and Union 
Carbide (40%) to such persons as follows:

   (a) Benefits. Such participants will be paid benefits under the 
       following schedule upon proof, during the 15 years of the 
       program (before December 15, 2010), of having developed a 
       disease or symptomology, at the indicated compensation level, 
       as defined in the revised settlement. (See Exhibit E1). 
       "Current Claimants" (defined in 11(d) above) may optionally 
       qualify for one-time benefits based on proof of a 
       disability/severity level and disease defined in the Disease 
       Schedule for the global settlement.

   (b) Benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment.

   (c) If during the 15-year period of the program, a participant  
       develops and documents a condition that would entitle her to a 
       larger payment under the revised disease schedule than 
       previously received under that schedule, she would at that 
       time be paid the difference between the new compensation 
       amount and the amount previously paid.

   (d) The obligations of McGhan, 3M, and Union Carbide to pay their 
       respective shares of benefits based on "post 8/84 McGhan" 
       implants to qualifying Current Claimants based on the global 
       settlement disease schedule--and to certain qualifying Current 
       Claimants based on the revised disease schedule, as described 
       in 12(b)((3)(A) and (B)--are unconditional and do not depend 
       upon how many or how few other such Current Claimants elect to 
       participate and qualify for benefits. However, "post-8/84 
       McGhan" benefits do not become payable to Current Claimants 
       until the Court's order becomes "Final" and, therefore, may be 
       delayed if there is an appeal from approval of the revised 
       settlement.

   (e) Except as stated in (d) above, the obligations of McGhan, 3M, 
       and Union Carbide to pay their respective shares of benefits 
       based on "post 8/84 McGhan" implants are subject to certain 
       maximum limitations. See 20(c) below. However, any failure by 
       them to make payments will at that time give affected 
       participants (other than "Late Registrants") a right to opt 
       out and pursue litigation against the defendants. See 20(e) 
       below.

   (f) There are no "Advance Payments" or rupture benefits payable to 
       implant recipients qualifying for eligibility based on "post 
       8/84 McGhan" implants, nor does this revised settlement 
       program provide benefits for removal of "post 8/84 McGhan" 
       implants.

14. Benefits and Options for "Late Registrants."

Late Registrants, as defined in 11(d) above, are eligible for 
benefits only under 12(b) and 13, and not for explantation benefits 
or Advance Payments. Late Registrants will be paid benefits under 
12(b) only if, when, and to the extent Bristol's, Baxter's, and 3M's 
cumulative payments to Current Claimants and Other Registrants under 
12(b) do not exceed their respective maximum obligations as stated in 
20. Late Registrants will be paid benefits under 13 only if, when, 
and to the extent McGhan's, 3M's, and Union Carbide's cumulative 
payments under 13 do not exceed their respective maximum obligations 
as stated in 20. As under the global settlement, Late Registrants 
will have no right to opt out in the event such maximum limitations 
result in their not receiving the full amount shown in the schedules. 
Late Registrants will, however, be entitled to the "Second Opt- Out 
Right" described in 7 above if they register with the Claims Office 
by April 1, 1996.

15. Status of Recipients of Mentor Implants.

Implant recipients who have received one or more Mentor implants in 
addition to Bristol, Baxter, 3M, or "post 8/84 McGhan" implants, are 
eligible to receive the same benefits under the revised settlement as 
others eligible to participate in the revised settlement.

   (a) There are no special benefits based on explantation or rupture 
       of a Mentor implant.

   (b) Persons who have had a Mentor implant but never had a Bristol, 
       Baxter, 3M, or "post 8/84 McGhan" implant are not eligible for 
       benefits under the revised settlement program. They will, 
       however, be eligible to participate in distribution of the 
       approximately $25,800,000 being paid by Mentor under terms of 
       a limited-fund mandatory (non-opt out) class settlement with 
       Mentor (which was not appealed and became final on September 
       10, 1993). The distribution formula for those benefits will be 
       set by the Court at a later time, and it is anticipated that, 
       because of the very limited funds set aside for such 
       recipients, the Court will give preferential, if not 
       exclusive, consideration to those who do not have potential 
       claims against other implant manufacturers.

   (c) Persons who have had a Mentor implant--whether or not eligible 
       to participate in the revised settlement--have the same rights 
       to opt out as provided to other members of the Lindsey class. 
       They should understand, however, that, because of the earlier 
       Mentor limited-fund settlement, they are precluded from 
       instituting or pursuing litigation regarding breast implant 
       claims against the "Mentor Defendants" (Mentor Corporation; 
       Mentor Polymer Technologies, Inc.; Mentor O&O, Inc.; Mentor 
       H/S, Inc.; Mentor Urology, Inc.; Mentor International, Inc.; 
       and Tecknar Corp.) for implantations occurring before
       June 1, 1993.

16. Status of Recipients of Bioplasty Implants.

Implant recipients who have received one or more Bioplasty implants 
in addition to Bristol, Baxter, 3M, or "post 8/84 McGhan" implants, 
are eligible to receive the same benefits under the revised 
settlement as others eligible to participate in the revised 
settlement.

   (a) There are no special benefits based on explantation or rupture 
       of a Bioplasty implant.

   (b) Persons who have had a Bioplasty implant but never had a 
       Bristol, Baxter, 3M, or "post 8/84 McGhan" implant are not 
       eligible for benefits under the revised settlement program. 
       They will, however, be eligible to participate in distribution 
       of the approximately $5,000,000 being set aside by Bioplasty 
       under terms of bankruptcy proceeding. The distribution formula 
       for those benefits will be set by the Court and the Bankruptcy 
       Court for the United States District Court in Minnesota at a 
       later time, and, because of the very limited funds set aside 
       for such recipients, it is anticipated that the courts will 
       give preferential, if not exclusive, consideration to those 
       who do not have potential claims against other implant 
       manufacturers.

   (c) Persons who have had a Bioplasty implant--whether or not 
       eligible to participate in the revised settlement--have the 
       same rights to opt out as provided to other members of the 
       Lindsey class. They should understand, however, that, because 
       of the Bioplasty bankruptcy proceedings, they are precluded 
       from instituting or pursing litigation regarding breast 
       implant claims against the "Bioplasty Defendants" (Bioplasty, 
       Inc.; Bio-Manufacturing, Inc.; and Uroplasty, Inc.).

17. Status of Recipients of Dow Corning Implants.

Implant recipients who have had one or more Dow Corning implants in 
addition to Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implants may participate in the 
revised settlement, but will have reduced benefits under the revised 
settlement in view of their right to present claims related to their 
Dow Corning implants.

   (a) Benefits for such participants under 12(b) and 12(c) are 50% 
       of the benefits for those without Dow Corning implants. 
       Participants in the revised settlement do not, however, waive 
       any claims against Dow Corning, though they should understand 
       that any claims against Dow Corning are subject to certain 
       automatic stays and other orders that may issue from the 
       Bankruptcy Court for the United States District Court for the 
       Eastern District of Michigan and, to be preserved, may require 
       presentation of a proof of claim in that court.

   (b) There are no special benefits based on explantation or rupture 
       of a Dow Corning implant.

   (c) Persons who have received a Dow Corning implant but never 
       received a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant are not eligible for 
       benefits under the revised settlement program even if they 
       received a "post 8/84 McGhan" implant.

   (d) Persons who have received a Dow Corning implant--whether or 
       not eligible to participate in the revised settlement--have 
       the same opt-out rights as other members of the Lindsey class. 
       They should understand, however, that any claims against Dow 
       Corning are subject to certain automatic stays and other 
       orders that may issue from the Bankruptcy Court for the United 
       States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan 
       and, to be preserved, may require presentation of a proof of 
       claim in that court.

   (e) Implant recipients will likely be mailed a separate notice 
       from the Bankruptcy Court for the United States District Court 
       for the Eastern District of Michigan explaining procedures and 
       possibly deadlines for presenting or preserving claims against 
       Dow Corning.

18. Definition and Status of "Foreign Claimants".

"Foreign Claimants" were defined in the global settlement, and 
continue to be defined under this Notice, as being breast implant 
recipients (i) who were not citizens or resident aliens of the United 
States, (ii) whose breast implants were all implanted outside the 
United States, and (iii) who had not received any compensation from 
any then settling defendant or released party for breast implant 
injuries or expenses under the laws or procedures of a country other 
than the United States. Such persons were offered more limited 
settlement benefits under the global settlement than the domestic 
members of the Lindsey class, but were also provided additional 
guarantees regarding opt-out rights, as well as the opportunity (if 
they did not participate affirmatively in the global settlement) to 
pursue breast- implant claims in the administrative and judicial 
tribunals of their own countries. Foreign claimants from Australia 
and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec were excluded from 
the Lindsey class unless they affirmatively opted into the 
settlement.

   (a) After issuance of the notice of the global settlement, this 
       Court in several orders relating to foreign recipients who had 
       opted out of the global settlement concluded that litigation 
       in courts of the United States by citizens of Australia, 
       Canada, and England is barred under the doctrine of "forum non 
       conveniens" (without prejudice to pursuit of claims by such 
       persons in Australian, Canadian, and English courts), but that 
       litigation in the courts of the United States by some citizens 
       of New Zealand is not barred under that doctrine. In those 
       orders the court did not specifically address claims by opt-
       out foreign claimants from other countries, but indicated that 
       such litigation rights would be resolved by applying the 
       principles used in addressing issues relating to the 
       Australian, Canadian, English, and New Zealand claimants.

   (b) Preferring administrative resolution or litigation--in this 
       country or in other countries--over any immediate settlement 
       as a means to address claims of Foreign Claimants, the 
       settling defendants under the revised settlement program are 
       not now making any offer to settle in this forum the pending 
       or potential claims of Foreign Claimants, and such persons are 
       not eligible for benefits under the revised settlement 
       program. The defendants' declination to provide settlement 
       offers to such persons at this time in this forum does not, 
       however, preclude the possibility of their willingness to 
       consider settlement of such claims outside the terms of this 
       settlement offer, whether in courts of the United States or in 
       judicial or administrative tribunals of other countries.

   (c) Foreign Claimants who want to pursue or institute litigation 
       in the United States against Bristol, Baxter, 3M, McGhan, or 
       Union Carbide have the right--as guaranteed under terms of the 
       global settlement--to do so (subject to any objection by those 
       defendants under doctrines such as "forum non conveniens"), 
       but, to do so, must exercise their "Second Opt-Out Right" as 
       described in 7 above, either at this time or after being 
       mailed a Notification by the Claims Office regarding their 
       status. To eliminate any need to make this decision 
       prematurely, they are allowed to delay making this decision 
       until sent the Notification by the Claims Office, with 
       statutes of limitation and repose in this country being 
       suspended until 30 days after the time allowed in that 
       Notification for opting out.

   (d) Foreign Claimants who want to pursue or institute claims 
       against implant manufacturers or distributors in the judicial 
       or administrative tribunals of their own countries may do so, 
       and need not file any further form or election with the Claims 
       Office.

19. Children of Breast Implant Recipients.

The revised settlement program does not provide any special benefits 
to children of breast implant recipients. Such children are, with 
respect to any claims for personal injury or death allegedly 
resulting from their mother's breast implant, hereby excluded from 
membership in any class previously established by the Court, and any 
such claims may be brought before December 15, 1997, or, if later, 
within two years after the claim accrues or the child attains the age 
of majority under applicable state law.

20. Limits on Obligations of Defendants; Additional Opt-Out Rights.

   (a) The obligations of the settling defendants to make payments 
       under this program are several, not joint, and are limited to 
       the approved claims involving implants from that defendant (or 
       with respect to which that defendant is agreeing to make 
       payments).

   (b) If a claimant has had implants from more than one of Bristol, 
       Baxter, or 3M, their obligations are divided simply on the 
       basis of the number of such defendants whose implants the 
       claimant had. For example, if a claimant had one or more 
       Bristol implants, one or more Baxter implants, a "post 8/84 
       McGhan" implant, and a Mentor implant and was entitled to a 
       $150,000 payment, then Bristol would be responsible for 
       payment of $75,000 and Baxter for payment of $75,000. 
       Enhancement payments for rupture and explantation benefits are 
       the sole responsibility of the defendant whose implant 
       ruptured or was explanted.

      (1) The obligations of Bristol, Baxter, and 3M to make payments 
          under 12(a), 12(c), and 12(d) are not subject to any
          maximum limitations.

      (2) As explained in 12(b)(4), their obligations to make 
          payments under 12(b) (other than to certain Current 
          Claimants as explained in 12(b)(3)) are subject to certain 
          limitations; namely, a maximum of $725,000,000 (less 
          amounts paid for explantation expenses of Other 
          Registrants), with their respective obligations for such 
          12(b) benefits being as follows:

          * Bristol's cumulative obligation for such 12(b) benefits 
            ($400,000,000) increases in the amount of $27,600,000 per     
            year for the first 10 years and $24,800,000 per year for 
            the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for 
            explantation expenses of Other Registrants)

          * Baxter's cumulative obligation for such 12(b) benefits  
            ($193,000,000) increases in the amount of $13,300,000 per 
            year for the first 10 years and $12,000,000 per year for 
            the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for 
            explantation expenses of Other Registrants)

          * 3M's cumulative obligation for such 12(b) benefits 
            ($132,000,000) increases in the amount of $9,100,000 per 
            year for the first 10 years and $8,200,000 per year for 
            the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for 
            explantation expenses of Other Registrants)

   (c) The obligations to pay benefits under 13 based on "post 8/84 
       McGhan" implants are divided between McGhan (20%), 3M (40%), 
       and Union Carbide (40%).

      (1) Their respective obligations to make payments to Current 
          Claimants are not subject to any maximum limitations.

      (2) As explained in 13(e), their obligations to make payments 
          under 13 (other than to Current Claimants as explained in 
          13(d)) are subject to certain limitations; namely, a 
          maximum of $30,000,000, with their respective obligations 
          for such benefits being as follows:

         * McGhan's cumulative obligation for such benefits 
           ($6,000,000) increases in the amount of $400,000 per year 
           for 15 years (less the amount, if any, that its payments  
           to Current Claimants based on "post 8/84 McGhan" implants 
           exceed $38,400,000)

         * 3M's cumulative obligation for such benefits ($12,000,000) 
           increases in the amount of $800,000 per year for 15 years 
           (less the amount, if any, that its payments to Current 
           Claimants based on "post 8/84 McGhan" implants exceed 
           $76,800,000)

         * Union Carbide's cumulative obligation for such benefits 
           ($12,000,000) increases in the amount of $800,000 per year 
           for 15 years (less the amount, if any, that its payments 
           to Current Claimants based on "post 8/84 McGhan" implants 
           exceed $76,800,000)

   (d) The settling defendants are to pay into the fund established 
       by the Court and maintained by the Escrow Agent such amounts 
       as, from time to time during the 15-year period of the 
       program, are estimated by the Court with the assistance of the 
       Claims Office and the Escrow Agent to be needed (after 
       considering undistributed funds previously contributed to the 
       fund by that defendant and the limitations under (b) and (c) 
       above) to pay benefits (or installments) for which that 
       settling defendant will become obligated to pay during the 
       next 3 months. For further information concerning the fund, 
       see 31.

   (e) If the cumulative limitations stated in (b) and (c) above 
       result in any year in a participant (other than a Late 
       Registrant) not being paid the full amount (or installment) 
       shown in the schedule, then such person would at that time 
       have the option either (1) to accept a reduced amount based on 
       the defendant's obligated payment (with a carry forward of the 
       unpaid portion for potential payment in future years if within 
       the defendant's obligated payments) or (2) to opt out from the 
       settlement, with the rights to pursue litigation against the 
       settling defendants for compensatory damages (but not punitive 
       or statutory multiple damages). Participants electing to opt 
       out (i) must first return any amounts previously paid under 
       the program (other than for explantation expenses or as an 
       Advance Payment) and (ii) shall be given the opportunity, if 
       they so elect, to participate in procedures to be established 
       by the Court, in an effort to resolve their claims.

   (f) If a participant's claims against one settling defendant have 
       been released or resolved by final judgment, she will be paid 
       only the prorated benefits due from other settling defendants 
       with respect to which her claims have not been released or 
       resolved by final judgment.

21. Pre-Existing Diseases; Successive Claims.

   (a) For claims under the revised settlement based on the revised  
       disease criteria (Exhibit E1)--

      (1) benefits may not be obtained for a disease or condition if  
          the qualifying symptoms existed before the date of the 
          first implantation; and

      (2) a claimant receiving benefits under the Long-term Benefit 
          Schedule may make an additional claim during the 15 years 
          of the program if, as a result of additional symptoms, she 
          can establish that she is entitled to a higher level of 
          compensation either because of a new disease or 
          symptomology or because of an increase in the compensation 
          level. In such event, amounts previously paid will be 
          subtracted from the amount otherwise payable for the new 
          condition.

   (b) For claims under the revised settlement based on the disease  
       and disability/severity schedule of the global settlement, the  
       provisions stated in the original notice govern the effect of  
       symptoms and disabilities that existed before the claimant's  
       first breast implant. Under those provisions, no symptom is  
       considered for purposes of establishing ACTD if it existed  
       before the date of first implantation. A participant who,  
       before her first breast implant, had another covered disease  
       listed on the original disease schedule would, if the benefit  
       level based on the disease or disability/severity increased  
       after that implant, be eligible for benefits measured by the  
       difference between the amount payable for the new disease and  
       disability/severity level and the amount that would have been  
       payable for the pre-existing condition.

22. Claims of Health-care Providers.

   (a) Under current terms of the revised settlement program,  
       reimbursement and subrogation-type claims by insurers,  
       governmental agencies, and other health-care providers will,  
       to the extent enforceable under applicable laws, be the  
       responsibility of participants; the settling defendants will  
       have no additional responsibilities to such insurers,  
       agencies, and providers for participants electing to accept  
       benefits under the revised settlement.

   (b) However, additional settlement negotiations are presently  
       underway between the settling defendants and many of the  
       private health-benefit providers and insurers which attempted  
       to intervene in the global class settlement to assert  
       reimbursement or subrogation claims. The general nature of  
       these discussions is that, in exchange for additional payments  
       to such providers and insurers by the settling defendants-- 
       over and above their obligations to pay benefits to  
       participants under the revised settlement--such providers and  
       insurers would agree not to pursue reimbursement or  
       subrogation claims against implant recipients participating in  
       the revised settlement. As of the printing of this Notice,  
       these discussions have not resulted in a final agreement  
       approved by those parties, but they are sufficiently promising  
       as to justify advising eligible participants of this potential  
       supplemental agreement that would be of substantial benefit  
       under the revised settlement program to many implant  
       recipients. Updated information regarding the status of these  
       negotiations will, when available, be posted on the Claims  
       Office recorded- message telephone line (800-887-6828); and,  
       if the negotiations are successful, you will be advised of the  
       details in the Notification of Status letter to be sent to you  
       by the Claims Office.

23. Releases.

   (a) Eligible implant recipients who do not timely opt out will for  
       themselves (and for their personal representatives and family  
       members with respect to representative or derivative claims)  
       waive and release, except as provided in 20(e), their rights  
       to institute or pursue breast-implant related claims against  
       the Settling Defendants and Released Parties identified in  
       Exhibit B1.

    (b) Claims against Dow Corning and other manufacturers,  
       distributors, or suppliers of breast implants or component  
       parts of such implants--or against doctors, hospitals, or  
       other health-care providers--not listed in Exhibit B1 are not  
       part of the revised settlement and are not released or  
       dismissed. Claims against Mentor, Bioplasty, and Dow Corning  
       may, however, be barred or restricted as a result of prior  
       settlements or bankruptcy proceedings, as explained in 15-17  
       above.

24. Effect of Appeals.

An appeal does not suspend the obligation of settling defendants to 
make payments under 12(a) or, upon receiving an executed standard-
form release, under 12(c) or 12(d). Depending on the issues raised, 
an appeal may suspend the obligation of defendants to make payments 
under 13 and (unless a mutually satisfactory release is executed) 
under 12(b).

25. Defendants' Position; Inadmissibility of Settlement.

   (a) Although agreeing to the revised settlement, the settling  
       defendants continue to deny any wrongdoing or any legal  
       liability of any kind. They have agreed to the revised  
       settlement not only because of the risk of adverse judgments  
       in some cases, but also because of the substantial time,  
       expense, and other burdens they would incur even in  
       successfully defending against thousands of existing cases and  
       cases that might be filed in the future. These defendants  
       believe that, at the same time, the settlement will also be in  
       the best interests of those who have been implanted with their  
       products by expediting the time for resolving claims and that,  
       by taking advantage of the potential savings in "transaction  
       costs" resulting from a class settlement, the amounts actually  
       paid to many participants under the settlement would, in their  
       opinion, exceed recoveries that might be obtained through  
       individual claims and lawsuits.

   (b) Establishment of and negotiations leading to the revised  
       settlement program, and Claims Office determinations and  
       payments under the program, do not constitute any admission by  
       the settling defendants of fault, liability, or damages and  
       will not be admissible in evidence in any proceeding for such  
       purposes or as evidence of ownership, control, agency, or  
       relationship between the settling defendants and the released  
       parties in the event an implant recipient proceeds with  
       litigation against the defendants (except that any judgment  
       obtained by such a person will be reduced by any payment under  
       this settlement).

26. Incorporation of Terms of Global Settlement.

The revised settlement program implements paragraph 18 of the notice 
of the global settlement by reducing--for those eligible to 
participate--the extent of ratcheting that would otherwise occur and 
by preserving--for those not eligible to participate--their rights to 
opt out of the class (while providing an extension of the period 
during which statutes of limitation and repose would be suspended). 
Except to the extent modified by or inconsistent with the terms of 
this Notice, the settlement terms announced in the April 1994 notice 
(including, for example, provisions relating to contribution and 
indemnification claims against the settling defendants and released 
parties) remain in effect and govern rights, obligations, and 
options. The benefits provided under the revised settlement supersede 
and are in lieu of all benefits that participants and their attorneys 
might have had under the global settlement. The Court retains general 
powers to administer and implement the settlement, including the 
power to interpret the terms of the settlement and to resolve on an 
equitable basis conflicting claims to benefits arising because of 
death of a participant or asserted assignments or liens relating to 
payment of benefits.

ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES

27. Privately-retained Counsel.

Fees and expenses of attorneys individually retained by Lindsey class 
members who have not previously opted out, whether in presenting 
claims under the global settlement, or in presenting claims under the 
revised settlement, or in instituting or pursuing claims as new "opt-
outs" will be borne by such persons based on applicable state law and 
the individual arrangements made between them and their attorneys, 
but subject to certain limitations indicated below.

   (a) The fees charged by individually-retained attorneys to an  
       implant recipient who accepts the terms of the revised  
       settlement shall not exceed the sum of--

      (1) 10% of the first $10,000 paid to such participant under the  
          settlement;

      (2) 22.5% of the next $40,000 paid to such participant under 
          the settlement; and

      (3) 30% of the amount in excess of $50,000 paid to such 
          participant under the settlement.

   (b) Amounts paid to or on behalf of participants as explantation  
       benefits shall not be counted as amounts paid to a participant  
       for purposes of calculating the above limitations.
 
   (c) The Court reserves the power to establish additional standards  
       and limitations affecting the expenses that individually- 
       retained attorneys may charge those participating in the  
       revised settlement.

   (d) Benefits payable to participants under 12, 13, and 14 shall  
       not be subject to any reduction for fees and expenses of class  
       counsel for representing the Lindsey class or for other  
       "common benefit" services (or for administrative expenses of  
       the Claims Office and others in implementing the revised  
       settlement).

28. Funding of "Common Benefit" Fees and Expenses.

Order No. 13 was entered in CV92-P-10000-S in July 1993 in order to 
provide for the fair and equitable sharing among breast-implant 
recipients who presented claims in federal court of the cost of the 
special services performed, and expenses incurred, by attorneys 
acting for the "common benefit" of all such claimants. Services in 
conducting common discovery, for example, would be beneficial not 
only to implant recipients who later chose to pursue litigation, but 
also to those who later accepted a settlement offer prompted at least 
in part by the existence of such discovery.

   (a) As a means for complying with Order No. 13, the settling  
       defendants under the revised settlement program will pay into  
       the previously established fund an amount equal to 6% of the  
       amounts paid under 12, 13, and 14. These payments will be paid  
       as a surcharge and will not reduce the amounts payable to  
       participants under 12. 13. or 14.

   (b) Order No. 13 continues in place, and will continue to govern  
       the resolution, whether by trial or settlement, of breast- 
       implant claims of persons who do not accept (or are not  
       eligible to participate in) the revised settlement, but who  
       either were members of the Lindsey class (and did not exercise  
       their initial right to opt out) or, although not members of  
       the Lindsey class (whether because they were ineligible or  
       because they exercised their initial right to opt out) now or  
       in the future have breast-implant claims that are filed in or  
       properly removed to federal court. What this means is that 6%  
       of the "gross monetary recovery" obtained by such persons,  
       whether by trial or settlement, is to be withheld and paid  
       into the common-benefit expense fund.

   (c) Under terms of Order No. 13, if the amounts paid into the fund  
       exceed the amounts ultimately approved by the Court as proper  
       charges against the fund, the excess will be distributed to  
       implant recipients on a pro-rata basis as the Court determines  
       to be fair and equitable.

29. Employment of Attorneys.

You may retain an attorney of your own choice for advice concerning 
your rights or to provide services either in presenting a claim under 
the revised settlement or in instituting litigation, but you will be 
responsible for the fees and expenses of such attorney as explained 
in 27. You are not required, however, to have private counsel in 
order to submit claims under the revised settlement.

CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION

30. Claims Office.

The Claims Office will continue to process and evaluate registrations 
and claims as expeditiously as possible, but may give priority of 
consideration to claims by claimants who, through Proof of 
Manufacturer forms, indicate they may have had a Bristol, Baxter, 3M, 
or "post 8/84 McGhan" implant (with particular priority to claims by 
those who have waived "Second Opt-Out Rights") and may defer 
consideration of submissions by those who appear to be ineligible 
under the revised settlement program.

   (a) As claims are processed and evaluated, the Claims Office will  
       send each person a Notification of Status indicating whether  
       her proof of manufacturer identification is satisfactory;  
       whether she is classified as a Current Claimant, Other  
       Registrant, or Late Registrant; whether, if a Current  
       Claimant, any documentation submitted in support of a rupture  
       supplement is satisfactory; whether there are any deficiencies  
       in the submission; and whether there is a deadline for  
       submitting supplemental documentation relating to  
       deficiencies. If there are deficiencies in any of the  
       materials that are subject to correction, the Notification  
       will so advise. This Notification, which triggers the opt out  
       period under 7(c), will be sent to the last address provided  
       to the Claims Office, with a copy to the person's attorney if  
       one has been indicated.

   (b) The Claims Office will continue to implement procedures  
       designed to detect and prevent payment of fraudulent claims.  
       To deter potential fraud, all claims must be signed under  
       penalties of perjury. Since the Postal Service will be used in  
       the processing and payment of claims, submission of fraudulent  
       claims will violate the criminal laws of the United States and  
       subject those responsible to criminal prosecution in the  
       federal courts.

   (c) Under its plenary responsibilities to assure an acceptable  
       level of reliability and quality control of claims, the Claims  
       Office may require, without expense to the claimant, an  
       examination or review by a physician or laboratory selected by  
       the Claims Office.

   (d) Expenses of the Claims Office will continue to be paid from  
       the funds initially provided under terms of the global  
       settlement, with such supplemental contributions from the  
       settling defendants as, during the 15-year period of the  
       program, the Court determines to be necessary for such  
       purposes and without reducing the benefits payable to  
       participants under the revised settlement program.

   (e) Operations of the Claims Office will be subject to the  
       continuing jurisdiction of the Court and subject to Court  
       review.

31. Fund Administration.

The fund into which the settling defendants' payments will be made is 
a continuation of the MDL 926 Settlement Fund established under Order 
No. 15, with Texas as its domicile, location, and place of creation 
and administration, and with eligible participants being its 
beneficiaries. Ann Tyrrell Cochran, Claims Administrator, has general 
responsibilities for collecting, collating, processing, evaluating, 
and quantifying claims. Edgar C. Gentle, III, has been designated as 
Escrow Agent and as Chairman of the Investment Committee, with the 
duties approved by the Court by order dated November 23, 1994 (as 
modified by further Court orders). Also on the Investment Committee 
are Don Springmeyer (plaintiffs' designee) and Todd M. Poland 
(defendants' designee).

32. Filing of Elections, Forms, and Documentation.

   (a) All elections, forms, and documentation described in this  
       Notice are to be filed with the Claims Office, and not with  
       the Court. Please do not send "courtesy" copies to the Court.  
       Please do not send additional copies of materials with a  
       request for acknowledgment--handling of duplicate copies only  
       results in increased administrative costs and delay.

   (b) Deadlines for providing elections, forms, or documentation to  
       the Claims Office are to be determined by the date such items  
       are actually received in the Claims Office, rather than date  
       of mailing. Facsimile transmissions are not acceptable.

33. Documentation.

Current Claimants, Other Registrants, and Late Registrants may, 
throughout the 15- year period of the program, submit documentation 
respecting manufacturer identification, medical conditions and 
disability, and other matters affecting eligibility or entitlement to 
benefits in accordance with governing procedures. The Claims Office 
may, however, establish regulations relating to the submission of 
medical documentation and setting reasonable periods at which to 
conduct evaluations or re-evaluations of a person's eligibility and 
benefits based on supplemental submissions and for submission of 
supplemental documentation after notice of deficiencies. Initial 
documentation showing manufacturer identification must be presented 
to the Claims Office no later than December 16, 1996, by participants 
claiming status as Current Claimants, as must documentation of a 
claim for rupture supplement under 12(c)(2).

34. Court Review of Claims Office Determinations.

A claimant dissatisfied with the decision made by Claims Officers may 
appeal to the Claims Administrator and, if still dissatisfied, may 
seek a further review, on the basis of the record evidence, by the 
Court (or a person designated by the Court to conduct such review). 
No other appeals or reviews are permitted, and the settling 
defendants will have no right of appeal or review from determinations 
made by the Claims Office.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

35. Court Filings and Other Documents.

You may inspect documents on file with the Court at the office of the 
Clerk, 1729 Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama, 35203, during 
regular business hours and may obtain copies of these documents (such 
as the revised settlement program and the Court's order approving 
transmittal of this offer to class members) by payment of the 
prescribed charges. The Clerk's office is not permitted to give legal 
advice. The Claims Office (800-600-0311 and 713-951-9106) is 
authorized to answer administrative and clerical inquiries relating 
to claims and the claims process, but not to give legal advice. 
Contact the Claims Office if you need a copy of the Disease Schedule 
that was transmitted with the original global settlement notice.

36. Assistance.

You should save this Notice for reference concerning your rights and 
benefits, the claims process, the important deadlines, and telephone 
numbers. In addition to the limited information available from the 
Claims Office (see 35 above), you may obtain further information 
concerning the revised settlement and your rights and options in any 
one or more of the following ways:

   * by reading the enclosed booklet, entitled "Questions and  
     Answers", which has been approved by the Court.

     supervise the advice given by such persons.)

   * by contacting any of the various "support groups" formed to  
     provide assistance to breast implant recipients and their  
     families. (Note: these support groups operate independently of  
     the Court, and their communications and advice are not  
     monitored, reviewed, or supervised by the Court.)

This Notice has been approved by Judge Pointer for distribution to 
breast-implant recipients as an official notice of the Court

EXHIBIT E1--Revised Disease/Symptomology Definitions and Compensation 
Levels

I. General
                  
    A. A claimant must file with the Claims Office all medical  
       records establishing the required findings or laboratory  
       abnormalities. Qualifying findings must have occurred within a  
       single 24-month period within the five years immediately  
       preceding the submission of the claim. (Findings supplemented  
       in response to a deficiency letter sent by the Claims Office  
       do not have to fall within the 24-month period outlined  
       above.)

    B. If exclusions are noted for a required finding, the physician  
       making the finding or ordering the test must affirmatively  
       state that those listed exclusions are not present. The  
       physician recording a GCTS finding or making a disease  
       diagnosis must also affirmatively state that the qualifying  
       symptoms did not exist before the date of first implantation.  
       (This statement can be based upon patient history so long as  
       consistent with medical records in the physician's  
       possession.) Failure to make these affirmative statements will  
       result in a deficiency letter. All underlying office charts,  
       radiology/pathology reports, and test results must be supplied  
       to the Claims Office.

II. Scleroderma (SS)
                  
A claim for scleroderma must include a diagnosis of systemic 
sclerosis/scleroderma made by a board-certified rheumatologist based 
upon personal examination of the patient. [Exclusion: localized 
scleroderma] Supporting medical documentation must affirmatively 
reveal that the major or at least two of the minor criteria listed 
below are present:

    A. Major criterion: Proximal scleroderma -- symmetric thickening,  
       tightening, and induration of the skin of the fingers and the  
       skin proximal to the metatarsophalangeal or  
       metatarsophalangeal joints. The changes may affect the entire  
       extremity, face, neck, and trunk (thorax and abdomen).  
       Description of this criterion is adequate if the board- 
       certified rheumatologist records that physical examination of  
       the patient revealed scleroderma skin thickening, and  
       adequately describes the parts of the body where that  
       thickened skin was found.

    B. Minor Criteria:

       1. Sclerodactyly: Above-indicated skin changes limited to the 
          fingers.

       2. Digital pitting scars or loss of substance from the finger  
          pad: Depressed areas at tips of fingers or loss of digital  
          pad tissue as a result of ischemia

       3. Bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis: Bilateral reticular pattern  
          of linear or lineonodular densities most pronounced in  
          basilar portions of the lungs on standard chest  
          roentgenogram; may assume appearance of diffuse mottling or  
          "honeycomb lung." These changes should not be attributable  
          to primary lung disease.

Compensation Levels:

    A. Death resulting from SS, or severe chronic renal involvement  
       manifested by a glomerular filtration rate of less than 50% of  
       the age- and gender-adjusted norm, as measured by an adequate  
       24-hour urine specimen collection.

    B. Clinically significant cardio-pulmonary manifestations of  
       sclerodermal(1) or proximal scleroderma on the trunk (thorax and  
       abdomen).

    C. A diagnosis of scleroderma in accordance with the above  
       criteria that does not involve the findings in A or B above.


       1. As manifested by interstitial fibrosis (based upon physical  
          examination findings and abnormalities seen on chest x-ray  
          or chest CT) or pulmonary hypertension (based upon physical  
          examination findings and 2-D Echo doppler or angiography  
          with hemodynamic measurements showing pulmonary artery  
          pressures of greater than 25 TORR).


III. Lupus (SLE)

A claim for SLE must include a diagnosis of SLE (lupus) made by a 
board-certified rheumatologist based upon personal examination of the 
patient. [Exclusion: mild lupus (SLE not requiring regular medical 
attention including doctor visits and regular prescription 
medications)] Supporting medical documentation must affirmatively 
reveal that at least four of the following 11 criteria are present:

  1. Malar rash             Fixed erythema, flat or raised, over the  
                            malar eminences, tending to spare the  
                            nasolabial folds

  2. Discoid rash           Erythematous raised patches with adherent

EXHIBIT G -- Implant Brands and Manufacturers

The left-hand column is a list of companies, implant brands, 
"designer" implant names, and other names or phrases that might be 
used in medical records to describe a particular type of breast 
implant. The column to the right identifies the company with which 
that brand is associated for purposes of this revised settlement 
program. If implantation date ranges are supplied for an implant an 
appropriate notation is to the right of each date range.

Implants noted as Mentor (for post 8/84 McGhan benefits) that have a 
star (*) before Mentor will be treated as Baxter implants if a Baxter 
lot number can be supplied for that implant Lists of lot and serial 
numbers for Bristol, Baxter,and 3M implants are available from the 
Claims Office upon request.

To prove that a McGhan implant which was implanted after August 2, 
1984, was wholly or partly manufactured before that date (and 
therefore can be treated as a 3M implant rather than a post 8/84 
McGhan implant), you should provide proof of the 3M name or 
qualifying serial number. A list of McGhan serial numbers qualifying 
as 3M implants is available from the Claims Office upon request.

Notations after the names Mentor or Bioplasty that say "(for purposes 
of post-8/84 McGhan benefits)" mean that they can be considered as 
Mentor or Bioplasty implants for purposes of determining eligibility 
under the program described in this notice, but that no determination 
can be made at this time as to whether one of these implants will 
trigger eligibility under the distribution program for the Mentor or 
Bioplasty funds. Further clarification of the status of those 
implants will be included in the more detailed information that will 
be available later about the Mentor and Bioplasty funds.

<P>Netscape attorney Gary Reback sent this letter to The Wall Street
Journal's online edition in connection with Netscape's ongoing
conflict with Microsoft. Netscape alleges that Microsoft is using
anticompetitive tactics against the developers of the most popular
World Wide Web browser software, Netscape Navigator, in
violation of a 1995 consent decree reached between Microsoft and the
Justice Department.

REBACK LETTER SUBMITTED TO WSJ INTERACTIVE
EDITION

Mr. Budde:

I have read the postings that the WSJ has received regarding its
recent deal with Microsoft. WSJ's decision to prevent its readers
from receiving content unless they use a Microsoft browser
obviously has struck an angry chord, as its readers plainly believe
that they should be able to choose which browser they want to use,
rather than have their choice dictated for them. WSJ's readers seem
to have taken particular offense at the fact that, based on WSJ s
reporting of the deal, Microsoft has paid WSJ to limit its readers'
ability to use the browser of their choice.

As you no doubt are aware, this is not the first time that Microsoft
has attempted to use its market power to limit user choice. For
example, a few weeks ago, Microsoft tried to strong-arm Netscape
into cooperating with it in a scheme to prevent customers from being
able to use Windows NT Workstation as a platform for Web servers.
We reported Microsoft's conduct regarding NT to the Justice
Department, but this exclusionary behavior turns out to be just the tip
of the iceberg. Netscape has received numerous additional complaints
from customers and others in the industry, and it has retained my
firm to investigate these incidents. We have found what we believe
to be a wide range of serious antitrust violations, some of which we
documented in another letter last week to the Justice Department.

As Netscape made clear when it rejected Microsoft s NT Workstation
scheme, Netscape believes that consumers should get to choose what
products they want, rather than have their choices dictated for them.
We hope that WSJ will promote consumer choice, rather than be on
the side of those who would restrict it.

We would also appreciate it if WSJ will disclose to its customers
whether it already has entered into terms that put it on the side of
exclusion -- for example, whether WSJ is precluded from giving
Netscape Navigator equal status; whether it is prevented from
displaying the Netscape NOW logo or linking to Netscape s site;
whether WSJ is required to use Microsoft s browser for its internal
use; and whether WSJ s decision to use ActiveX was one that it made
on the merits, or whether it was required in order to get the Microsoft
payments. Finally, if WSJ believes that it is prevented from
disclosing these terms because it has agreed to  nondisclosure  -- one
of Microsoft s favorite tactics -- I would urge it to reconsider whether
it properly can honor such a term, if in the process it must suppress
reporting on what is obviously an important issue of great interest to
its readers.

<P>Netscape Communications claims Microsoft is violating its
antitrust agreement with the government and wants the Justice
Department to investigate. In this letter, Netscape says Microsoft is
using its dominance in personal computer operating systems to
influence computer makers, Internet service companies and others
into giving Microsoft's Internet software prominence over
competitors like Netscape. For instance, Netscape claims Microsoft
is charging less money for its Windows 95 operating system to PC
makers who agree to make other Web browser programs less
accessible to computer users.
Browser programs allow people to find and work with information
on the Web. Netscape's Navigator is used by about 80 percent of
people who browse the Web while Microsoft's Explorer is used by
about 10 percent.
Both companies recently released new versions of their products.
Microsoft charged Netscape's letter was timed around the rollouts
because its browser is catching up to Netscape's in technical features.

Joel Klein, Esq.
Deputy Assistant Attorney General
International/Policy Matters
Department of Justice
10th & Constitution, N.W.
Room 3208
Washington, D.C. 20530

CONFIDENTIAL
VIA FACSIMILE

RE:  Microsoft Illegal Conduct And Ramifications For Consent
Decree

Dear Joel:

This letter is intended to supplement and clarify our earlier
communications with the Department concerning conduct by
Microsoft that violates both the existing Consent Decree as well as
the substantive antitrust laws.

The Internet software industry currently exhibits great innovation,
with the development of an astonishing number of new products and
technologies that promise to transform the way that computers are
used. These new products and technologies are being developed by
a wide array of companies, from new start-ups to more established
software firms. Many of the smaller Internet software vendors
(including companies that make Internet software tools and servers),
however, now face the threat of elimination from the market by
reason of Microsoft's illegal conduct. While Netscape has greater
resources to fight back against Microsoft's predation, both in the
marketplace and through means such as this letter, many of these
smaller Internet software vendors have made it clear that they have
insufficient resources to fight back against Microsoft's illegal conduct
in the market.

Much of Microsoft's conduct appears to violate both the letter and
spirit of the existing Consent Decree entered in United States v.
Microsoft. Indeed, Microsoft's behavior is, if anything, more
anticompetitive and pernicious than the conduct addressed
specifically in the Decree. In engaging in this far-reaching
anticompetitive behavior, Microsoft hurts consumers and restricts
consumer choice.

Microsoft's Conduct

Microsoft's recent conduct far exceeds any reasonable definition of
procompetitive, welfare enhancing behavior. Microsoft has made
written offers to OEMs; Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"),
including many "local and long distance telephone companies";
Value-Added Resellers ("VARs"), including systems integrators; and
to large corporations. These offers provide for either clandestine side
payments, discounts on the Microsoft desktop operating system
(Windows), or payments in the form of "real estate" on the Windows
95 screen. These inducements are made on the condition that the
offeree make competitors' "browsers" (more correctly known as
"Internet clients") far less accessible to users than Microsoft's own
"browser." (Microsoft's browser, as you know, is called Internet
Explorer.) A number of these offers have already been accepted and
are in the process of being implemented.

In addition to these under-the-table arrangements, Netscape's recent
investigation has uncovered numerous additional steps that Microsoft
has taken for the purpose of eliminating competition in the Internet
software markets. Microsoft's tactics include manipulating the
disclosure of APIs; predatory pricing; and the bundling of products
such as FrontPage, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft's Internet server
("Internet Information Server," or "IIS") with Microsoft's monopoly
operating systems. This anticompetitive behavior directly threaten
numerous small Internet software companies that are competing in
these markets. Microsoft's illegal acts include the following:

*    With respect to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), i.e.,
personal computer makers, Microsoft began by bundling its
"browser" free for redistribution. Now, Netscape has been informed
that Microsoft has gone even further, offering OEMs discounts on
the license price of the Windows operating system if the OEM not
only continues to feature the Microsoft browser on its desktop, but
also makes competitors' browsers far less accessible to users.

The net effect is this. Every OEM automatically gets the Microsoft
browser on the Windows desktop provided by Microsoft, whether
desired by the OEM or not. If the OEM wants to give the consumer a
fair and even choice of browsers by placing competitors' browser
icons in a comparable place on the desktop, Netscape has been
informed that the OEM must pay $3 more for Windows 95 than an
OEM that takes the Windows bundle as is and agrees to make the
competitors' browsers far less accessible and useful to customers.

Some OEMs have gone so far as to indicate that the Microsoft
Windows discount really buys exclusivity. For example, Hitachi has
refused to bundle Netscape Navigator with its  laptop computer
because it says that it is prohibited from carrying the product under
its license with Microsoft. Indeed, Hitachi now has gone even
further, and informed another company that it cannot carry its
software because that product includes Netscape Navigator -- and
therefore is prohibited by the Microsoft license.

The potential magnitude of Microsoft's secret tax on the OEM
channel -- all for the purpose of restricting consumer choice -- is truly
breathtaking. If estimates are correct that Windows 95 is selling at a
rate of 40 million copies or more a year, it will cost OEMs more than
$100 million to offer their customers non-Microsoft Internet software
on an equal footing with that of Microsoft. And Microsoft has made
sure that customers will never learn about these under-the-table deals.
Microsoft muzzles all of the OEMs with "non-disclosure" terms that
place them in an entirely untenable position:  they have been induced
with secret payments, and ostensibly cannot tell anyone, including
their customers, about them.

*    In addition to its efforts to strong-arm OEMs, Microsoft has also
targeted Internet Service Providers with special inducements based
on its position as a monopolist. Microsoft has offered a wide array of
sweeteners even to the smaller ISPs:  one ISP, for example,
apparently was offered not just free software but free hardware as
well as free advertising if it would agree not to make Netscape
Navigator (or other Internet browsers) accessible to customers.
Netscape believes that Microsoft also has offered to "buy out" the
contracts that larger ISPs have with Netscape, and some of the
international ISPs have apparently received side payments in the form
of $400,000 "marketing funds" on condition that they will not sell
any Netscape or other Internet software. (There are also what appear
to be complicated "bounty" payments from ISPs to Microsoft;
Netscape is still trying to ascertain the nature of these payments.)

Microsoft's most important inducement to the large ISPs, however,
is in the form of currency that no other company in the world can
match:  a place on the Windows 95 screen. This unique asset, which
Microsoft controls because of its monopoly in operating systems, is
one that AT&T and NetCom could not pass up -- just like the online
services before them. In all of these cases, Microsoft is directly
using its monopoly to hinder consumer choice. The transactions
work like this:  the ISP (or online service) gets "paid" with a spot on
the Windows 95 screen. Their customers, however, do not receive
any "trickle-down' from this payment -- they do not, for example,
get equal access to Microsoft's browser along with Netscape's and
those of other Internet vendors. To the contrary:  the "payment" that
Microsoft extracts from these resellers is that they agree to make
other Internet software less accessible to their customers.

*    Microsoft also is using its monopoly position in operating
systems to restrict consumer choice in Internet servers. For example,
Windows NT Workstation is the platform of choice for consumers in
many operating environments, and Netscape, O'Reilly and
Associates, and Process Software (among others) have developed
Internet servers designed to provide consumers using this platform
with the best possible functionality at the lowest possible price.

Microsoft is trying to take away this consumer choice. Microsoft has
taken the position (as we informed you by separate letter last week)
that these companies must artificially limit the functionality of their
Internet servers to 10 connections. It asserts that claim even though
it admitted in its July 19 press release that it is "in the best interests"
of "the large number of customers who are planning to base their
Internet and intranet solutions on Windows NT Workstation" not to
face such a limit. But Microsoft now claims that it can make its
competitors abide by such a limit, just because it says so.

Moreover, Microsoft has expanded its strong-arm tactics on this
issue to OEMs. For example, Microsoft has threatened OEMs that
their users may be violating the Microsoft license agreement if the
OEM bundles NT Workstation with Netscape's Internet server. And
Netscape believes that independent software vendors writing
products to run on Netscape's or other third parties' Internet servers
have received the same implicit or explicit threat.

*    Microsoft's technical and legal manipulations on the 10-
connection issue are not its only  use of anticompetitive tactics in its
effort to monopolize Internet servers. Equally notorious among
Internet vendors was Microsoft's use of secret APIs in Windows NT
Server to gain a preferential speed advantage for its Internet server
software ("IIS"). These APIs, which have a very significant impact
on Internet server performance, were only disclosed by Microsoft in
late 1995 in its "Service Pack 3," but were already incorporated into
the beta of IIS released shortly thereafter. Plainly the IIS developers
had been given these APIs months before the rest of the industry.

It was not until the end of June 1996 that Netscape was able to
release a final version of its Internet server that incorporated the two
new NT Server APIs. Other, smaller Internet server vendors, with
fewer resources available, undoubtedly found it more difficult to
catch up with Microsoft's unfair advantage. During this half-year
interval, reviews (such as PC Week's March 1996 Internet server
review) repeatedly emphasized Microsoft's speed superiority. But
that superiority was not because its programmers were better than the
rest of the industry's -- it is because they had an unfair advantage as a
result of their operating system monopoly. Indeed, once Netscape
was able to integrate these APIs in its June release, its Internet server
did not simply match Microsoft's Internet server in speed, but
significantly exceeded it. The APIs therefore were decisive in the
half-year advantage that Microsoft held in Internet server speed.

*    Finally, Microsoft has resorted to a wide variety of predatory
pricing and bundling behavior that violates the antitrust laws. For
example, with corporate customers, Microsoft has agreed to a whole
spectrum of free products and services, including free operating
system upgrades, free consulting, free dialers, and so forth if the
customer accepts the free Microsoft browser. Microsoft even offered
international telecommunications customers $5 for every installed
Netscape Navigator that they removed from their corporation and
installed with Internet Explorer.

Microsoft is also bundling its "free" Internet Explorer and IIS with its
operating systems, which according to news reports have already led
some vendors to decide to quit the market. And its bundling of tools
such as FrontPage for "free" with its operating system products (as
well as distribution of FrontPage as a stand-alone product for "free"
at least until the end of the year) have threatened the Internet tools
market, which includes promising young companies with "hot"
products like NetObjects. In short, it is plain that Microsoft intends
to "zero out" the markets for Internet servers, and Internet tools (like
Internet browsers), and drive all other competitors out of these
markets.

The Reason for Microsoft's Conduct

Obviously, Microsoft has so little confidence in the success of its
products in a fair comparison with those of other software vendors
that it has resorted to undisclosed, under-the-table payments and
other forms of coercion to impose its products on consumers.
Survey after survey has shown that in a straightforward comparison,
end users, both in individual and corporate environments, would
choose a non-Microsoft product.   For example, a recent survey of
Intranet computer users found that companies provide employees
with Netscape Navigator 58% of the time, and Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 17% of the time (with other vendors making up the rest).
When asked which product they primarily use, however, Netscape's
share shot up to 89%, and Microsoft's dropped to 4%. In other
words, Microsoft's product was offered four times as often as it
would have been based on consumer preference, while Netscape
Navigator was offered far less. Microsoft's conduct in buying off
suppliers has inhibited if not precluded unfettered consumer choice.

Nor would resellers themselves, if left to their own devices, prefer to
bundle Microsoft's browsers. They are forced to do so by
Microsoft's overwhelming market power. Typical comments to
Netscape include:

"All I can tell you is that the pressure and incentives from Microsoft
are so outrageous they're scary."

and

"Microsoft gave me a deal I couldn't refuse. Free dialer, browser,
developers kit, free distributable, etc. . . . I know Netscape is better,
but $0 vs. $18K is impossible to beat."

The money to support these under-the-table payments comes directly
from Microsoft's monopoly over the operating system, a point Bill
Gates openly conceded to the Financial Times this June:

"Our business model works even if all Internet software is free,"
says Mr. Gates. "We are still selling operating systems. What does
Netscape's business model look like [if that happens]? Not very
good."

The point was made even more bluntly by a Microsoft representative
who brazenly announced to hundreds of people in attendance at a
program sponsored by Motorola:

"Our intent is to flood the market with free Internet software and
squeeze Netscape until they run out of cash."

The entire industry will suffer if Microsoft is permitted to succeed.
First, if the market remains open, it is far more likely that innovative
developments will come from small competitors like NetObjects than
from Microsoft. And to the extent that Microsoft does try to innovate,
it will do so only under the spur of competition.

Second, the Internet revolution has the potential for providing
competition to Microsoft's desktop operating system monopoly.
That is the reason, Netscape believes, why Microsoft has resorted to
such desperate measures in trying to eliminate its Internet software
competitors. The point was explicitly made in a speech by Bill Gates
that was posted on the Microsoft Web page. While his speech is
focused on Netscape, it would more accurately be directed at the
entire Internet software revolution:

Netscape's strategy is to make Windows . . . all but irrelevant by
building the browser into a full-featured operating system with
information browsing. Over time Netscape will add memory
management, file systems, security, scheduling, graphics and
everything else in Windows that applications require. The company
hopes that its browser will become a de facto platform for software
development, ultimately replacing Windows as the mainstream set of
software standards.

Steve Ballmer made the point even more emphatically in an
interview, also posted on the Internet:

I want the thing that replaces Windows to be Windows. I don't want
to wake up in a position one day where the guys at Netscape say,
"Isn't Windows just that little thing that we use to put up menus and
draw lines."

The Promise of the Consent Decree

As you know, Paragraph IV(E)(1) prohibits Microsoft from licensing
Windows 95 under terms that are "expressly or impliedly conditioned
upon the licensing of any . . . other product." Similarly, the
following paragraph of the Decree, Paragraph IV(E)(2) states that the
licensing of Windows 95 cannot be expressly or impliedly
conditioned upon the OEM "not licensing, purchasing, using or
distributing any non-Microsoft product."  If Microsoft's conduct is
not an outright violation of the Decree, it is, if anything, far more
disturbing than that expressly precluded by the Decree. Microsoft is
conditioning the license of Windows 95 on inhibiting consumer
access to products that, in Microsoft's view, could successfully
develop "into a full-featured operating system."

In its argument in support of the entry of the Decree, the Antitrust
Division expressly promised that it would ensure that Microsoft
would not be permitted to engage in such conduct. In its
Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Enter Final Judgment,
signed by the Assistant Attorney General herself, the Department of
Justice made an important promise, upon which the industry has
relied:

It is important to note . . . that an alternative to Microsoft's operating
system might arise at some point, an operating system that either
displaces Microsoft's or attracts sufficient users to gain the benefits
of increasing returns to the point where the market is divided between
the world of Microsoft and the world of this new operating system.
The proposed Consent Decree insures that this new operating
system, when developed, will have access to the market.

It is time for the Department of Justice to act on that promise. If
action is not taken immediately, Microsoft will be able to maintain
unilaterally its monopoly of desktop operating systems, to increase
the installed base of its Internet software, and to inhibit the continued
growth of competition through conduct of the very type addressed by
the Decree. Action at some future date will simply not be effective.
Action at a future date might stop Microsoft from engaging in future
conduct, but only after the harm which the Decree is intended to
prohibit has already occurred.

The various written proposals and agreements made by Microsoft
that are set forth in this letter have come to our attention orally. The
offers are universally made under nondisclosure agreements, thereby
prohibiting the offeree from providing us a copy of the
offer/agreement, or even providing us with a complete set of terms.
Simply put, Microsoft does not want the proposals to see the light of
day. However, the Department of Justice could easily and rapidly
gather detailed information. By issuing Civil Investigative Demands
to local and long distance telephone companies and other ISPs, value
added resellers, OEMs, and large corporate users, the Antitrust
Division would be in a position to ascertain and act upon Microsoft's
illegal offers.

Time is of the essence. We know that the Antitrust Division has an
open file with respect to Microsoft. However, insofar as we know,
the Division currently has no outstanding Civil Investigative
Demands of any type. It has been almost a year since the Antitrust
Division even sought documents from Microsoft. All of this leads us
to wonder whether the Antitrust Division is truly in a position to
investigate and restrain the illegal behavior on a timely basis.

Perhaps the public interest would be better served, given its possible
staffing constraints, if the Department returned the matter to the
Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has recently expressed interest
in the subject matter and has allocated staff that has developed a very
detailed report on antitrust concerns arising from networked
industries. That report recognizes the need for "heightened scrutiny"
in network markets such as the software industry. The FTC's
conclusions are particularly germane in view of the threat that
Microsoft's illegal behavior poses to the nascent Internet software
industry, which its conduct places directly at risk.

In any event, we are requesting immediate action. If you need any
help in identifying potential CID recipients, we will be happy to work
with your personnel. Please respond to me at your earliest
opportunity.

Sincerely,

Gary L. Reback

<P>The Web war between Netscape Communications and Microsoft
is getting nasty. Netscape has accused rival Microsoft of abusing
monopolist powers in the industry and wants the Justice Department
to investigate. The accusations came in response to a letter from a top
Microsoft lawyer demanding that Netscape stop making claims about
its price advantage over Microsoft. Netscape also insists that a new
Microsoft license, which limits the number of users who can connect
to the workstation version of Microsoft's new Windows NT operating
system to 10, allows Microsoft to position its more expensive NT
Server as the product to be used by multiple users. <p>

Corporation. Your letter of July 30, 1996, has been referred to us for
reply. In your letter you demand that Netscape stop posting a
comparison chart on the World Wide Web. The comparison chart
shows that users can get a better price/performance value by licensing
Netscape products in conjunction with Windows NT Workstation than
by licensing Microsoft's higher priced alternative, Windows NT
Server with a combination of proprietary Microsoft products.

Your letter does not claim that Netscape's comparison is incorrect. To
the contrary, Microsoft would have no choice but to agree that
consumers get a better value using Netscape products. Rather, your
letter states that your Windows NT Workstation license prohibits
consumers from using the combination of products that is best for
them. You admit there is no technical justification for such a licensing
restriction; NT Workstation works superbly with Netscape products to
provide a packaged web server solution. Microsoft has simply decided
to interpret its license in order to force users to pay more money to
Microsoft, to the disadvantage of both users and competitors.

Your demand letter to Netscape follows Microsoft's clumsy and ill-
conceived attempt to cripple the functionality of its NT Workstation
product so that consumers would have to license Microsoft's more
expensive product. The storm of protest from consumers forced
Microsoft on July 19 to back down from its attempt to impose artificial
technical restraints on its NT product.

Microsoft stated publicly on July 19 that "in the best interests" of "the
large numbers of customers" who are planning to use Windows NT as
their web server platform, Microsoft was withdrawing a 10-
connection limitation discovered by users in the beta version of its
forthcoming NT Workstation release. You claimed in your public
statement that you would compete the way other companies do: you
would persuade customers that NT server was a better web server
platform, by making it a "compelling" alternative with "high-
performance tuning" and attractive pricing. But it now turns out that
you intend to force the same limitations on customers through your
licenses when there is absolutely no technical justification for your
position.

Worse yet, you demand that Netscape cooperate in your scheme to
limit consumer choice. By this letter we inform you that Netscape will
never agree with you to deprive users of their ability to combine the
best possible functionality at the lowest possible price. We believe
your effort to limit consumer choice by artificially restricting your
product's functionality (whether through technical or licensing means)
violates the antitrust laws. In any case, if you want to flaunt your
contempt for consumers in this way, you will have to do it without
Netscape's cooperation.

Insofar as we know, your current license does not remotely support
the limitations you assert. The only relevant provision of your license
sets a limit of 10 simultaneous inbound "peer connections." The only
reasonable interpretations of the term "peer connections" in the license
is that it refers to Server Message Block (SMB) connections ("SMB"
is a file and print sharing protocol used by NT) because NT
Workstation has had a technical governor which precludes a user from
exceeding a maximum number of SMB connections since Version
3.5.

It is not reasonable to suggest that the limitations on "peer
connections" in your license refers to TCP/IP connections. Microsoft
cannot claim the right to limit a customer's TCP/IP connections
because TCP/IP is an open Internet protocol, not a proprietary
Microsoft product. In your July 19 public statement, Microsoft
admitted that customers had purchased NT Workstation in reliance on
their ability to use it -- in your words -- as the "base [for] their Internet
and intranet solutions." Plainly, Microsoft made no claim while
customers were purchasing the product that the company had any right
to limit TCP/IP connections. If Microsoft had that intention, it should
have asserted its claim before customers bought its product in reliance
on the position reasserted publicly on July 19. Indeed, Netscape is
informed that Microsoft has publicly disclaimed the applicability of the
license restriction to TCP/IP connections.

Your demand letter to Netscape claims that Netscape's comparison
chart "erroneously assumes" that a NT Workstation licensee can make
unlimited connections to a website without violating Microsoft's
license. But the chart makes no claim, implicit or explicit, about the
volume of connections that a customer can make using either
Microsoft's or Netscape's web servers. The chart simply conveys that
the Netscape servers are capable of running on NT Workstation while
Microsoft's IIS is not. Netscape's engineers estimate that even
restricted to Microsoft's interpretation of the license agreement, a
customer can process well over one million collections per day using
Netscape's server products. The comparison chart is neither inaccurate
nor misleading.

Other claims in your letter are expressly contradicted by Microsoft's
July 19 public statement. For example, your letter claims that it is
"deceptive" to suggest that NT Workstation can be used "as the server
operating system for a web server solution. " But on July 19,
Microsoft agreed to abandon plans to cripple the functionality of NT
Workstation because customers are planning "to base their Internet
and intranet solutions on Windows NT" -- in other words to use it as
the operating system for a web server solution. If any company is
being "deceptive" it is Microsoft; Microsoft on July 19 tried to
persuade customers that it is bowing to their wishes while in reality
Microsoft is surreptitiously trying to deprive them of choice.

Finally, we have heard that you may be circulating a new form of
license agreement in correction with release 4.0 of NT Workstation,
and that this new license agreement may implement the restrictions that
you assert -- but are not present -- in the NT Workstation 3.51 license.
If you intend to go forward with this new license as part of the final
release of the upcoming version of NT Workstation, please let us
know at the earliest opportunity.

Sincerely yours,

/s/Gary L. Reback

Re: Deceptive Advertising

Dear Ms. Katz

We are very concerned about Netscape's publication of a price
comparison chart ("Chart") in which the cost of a web server solution
using Microsoft Internet Information Server is purportedly contrasted
with a web server solution using Netscape software. The Chart is
entitled "PRICE COMPARISONS BETWEEN NETSCAPE AND
MICROSOFT WEB SERVER SOLUTIONS." It appears, among
other places, on Netscape's corporate web site.

The price comparison is unfair and deceptive because the cost on the
Netscape side of the ledger erroneously assumes the user can run the
Netscape Web server software on Windows NT (R) Workstation and
make unlimited connections to a web site without violating the
Windows NT Workstation license agreement and without additional
charge. That is not the case. The end user license agreement for
Windows NT Workstation only permits up to ten connections. If the
user wishes to utilize more than the ten connections, the user must
license Windows NT Server. Windows NT Server is designed and
optimized to provide maximum performance to support server
services.

Microsoft is also concerned that Netscape is deceiving customers by
suggesting that Windows NT Workstation is meant to be used as a
server operating system for a web site. It is not. Windows NT Server
is designed and licensed to provide high performance server services .
Windows NT Workstation, as one would expect, is designed and
licensed as interactive desktop software.

We demand that Netscape immediately cease and desist from further
publication of the Chart in its current form (and the deception
information contained therein), and from suggesting that Windows
NT Workstation is to be used as the server operating system for a web
server solution. Netscape has already caused irreparable harm to
Microsoft, and further publication of the deceptive information will
only compound the damage.

Please assure me by August 15, 1996 that you will cease and desist.
My direct dial telephone number is (206) 936-7084 if you wish to
discuss this matter further. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Press Releases

Microsoft Removes Technical
Limitation in Windows NT Workstation
4.0 Beta

Microsoft believes this decision is in the best interests of the large
number of customers who are planning to base their Internet and
intranet solutions on Windows NT.

REDMOND, Wash. - July 19, 1996 - Microsoft Corp. today
announced that it has decided to remove a technical limitation under
evaluation in the Microsoft(R) Windows NT(R) Workstation
operating system version 4.0 beta that restricted inbound TCP/IP
connections to 10 unique IP addresses. The company appreciates the
rigorous customer beta testing and subsequent customer feedback that
led to this decision.

Microsoft believes this decision is in the best interests of the large
number of customers who are planning to base their Internet and
intranet solutions on Windows NT. This decision will also help
customers deploying distributed peer-to-peer applications. During the
beta period, Microsoft found that various user scenarios were affected
by the proposed limits in the TCP/IP stack.

Microsoft believes customers are best served by a production Web
server that runs on a dedicated mission-critical server such as
Windows NT Server. In contrast, Windows NT Workstation is
optimized for use as an interactive workstation. Microsoft will
introduce a compelling upgrade to make it easier for customers testing
or running Web servers on Windows NT Workstation 3.51 to
upgrade and take advantage of the high-performance tuning of
Windows NT Server 4.0. Pricing and availability will be announced
later.

Microsoft and Windows NT are either registered trademarks or
trademarks of Microsoft Corp. in the United States and/or other
countries.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Caldera, Inc., ("Caldera") brings this action against
defendant Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") for damages and
injunctive relief under the antitrust laws of the United States, and for
damages in tort, and demands trial by jury, complaining and alleging
as follows:

I. NATURE OF CASE.

This action challenges illegal conduct by Microsoft calculated and
intended to prevent and destroy competition in the computer software
industry. As the United States Department of Justice alleged in
United States vs. Microsoft, Civil No. 94-1564 (D.D.C., Complaint
filed July 15, 1994), Microsoft has violated Sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 1 and 2. As outlined in the Justice
Department's complaint, through various unfair and predatory acts,
Microsoft has willfully maintained a monopoly of the  market for
MS-DOS operating system software and functionally- equivalent
software (the "DOS Market").  (For purposes of this complaint, MS-
DOS and competing functionally-equivalent operating system
software will be referred to as "DOS Software.") Such software is
designed to run on personal computers using Intel x86 or Intel x86-
compatible microprocessors ("PCs"). The Intel x86 class of
microprocessors includes Intel 286, 386, 486, Pentium and Pentium
Pro microprocessors, as well as microprocessors manufactured by
other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and
instruction set.

Microsoft has erected artificial barriers to the entry and growth of
competing operating systems vendors through its contractual
relations with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of PCs and
other predatory conduct, which have had the effect of excluding
competitors from the DOS Market, a market in which Microsoft has
monopoly power. These practices have included the following:

License agreements which required OEMs to pay royalties to
Microsoft not only when they sold PCs containing Microsoft's MS-
DOS, but also when they sold PCs containing competing DOS
Software or no DOS Software ("per processor licenses");

Unreasonably long terms for license agreements with OEMs for the
use of Microsoft's MS-DOS software;

In lieu of and in addition to per processor licenses, pricing schemes
and other license terms and enforcement practices that effectively
have required OEMs to purchase their entire DOS Software
requirements from Microsoft;

Tying arrangements under which Microsoft required OEMs to
purchase MS-DOS to the exclusion of competing DOS Software
products, in particular DR DOS and Novell DOS, in order to obtain
its Windows software programs or to be given access to other
essential information, product support and service;

False public statements by Microsoft executives, and Windows error
messages, which have misled the market as to possible
incompatibility problems between Microsoft's Windows software
programs and non-Microsoft DOS Software, in particular DR DOS
and Novell DOS; and

False public statements by Microsoft executives concerning future
product features and anticipated shipment dates, known in the
industry as "vaporware," timed to match announcements or releases
of new versions of competing DOS Software, in particular DR DOS
and Novell DOS.

These practices have had the purpose and effect of freezing out
competing DOS Software products, in particular DR DOS and Novell
DOS, and thereby entrenching Microsoft as the dominant provider of
DOS Software.

Microsoft's conduct has had a direct, substantial and adverse effect
on competition by raising barriers to entry to competing DOS
Software, foreclosing competition with Microsoft on the basis of
price and performance, and stifling innovation. Buyers of PCs and
software have thus been forced to pay higher prices for less
innovative, inferior products.

Caldera, has acquired from Novell, Inc. ("Novell"), its DR DOS-
and Novell DOS-related assets, including this claim (the "DR DOS
Business"), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 23,
1996. (For simplicity's sake, DR DOS and Novell DOS are referred
to generically herein as "DR DOS.") Caldera is therefore entitled to
recover damages from Microsoft for its anticompetitive and illegal
conduct. Moreover, unless restrained by order of this court,
Microsoft will permanently destroy competition in the DOS Market in
the microcomputer software industry, and Caldera will be artificially
and illegally prevented from realizing the full financial potential of the
DOS Business.

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered
a Final Judgment in United States v. Microsoft on August 21, 1995,
which barred certain of Microsoft's anticompetitive practices,
including per processor licenses, licences exceeding one year in
length, licenses prohibiting or restricting OEMs from licensing or
distributing non-Microsoft operating systems, license agreements
conditioning an OEM's license of one Microsoft operating system
product upon the license of another Microsoft product or upon the
OEM not licensing a non-Microsoft product, minimum commitment
licenses, and licenses requiring royalty payments to Microsoft other
than on a per-copy or per-system basis. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sect.
16(i), the statute of limitations has been suspended as a result of
United States v. Microsoft.

II. THE PARTIES.

Plaintiff Caldera is a Utah corporation. Caldera's principal place of
business is located at 633 South 550 East, Provo, Utah 84606.
Caldera develops, markets, sells, licenses and services software used
with PCs.

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Novell, Caldera is in
the business of developing, marketing, selling, licensing and
servicing DR DOS products.  Caldera competes with Microsoft in
the sale, distribution and support of DOS Software and other
software products via the Internet, as well as  through traditional
OEM, distributor, retailer and value-added reseller channels.

Defendant Microsoft is a Delaware corporation. Microsoft's
principal place of business is located at One Microsoft Way,
Redmond, Washington, 98052.

Microsoft is the world's largest independent software company with
fiscal 1996 sales totaling $8.67 billion. Microsoft's net income
reached $2.20 billion in 1996, up from  $1.453 billion the prior year,
an increase of 52%. Over the last 5 years, Microsoft's average annual
growth rate has been 33%. Operating system sales increased 53%
during fiscal year 1996 over fiscal year 1995.

The Microsoft products chiefly at issue here are MS-DOS, which
runs on the Intel x86 class of microprocessors, and Windows, a
graphical user interface (GUI), which runs on top of MS-DOS and
other DOS Software.

III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE.

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Section 4 of
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sect. 4, Sections 4 and 16 of the
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 15 and 26, and 28 U.S.C. Sections
1331, 1337 and 1367.

Venue is proper in this district under 15 U.S.C. Sections 15, 22 and
26, and under 28 U.S.C. Sect. 1391(b) and (c) because (i) defendant
Microsoft transacts business and is found within this district, (ii)
plaintiff's principal place of business is within this district, and (iii) a
substantial portion of the events giving rise to the claim herein
occurred within this district.



IV. PERSONAL COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND THE
PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY.

A. Introduction of the PC

IBM was among the first United States companies to introduce
microcomputers for personal use. IBM introduced the IBM personal
computer in 1981. It was quickly dubbed the "PC," a term now used
(in this Complaint and generally) to refer to any personal computer
that is IBM-compatible, whether manufactured by IBM or not, i.e.,
personal computers that use Intel x86-class microprocessors.

The components of a PC are the hardware (which includes the
microprocessor, the memory and the disk drive), software (which
includes the operating system, other low level programs, and various
applications programs), and peripherals (which include the display
screen, keyboard and printer).

IBM's hardware architecture design was based on a microprocessor
chip designed and manufactured by Intel. So-called "clone" PC
manufacturers also utilize Intel x86-class microprocessors.

The dominant operating system on Intel x86-class microprocessors is
Microsoft's MS-DOS.


B. The Importance of the Operating System Software

The software on a PC can be divided into three basic categories:
operating system software (e.g., MS-DOS), graphical user interface
(GUI) software and applications software.

Applications software gives the PC its functionality and consumer
utility. Application software provides the PC with instructions for
the performance of tasks selected by the user. Primary examples of
application software are word processing, spreadsheet, and database
programs.

The operating system controls the basic functions of the PC and
facilitates interaction between application programs and hardware.
Operating system software performs the following functions:

controlling the allocation and usage of computer hardware
components such as central processing unit, memory, disk space and
peripheral devices;

facilitating the execution of applications software by responding to
requests or "calls" made by the application programs during their
operation that require various hardware components to perform
particular functions;

managing the flow of data and communication among various PC
components.

The operating system constitutes the critical layer of software in
every PC. All other software programs installed by a PC user must
work with, and therefore be compatible with, the particular operating
system running on the PC.

In writing applications for a particular operating system, applications
developers refer to a set of ground rules for that operating system,
known as the Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs). APIs
tell the application developer what the operating system will do in
response to a defined set of requests or "calls."  As long as an
application is written in accordance with the rules set by the API, the
application will run with a given operating system.

Particular operating systems can only work with a certain type of
microprocessor. For example, MS-DOS will operate only on PCs,
i.e., machines that contain Intel x86-class microprocessors. MS-
DOS will not run on machines manufactured by Apple Computer,
which operate on a non-Intel microprocessor platform.

C.  The Emergence of Graphical User Interfaces ("GUIs").

MS-DOS is character-based, i.e., most of the visual displays
generated by MS-DOS are limited to blinking cursors, letters and
numbers. To have the computer perform certain tasks -- such as
opening a new file -- the user must issue instructions by typing in the
correct sequence of letters and numbers or by using rudimentary
mouse functions.

Graphical user interface or GUI screen displays include icons or
symbols to represent programs, functions or information. A GUI,
together with a "mouse" pointing device, allows the user to instruct
the computer to perform specific functions by merely pointing to and
"clicking" on certain graphical images, symbols or words.

In 1985, Microsoft introduced its GUI software, called Windows.

Although sometimes referred to as an operating system, all versions
of Windows, excluding Windows NT and Windows 95, interface
with and "run on top of" DOS Software. Windows adds a GUI
interface between DOS and the user. Windows takes advantage of
more sophisticated microprocessors and increased memory capacity
to generate complex visual displays as part of its graphical user
interface.

D.  Software Distribution Channels

The customer base for DOS Software consists primarily of PC
manufacturers, i.e., OEMs. This is commonly referred to as the
OEM channel. DOS Software is also sold at retail, primarily as an
upgrade. Because virtually all PCs are sold with operating system
software installed, however, there is little opportunity for vendors of
DOS Software to make significant sales in retail channels. Hence, by
controlling the OEM channel, Microsoft is able to control
distribution.

OEM licenses for DOS Software (and also Windows software
products) typically permit the OEM, through the use of a "golden
master" diskette supplied by the software developer (such as
Microsoft), to reproduce and install the software on each PC. By
contrast, applications programs are generally manufactured onto
separate disks and sold in boxes through retail channels.

V.  MICROSOFT'S GROWTH AND DOMINATION.

In 1981, IBM contracted with Microsoft to design and develop the
operating system software for the IBM PC. Since it had practically
no background in operating systems, Microsoft entered into an
arrangement with a company known as Seattle Computer Products
(SCP) to acquire rights to a program under development by SCP
known as "QDOS" for Quick and Dirty Operating System.

QDOS borrowed heavily from an operating system developed by
Digital Research, Inc. ("DRI") called CP/M.

Microsoft changed the name of QDOS to MS-DOS, for Microsoft-
Disk Operating System. Under its arrangement with IBM, Microsoft
retained the right to license MS-DOS to other PC manufacturers.
IBM called its version of the product PC DOS.

MS-DOS was originally designed to run on the Intel 8088
microprocessor. Microsoft has introduced several versions of MS-
DOS since 1981, which have run on the Intel x86 class of
microprocessors.

Because Microsoft distributes MS-DOS (and Windows)
predominantly through the OEM channel, its costs of sale are
minimal. Once Microsoft delivers a master copy of a disk containing
the MS-DOS (or Windows) program to a given OEM, it incurs little
or no additional costs of sale. OEMs, on the other hand, must copy
and package disks, prepare product literature, and ship product to
customers.

By the mid-1980's, MS-DOS had become entrenched as the standard
in the DOS Market, generating millions of dollars of revenues to
Microsoft. Not surprisingly, in view of Microsoft's monopoly
power and the absence of competition, the price of MS-DOS in the
OEM channel escalated from $2-$5 per copy in the 1981-1982 period
to $25-$28 per copy by 1988.

At the same time, for much of the 1980s, Microsoft did almost
nothing to improve MS-DOS. Microsoft released MS-DOS 3.0 in
August 1984, but did not release MS-DOS 4.0 until June 1988, a
month after DRI released DR DOS 3.31. Microsoft did not issue an
improved release until June 1991, when MS-DOS 5.0 appeared in
response to DR DOS 5.0 (which was released in April 1990).

VI. THE DR DOS CHALLENGE.

Microsoft's inaction was remarkable given that improvements in
hardware technology and applications software had created a demand
among PC users for an enhanced operating system. By 1987, users
were seeking:

The ability to support larger disk drives. Although larger hard disks
were becoming available, Microsoft did nothing to improve MS-DOS
so that it could support such hard disks until Compaq developed its
own version of MS-DOS with such functionality.

Improved memory management. Microsoft did nothing to improve
memory management so that larger applications programs (such as
popular desktop publishing applications) could run on a computer
with relatively limited memory.

Loading the operating system on a ROM chip. Even though it had
become technologically feasible to install certain portions of operating
systems on a "read only memory" (ROM) chip, a feature that would
improve the function of the program, Microsoft did nothing to create
a "ROM-able" version of MS-DOS.

Improved user interface. MS-DOS required users to master rather
arcane programming commands in order to perform various
operations. Microsoft failed to make its commands more user-
friendly or to provide any "help" screen for users to enable them to
determine which commands they should execute.

Because of these deficiencies, a number of OEMs approached DRI
and requested that it develop a version of DOS that would fill the
gaps in functionality that plagued MS-DOS. At the same time, there
were a number of OEMs who simply could not get Microsoft to deal
with them (irrespective of product features). Many of these OEMs
indicated to DRI that they would be seriously interested in an
alternative DOS Software product. Accordingly, in 1987 DRI began
planning for a new version of DOS, to be called DR DOS.

DRI designed DR DOS to be the functional equivalent of MS-DOS,
i.e., to support the same API set. DRI was able to accomplish this
largely because of its experience in the development of CP/M, from
which QDOS and MS-DOS derived.

The result of DRI's initial development effort was a product
designated as DR DOS 3.31, introduced on May 28, 1988. DR DOS
3.31 was followed quickly by enhanced versions of the product.
Thus DR DOS 5.0, introduced in May 1990, and DR DOS 6.0,
introduced in September 1991, were significantly superior to then-
existing versions of MS-DOS in many areas, including (a) memory
management, (b) a ROM-able core of the operating system, (c) user-
friendly commands and on-screen help resources, (d) a graphical
user interface option, (e) extended disk commands, (f) password
protection, and (g) the ability to store twice as much information on a
hard disk through disk compression technology.

Industry experts responded enthusiastically to DR DOS. DR DOS
5.0 received several awards including the 1990 BYTE Award of
Distinction and Finalist in the 1990 PC Magazine Award for
Technical Excellence. DR DOS 6.0 similarly received a number of
industry awards, including the 1991 BYTE Award of Excellence,
BEST of COMDEX (Fall 1991), and the Infoworld Buyers
Assurance Seal.

The technical superiority of DR DOS resulted in a rise in sales from
about $15 million in fiscal year 1990 to $30 million in fiscal year
1991, notwithstanding Microsoft's anticompetitve conduct. DR DOS
sold well in the retail distribution channel, but due to Microsoft's
exclusive dealings and other predatory conduct, it was largely locked
out of the OEM channel.

VII. MICROSOFT'S PREDATORY RESPONSE TO DR DOS.

Microsoft refused to tolerate this PCs to its monopoly position in the
DOS Market for at least two (to Microsoft) compelling reasons:  (i)
Microsoft's DOS Market monopoly enabled it to control the
standards or APIs to which all applications for IBM-compatible PCs
had to be written; and (ii) MS-DOS enabled Microsoft to collect
enormous amounts of money from its license of MS-DOS at
negligible ongoing cost or risk.

DR DOS posed a particularly significant threat to Microsoft because
(i) it was compatible with applications written for MS-DOS; and (ii)
since both DR DOS and MS-DOS were technological successors to
CP/M, Microsoft could not claim that DR DOS infringed upon any
proprietary technology it owned.

Microsoft's principal defense against any competitive threat,
including DR DOS, was the wall of "per processor" licenses that it
had begun to construct in 1988, the year that DR DOS was first
released to the market. Under per processor licenses, OEMs were
required to pay Microsoft a royalty on every PC they sold regardless
of whether it contained Microsoft's MS-DOS, some other software
developer's DOS Software, or no operating system software. This
royalty system effectively imposed a tax in favor of Microsoft
whenever an OEM sold a PC equipped with any operating system
other than MS-DOS. Given the razor-thin margins on the sale of
PCs, this royalty scheme caused OEMs to ship MS-DOS exclusively.

Microsoft compounded this per processor licensing scheme by
insisting on long-term licenses of MS-DOS from its OEM customers,
contracts that tended to be longer than typical product cycles.
Microsoft also obtained large "take or pay" minimum commitment
licenses that also effectively foreclosed the ability of competitors such
as Novell to sell competing DOS Software products to OEMs, and
engaged in other licensing practices that had the effect of coercing
OEMs to deal exclusively with Microsoft.

Microsoft responded to DR DOS 5.0 by announcing in May 1990
that it intended to issue a new release of MS-DOS, to be called MS-
DOS 5.0, that would mirror the technical advantages already present
in DR DOS 5.0. Microsoft indicated that the new release of MS-
DOS would be available within a few months. Industry experience
indicates that it would have been near impossible for Microsoft to
develop and release a commercial version of its product matching the
features of DR DOS 5.0 within that period. Nonetheless, Microsoft
repeated this vaporware announcement throughout the summer and
into the fall of 1990. In fact, MS-DOS 5.0 was not released until
June 1991 and, when finally released, it did not offer the features
Microsoft had promised.

On July 17, 1991, DRI, finding it difficult to compete in the face of
Microsoft's onslaught, announced its agreement to be acquired by
Novell. The merger was completed October 28, 1991. With the
financial, research and development, and marketing support of
Novell, DR DOS could have obtained a significant share of the DOS
Market, but for Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct.

In the fall of 1991, Microsoft announced to the market that DR DOS
would not be compatible with the next release of Windows known as
Windows 3.1, scheduled for release in April 1992. The market
perceived that it was critical for an operating system to support
Windows;  therefore Microsoft's statements that DR DOS could not
do so substantially undercut Novell's efforts to penetrate the DOS
Market.

To reinforce the impression that DR DOS would be incompatible
with Windows 3.1, beginning in December of 1991, Microsoft
released beta versions of Windows 3.1 containing code that
generated error messages when Windows 3.1 ran on top of DR DOS
rather than MS-DOS. Microsoft created these error messages solely
for the purpose of creating the impression that DR DOS would be
incompatible with Windows in order to dissuade customers from
purchasing DR DOS.

Even though the Windows 3.1 beta release was at that time the
largest such release in history, Microsoft refused to provide a
Windows 3.1 beta to Novell. Microsoft's refusal to do so was
another predatory effort to impede Novell's ability to test DR DOS
with Windows 3.1 and thereby hamper Novell's ability to offer a
Windows 3.1-compatible release of DR DOS to the market.   In fact,
when Windows 3.1 was finally released to the market, Novell was
able to release an enhanced version of DR DOS supporting Windows
3.1 without substantial technical difficulty.

Microsoft also informed certain OEM PC manufacturers that they
could not obtain Windows or be given access to essential
information, product support and service if  they did not purchase
and ship MS-DOS, to the exclusion of DR DOS.

Similarly, Microsoft established a pricing structure for Windows that
made it prohibitive to buy that product in the absence of MS-DOS.
For example, certain Korean OEMs were informed that the price of
Windows without MS-DOS would be double the price of Windows
with MS-DOS.

Microsoft's most devastating tactic, however, was its massive
expansion of per processor licenses in the OEM channel. Following
the announcement of Novell's acquisition of DRI, Microsoft
substantially stepped up its efforts to coerce OEMs to enter into per
processor licenses or comparably exclusionary MS-DOS licenses.
Thereafter, Novell's sales force found the OEM channel virtually
impenetrable; they were thwarted in account by account by
Microsoft's per-processor license wall.

The combined effect of Microsoft's anticompetitive practices on DR
DOS was devastating. DR DOS sales plummeted during fiscal year
1992, totaling $15.5 million in the first quarter,  $13.7 million in the
second quarter, $6.9 million in the third quarter, and $1.4 million in
the fourth quarter (which ended October 31, 1992).

Microsoft continued with its predatory practices throughout 1992 and
up to the present day. Microsoft has employed another tactic for
locking OEMs exclusively to MS-DOS, namely, "cliff pricing"
through which a commercially-reasonable price is provided to OEMs
if and only if they commit to obtain all of their requirements for
operating system software from Microsoft.

Although various governmental agencies including the United States
Department of Justice have sought to bar certain of Microsoft's
predatory practices such as the per processor license, Microsoft has
been permitted to employ its "cliff pricing" practice with impunity.

Novell introduced its final version of the product, Novell DOS 7.0,
in the summer of 1993. In September 1994, as a result of
Microsoft's predatory and anticompetitive conduct described herein,
Novell announced that it would cease the marketing and development
of DR DOS.

VIII.    RELEVANT MARKETS.


There are two relevant product markets: (i) the DOS Market; and (ii)
the market for graphical user interfaces that run on top of DOS
Software (the "GUI Market").

The relevant geographic market is the United States. Microsoft sells
and licenses MS-DOS throughout the United States. The major
developers of other DOS Software are exclusively U.S. companies.

Microsoft has monopoly power in the DOS Market and the GUI
Market. In fact, according to the Justice Department's complaint,
"Microsoft has monopoly power in the relevant market and has had
monopoly power since at least the mid-1980s. For almost a decade
Microsoft has retained an extremely high market share -- consistently
in excess of 70%."  Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows are the de
facto software standards for the Intel x86 class of microprocessors.

Microsoft's control of MS-DOS and Windows standards for Intel
x86-class microprocessors provides it with several significant
advantages over competitors, including the following:

Because of Microsoft's large installed base, for competing DOS
Software products to have any chance of commercial success, they
must provide the functionality of Microsoft's MS-DOS so that they
can support graphical user interfaces and applications written for MS-
DOS;

Because Microsoft has early access to its own MS-DOS and
Windows APIs, it can develop and deliver complementary products
to market more quickly than competitors whose complementary
software products must be compatible with Microsoft's products;

By changing APIs, or refusing to support certain APIs in newer
versions of its MS-DOS and Windows products, Microsoft can
render competitors' complementary products technologically
incompatible; and

Microsoft has power over OEMs, such that they can influence
OEMs' decisions whether to purchase software products offered by
Microsoft competitors.

As a result of these and other advantages, Microsoft holds and has
exercised power to exclude competitors and increase prices in the
DOS Market and the GUI Markets.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

MONOPOLIZATION OF DOS MARKET

(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 2)

Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges the averments of
Paras. 1-60 as if fully set forth herein.

Microsoft has monopolized the DOS Market in violation of Sect. 2 of
the Sherman Act. There is no legitimate business justification or
purpose for Microsoft's conduct. Microsoft has not used the least
restrictive means for achieving its business objectives.

The aforesaid conduct of defendant Microsoft has produced and,
unless restrained by Order of this Court, will continue to produce the
following anticompetitive effects, among others:

Competition in the manufacture, sale and distribution of operating
system software, particularly DOS Software, has been unreasonably
restrained and eliminated, and has been monopolized by defendant
Microsoft;

Competition with defendant Microsoft in the DOS Market, including
competition by Novell and Caldera, has been or will be eliminated;

Barriers to entry in the DOS Market have been raised to a virtually
insurmountable level, thereby assuring continued unlawful
maintenance of Microsoft's monopoly and Microsoft's ability to
exercise its monopoly power to control prices and eliminate
competition; and

Innovation and the development of new and more efficient operating
system software has been retarded and is in danger of ceasing.

As a direct and proximate result of the predatory acts and practices
alleged above, the DR DOS Business, which plaintiff Caldera has
acquired, is being and will continue to be immediately and irreparably
injured through the following:

The loss of profits that otherwise would have been earned from the
sale of DR DOS and related PC operating system software;

The loss of sales of DR DOS and related PC operating system
software that otherwise would have been made;

The loss of market presence for DR DOS, as well as the loss of
market share that might otherwise have been achieved in a freely
competitive market;

The substantial reduction in the value of the DR DOS Business
assets;

The loss of good will in the DR DOS Business as a going concern;
and

The loss to the DR DOS Business of skilled engineering, product
development and marketing personnel and the erosion of its sales and
service organization.

The precise amount of damages that Caldera is entitled to recover as a
result of the foregoing injuries to the DOS Business has not yet been
ascertained.

In addition, defendant Microsoft's monopolization of the DOS
Market is an ongoing wrong causing the DR DOS Business
incalculable and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate
remedy at law. Unless defendant Microsoft is restrained by an
appropriate Order of this Court, Caldera will be unable to compete
fully and fairly in the DOS Market.

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

ILLEGAL TYING

(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 1)

Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges each and every
allegation contained in Paras. 1-66 as if fully set forth herein.

Microsoft has coerced OEMs to enter into unreasonable and
anticompetitive tying arrangements in the form of licenses to MS-
DOS. In furtherance of its illegal tying arrangements, Microsoft
engaged in the following conduct, among other things:

Demanded that OEMs license MS-DOS in order to obtain a license to
Windows;

Set royalty rates on unbundled Windows licenses, i.e., licenses to
use Windows only without a license to MS-DOS, such that the only
viable economic option for OEMs was to license both MS-DOS (the
tied product) and Windows (the tying product) from Microsoft;

Conditioned access to the Windows product as well as critical
technical information, product support and service for both MS-DOS
and Windows on the purchase of MS-DOS to the exclusion of DR
DOS; and

Tied MS-DOS and Windows technologically by deliberately creating
technological incompatibilities offering no technical benefit solely for
the purpose of creating the impression that DR DOS was
incompatible with Windows.

Many OEMs did not and do not wish to license MS-DOS from
Microsoft on the terms imposed and many users would have
preferred to run DR DOS with Windows but for the fears of
incompatibility created by Microsoft.

Microsoft has appreciable market power in the GUI Market due to,
among other things, (i) its dominant market share; (ii) its copyrighted
Windows product; and (iii) its unique MS-DOS-compatible graphical
user interface.

Novell competed with Microsoft in attempting to license its DR DOS
operating system to OEMs and in attempting to license DR DOS
directly to end users at retail. As a direct result of Microsoft's tying
arrangements as described above, Novell and other competitors were
foreclosed from selling DOS Software to a substantial portion of the
market.

Microsoft's illegal tie-ins have resulted in actual substantial
foreclosure of DR DOS from the DOS Market. Competition in the
DOS Market  has been reduced because of Microsoft's
anticompetitive conduct.

Microsoft's tying arrangements constitute contracts in unreasonable
restraint of trade in or affecting a substantial volume of interstate
commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
Sect.1.

The DR DOS Business, now owned by Caldera, suffered injury by
reason of these acts. The precise amount of damages has not yet
been ascertained.

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF

EXCLUSIVE DEALING

(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 1)

Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges the averments of
Paras. 1-74 as if fully set forth herein.

Microsoft has coerced OEMs to enter into long-term exclusive
dealing arrangements for MS-DOS. These exclusive dealing
contracts have taken the form of per-processor licenses, cliff pricing,
volume discounts, coercive royalty schedules and other licensing
terms and practices having the purpose and the practical effect of
forcing OEMs to purchase all of their DOS Software requirements
from a single seller -- Microsoft.

The effect of Microsoft's exclusive dealing arrangements was to
effectively foreclose a substantial number of prospective customers,
particularly OEMs, from purchasing DR DOS. OEMs who would
like to have licensed DR DOS have been precluded from doing so by
their per processor and other exclusive licenses with Microsoft.

The actual and probable effect of Microsoft's exclusive dealing
arrangements has been to raise prices above the competitive level and
substantially lessen competition in the DOS Market. Microsoft
possesses monopoly power and has used and, continues to use,
exclusive dealing arrangements with OEMs to raise barriers to entry
and foreclose actual and potential competition.

There is no legitimate business justification for Microsoft's exclusive
dealing arrangements.

The above-described exclusive dealing arrangements imposed by
Microsoft  constitute contracts in unreasonable restraint of trade in or
affecting a substantial volume of interstate commerce in violation of
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sect. 1.

Caldera's DOS Business has been injured by reason of these acts.
The precise amount of damages has not yet been ascertained.

FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS

Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges the averments of
Paras. 1-81 as if fully set forth herein

Microsoft, through various improper means as alleged above, has
willfully and intentionally sought to damage Novell's and DRI's
existing and prospective business relations. Microsoft, through
various false statements, cover-ups, encrypted code, and other
fraudulent and deceptive means, has sought to conceal the true nature
and extent of such conduct, thus tolling any applicable statute of
limitations.

Microsoft was and is maliciously motivated and knew, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should have known, that its actions
would damage and continue to damage the DR DOS Business and
existing and prospective contractual relations with DR DOS
customers, and has acted in conscious disregard of this effect.

As a proximate result of this intentional interference by Microsoft, the
DR DOS Business has suffered special damages in the form of lost
sales and profits. Caldera, having acquired the DR DOS Business
from Novell, is entitled to recover such damages from Microsoft, the
amount of which has not yet been ascertained.

Caldera, due to Microsoft's willful, malicious and intentionally
fraudulent conduct, manifesting a knowing and reckless indifference
to, or a reckless disregard of, DRI's and Novell's rights, is entitled
to an award of punitive damages in sufficient amount to dissuade
Microsoft from similar future conduct.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

For an order trebling the amount of compensatory damages awarded
pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sect. 15.

For an award of punitive damages.

For an order granting permanent injunctive relief requiring that
defendant Microsoft hereinafter refrain from the use of per processor
licenses on MS-DOS or any other operating system software that is
competitive with, or an intended replacement for, DOS Software,
including Windows 95 and Windows NT.

For an order granting permanent injunctive relief requiring that
defendant Microsoft hereinafter refrain from licensing practices and
pricing policies which have the purpose and effect of causing
exclusive dealing.

For an order granting permanent injunctive relief requiring Microsoft,
for a period of ten years, to disclose to Caldera all APIs for any
operating system it produces, as well as any modifications,
enhancements, updates, or new versions of such operating systems
at the time that such products are released for beta testing.

For an order granting permanent injunctive relief prohibiting
Microsoft from including code in any software products that has the
sole or primary purpose of creating real or perceived incompatibility
between Microsoft's products and Caldera's products.

For an order granting permanent injunctive relief as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to eliminate the effects of
Microsoft's violations of the antitrust laws and to restore effective
competition in the computer software industry.

For the award to plaintiff of its attorneys' fees and costs of suit.

For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
equitable.

Dated this 23 day of July, 1996.

MEMORANDUM OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO
STRIKE MICROSOFT'S PETITION FOR AN ORDER SETTING ASIDE CIVIL
INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND NO. 13187 

This memorandum is submitted in support of the United States motion to
strike Microsoft's Petition For An Order Setting Aside Civil
Investigative Demand No. 13187, which was filed with this Court on
Friday, June 23, 1995. Last week, in a follow-up to an on-going
investigation, the Government submitted to Microsoft a Civil
Investigative Demand (CID) setting out certain interrogatories and
requests for the production of documents. The cover letter
accompanying the CID made two express points: (i) that document
production could be deferred or avoided altogether depending on the
interrogatory answers; and (ii) that the government was willing to
work with Microsoft to the extent Microsoft had any difficulty with
the scope or timing of the CID. Discussions with Microsoft promptly
ensured, and Microsoft, implicitly acknowledging the relevance of the
government's requests, made a proposal (on Thursday night, June 22) as
to scope and timing of compliance. Then, without waiting for the
government to respond to that proposal, on the very next morning
(Friday, June 28) Microsoft filed its petition seeking to set aside
the CID. Microsoft's petition was improper and unnecessarily
preterminated ongoing negotiations that were taking place between
Microsoft and the Government. 

As support for this Motion, the government states as follows: 

1. As the press has reported, and as Microsoft's Petition and the
attached CIDs establish, the Justice Department currently is
investigating the state of competition in the market for on-line
services, with particular regard to whether and how Microsoft's
proposed entry into that market by incorporating copies of its new
on-line service, Microsoft Network, in copies of its Windows 95
operating system, will harm competition in that market. 

2. The Justice Department notified Microsoft's counsel of this
investigation and served its first CID on June 4, 1995. See Exhibit A
hereto. Microsoft promptly announced that it would cooperate fully
with the investigation, and negotiated and agreed upon a schedule for
interrogatory answers and documents to be produced. See Exhibit B
hereto, incorporating the terms of Microsoft's agreement to the first
CID. The return date on the first CID was June 9, 1995. In discussions
with counsel representing the Justice Department, Microsoft sought and
received an extension to answer interrogatories until Monday, June 12,
1995, and an extension to produce documents until June 26, 1995. The
government raised no objection to either extension and readily changed
the due date by agreement with the party, which is the standard course
for CIDs. 

3. Windows 95 has been announced for release on August 24, 1995.
Because of the developing market situation, and the urgency of
reaching a conclusion promptly, the government has worked with
Microsoft and third parties to understand the most current market
facts, and additionally had issued CIDs to a number of original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), other on-line service providers, and
numerous content providers, all of which responded on a few days
notice and promptly, as did Microsoft, to the first CID. 

4. A courtesy copy of the Justice Department's second CID was served
upon Microsoft on June 19, 1995, both by hand delivery and on its
General Counsel by fax. Accompanying the second CID was a letter from
the Assistant Attorney General, attached hereto as Exhibit C, stating
that, given the shortness of time, answers to the interrogatories only
were requested by the return date on the CID, June 23, 1995, and that
most of the document production could be postponed until some later
time. Microsoft never responded to the letter from the Assistant
Attorney general. 

5. The Assistant Attorney General and numerous staff met with
Microsoft's general counsel and several private attorneys representing
Microsoft for several hours during the day of Tuesday, June 20, 1995.
No reference was made to the CID served the night before, nor was any
objection raised to the time period for responding. The meeting lasted
from approximately 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. with a break for lunch, and
many issues concerning the current investigation were discussed, as
well as other issues. 

6. On Wednesday, June 21, 1995, Microsoft was scheduled to have a
conference call to negotiate the government's second request for
information, served on June 1, 1995. The Assistant Attorney General
called Ms. Debra Vogt, manager of Litigation for Microsoft, to inform
her that minor amendments were being made to clarify the information
request, and that two document requests and three additional
interrogatories were being added. The Department then faxed the
amended CID with the changes in bold letters to Microsoft in the
afternoon of June 21, 1995. It was the Department's expectation that,
as had done previously under the first CID, the matter would be
negotiated on a reasonable time schedule. 

7. On the afternoon of Thursday, June 22, 1995 (after Microsoft
requested a one-day delay in conducting discussions concerning the
CID), Microsoft's attorneys spoke to the attorney, Reid B. Horwitz,
representing the Justice Department for the purpose of negotiating
compliance with the second CID. See Declaration for the purpose of
("Horwitz Dec'l) Paras. 4-5, attached hereto as Exhibit D. Microsoft
did not at any time state that the government was not entitled to this
discovery, and indeed given its agreement to the earlier discovery and
to the relevance thereof, such an objection would have been
ill-founded. Instead, Microsoft agreed to produce all documents
requested by July 24, 1995 on a rolling basis, subject to limitations
for the search group and the time of the search. Horwitz Dec'l Para.
6. Microsoft offered to search the files of five individuals and to
limit the search from January 1, 1994 to the date of the search.
Horwitz Dec'l Para. 7. 

8. With respect to interrogatories, Microsoft agreed to answer fully a
large percentage of the interrogatories, and to provide full responses
limited to years in certain instances, rather than months, with regard
to a number of others. Horwitz Dec'l Paras. 8, 10. With respect to a
number of other interrogatories, Microsoft agreed to provide answers
in a different format. 

9. The Department accordingly understood that Microsoft was proposing
to answer all document requests, subject to the search group and time
limitation, and most of the interrogatories, no later than July 24,
1995. The Department was in the process of considering the timeliness
of Microsoft's response, given other issues ongoing in the
investigation, when the Assistant Attorney General received an
unexpected call from Mr. Richard Urowsky, attorney for Microsoft,
stating that he was standing in the chambers of Judge Ward at
approximately 9:45 a.m. on the morning of Friday, June 23, 1995, and
had filed a petition to set aside the Department's CID. The papers had
not been sent to the Department, and the Assistant Attorney General
said that, because the Department had no notice and did not know what
grounds were specified in the petition, the Department would like a
chance to review Microsoft's papers before speaking to the Court
directly. A briefing schedule for the Motion was worked out later that
day and is incorporated in Mr. Urowksy's letter to Judge Ward. See
Exhibit E, attached hereto. 

10. On the afternoon of Friday, June 23, 1995, the Department called
Mr. Urowsky directly to ask why Microsoft filed the petition, and why
the discussions, which were ongoing as of Thursday, June 22, 1995,
were abruptly broken off. Mr. Urowsky answered that he had been unable
to reach his client, Microsoft, throughout the day on Friday, June 23,
1995, and could not respond to that directly before doing so. 

11. Finally, the government today again advised counsel for Microsoft
that it was willing to accept compliance with the CID as proposed by
Microsoft on June 22, 1995, and as set forth in Mr. Horwitz's attached
declaration. Microsoft did not accept the government offer. 

ARGUMENT

Based on these events, it is clear that Microsoft has used the excuse
of the return date on the CID of June 23, 1995, (i) to abruptly
terminate an established negotiating process under which the
Department, just two weeks previously, had willingly extended the
return date by two and a half weeks; and (ii) to ignore completely the
offer in the Assistant Attorney general's letter, dated June 19, 1995,
to suspend ant requirement to produce documents until interrogatories
were unanswered. Microsoft, therefore, has seized upon a purported
disagreement over the scope and time of the government CID, as to
which the parties were in the mist of negotiations, to rush into Court
to short-circuit a well-established process for resolving discovery
disputes. 

Had Microsoft not acted precipitously, it would have concluded, as it
should, that there is no dispute at all. The government was prepared
to accept, and remains prepared to accept, Microsoft's proposal as
made by Microsoft ad its attorneys on the afternoon of Thursday, June
22, 1995, to Reid B. Horwitz and as reflected in his Declaration. But
Microsoft, by filing papers that do not mention this offer within
three business hours of their meeting with Mr. Horwitz, gave the
government no practical opportunity to resolve the matter. Microsoft's
petition thus violates, at a minimum, the spirit of local rule 3(f) of
this Court, which requires parties in discovery disputes to "confer[]
with counsel for the opposing party in an effort in good faith to
resolve by agreement the issues raised by the [petition] without the
invention of the court." S.D.N.Y. R. 3(f). 

The government would note that its efforts to complete discovery in a
compressed and limited time frame is intended to benefit Microsoft.
The government has worked tirelessly to ensure that its investigation
accommodates not only Microsoft's marketing efforts with respect to
its Windows 95 product, but also third parties who will sell that
product and associated products. By refusing to produce until July 24,
1995, documents that, through its June 2, 1995, offer, Microsoft
conceded are relevant, Microsoft now appears to have chosen to delay
substantially completion of the investigation. 

The government's investigation is continuing. The issues under
investigation and the parties who have complied willingly include most
parties in the industry, including many OEMs and content providers --
but not Microsoft. Because Windows 95 is Microsoft's product, and it
is Microsoft's plan to bundle a product in a competitive, adjacent
market with its monopoly operating system, it is Microsoft, even more
than other parties, that should be working expeditiously to aid the
Department to reach a conclusion as promptly as possible. 

In conclusion, Microsoft's petition is a tempest in a teapot, raising
a matter that can and should be resolved by the parties without the
need to resort to intervention by this Court. This Court need not
concern itself with mundane discovery disputes that were effectively
worked out before Microsoft rushed into Court with a precipitous,
unnecessary, and improper petition. 

CONCLUSION

The United State's Motion to Strike should be granted. 

Respectfully submitted,

    Misc. Action No. 94-

VERIFIED PETITION OF MICROSOFT
CORPORATION FOR AN ORDER SETTING ASIDE
CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND NO. 13187

 Petitioner Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), by its
undersigned attorneys, respectfully states as follows:

  1. Microsoft is a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Washington, with its principal place of
business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399.

  2. Microsoft was founded in 1975. The company develops and
markets licences a wide range of software productsproducts used
in computers. Microsoft provides operating system software
products, such as MS-DOS, Windows, Windows NT and (soon) Windows
95. Microsoft provides applications software -- including Word
and Excel, Microsoft's popular word processing and spreadsheet
software products -- for both IBM-compatible computers and the
Apple Macintosh. Microsoft provides a variety of software
development tools and programming languages that can be used by
independent software developers ("ISVs") to create applications
software products that will run on Microsoft operating systems.
Microsoft manufactures hardware peripherals like the mouse
pointing device.

  3. Respondent is the Assistant Attorney General in charge of
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice. Respondent signed the Civil Investigative Demand
("CID") that is the subject of this petition.

  4. Jurisdiction for the Court to hear this petition is
conferred by Section 5(e) of the Antitrust Civil Process Act, 15
U.S.C. Section 1314(e).

  5. Venue is proper in this Court under Section 5(b)(1)(B) of
the Antitrust Civil Process Act, 15 U.S.C. Section
1314(b)(1)(A), because Microsoft transacts business in the
Southern District of New York.

 CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND NO. 13187

  6. On June 5, 1995, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") served Microsoft with Civil
Investigative Demand No. 13025, dated June 4, 1995, directing
Microsoft to answer 12 interrogatories and to produce documents
responsive to 16 document production requests by 10:00 A.M. on
June 9, 1995. (A copy of the June 4 CID is annexed hereto as
Exhibit A and is made a part hereof.) The focus of the June 4
CID was The Microsoft Network ("MSN"), a new online information
service that Microsoft is planning to launch on August 24, 1995.
Microsoft has invested large sums of money in developing MSN
over the last several years in order to compete with existing
online information services like America Online, CompuServe and
Prodigy.

  7. Following negotiations between Microsoft and the DOJ, it
was agreed that Microsoft would answer all but two of the
interrogatories in the June 4 CID (as modified) by Monday, June
12, 1995, and that Microsoft would answer the remaining two
interrogatories by Wednesday, June 14, 1995. Microsoft has fully
complied with that undertaking. In addition, Microsoft and the
DOJ agreed that Microsoft would provide documents responsive to
the document production requests in the June 4 CID by Monday,
June 23, 1995. Microsoft has every expectation of meeting that
deadline as well.

  8. On June 19, 1995, respondent sent a letter informing
Microsoft that it would be receiving a "follow-up and
supplemental CID" later in the day. (A copy of that letter is
annexed hereto as Exhibit B and is made a part hereof.) In fact,
no CID was served on June 19, 1995. Instead, late Monday
evening, the DOJ sent Microsoft's counsel -- who were in
Washington, D.C. to attend a meeting with respondent on Tuesday,
June 20, 1995 -- a schedule of interrogatories and document
production requests that was not accompanied by any CID. (A copy
of that schedule is annexed hereto as Exhibit C and made a part
hereof.)

  9. Microsoft's counsel spent most of the next day in a
meeting with respondent and her colleagues, traveling back to
Seattle and New York on Tuesday evening. It was not until
Wednesday afternoon, June 22, 1995, that the DOJ faxed Civil
Investigative Demand No. 13187, dated June 21, 1995, to
Microsoft. (A copy of the June 21 CID is annexed hereto as
Exhibit D and made a part hereof.) The June 21 CID directs
Microsoft to answer 29 interrogatories (many of which contain
multiple questions) and to produce documents responsive to 16
broad document production requests by 10:00 A.M. today, June 23,
1995.

  10. On Thursday, June 22, 1995, Microsoft's counsel spoke
with the DOJ lawyer designated by respondent in an effort to
reach some accommodation concerning the June 21 CID. That
discussion was expressly without prejudice to Microsoft's rights
to challenge the June 21 CID as legally defective. The DOJ
lawyer, who had no involvement in drafting the June 21 CID and
no authority to agree to any modification of it, was unable to
explain the relevance of the information sought in the CID to
the investigation described on the face of the CID. At
approximately _:__ P.M. yesterday, the DOJ lawyer stated that
Microsoft's proposed accommodation was unacceptable to
respondent and Microsoft concluded that further negotiations
were unlikely to be productive given its need to seek relief
from the June 21 CID before 10:00 A.M. this morning.

  11. The return date specified in the June 21 CID is less than
48 hours after Microsoft first received a copy of the CID by
facsimile and less than 24 hours after Microsoft was formally
served with a copy of the CID. Given the scope information
sought in the June 21 CID and the fact that Microsoft is still
in the process of responding to an earlier CID that addresses
the same topics, the schedule set by the DOJ is obviously
unreasonable. By this petition, Microsoft respectfully asks that
the June 21 CID be set aside.

  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

  12. Microsoft does not lightly invoke the jurisdiction of
this Court, understanding fully the reluctance of judges to
interfere with the decisions of federal enforcement agencies
concerning the appropriate scope of discovery in an
investigation. But Microsoft (and its customers and business
partners) has been subjected to a series of burdensome document
demands from the DOJ over the last two years that shows no sign
of abating.

  13. At present, Microsoft is working at a furious pace to
insure that its new operating system software, Windows 95, will
be commercially released on August 24, 1995 as currently
planned. In addition, Microsoft is putting the finishing touches
on its new entry into the online services business, MSN. Rather
than applauding Microsoft for providing consumers with
innovative new software products at low prices and for making de
novo entry in a related businesses like online information
services, the DOJ seems to be doing its level best to hinder
Microsoft's efforts.

  14. The source of the DOJ's concern is Microsoft's decision
-- which was publicly announced in November 1994, i.e., more
than more than six months ago -- to include access software for
MSN as a feature of Windows 95. There is nothing anticompetitive
about that decision, which will provide consumers with an easy
mechanism for subscribing to Microsoft's new online information
service if they choose to do so. The mere fact that MSN access
software will be available in Windows 95 does not mean that
consumers must subscribe to MSN or even that they are likely to
do so. And the inclusion of MSN access software does nothing to
impair the ability of existing online information services to
continue distributing their access to consumers as they have in
the past. In short, there is no occasion for panic.

  15. The sense of urgency surrounding the DOJ's most recent
investigation of Microsoft is all the more puzzling given the
weakness of the DOJ's legal position. To succeed with a claim
under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 2 -- the
only statute referred to in the June 21 CID -- the DOJ must
prove (i) that Windows 95 -- an operating system that has not
yet been commercially released -- provides Microsoft with the
ability to wield monopoly power or (ii) that including MSN
access software with Windows 95 will permit Microsoft to
monopolize the online information services (or come dangerously
close to doing so). Such claims are, quite frankly, ridiculous.

  16. By this simple logic, Windows 95 cannot give Microsoft
the ability to fix prices for operating system software or to
exclude competitors from the that segment of the software
business because Microsoft has yet to sell a single copy of
Windows 95. And in arguing that Microsoft might achieve some
competitive advantage by including MSN access software with
Windows 95, the DOJ ignores that such unilateral action -- even
by a monopolist -- cannot be challenged under the antitrust laws
unless it constitutes monopolization or attempted
monopolization. When America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy have
millions of subscribers and Microsoft has zero, it is spurious
for he DOJ to assert that Microsoft has a monopoly in online
information services or that there is any dangerous probability
of Microsoft achieving such a monopoly.

  17. The DOJ's insistence that Microsoft put all other
business aside at a busy and important time in order to provide
the DOJ with instant gratification of its seemingly insatiable
appetite for information from Microsoft is neither fair nor
appropriate. The June 21 CID should be set aside.

  FACTUAL BACKGROUND

  A. The FTC Investigation

  18. Microsoft is well acquainted with burdensome government
demands for information. During the investigation of the company
by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") -- which began in
June 1990 and dragged on for more than three years before being
closed in August 1993 with no enforcement action having been
taken -- Microsoft complied with four subpoenas seeking
information about virtually every aspect of the company's
business. Microsoft also responded to a seemingly endless stream
of informal requests from the FTC Staff for documents and
information.

 B. The First DOJ Investigation

  19. In August 1993, the DOJ took the highly unusual step of
instituting its own investigation of Microsoft on the heels of
the FTC's three-year probe. The DOJ obtained the FTC's
investigational files which contained a mass of information
gathered from Microsoft and third parties, totaling more than
400,000 pages of documentary evidence and approximately 500
diskettes of electronically-stored information.

  20. Building on work done by the FTC Staff, the DOJ sought
further information from Microsoft and the original equipment
manufacturers ("OEMs") who license Microsoft's operating system
software for shipment with some or all of their computers. In
October 1993, the DOJ issued a CID to Microsoft seeking further
information about Microsoft's license agreements with OEMs, as
well as information regarding Microsoft's total sales of various
kinds of software products.

  21. In February 1994, after seven months of investigation,
the DOJ issued an omnibus CID seeking evidence to support
theories of antitrust liability that had been pursued without
positive result since June 1990. That CID resuscitated theories
that even the FTC Staff had considered and specifically
rejected.

  22. Following Microsoft's production of hundreds of thousands
of documents in response to the February 14 CID, the DOJ
announced that it would take the depositions of Microsoft's most
senior executives, including William H. Gates III, Microsoft's
chairman and chief executive officer. Those depositions covered
a wide range of topics.

  23. On June 17, 1994, the DOJ initiated discussions with
Microsoft concerning a possible settlement. Following four weeks
of intensive negotiations, the parties reached an agreement that
brought an end to the DOJ investigation. That agreement was
embodied in a proposed Final Judgment subject to review under
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. Section
16(b)-(h), commonly known as the Tunney Act. The district court
declined to approve the proposed Final Judgment. See United
States v. Microsoft Corp., 159 F.R.D. 318 (D.D.C. 1995). One
week ago, however, that decision was reversed and remanded with
instructions that the Final Judgment be entered and that the
case be reassigned to another district judge for purposes of
supervising compliance with the Final Judgment. See United
States v. Microsoft Corp., 1995 WL 357850 (D.C. Cir. June 16,
1995).

  C. The DOJ's Investigation of the Intuit Merger

  24. On October 13, 1994, while the Tunney Act proceeding was
still pending, Microsoft agreed to acquire Intuit, a company
whose three major products are Quicken personal finance
software, TurboTax tax preparation software and QuickBooks
business accounting software. Microsoft develops and markets
Money, a personal finance software product that competes with
Quicken.

  25. To eliminate concern that its acquisition of Intuit might
substantially lessen competition in personal finance software --
the only line of business directly affected by the planned
transaction -- Microsoft agreed to divest its Money personal
finance software to Novell, Inc. ("Novell"), a financially
strong and technically sophisticated company with a wide range
of applications software. By adopting a "fix it first" approach,
which the DOJ encourages, Microsoft eliminated the only
overlapping product offerings of the two companies.

  26. The very same day that Microsoft filed its premerger
notification form under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the DOJ
served a CID on Microsoft containing. The document production
requests in the October 21 CID sought a wide range of documents
relating to the planned acquisition of Intuit and the
divestiture of Microsoft Money to Novell. Microsoft produced 44
boxes of documents responsive to the CID which, together with
Microsoft's answers to interrogatories, provided the DOJ with a
large quantities of information concerning the transaction.

  27. Despite having already gathered more than enough
information to make a decision as to whether to sue to block
Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Intuit, the DOJ issued a
wildly overbroad Second Request to Microsoft in November 1994.
Unlike the earlier October 21 CID, which focused on products
relevant to the planned transaction, the 55 interrogatories and
42 document production requests in the Second Request sought
huge quantities of information about products such as word
processing software and operating system software that Intuit
does not develop or market. Such products thus had no
conceivable relevance to whether Microsoft's proposed
acquisition of Intuit threatened to substantially lessen
competition in personal finance software. In addition, the
Second Request sought to reopen issues that had been thoroughly
explored during the DOJ's earlier investigation of Microsoft.

  28. The DOJ agreed to modify the Second Request in certain
respects to remove the most egregious requests for irrelevant
information. Even with those modifications, however, it took 60
lawyers and paralegals working seven days a week to answer the
interrogatories (those answers stand more than a foot high) and
to produce in excess of 800 boxes of documents. The overbreadth
of the Second Request delayed Microsoft's ability to declare
substantial compliance until April 7, 1995, almost six months
after the transaction was announced.

  29. On April 28, 1995, the DOJ brought an action seeking to
enjoin Microsoft's planned merger with Intuit on the strained
theory that although there would be no horizontal overlap
between the product offerings of the two companies following the
divestiture of Microsoft Money to Novell, there was a risk that
Microsoft might be able to monopolize online financial services
-- a new business in which formidable competitors like banks,
securities brokerages and insurance companies control the most
important assets, i.e., account relationships with customers.
Confronted with the prospect of months, if not years, of
additional delay, Microsoft was forced to abandon the
transaction.

  D. The DOJ's Ongoing Efforts to Regulate Microsoft's Business

  30. Apparently emboldened by Microsoft's decision to abandon
the Intuit transaction rather than suffer potentially
interminable delays, the DOJ is now seeking to intrude itself
into various other aspects of Microsoft's business. There is no
basis, however, for subjecting Microsoft to such pervasive
government regulation, nor is the DOJ authorized to serve, in
respondent's words, as a "Microsoft complaints center" for
competitors like IBM. (A copy of the May 22, 1995 New York Times
article in which that statement is quoted is annexed hereto as
Exhibit F and made a part hereof.) Such wealthy and powerful
companies are perfectly capable of fending for themselves.

  31. More importantly, the Department should not be seeking to
interfere with development of an emerging industry like on-line
information services. Such interference almost inevitably harms
consumers, which is why it has long been eschewed by antitrust
enforcement agencies in this country. The companies whose
interests the DOJ is currently championing -- America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy -- are obviously unhappy that Microsoft
is investing heavily in the on-line information services
business, but that what competition is all about. Any attempt by
the DOJ to shield companies like America Online from the
competitive process would be antithetical to the public
interest. See generally Chattanooga Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. U.S.
Dept. of Justice, 358 F.2d 864, 867 (6th Cir. 1966)

  32. The June 21 CID is the latest salvo in what increasingly
appears to be a campaign of harassment directed against
Microsoft by the DOJ. Unfortunately, Microsoft's customers and
business partners also find themselves in the line of fire, and
their anger at being put to the trouble and expense of
responding to a seemingly endless series of demands for
information from the DOJ about their dealings with Microsoft is
becoming a serious impediment to Microsoft's ability to conduct
its business.

  33. The DOJ is vested with enormous power in investigating
potential antitrust violations which should be exercised in a
responsible manner. Microsoft's ability to protect itself from
abusive behavior by the DOJ is limited to the protections
afforded by the Antitrust Civil Process Act, 15 U.S.C. Section
1312, et seq. That statute, however, plainly prohibits the sort
of vexatious tactics reflected in the June 21 CID.

  APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

  34. The June 21 CID was served upon Microsoft in purported
compliance with the Antitrust Civil Process Act ( the "Act"), 15
U.S.C. Section 1312, et seq. Under the Act, courts are
authorized to set aside or modify a CID if the information
sought by the CID would be protected from disclosure under (i)
"the standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum
issued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury
investigation," or (ii) "the standards applicable to discovery
requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the
extent that the application of such standards to any such demand
is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes
of this chapter." 15 U.S.C. Section 1312(c)(1).

  35. Courts interpreting 15 U.S.C. Section 1312(c)(1) have
held that a CID may be set aside or modified if it is
"unreasonable or oppressive" in violation of Rule 17(c) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. See Associated Container
Transportation (Australia) Ltd. v. United States, 705 F.2d 53,
58 (2d Cir. 1983). A grand jury subpoena will be deemed
unreasonable or oppressive under Rule 17(c) if it is "far too
sweeping" in scope. See In re Subpoenas to Local 478,
International Union of Operating Engineers & Benefit Funds, 708
F.2d 65, 70 n.5 (2d Cir. 1983) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S.
43, 76 (1906)); see also United States v. Doe, 457 F.2d. 895,
899 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 941 (1973).

  36. Similarly, a CID may be set aside or modified to protect
the target of a DOJ investigation from "annoyance, oppression or
undue burden or expense" if (i) the information it seeks is not
relevant to the subject matter of the investigation, Rule
26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., (ii) "the discovery sought is
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative," Rule 26(b)(2), Fed. R.
Civ. P., or (iii) the "the burden or expense of the proposed
discovery outweighs its likely benefit," id.; see H.R. Rep. No.
1343, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, reprinted in [1976] U.S. Code
Cong. & Ad. News 2596, 2606.

  37. Under the terms of the Act, cases construing the Act and
the Act's legislative history, it is apparent that the June 21
CID is infirm and should be set aside.

  38. First, the Act does not permit the DOJ to conduct the
full range of discovery that would be available to it after an
enforcement action is instituted. Rather, the DOJ may use CIDs
only to seek information that is necessary to enable the DOJ "to
make a more informed judgment on whether or not to institute a
civil suit." H.R. Rep. No. 1343, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2,
reprinted in [1976] U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2596, 2597. As
the court stated in United States v. Witmer, 835 F. Supp. 208,
219 (M.D. Pa. 1993), "using the CIDs for a purpose other than to
determine if there is sufficient evidence to file suit would be
improper."

  39. Thus, a CID may be set aside where, as here, the DOJ "is
engaged in 'an unlimited, exploratory investigation whose
purposes and limits can be determined only as it proceeds.'"
H.R. Rep. No. 1343, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, reprinted in [1976]
U.S. Cong. & Ad. News 2596, 2605 (quoting In re Grand Jury
Investigation (General Motors Corp.), 174 F. Supp. 393, 395
(S.D.N.Y. 1959)). This is consistent with the general principle
that a government subpoena cannot be justified under a "claim of
'an unlimited right of access to the respondents' papers . . .
relevant or irrelevant, in hope that something will turn up.'"
Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 207 n.40
(1946) (quoting FTC v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 305
(1924)). It is impossible to determine from the face of the CID,
and has certainly never been explained to Microsoft in
comprehensible fashion by the DOJ, how the inclusion of access
software for MSN -- an online information service that has not
yet been launched -- in Windows 95 -- an operating system that
has not yet been released -- could possibly violate Section 2 of
the Sherman Act. The DOJ is not free to turn Microsoft upside
down in a quest to find something objectionable about such an
ordinary business practice.

  40. Second, the Act expressly requires the DOJ to identify,
as to each interrogatory and document request, the "conduct
constituting the alleged antitrust violations . . . which are
under investigation and the provision of law applicable
thereto." 15 U.S.C. Section 1312(b)(1)(A). The DOJ has not
complied with this requirement. Rather, the June 21 CID states
only that the DOJ is investigating whether Microsoft has engaged
in conduct that violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act, i.e.,
monopolization or attempted monopolization, by virtue of
"bundling of Microsoft Network with Windows 95." That, however,
is a complete non sequitur. MSN is an online information
service; a consumer who has chosen to license Windows 95 must
make an entirely independent decision whether to subscribe to
the network. It would be possible for Microsoft to condition the
sale of Windows 95 on a consumer's agreement to subscribe to
MSN, at which point it might make some sense to say that the
online information service had been "bundled" with the operating
system, but that would almost certainly constitute an illegal
tying arrangement under Section 1 and is, in any event, not
something Microsoft has any intention of doing. Cf. In re Union
Oil Co. of California, 225 F. Supp. 486, 487 (S.D. Cal. 1963)
(CID can be set aside as facially invalid if conduct described
as subject of investigation cannot plausibly be said to
constitute violation of antitrust statute referenced in CID),
aff'd, 343 F.2d 29 (9th Cir. 1965).

  41. Because the scope of the investigation as described on
the face of the CID is nonsensical -- MSN is an online
information service that is not, and cannot, be "bundled" into
an operating system like Windows 95 -- it is impossible for
Microsoft or this Court to assess whether particular requests
contained in the June 21 CID are proper under the Act. As the
court stated in Material Handling Institute, Inc. v. McLaren,
426 F.2d 90, 92 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 826 (1970), a
generalized statement by the DOJ that it purports to be
"investigating a possible violation of section 1 of the Sherman
Act by a 'contract or combination in unreasonable restraint of
trade'" is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act.
The same, of course, applies to Section 2.

  42. The test for determining whether the DOJ has complied
with its obligation to specify the conduct alleged to constitute
an antitrust violation and the law applicable to that conduct is
whether the statements in the CID are "sufficient to inform
adequately the person being investigated and sufficient to
determine the relevancy of the documents demanded for
inspection." In re Gold Bond Stamp Co., 221 F. Supp. 391, 397
(D. Minn. 1963) (emphasis in original), aff'd, 325 F.2d 1018
(8th Cir. 1964). Microsoft cannot determine how many of the
interrogatories and document production requests in the June 21
CID have any bearing on whether Microsoft's inclusion of MSN
access software as a feature of Windows 95 may violate Section
2, and the DOJ lawyer designated by respondent to discuss the
June 21 CID with Microsoft's counsel was unable to shed any
light on that subject. The DOJ's failure to articulate any
logical connection between much of the information sought in the
June 21 CID and a claim under Section 2 -- even assuming that
such a claim was legally cognizable -- is further reason to set
aside the CID.

  43. Third, the Act's requirement that the scope of the
information requested be reasonable is violated by requests for
information that relate to conduct that cannot possibly
constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. The DOJ cannot
seriously assert a monopolization or attempted monopolization
claim based on two products that have not yet been commercially
released. Even if the Court determines that the DOJ is entitled
to explore the possibility of a Section 2 claim, the glaring
flaws in the DOJ's underlying legal theory should be borne in
mind in determining whether the substantial burden imposed on
Microsoft in responding to the June 21 CID is justified,
especially on the highly expedited schedule demanded by the DOJ.

  44. Fourth, and finally, Congress specifically contemplated
that the target of a DOJ investigation could object to a CID on
that ground that it "unreasonably seeks information that has
already been provided to another Federal agency, such as the
FTC." H.R. Rep. No. 1343, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 11, reprinted in
[1976] U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News. 2596, 2605 (footnotes
omitted). A fortiori, a CID is objectionable if it seeks
information that has already been provided to the DOJ itself. A
substantial portion of the June 21 CID is duplicative of
requests for information contained either in the June 4 CID or
in earlier CIDs issued by the DOJ, either in connection with the
proposed Intuit merger or in the DOJ's first investigation of
Microsoft. All of those CIDs have been complied with fully by
Microsoft.

CONCLUSION

  WHEREFORE, for the reasons stated in this petition, the Court
should set aside the June 21 CID in its entirety.

Opinion for the Court filed by *Circuit Judge* Silberman.

Opinion Per Curiam.


Silberman, *Circuit Judge:* Section 16(e) of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act, known as the Tunney Act, requires
the district court to determine whether entry of an antitrust
consent decree is "in the public interest." 15 U.S.C. Section
16(e) (1988). In this case, the district court refused to enter a
proposed consent decree the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice negotiated with Microsoft Corporation. We conclude that
the proposed consent decree is in the public interest, and that
the district court exceeded its authority in concluding to the
contrary. We therefore reverse and remand with instructions to
enter an order approving the decree.


I.

Microsoft dominates the world market for operating systems
software that runs on IBM-compatible personal computers ("PCs").
Operating systems software controls the operation of the computer
and manages the interaction between the computer's memory and
attached devices such as keyboards, printers, display screens and
disk drives. In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission began
investigating Microsoft's acquisition and maintenance of monopoly
power in that market. When faced with the decision whether to file
a complaint against Microsoft, however, the Commission deadlocked
2-2, thus suspending the agency's investigation.

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice then initiated
its own investigation of Microsoft (apparently a rather rare
occurrence), using the FTC's extensive investigatory file as its
starting point. The Department issued 21 Civil Investigative
Demands to Microsoft and third parties, reviewed one million pages
of documents, and conducted over 100 interviews. The Department
also deposed 22 persons, including Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.

In July 1994, the Department filed a civil complaint under the
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 1 and 2 (1988), charging Microsoft
with unlawfully maintaining a monopoly of operating systems for
IBM-compatible PCs and unreasonably restraining trade of the same
through certain anticompetitive marketing practices.

The key anticompetitive practice against which the complaint is
aimed is Microsoft's use of contract terms requiring original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to pay Microsoft a royalty for
each computer the OEM sells containing a particular microprocessor
(in this case, an x86 class microprocessor), whether or not the
OEM has included a Microsoft operating system with that computer.
The practical effect of such "per processor licenses," it is
alleged, is to deter OEMs from using competing operating systems
during the life of their contracts with Microsoft. The complaint
further charges that Microsoft has exacerbated the anticompetitive
effect of the per processor licenses by executing long-term
contracts with major OEMs, and by requiring minimum commitments
and crediting unused balances to future contracts, thereby
extending the contract term and creating an economic disincentive
for an OEM to install a non-Microsoft operating system.

The other anticompetitive device alleged in the complaint is
Microsoft's use of overly restrictive nondisclosure agreements
with certain independent software vendors ("ISVs"). Those ISVs
provide applications software to run "on top of" Microsoft's
operating system, enabling the user to perform a variety of tasks,
such as wordprocessing. Microsoft provides those ISVs with advance
test versions of its newest operating system so that the ISVs can
develop their software to be compatible with that operating
system. The government alleged that Microsoft, as a corollary, has
imposed nondisclosure agreements on some ISVs which would restrict
their ability to work with competing operating systems companies
and to develop competing products for an unreasonably long period
of time.

The government did not allege and does not contend-and this is of
crucial significance to this case-that Microsoft *obtained* its
alleged monopoly position in violation of the antitrust laws. The
government believes that Microsoft's initial acquisition of
monopoly power in the operating systems market was the somewhat
fortuitous result of IBM choosing for its PCs the operating system
introduced by Microsoft ("MS-DOS"), which, with Microsoft's
successful exploitation of that advantage, led Microsoft to obtain
an installed base on millions of IBM, and IBM-compatible, PCs.

It is undisputed that the software market is characterized by
"increasing returns," resulting in natural barriers to entry.
Because the costs of producing software are almost exclusively in
its design, marginal production costs are "virtually zero."
Professor Arrow, the government's consultant and a Nobel-prize
winning economist, described the importance of Microsoft's large
installed base in an increasing returns market as follows:

A software product with a large installed base has several
advantages relative to a new entrant. Consumers know that such a
product is likely to be supported by the vendor with upgrades and
service. Users of a product with a large installed base are more
likely to find that their products are compatible with other
products. They are more likely to be able successfully to exchange
work products with their peers, because a large installed base
makes it more likely that their peers will use the same product or
compatible products. Installed base is particularly important to
the economic success of an operating system software product. The
value of the operating system is in its capability to run
application software. The larger the installed base of a
particular operating system, the more likely it is that
independent software vendors will write programs that run on that
operating system, and, in this circular fashion, the more valuable
the operating system will be to consumers.



In a not uncommon technique, the Department of Justice filed a
proposed consent decree along with its complaint, which embodied
the Department's and Microsoft's settlement of the case. The
consent decree, which essentially tracks the complaint and is
effective for 78 months following its entry, prohibits Microsoft
from entering into per processor licenses, licenses with a term
exceeding one year (unless the customer opts to renew for another
year), licenses containing a minimum commitment, and unduly
restrictive nondisclosure agreements. To prevent Microsoft from
using other exclusionary practices to achieve effects similar to
those achieved by the practices challenged in the complaint, the
proposed decree also prohibits certain other arrangements such as
lump-sum pricing and variants of per processor licensing. The
decree applies to Microsoft's most popular operating systems
products (MS-DOS, Windows and Windows 95) and successor versions
or operating systems marketed as replacement products. The decree
does not, however, cover "Windows NT" products, which are designed
for sophisticated "high end users" and which do not enjoy a
substantial portion of the market for such products.

Pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C. Section
16(b) (1988), the Department of Justice published the proposed
decree in the Federal Register, accompanied by a competitive
impact statement, and invited comment. *See* 59 Fed. Reg. 42,845
(1994). Only five comments were received during the statutory
period, to which the government responded on October 31, 1994.

At the first substantive status conference on September 29, 1994,
the district judge informed the parties that over the summer he
had read a book about Microsoft-*Hard Drive*[n.~1]-because he
"thought it would be a good idea maybe to know as much about
Microsoft as probably they're going to know about me." Much of the
ensuing discussion focused on accusations against Microsoft
contained in the book. The district judge asked whether the
government's lawyers had read the book and whether they had
investigated the allegations made by its authors. In particular,
the judge focused on the allegation that Microsoft engages in
"vaporware," which he described in differing terms but ultimately
defined as "the public announcement of a computer product before
it is ready for market for the sole purpose of causing consumers
not to purchase a competitor's product that has been developed and
is either currently available for sale or momentarily about to
enter the market." *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*, 159 F.R.D.
318, 334 (D.D.C. 1995) ("*Opinion*").[n.~2] (The judge insisted
that even truthful product preannouncements would violate the
securities laws, if not the antitrust laws.)

According to the district judge, *Hard Drive* also claimed that
Microsoft's own applications developers have unfair access to
information about Microsoft's operating systems, giving them an
undue advantage over competitors in developing applications
software that is compatible with Microsoft's operating systems.
The government did not include "vaporware" or unfair access
charges in its complaint against Microsoft.

At a subsequent status hearing on November 2, 1994, the district
judge again referred to *Hard Drive* and its "vaporware"
allegations, noting that the book "does allege some very serious
practices," and telling the government that he wanted to be
satisfied that the allegations in the book were not true. The
Department was instructed to inform interested persons that they
had until December 5, 1994 to seek leave to participate in the
court's hearing on the consent decree. Only I.D.E. Corporation,
which had participated in the comment process, sought leave to
participate in the hearing. But on January 10, 1995, (over a month
late and over the objection of both the government and Microsoft),
the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, on behalf of
three computer industry companies ("Doe Companies"), filed a
96-page memorandum (plus a 215-page appendix) arguing that the
proposed consent decree was inadequate because it would not result
in increased competition in the operating systems market, nor
prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the rest of the software
industry. The Doe Companies claimed that because of the unusual
"increasing returns" nature of Microsoft's market position, it
would be extremely difficult to dislodge Microsoft from its
dominant status and return the market to a state of equilibrium,
or competition. Moreover, they claimed that Microsoft had the
capacity to leverage its installed base in the operating systems
market so as to dominate the related markets for applications and
other software products. The Doe Companies also attached two
documents purporting to show that Microsoft had engaged in
"vaporware."[n.~3] Wilson, Sonsini's brief was accompanied by a
motion requesting that the district court permit the late filing,
and also permit the purported computer industry companies to
remain anonymous, asserting "fear" that they would be subject to
unexplained retaliation from Microsoft. The district court,
without a hearing on the need for or propriety of the Doe
Companies' proceeding anonymously, granted the motion over the
government's and Microsoft's objections.

On January 18, 1995, the United States filed a motion for entry of
the decree (later joined orally by Microsoft at the district
court's January 20, 1995 hearing) and attached an affidavit from
Professor Arrow. As noted, Professor Arrow agreed with *amici*
that in an increasing returns market there is a possibility of
monopolization, which may be inefficient; but, he claimed, this
process is entirely natural. He specifically rejected the notion
that the government should intervene where, as he believed was the
case here, the market success of the dominant firm was not the
result of anticompetitive practices. Professor Arrow concluded
that only artificial barriers, such as the licensing practices
addressed in the decree, should be regulated or prohibited.

The next day the district court issued an order identifying issues
to be addressed at the hearing scheduled for the following day.
The parties were requested to explain why, among other things, the
consent decree did not contain provisions that would (1) bar
Microsoft from engaging in "vaporware," (2) establish a wall
between the development of operating systems software and the
development of applications software at Microsoft, and (3) require
disclosure of all instruction codes built into operating systems
software designed to give Microsoft an advantage over competitors
in the applications software market. *See Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at
326-27 n.15. The Computer & Communications Industry Association
("CCIA") filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively,
to participate as *amicus curiae.*

The district court allowed I.D.E. Corporation, CCIA and the Doe
Companies to participate in the January 20, 1995 hearing.[n.~4]
All three urged disapproval of the decree. The district judge
devoted substantial time to questioning counsel about "vaporware"
and pressing the government for information regarding its
investigation of "vaporware" allegations-information which the
government declined to provide on the ground that the such
allegations were unrelated to the violations charged in the
complaint.[n.~5]

On February 14, 1995, the district court issued an order denying
the government's motion to approve the consent decree. The judge
stated that he could not find the proposed decree to be in the
public interest for four reasons:

First, the Government has declined to provide the Court with the
information it needs to make a proper public interest
determination. Second, the scope of the decree is too narrow.
Third, the parties have been unable and unwilling adequately to
address certain anticompetitive practices, which Microsoft states
it will continue to employ in the future and with respect to which
the decree is silent. Thus, the decree does not constitute an
effective antitrust remedy. Fourth, the Court is not satisfied
that the enforcement and compliance mechanisms in the decree are
satisfactory.



*Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 332.

The judge's understanding of the extent of additional information
he "need[ed]" to make the public interest determination under the
Tunney Act was quite considerable and was of a character that the
government contended was not only outside the scope of the Tunney
Act, but was also improper for a judge to seek. The court required
at a "minimum":

(1) The broad contours of the investigation *i.e.,* the particular
practices and conduct of the defendant that were under
investigation along with the nature, scope and intensity of the
inquiry;



(2) With respect to such particular practices and conduct, what
were the conclusions reached by the Government;



(3) In the settlement discussions between the Government and
defendant: (a) what were the areas that were discussed, and (b)
what, if any, areas were bargained away and the reasons for their
non-inclusion in the decree;



(4) With respect to the areas not discussed at the bargaining
table or not bargained away, what are the plans for the Government
to deal with them *i.e.,* is the investigation to continue, and,
if so, at what intensity, or if the investigation is to be closed,
then the Government must explain why it is in the public interest
to do so.



*Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 332.

The judge's second objection, going to the *scope* of the decree,
was predicated on his concern that it does not apply to all of
Microsoft's operating systems. The decree, it will be recalled,
explicitly excludes from its coverage "Windows NT." In an apparent
reference to Microsoft's contention that its product
preannouncements do not fit the definition of "vaporware" and do
not constitute antitrust violations, the court further noted that
"taking into account Microsoft's penchant for narrowly defining
the antitrust laws, the Court fears there may be endless debate as
to whether a new operating system is covered by the decree." *Id.*
at 333.

As to the third point-the essence of the *amici*'s objection-the
judge concluded that the decree does not provide an effective
antitrust remedy because it does not "pry open" the market to
competition, *i.e.,* remedy the monopolist position Microsoft has
achieved through supposed illegal means. The judge was especially
concerned that the decree does not address "a number of other
anticompetitive practices that from time to time Microsoft has
been accused of engaging in by others in the industry." *Id.* at
334. Among such practices were "vaporware," Microsoft's "use[
][of] its dominant position in operating systems to give it an
undue advantage in developing applications software," and its
manipulation of its operating systems to render competing
applications software inoperable or more difficult for consumers
to use. *Id.* at 334-35.

Finally, the court determined that the consent decree did not
oblige Microsoft to adopt sufficient internal compliance
mechanisms. Based on its perception that Microsoft had misled the
court about whether it engaged in "vaporware," the district court
concluded that Microsoft's current staff of "50 or so in-house
lawyers, along with its outside retained counsel," were
insufficient to monitor the decree adequately. *Id.* at 336.

The United States and Microsoft appeal from the order refusing to
enter the decree, asking this court to remand with instructions to
enter the decree. Microsoft appeals as well from the order
allowing the anonymous participation of the Doe Companies (and
CCIA's participation), and asks that the case be remanded to
another district court judge because it contends that Judge
Sporkin has demonstrated personal bias against the company.

Since both parties to the decree have appealed the district
court's order, these consolidated cases present the rare situation
in which there is no appellee. Accordingly, we have allowed the
Doe Companies, CCIA and I.D.E. Corporation to continue in their
roles as *amici.*


II.

Both the government and Microsoft contend that the district judge
vastly exceeded his authority under the Tunney Act, and that as a
matter of law they are entitled to the court's entry of the
consent decree. Before considering their arguments, however, we
are obliged to determine that we have jurisdiction to entertain
this appeal. *Amici* contend that we do not. The government (and
Microsoft) rely on 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(a)(1) (1988), which
authorizes interlocutory appeals from orders of the district court
"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving
injunctions...." By refusing to enter the consent decree, the
district court, it is argued, has refused to grant an injunction
within the meaning of that statute. The leading case on point is
*Carson v. American Brands, Inc.,* 450 U.S. 79 (1981), where the
Supreme Court held that a district court's refusal to enter a
consent decree that had the practical effect of denying an
injunction was immediately appealable if the order had a "serious,
perhaps irreparable, consequence," and could only be "effectually
challenged" by immediate appeal. *Id.* at 84, citing *Baltimore
Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger,* 348 U.S. 176, 181 (1955).

The decree at issue here does, as in *Carson,* call for an
injunction: Microsoft would be permanently enjoined from using
what the government contends are anticompetitive licensing
contracts for its PC operating systems. "Indeed, prospective
relief [is] at the very core of the disapproved settlement." *Id.*
To be sure, in *Carson* the district court indicated its
disapproval of the relief sought by a civil rights plaintiff
because it was arguably too extensive; whereas here, the district
judge is objecting because the relief does not appear to him to go
far enough. *Amici* thus describe the district judge's order as a
refusal to *limit* the potential relief available rather than a
refusal to grant injunctive relief. That seems to us to be only a
deft semantic characterization. It matters not whether a district
judge objects to the injunctive relief as too strong or not strong
enough: in either case, the judge is refusing to grant the
injunction except under conditions that the parties will not
accept. Nor is there any doubt in this case that the district
judge had reached a firm determination. His order and opinion make
that quite clear.

*Amici* nevertheless contend that the government has not shown any
"serious consequences" that justify the interlocutory appeal. The
government, it is argued, is only concerned about its settlement
statistics. We disagree. The district court's refusal to enter the
decree puts the government to a difficult, perhaps Hobson's,
choice. It must either drop its case against Microsoft entirely
and allow Microsoft to continue to engage in practices which the
government believes are anticompetitive; or, it is compelled to
litigate and presumably proceed under a vastly expanded complaint
that in effect asserts that Microsoft engaged in activities which
the government does not believe are illegal (*i.e.,* achieving its
dominant position in the first place), or seeks remedies which the
government does not believe are justified by the evidence.
Moreover, as the government points out, the consent decree is part
of a negotiated settlement. A district judge's refusal to accept
the decree-particularly upon the grounds advanced-cannot but have
enormous practical consequences for the government's ability to
negotiate future settlements. *Cf. Carson,* 450 U.S. at 88 n.14
(order refusing to enter consent decree would undermine Title
VII's strong preference for encouraging voluntary settlement of
employment discrimination claims). The Tunney Act was not intended
to create a disincentive to the use of the consent decree. *See,
e.g.,* S. Rep. No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1973) ("The
[Senate Judiciary] Committee wishes to retain the consent judgment
as a substantial antitrust enforcement tool."); H. Rep. No. 1463,
93 Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1974) (expressing intent to preserve the
policy of the antitrust laws to encourage settlement by consent
decree), *reprinted in* 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 6535,
6536-37. We conclude, therefore, that the government easily meets
the *Carson* standard. We have jurisdiction over the appeal.

Microsoft has also appealed the judge's refusal to enter the
consent decree. Actually, in this situation, it is doubtful if we
would have jurisdiction unless both parties to the decree
appealed. Certainly if the government accepted the district
judge's view of the case and wished to proceed to trial, the
propriety of the judge's order would be moot; and, if Microsoft
was no longer willing to agree to the government's conditions, the
issue would similarly be moot.[n.~6] Therefore, both parties must
be entitled to appeal the district judge's refusal to enter the
decree. Microsoft in addition appeals one order that the
government does not: the order allowing participation by the Doe
Companies and CCIA. Microsoft asserts that the district court
erred in permitting the Doe Companies to participate anonymously.

Microsoft argues that the order fits within the "collateral order"
doctrine of *Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,* 337 U.S.
541 (1949), which permits interlocutory review of collateral
orders "that are conclusive, that resolve important questions
completely separate from the merits, and that would render such
important questions effectively unreviewable on appeal from final
judgment in the underlying action." *Digital Equip. Corp. v.
Desktop Direct, Inc.,* 114 S. Ct. 1992, 1995-96 (1994). Normally,
of course, an order permitting or denying *amici* participation
could not qualify under the doctrine. Here, however, the Doe
Companies, the prime opponents of the decree and the most vigorous
accusers of Microsoft, appeared anonymously. That is quite a
departure from normal procedure, and raises profound questions of
fundamental fairness and perhaps even due process. It might well
be that a party forced to confront an anonymous plaintiff (or the
functional equivalent of a plaintiff acting as an *amici* ) could
suffer injury that might not be redressable in an ultimate appeal.
Anonymity may well confer a kind of immunity which permits a
plaintiff to hurl rhetorical weapons that could cause a unique
kind of harm not faced in ordinary litigation. *Cf. McIntyre v.
Ohio Election Comm'n,* 63 U.S.L.W. 4279, 4286 (U.S. Apr. 19, 1995)
(holding that Ohio election law forbidding all anonymous political
leafletting violated the First Amendment but noting that "[t]he
right to remain anonymous may be abused when it shields fraudulent
conduct"). However, in our view, it is unnecessary to decide
whether Microsoft would have been entitled to appeal this order
independently. Since we have concluded that we have jurisdiction
over the basic appeal, the district judge's order permitting the
*amici* to participate is not really interlocutory. It comes
before us as part and parcel of the record in this case.


III.

Appellants contend that the district judge misinterpreted the
Tunney Act-indeed interpreted that statute so as to raise serious
questions regarding its constitutionality-by basing his rejection
of the decree on considerations which implicate the executive
branch's prosecutorial discretion. The thrust of the judge's
concerns were directed to his dissatisfaction with the framework
of the complaint fashioned by the Department. He thought it much
too modest to deal with the imperfections in the relevant market
and their cause-at least as he perceived them. Appellants contend
that the judge did not simply make the proper inquiry into whether
the decree was appropriate to the complaint, but instead asked
whether the complaint itself was adequate. By doing so, it is
argued, the judge improperly intruded on the government's
prosecutorial role. The judge's demand that he be informed of the
contours of the investigation, the settlement discussions, and the
government's future investigative plans, indicates that the judge
impermissibly arrogated to himself the President's role "to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed."

*Amici,* defending the judge's order, argue that it merely focused
on whether the remedy provided in the decree was adequate to the
allegations in the complaint. Appellants respond, however, that
even to the extent that the judge's order is directed to the
adequacy of the remedy to the allegations actually charged-which
they insist is only a minor theme in the judge's opinion-the judge
nevertheless exceeded his authority. Under our own precedent
dealing with uncontested modifications of a consent decree, we
have repeatedly said that a district judge must approve such
modifications so long as the proposed falls "within the *reaches*
of the public interest." *United States v. Western Elec. Co.,* 900
F.2d 283, 309 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("*Triennial Review Opinion* ")
(emphasis in original) (quoting *United States v. Bechtel Corp.*,
648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), *cert. denied,* 454 U.S. 1083
(1981), in turn quoting *United States v. Gillette Co.,* 406 F.
Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975)).

At the heart of this case, then, is the proper scope of the
district court's inquiry into the "public interest." Is the
district judge entitled to seize hold of the matter-the
investigation into the putative defendant's business practices-and
decide for himself the appropriate combined response of the
executive and judicial branches to those practices? With respect
to the specific allegations in the government's complaint, may the
court interpose its own views of the appropriate remedy over those
the government seeks as a part of its overall settlement? To be
sure, Congress, in passing the Tunney Act, intended to prevent
"judicial rubber stamping" of the Justice Department's proposed
consent decree. H.R. Rep. No. 1463, *supra,* at 8, *reprinted in*
1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 6538. The Court was to "make
an independent determination as to whether or not entry of a
proposed consent decree [was] in the public interest." S. Rep. No.
298, *supra,* at 5. Yet, Congress did not purport to alter
antitrust precedent applying the public interest in reviewing
consent decrees. H.R. Rep. No. 1463, *supra,* at 11, *reprinted
in* 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 6539. The difficulty
with that stated purpose is that there was virtually no useful
precedent-certainly none in which an appellate court had approved
a trial court's rejection of a consent decree as outside the
public interest. *Cf. Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act:
Hearings on S.782 and S.1088 Before the Subcomm. on Antitrust and
Monopolies of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary,* 93d Cong., 1st
Sess. 92 (1973) ("Senate Hearings") (Statement of Thomas E.
Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, Dept. of
Justice) ("[E]xcept in cases where a previous judicial mandate is
involved and the consent decree fails to comply with that mandate,
or where there is a showing of bad faith or malfeasance, the
courts have allowed a wide range of prosecutorial discretion.").

Although the statute does not give specific guidance, it does
speak in rather broad terms. In determining whether the decree is
in the public interest, the district court is authorized to
"consider":

(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination
of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and
modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of
alternative remedies actually considered, and any other
considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;



(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally
and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set
forth in the complaint including consideration of the public
benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues
at trial.



15 U.S.C. Section 16(e) (1988).

The Ninth Circuit observed (in a case in which the *defendant*
wished to withdraw from the decree) that that language "suggests
that a court may, and perhaps should, look beyond the strict
relationship between complaint and remedy in evaluating the public
interest." *Bechtel Corp.,* 648 F.2d at 666. But it went on to
determine that "we cannot agree that a district court should
engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best
serve the public." *Id.*[n.~7]

The most prominent post-Tunney Act consent decree, the AT&T
consent decree, was modified by the district judge in several
respects in accordance with his views of the public interest and,
although both the government and AT&T acquiesced, non-parties to
the decree were allowed to intervene for purposes of appealing the
district judge's public interest determination. It does not appear
that any of the appellants challenged the constitutionality of the
Tunney Act, but Justice Rehnquist, speaking for Chief Justice
Burger and Justice White, nevertheless published a dissent from
the order affirming the district court's entry of the decree. *See
Maryland v. United States,* 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). The dissent
expressed grave doubt as to the Act's constitutionality because
without a judicial finding of illegality (a consent decree is, of
course, a settlement), the statute does not supply a judicially
manageable standard for review of the decree, *id.* at 1004, and
the considerations that led the Department of Justice to settle
are not amenable to judicial review, *id.* at 1005-06. *See also
Heckler v. Chaney,* 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). For instance, a
settlement, particularly of a major case, will allow the
Department of Justice to reallocate necessarily limited resources.

The government, cautioning us as to the constitutional
difficulties that inhere in this statute, urges us to flatly
reject the district judge's efforts to reach beyond the complaint
to evaluate claims that the government did *not* make and to
inquire as to why they were not made. We agree. Although the
language of section 16(e) is not precise, we think the government
is correct in contending that section 16(e)(1)'s reference to the
alleged violations suggests that Congress did not mean for a
district judge to construct his own hypothetical case and then
evaluate the decree against that case. Moreover, in section
16(e)(2), the court is authorized to consider "the public benefit
the perplexing question of how the district judge could insure a
trial if the government did not wish one, "the issues" referred to
must be those formulated in the complaint. Congress surely did not
contemplate that the district judge would, by reformulating the
issues, effectively redraft the complaint himself. We therefore
dismiss the claim that the last line in section 16(e)(1), the
catchall clause allowing the district court to entertain "any
other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment,"
authorizes the wide-ranging inquiry the district court wished to
conduct in this case. That language recognizes, *inter alia,* that
a consent decree might well do unexpected harm to persons other
than those "alleging specific injury from the violations set forth
in the complaint." 15 U.S.C. Section 16(e)(2) (1988). And the
district court might ponder those sort of concerns in determining
whether to enter the judgment.

To be sure, the Act also authorizes the district judge to "take
testimony of Government officials ... as the court may deem
appropriate." 15 U.S.C. Section 16(f)(1) (1988). We do not read
this language, however, to authorize the district judge to seek
the kind of information concerning the government's investigation
and settlement negotiations that he wished to obtain here. Even
when a court is explicitly authorized to review government action
under the Administrative Procedure Act, "there must be a strong
showing of bad faith or improper behavior" before the court may
"inquir[e] into the mental processes of administrative
decisionmakers." *Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.
Volpe,* 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971). Here, the district court is not
empowered to review the actions or behavior of the Department of
Justice; the court is only authorized to review the decree itself.
It is unnecessary to consider whether the district court might
have broader authority to inquire into the Department's
deliberations, even though not authorized to "review" the
Department's action, if there were a credible showing of bad
faith. *See* Senate Hearings, *supra,* at 92. There is no such
claim here.

The district court was troubled that if its review were limited to
the market and practices within that market against which the
complaint was directed, the government could, by narrow drafting,
artificially limit the court's review under the Tunney Act. *See
Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 332. We think, with all due respect, that
the district court put the cart before the horse. The court's
authority to review the decree depends entirely on the
government's exercising its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a
case in the first place.

That brings us to *amici*'s contention that the district court was
justified in rejecting the decree as providing inadequate
remedies, even if the court was barred from reaching beyond the
complaint to examine practices the government did not challenge.
The district judge (and *amici* ) believed that the decree would
not "effectively pry open to competition a market that has been
closed by defendant['s] illegal restraints." *Opinion,* 159 F.R.D.
at 333 (quoting *United States v. American Telephone & Telegraph
Co.,* 552 F. Supp. 131, 150 (D.D.C. 1982) (in turn quoting
*International Salt Co. v. United States,* 332 U.S. 392, 401
(1947)), *aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States,* 460 U.S. 1001
(1983)). The judge was especially concerned that Professor Arrow
had not explained "how the decree remedies the monopolist position
Microsoft has achieved through alleged illegal means *in an
increasing returns market.*" *Id.* at 334 (emphasis in original).
And he urged that the decree should address "a number of other
anticompetitive practices that from time to time Microsoft has
been accused of engaging in by others in the industry," such as
"vaporware." *Id.*

This argument, it seems to us, merely recasts the district court's
order to make it appear less unorthodox. The complaint did not
allege-because the government did not believe it was true-that
Microsoft's dominant market position resulted from illegal means.
The district court and *amici* would have it be otherwise, but
neither have the power to force the government to make that claim.
And since the claim is not made, a remedy directed to that claim
is hardly appropriate. Of course, such reasoning applies *a
fortiori* to discrete practices such as "vaporware," that the
government does not assert are antitrust violations and which bear
no relationship to the practices against which the complaint is
directed. Even where the government has proved antitrust
violations at trial, the remedies must be of the "same type or
class" as the violations, and the court is not at liberty to
enjoin "all future violations of the antitrust laws, however
unrelated to violations found by the court." *Zenith Radio Corp.
v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,* 395 U.S. 100, 132-33 (1969)
(citations omitted).

If the essential dispute between *amici* and appellants were more
narrowly cast as objections to the remedies sought, the district
judge would still not be empowered to reject them merely because
he believed other remedies were preferable. As we have said in the
context of reviewing agreed upon modifications of a consent
decree:

The court should also bear in mind the *flexibility* of the public
interest inquiry: the court's function is not to determine whether
the resulting array of rights and liabilities "is the one that
will *best* serve society," but only to confirm that the resulting
settlement is " "within the *reaches* of the public interest.' "



*Triennial Review Opinion,* 900 F.2d at 309 (emphasis in original)
(citing and quoting *Bechtel,* 648 F.2d at 666, in turn quoting
*Gillette,* 406 F. Supp. at 716). Thus, a court should not reject
an agreed-upon modification unless "it has exceptional confidence
that adverse antitrust consequences will result-perhaps akin to
the confidence that would justify a court in overturning the
predictive judgments of an administrative agency." *United States
v. Western Elec. Co.,* 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir.)
("*Triennial Review Remand Opinion* "), *cert. denied,* 114 S. Ct.
487 (1993).

The *Triennial Review* cases, dealing with the administration of
the AT&T consent decree, involve a decree the oversight of which
had been the business of a district judge for several years. In
some respects, the parties' request for approval of a modification
to a decree is akin to a request for entry of an initial proposed
decree but, in other respects, it is therefore different. In the
latter situation, it seems to us that the district judge must be
even more deferential than in the former. As Justice Rehnquist
noted in *Maryland v. United States,* when a consent decree is
brought to a district judge, because it is a settlement, there are
no *findings* that the defendant has actually engaged in illegal
practices. *See* 460 U.S. at 1004 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). It
is inappropriate for the judge to measure the remedies in the
decree as if they were fashioned after trial. Remedies which
appear less than vigorous may well reflect an underlying weakness
in the government's case, and for the district judge to assume
that the allegations in the complaint have been formally made out
is quite unwarranted.[n.~8] We think the district judge's
criticism of Microsoft for declining to admit that the practices
charged in the complaint actually violated the antitrust laws was
thus unjustified. *See Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 337; H.R. Rep. No.
1463, *supra,* at 6 ("Ordinarily, defendants do not admit to
having violated the antitrust or other laws alleged as violated in
complaints that are settled."), *reprinted in* 1974 U.S. Code
Cong. & Admin. News 6535, 6536-37. The important question is
whether Microsoft will abide by the terms of the consent decree
regardless of whether it is willing to admit wrongdoing.

After a district judge has administered a consent decree for some
period of time-as is true regarding the AT&T decree-it might be
thought that he would gain at least some familiarity with the
market involved, and therefore the lack of an initial trial is, at
least marginally, less of an inhibition. But when the proposed
decree comes to a district judge in the first instance as a
settlement between the parties that may well reflect weaknesses in
the government's case, the district judge must be even more
deferential to the government's predictions as to the effect of
the proposed remedies than he would be when a modification request
is presented, as in the AT&T cases, long after entry.

Giving due respect to the Justice Department's perception of the
market structure and its view of the nature of its case, we think
the district judge was obliged to conclude that the remedies were
not so inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall outside
of the "reaches of the public interest." The district court
understandably questioned the government as to why the decree did
not forbid Microsoft from using the alleged anticompetitive
licensing practices with respect to all of Microsoft's operating
systems (in particular, Windows NT products). But the government
explained that Windows NT products do not have "a significant
share of a relevant market at this time."

It might well be that the decree would be strengthened if Windows
NT were explicitly covered (it could also be that this was a
concession the government made in bargaining), but that is of no
great moment. It is undisputed that Windows NT does not have a
dominant market position, and Professor Arrow assured the court
that the decree "appropriately addresses and remedies the
anticompetitive effects of the practices challenged in the
complaint." It is not for us (or the district court) to decide
whether Professor Arrow is correct. "The quality of [his]
presentation[ ] is enough ... to establish an ample factual
foundation for the judgment call made by the Department of Justice
and to make its conclusion reasonable." *Triennial Review Remand
Decision,* 993 F.2d at 1582.[n.~9]

A district judge pondering a proposed consent decree
understandably would and should pay special attention to the
decree's clarity. The government may be entitled to rather broad
discretion to settle with the defendant within the reaches of the
public interest, but the district judge who must preside over the
implementation of the decree is certainly entitled to insist on
that degree of precision concerning the resolution of known issues
as to make his task, in resolving subsequent disputes, reasonably
manageable. We therefore think the district judge was on solid
ground in, at least, inquiring as to the product lines covered in
the decree. *Amici* suggest that in this respect the decree is
ambiguous and that the district judge's refusal to accept it can
be justified on this alternative ground. The decree provides that
"successor versions of or replacement products marketed as
replacements for the [covered products]" are covered by the
decree. But, as noted, Windows NT is specifically excluded. What
would happen, *amici* ask, if Windows NT were somehow to be made
to serve as a replacement or successor to MS-DOS or Windows
products covered by the decree? The government contends (and
Microsoft does not dispute) that in such an unlikely event Windows
NT would be covered as a successor to the covered products. We
think that is the logical interpretation of the decree, and
therefore perceive no continuing ambiguity.[n.~10] In any event,
the district judge's concern was not primarily ambiguous language,
but was rather his perception that Microsoft had a "penchant for
narrowly defining the antitrust laws," and that therefore "endless
debate" might ensue "as to whether a new operating system is
covered by the decree." *Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 333. This
observation apparently stems from the "vaporware dispute" between
Microsoft's counsel and the district judge, as well as from
Microsoft's unwillingness to concede that the practices covered by
the decree violated the antitrust laws. As we have already noted,
the judge's conclusions about Microsoft's behavior past or future
are, *on this record,* unwarranted.

Similarly, we would expect a district court to pay close attention
to the compliance mechanisms in a consent decree. In this case,
the lack of an adequate compliance mechanism was the final ground
the district judge advanced for rejecting the decree. The district
judge appeared to be concerned, however, with a great deal more
than the decree. Although the court recognized that Microsoft
employed "50 or so in-house lawyers, along with its outside
retained counsel," all available to monitor compliance, he
indicated that the company ought to be obliged to employ an
internal compliance officer, such as a private inspector general.
The judge, in accordance with his previously described views of
Microsoft's business practices and positions taken in court,
believed the decree should seek to fundamentally alter Microsoft's
culture, perhaps even reduce its competitive zeal. Suffice it to
say, those objectives exceed any legitimate concerns about actual
compliance with the decree.

* * * *



When the government and a putative defendant present a proposed
consent decree to a district court for review under the Tunney
Act, the court can and should inquire, in the manner we have
described, into the purpose, meaning, and efficacy of the decree.
If the decree is ambiguous, or the district judge can foresee
difficulties in implementation, we would expect the court to
insist that these matters be attended to. And, certainly, if third
parties contend that they would be positively injured by the
decree, a district judge might well hesitate before assuming that
the decree is appropriate. But, when the government is challenged
for not bringing as extensive an action as it might, a district
judge must be careful not to exceed his or her constitutional
role. A decree, even entered as a pretrial settlement, is a
judicial act, and therefore the district judge is not obliged to
accept one that, on its face and even after government
explanation, appears to make a mockery of judicial power. Short of
that eventuality, the Tunney Act cannot be interpreted as an
authorization for a district judge to assume the role of Attorney
General.

Accordingly, the case is remanded with instructions to enter the
proposed decree.





*Per Curiam:* Microsoft requests that this case be remanded to
another district court judge because Judge Sporkin has
demonstrated actual bias against the company. We do not lightly
conclude that a bias claim has been made out. *See SEC v. First
City Financial Corp.,* 890 F.2d 1215, 1221-23 (D.C. Cir. 1989).
But both the recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 455(a)
(1988),[n.~1] and our general supervisory power to "require such
further proceedings to be had as may be just under the
circumstances," 28 U.S.C. Section 2106 (1988), allow us to
reassign this case to a different judge on remand. *See Liteky v.
United States,* 114 S. Ct. 1147, 1156-57 (1994). To do so, we need
not find actual bias or prejudice, but only that the facts "might
reasonably cause an objective observer to question [the judge's]
impartiality." *Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp.*, 486
U.S. 847, 865 (1988).[n.~2]

We are deeply troubled by several aspects of the proceedings in
district court. As we have made clear, it was error for the judge
to inquire into allegations outside the complaint. That a judge
commits error, of course, is by itself hardly a basis for imputing
bias or even the appearance of partiality. But a review of the
transcripts in this case makes it patently obvious that the reason
for the judge's broad-ranging inquiries was his acceptance of the
accusations in the book *Hard Drive.* The district judge's
reliance on that book contaminated the entire Tunney Act review.
Perhaps the most serious example was the district judge's
insistence on dwelling on the book's charges regarding
"vaporware." After reviewing the transcripts and the district
judge's opinion, an objective observer is left with the overall
impression that the district judge had formed an opinion about
Microsoft's practices based on *Hard Drive,* and therefore was
unwilling to accept a consent decree that did not address
"vaporware" (as well as various other allegations made in the
book). The following colloquy is just one of many that leaves this
impression:

THE COURT: You see, what you have to explain to me is why not if
these other practices-say while we're cleaning up this mess, why
don't we also take care of-you must agree that vaporware is a
problem. You must agree that to give Microsoft an advantage
because their applications people have access to their operation
people-



MS. BINGAMAN (for the government): Let me go to that.



THE COURT: In other words, it would seem to me to say, hey, look,
we don't want to come back and sue you next week. We don't want to
come back and sue you every Monday and Tuesday. You ought to clean
up this mess. They've got 50 lawyers there. They can make sure
that they're doing it.



MS. BINGAMAN: Here's the answer, Your Honor. If I had a case that
I could file today on those practices, I would file it. I've said
that repeatedly.



THE COURT: Well, I know, *but you don't have to have a case.*



The book's allegations are, of course, not evidence on which a
judge is entitled to rely, nor are those unsworn allegations even
grounds upon which to interrogate the government about its
position with respect to those allegations.

We are similarly distressed by the district judge's decision to
allow the Doe Companies to proceed anonymously. We are not aware
of any case in which a plaintiff was allowed to sue a defendant
and still remain anonymous to that defendant. Such proceedings
would, as Microsoft argues, seriously implicate due process.
Indeed, parties to a lawsuit must typically openly identify
themselves in their pleadings to "protect[ ] the public's
legitimate interest in knowing all of the facts involved,
including the identities of the parties." *Doe v. Frank,* 951 F.2d
320, 322 (11th Cir. 1992). "Basic fairness dictates that those
among the defendants' accusers who wish to participate ... as
individual party plaintiffs must do so under their real names."
*Southern Methodist Univ. Ass'n of Women Law Students v. Wynne &
Jaffe,* 599 F.2d 707, 713 (5th Cir. 1979).

Although it is within the discretion of the district court to
grant the "rare dispensation" of anonymity against the world (but
not the plaintiff), even in that situation the court has "a
judicial duty to inquire into the circumstances of particular
cases to determine whether the dispensation is warranted." *James
v. Jacobson,* 6 F.3d 233, 238 (4th Cir. 1993). As part of this
inquiry, the court should take into account the risk of unfairness
to the opposing party, *Wynne & Jaffe,* 599 F.2d at 713, as well
the "customary and constitutionally-embedded presumption of
openness in judicial proceedings." *Doe v. Stegall,* 653 F.2d 180,
186 (5th Cir. 1981). Nor are we aware of any case in which an
*amici*-a friend of the court-has been permitted to remain
anonymous. One might think that such a situation would be a
contradiction in terms. But these *amici* are in any event
apparent adversaries of Microsoft, so they should be no more
entitled to proceed anonymously than if they were plaintiffs.

Here, the district judge accepted the Doe Companies' claims of
fear of retaliation from Microsoft, without inquiry and apparently
with no consideration of what an extraordinary break with
precedent such an action implied. *See Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at
329. The judge did not fulfill his duty to consider the impact of
anonymity on the public interest in knowing the identities of the
participants in this proceeding, nor did he consider possible
unfairness to Microsoft.

The language of the Tunney Act relied upon by the district
judge-which permits a district court to authorize "participation
in any other manner and extent which serves the public interest,"
15 U.S.C. Section 16(f) (1988)-does not authorize his cursory
dismissal of Microsoft's (and the government's) protests. The
district judge may not rely on that language to abandon all
precedent governing accepted process in federal courts. The public
interest, after all, includes an interest in fairness to all
parties. While "judicial rulings alone almost never constitute
valid basis for a bias or partiality motion," *Liteky,* 114 S. Ct.
at 1157, the district judge's failure to accord any weight to
Microsoft's interests in making its determination adds to the
appearance of bias in this case.

We are also concerned by the district judge's acceptance of *ex
parte* submissions. *See, infra,* n.5. "*Ex parte* communications
generally are disfavored because they conflict with a fundamental
precept of our system of justice: a fair hearing requires "a
reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party
and to meet them.' " *In re Paradyne Corp.,* 803 F.2d 604, 612
(11th Cir. 1986) (quoting *Morgan v. United States,* 304 U.S. 1,
18 (1938)). *See also Code of Judicial Conduct for United States
Judges,* Canon 3(A)(4) (a judge "should ... neither initiate nor
consider *ex parte* or other communications concerning a pending
or impending proceeding"). Although the district judge stated that
he did not consider the *ex parte* submissions of the Doe
Companies or Apple Computer, Inc., *see Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at
327-28, he allowed the latter to be filed, and with respect to the
former, he suggested that the government should consider the
redacted material "and if it believes such information is
pertinent to this case, on notice to defendant, it may request the
Court to reopen these proceedings so the information appropriately
may be considered." *Id.* at 327-28 n.16. We think the appropriate
course would have been simply to refuse to accept any *ex parte*
communications.

Finally, we note that the district judge made several comments
during the proceedings which evidenced his distrust of Microsoft's
lawyers and his generally poor view of Microsoft's practices.
*See, e.g., Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 336 ("This is the same group
[of lawyers] that has advised its client that "product
preannouncements' to impede competition is proper behavior.");
*id.* at 338 ("Microsoft, a rather new corporation, may not have
matured to the position where it understands how it should act
with respect to the public interest and the ethics of the market
place."). These comments arose out of the district court's
misguided focus on "vaporware" and Microsoft's other alleged
misdeeds, none of which were charged in the complaint.

The combined effect of the foregoing is to cause a reasonable
observer to question whether Judge Sporkin "would have difficulty
putting his previous views and findings aside" on remand. *United
States v. Torkington,* 874 F.2d 1441, 1447 (11th Cir. 1989).
Accordingly, we will remand the case to the chief judge of the
district court, with instructions that it be assigned to another
district court judge.


::::::::::FOOTNOTES::::::::::

1. James Wallace & Jim Erickson, *Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the
Making of the Microsoft Empire* (1992).



2. Based on his reading of *Hard Drive,* the district judge
initially described "vaporware" as "putting out announcements that
are misleading or not true to freeze the competition." When the
judge asked Microsoft whether it engaged in "vaporware" so
defined, Microsoft stated that such charges are "entirely false."
Microsoft did not deny that it preannounced products, but
explained in its subsequent filings that such preannouncements do
not violate the antitrust laws unless they are knowingly false or
misleading when made. The judge rejected Microsoft's position,
stating that Microsoft's lawyer "[n]ever told me that you have
this funny little interpretation of vaporware."



3. In it submissions to the district court, Microsoft rebutted the
claim that the documents evidenced "vaporware" activities.
Microsoft also explained that it preannounces products because
ISVs need such early notification to begin developing compatible
applications software. The district court, however, did not refer
to Microsoft's rebuttal in its opinion.



4. The district court subsequently issued an order denying motions
to intervene by I.D.E. Corporation and CCIA but authorizing them
to participate under Section 16(f)(3) of the Tunney Act, which
allows the district court to "authorize full or limited
participation in proceedings before the court by interested
persons ... in any other manner and extent which serves the public
interest as the court may deem appropriate." 15 U.S.C. Section
16(f)(3) (1988).



5. After the hearing on the consent decree, several *ex parte*
submissions were sent to the district judge. First, the Doe
Companies submitted a supplement to their brief which contained a
redacted exhibit. At the same time the district judge ruled on the
motion to approve the consent decree, he granted Microsoft's
motion to strike the supplement, but only to the extent that it
referred to the redacted exhibit. Then, Apple Computer, Inc. sent
to the district judge an *ex parte* letter (with five attached
affidavits) accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive practices not
related to those charged in the complaint. The judge ordered that
Apple's letter and affidavits be filed, but stated that he did not
consider them. *See Opinion,* 159 F.R.D. at 328-29. Finally,
Andrew Schulman, a software industry commentator, sent the
district judge an *ex parte* letter opposing the consent decree.
In his letter, Schulman stated that he had asked his publisher to
send to the judge a copy of *Unauthorized Windows 95,* Schulman's
latest book. Microsoft states that the judge did not disclose his
receipt of the Schulman letter or book and Microsoft did not
become aware of the letter's existence until the Doe Companies
attached it to their supplemental submission. Upon learning that
the materials Schulman sent to chambers had "become an issue in
this case," the judge ordered that a facsimile from Schulman be
filed. (The order did not refer to Schulman's previous letter
opposing the consent decree.) That facsimile indicates that the
district judge had returned Schulman's unsolicited book (along
with a copy of the district judge's opinion).



6. In a case in which only the defendant appealed (the
government's position is not apparent) the Ninth Circuit concluded
that it lacked jurisdiction. *Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n
v. Pan American World Airways,* 796 F.2d 314 (9th Cir. 1986),
*cert. denied,* 479 U.S. 1030 (1987).



7. The Ninth Circuit subsequently split as to whether that
language did or did not authorize a district court to look behind
and beyond the complaint to judge the public interest. *United
States v. BNS, Inc.,* 858 F.2d 456 (9th Cir. 1988). The majority
thought a district judge could look to non-antitrust factors, but
not to antitrust concerns in markets other than those alleged in
the complaint. *Id.* at 462-63.



8. On this point, we disagree with *Gillette,* 406 F. Supp. at
715-16, in which the district court stated that "the decree is to
be tested on the basis of the relief provided, on the assumption
that the government would have won."



9.* Amicus* I.D.E. Corporation (which refers to itself as "IDEA")
contends that the decree is inadequate because it does not require
Microsoft to disgorge unused minimum commitment payments that IDEA
made pursuant to its licensing agreement with Microsoft. In other
words, IDEA asserts generally that the remedy should provide
retroactive relief and that it should be tailored to meet IDEA's
particular situation. While the district court may inquire into
whether a decree will result in any positive injury to third
parties, *see* 15 U.S.C. Section 16(e)(2) (1988), in the absence
of such injury, it should not reject an otherwise adequate remedy
simply because a third party claims it could be better treated.
The decree does not preclude IDEA from bringing its own private
antitrust suit against Microsoft to gain the specific relief it
seeks.



10.* Amici* also contend without explanation that the decree
contains a "loophole" by which a next-generation operating system
can be taken outside the scope of the decree if Microsoft sells it
"bundled" with an applications program. We perceive no
interpretation of the decree's definition of covered products
which would allow such a result.

FILED Feb. 14 1995

CLERK, U.S. DISTRICT COURT
District of Columbia

MEMORANDUM OPINION

The issue before this Court is whether the entry of a proposed
antitrust consent decree between Microsoft Corporation and the
United States is in "the public interest. FN 2 Microsoft is the
world's largest developer of computer software. On July 15,
1994, the Government filed a complaint charging Microsoft with
violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 15
U.S.C.    1-7 (1973). On the same day the parties filed a
proposed consent judgment. FN 3

I. Background

The Government filed the complaint and proposed judgment after a
four-year investigation of Microsoft. The Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") initiated the investigation in 1990.
According to Microsoft, but not confirmed by the Government, the
FTC considered a wide range of practices including: (1) that
Microsoft gave its developers of applications software information
about
its operating systems software before providing it to other
applications developers; (2) that Microsoft announced that it
was developing a non-existent version of operating software to
dissuade Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") from leasing
a competitor's operating system; (3) that Microsoft required OEMs
 that licensed its operating system software also to license
 Microsoft applications; and (4) that Microsoft licensed its
 operating systems to OEMs on a per processor basis. FN 4
Microsoft asserts that before the FTC investigation was completed, it
was
 expanded to include every aspect of Microsoft's business. FN 5

There was never a majority vote among the FTC commissioners to
file an administrative complaint against Microsoft. In late
1993, after a 2-2 deadlock by the commissioners, no
administrative action was filed, and the FTC suspended its
investigation of Microsoft.

Following the suspension of the FTC investigation, Assistant
Attorney General Bingaman, the head of the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice, decided to revive the investigation.
In June, 1994 Microsoft and the Department of Justice initiated
settlement negotiations. Approximately a month later the parties
came to agreement and filed a proposed judgment with the
Court. FN 6

II. The Complaint

The complaint charges that Microsoft violated Sections 1 and 2 of
the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 15 U.S.C.    1-7. The primary
allegations in the complaint concern licensing agreements
between Microsoft and OEMs of personal computers ("PCs"). The
complaint also addresses provisions of non-disclosure agreements
("NDAs") between Microsoft and other developers of applications
software, known as independent software developers ("ISVs"). The
complaint narrowly tailors the relevant product market to the
market for certain operating systems software for x86
microprocessors. The geographic market is not limited.
In order to understand the complaint, one must understand
something about computers, microprocessors, and operations and
applications software. A microprocessor is the "brain" of the
computer. The x86 microprocessor, or chip, runs IBM and IBM-
clone PCs. These chips are primarily, but not exclusively, made by
Intel. FN 7 Operating systems software acts as the central nervous
system for a personal computer, linking up the keyboard,
monitor, disk drive and other components. Applications software
enables the PC user to perform a variety of tasks including word
processing and database management. Applications software
operates on top of the PC's operating system and must be
designed to function with that operating system. As a result,
ISVs who design applications software need information about an
operating system's codes in order to design their software.
Microsoft designs both operating systems (e.g., MS-DOS) and
applications
(e.g., Microsoft Word, a word processing program).

Microsoft has a monopoly on the market for PC operating systems.
Microsoft's share of the operating systems market identified in
the complaint is consistently well above 70%. FN 8 According to
Microsoft's 1993 Annual Report, as of June 30, 1993, 120
million PCs ran on Microsoft's MS-DOS. Microsoft also developed
 and sells Windows, a sophisticated operating system that runs on
 top of MS-DOS or a similar operating system. Windows allows a PC
 user to run more than one application at a time and shift
between them. Windows is known as a "graphical user interface."
 Approximately 50 million PCs now use Windows. Microsoft
 generally does not sell its operating systems directly to
 consumers. Instead, it licenses its operating systems to OEMs
for inclusion in the PCs they make. FN 9

Microsoft, the Justice Department, and a number of competitors
who oppose the entry of the decree all agree that it is very
difficult to enter the operating systems market. There are two
main reasons for this, each of which reinforces the other.

First, consumers do not want to buy PCs with an operating system
that does not already have a large installed base because of
their concern that there will not be a wide range of
applications software available for that operating system. The
second, complementary reason why there are large barriers to
entry into the operating systems market is that ISVs do not want to
spend time
and money developing applications for operating systems that do
not have a large installed base. They perceive that demand
for that software will be low. As a result, OEMs have little
incentive to license an operating system that does not have a
large installed base and include it in their PCs.
In addition to these "natural" barriers to entry, the complaint
identifies Microsoft's use of per processor licenses and long
term commitments as "exclusionary and anti-competitive contract
terms to maintain its monopoly." A per processor license means
that Microsoft licenses an operating system to an OEM which
pays a royalty to Microsoft for each PC sold regardless of
whether a Microsoft operating system is included in that PC. In
other words, under a per processor license, if an OEM sells some
PCs with a competitor's operating system installed (e.g., IBM's OS/2),
and
others with MS-DOS installed, the OEM would pay Microsoft
royalties for all PCs sold. In effect, the OEM pays twice every
time it sells a PC with a non-Microsoft operating system -- once
to the company that licensed the operating system to the OEM
and once to Microsoft. The complaint charges that per processor
licenses discourage OEMs from licensing competing operating
systems and/or cause OEMs to raise the price for PCs with a
competing operating system to recoup the fee paid to Microsoft.
The complaint further alleges that Microsoft's use of longterm
licensing agreements with or without minimum commitments, and
the rolling over of unused commitments unreasonably extended
some licensing agreements with Microsoft. These practices
allegedly foreclosed OEMs from licensing operating systems from
Microsoft's competitors.

The other anticompetitive practice cited in the complaint is the
structure of Microsoft's non-disclosure agreements ("NDAs") with
ISVs during the development of its new Windows operating
system. FN10 ISVs work with Microsoft during the development and
testing of new operating systems so they can produce
applications that run with that operating system and release
them around the time the operating system is released. This
collaboration benefits Microsoft in two ways. First, Microsoft
receives input from the ISVs on how to improve the operating
system. Second, a new operating system is more attractive to consumers
if there are compatible applications programs immediately
available. In order to protect confidential information about
its new software, Microsoft requires ISVs to sign NDAs in order to
obtain product information.

The complaint alleges that the recent NDAs Microsoft has executed
with ISVs are overly restrictive and anti-competitive. The
Government alleges that the NDAs not only legitimately protect
 against the disclosure of confidential information to competing
developers of operating systems but also discourage ISVs from
 developing their own competing operating systems and/or from
 developing applications for competing operating systems.

In sum, the Government alleges that the practices outlined above
 deprive competitors of substantial opportunities to license
 their operating systems to OEMs, preventing them from developing
 a large installed base. This discourages both ISVs from
designing software for competing operating systems and consumers
 from buying PCs with these competing operating systems. These
 practices also harm consumers by limiting the variety of
 available operating systems and raising the prices for non-
Microsoft operating systems.

Based on the allegations in the complaint, the Government sought
 the following relief:

(1) That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has
 monopolized the interstate trade and commerce in the market for
 PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman
 Act.

(2) That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has entered
 into unlawful contracts and combinations which unreasonably
 restrain the trade in interstate commerce in PC operating
 systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

(3) That Microsoft and all persons, firms and corporations acting
 on its behalf and under its direction or control be permanently
 enjoined from engaging in, carrying out, renewing or attempting
 to engage, carry out or renew, any contracts, agreements,
practices, or understandings in violation of the Sherman Act.

(4) That plaintiff have such other relief that the Court may
 consider necessary or appropriate to restore competitive
 conditions in the markets affected by Microsoft's unlawful
 conduct.

III. The Proposed Decree

The proposed decree negotiated and entered into by the parties is
significantly and substantially narrower than the requests
contained in the prayer for relief in the complaint. The consent
 decree limits certain of Microsoft's contract and NDA practices.
The prohibitions concern licensing agreements and NDAs for
certain operating systems software; operating systems software
for workstations are not covered. The decree does not address
any of Microsoft's applications software.

The decree enjoins Microsoft from entering into any licensing
agreement longer than one year, though OEMs may at their
discretion include in the licensing agreement a one year option
to renew.

Microsoft can impose no penalty or charge on an OEM for its
choice not to renew the licensing agreement, nor can it require
an OEM to commit not to license a competitor's operating system.
Microsoft may only license the operating systems covered by the
 decree on a per copy basis, with one exception. FN 11 Microsoft
 cannot include minimum commitments in its covered licensing
 agreements. The agreements cannot be structured so that the OEM
 pays royalties for including MS-DOS in a fixed number of PCs,
 whether or not the OEM actually sells that number of PCs with a
Microsoft operating system included.

The decree restricts the scope of the NDAs that Microsoft may
negotiate with ISVs. Microsoft cannot enter into an NDA whose
 duration extends beyond, (i) commercial release of the operating
 system, (ii) an earlier public disclosure by Microsoft, or (iii)
one year from the date of the disclosure of information
 covered by the NDA to a person subject to the NDA, whichever
 comes first. The decree also prohibits the use of NDAs that
 would prevent persons covered by that NDA from developing
applications for competing operating systems unless the
application
entailed use of proprietary Microsoft information.

The decree explicitly states that it does not constitute "any
 evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of
fact or law." Indeed, Microsoft has denied in its submissions to
 the Court that any of the allegations set forth in the complaint
constitute violations of the antitrust laws. FN12

IV. Motions To Participate

Before addressing the question of whether the proposed decree is
in the public interest, the Court must decide whether to approve
three opposed motions to participate in this Tunney Act
proceeding. I.D.E. Corporation ("IDEA") has moved to intervene
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. Anonymous persons, represented by Gary
Reback of the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati
("Wilson, Sonsini"), have made a motion to file an amicus curiae
memorandum in opposition to the proposed final judgment. The
Computer & Communications Industry Association ("CCIA") has
 moved to intervene, or in the alternative, moved to participate
 as amicus curiae.

IV.A. Tunney Act - Participation by Interested Persons

Section 16(f) of the Tunney Act gives the Court wide latitude to
gather relevant information to make its public interest
determination. In order to exercise properly its independent
 role as mandated by Congress, the Court must ensure that it is
adequately informed about the intricacies and complexities of the
industry affected by the consent decree. FN 13 Section 16(f)(3)
 specifically empowers the Court to gather relevant information
by means of authorizing intervention and amicus curiae
participation:

(f) In making its determination under subsection (e) of this
 section, the court may

(3) authorize full or limited participation in proceedings before
 the court by interested persons or agencies, including
 appearance amicus curiae, intervention as a party pursuant to
 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, examination of witnesses
or
documentary materials, or participation in any other manner and
 extent which serves the public interest as the court may deem
 appropriate.
  16(f)(3).

The Act also encourages participation by interested persons by
 setting forth a procedure for written public comments on the
 proposed consent decree.   16(b). The United States is required
 to publish in the Federal Register the proposed consent decree
as well as a competitive impact statement. Id. The public has
 60 days to submit written comments relating to the consent
 decree. The United States is required to file such comments with
 the District Court and publish such comments in the Federal
Register. Id. At the expiration of the 60 day period, the United
 States must file a response with the Court and publish such
 response in the Federal Register.   16(d).

In Senate hearings before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and
 Monopoly, Judge J. Skelly Wright, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
 District of Columbia Circuit, emphasized the vital role of
 participation in the consent decree approval process by outside
persons:

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, while no
doubt among the most competent and dedicated groups of
professionals in Government service, nevertheless is made up of
human beings and, unfortunately, human beings occasionally make
mistakes.

In approving a particular decree, the Justice Department
attorneys may overlook certain issues, ignore certain concerns,
or misunderstand certain facts. The participation of additional
interested parties in the consent decree approval process helps
to correct these oversights. Senate Hearings, at 146.

Only five public comments were received pursuant to the
procedures outlined in   16(b). FN 14 These public comments did
 not provide much enlightenment about the proposed settlement.

Since receipt of these public comments, the Court has received
 motions to intervene and appear as amici in the proceeding.

IV.B. Timeliness of Motions to Participate

Both the Justice Department and Microsoft argue that the motions
to intervene and the motion to appear as amicus curiae
(hereinafter "motions to participate") are untimely because they
were served three months after the close of the Tunney Act's 60
day public comment period pursuant to   16(b), and were served
only days before the scheduled final hearing held on January 20,
1995.

These motions to participate were brought under  16(f) which
specifically gives the court a wide variety of alternatives to
gather information necessary to its public interest
determination. Section 16(f) and   16(b), while complementing
each other
in the sense that they both help to insure that the proposed
consent decree receives a thorough public airing, are wholly
separate provisions.

The Justice Department and Microsoft suggest that granting the
"late" motions to participate would be prejudicial because it
would delay the approval process. The Court is well-aware that
Congress directed that the public interest inquiry should be
conducted in "the least complicated and least time-consuming
means possible." S. Rep. No. 296, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 6
(1973) [hereinafter "S. Rep."]; accord H.R. Rep. No. 1463, 93d
 Cong., 2d Sess. at 12 (1974) [hereinafter "H.R. Rep."] "Extended
proceedings might Behave the effect of vitiating the benefits of
 prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree
 process." 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) (statement of Sen.
 Tunney).

But the Court cannot sacrifice the thoroughness of its inquiry,
 and hence, the validity of its determination that the consent
 decree is in the public interest in order to increase the speed
 with which the decree is approved. Judge J. Skelly Wright
aptly recognized that in cases of national import the Tunney Act
 process would be turned on its head if the Court considered the
 speed of review to be more important than the accuracy of
 review:

[I]n many cases, I would think, and have seen, no opposition
 filed, where the case is of great national importance, then time
 should be taken -- court's time and counsels' time should be
 taken to study the decree, to get information from the public
concerning the ramification of the decree, the anticipated
 results of the decree and, in my judgment, this time is well
 spent, even though it may take day, even though it might take
 weeks; it could have a trial that would last months and months.

So, to suggest that S. 782 will not require judicial time and
 counsel time would be misleading. In important cases, S. 782
 would require judicial time, necessarily so, and I believe
 rightfully so.
Senate Hearings, at 151.

The Court is simply not willing to find that because the motions
 were made days before the scheduled final hearing on January 20,
 1995 that the motions should be denied on timeliness grounds.
 The lack of any demonstrated prejudice to the parties, along
with the need for a thorough review of the proposed decree
 are factors that weigh against denying these late filings.

Despite the complexity and the national importance of this case,
 until these new motions to participate were filed, there was a
 severe lack of information regarding the proposed consent
 decree.

Only five public comments were filed during the public comment
 period. Neither the Justice Department nor Microsoft provided
 the Court with affidavits of experts. Moreover, the Justice
 Department failed to make available to the Court and to the
public "any other materials and documents [in addition to the
 proposed consent decree] which the United States considered
 determinative in formulating" the proposed consent decree.
 16(b). At the hearings held prior to receipt of the motions to
participate, the Court expressed its concern over the lack of
meaningful information. FN 15
Microsoft's response was that it would countenance no changes in
 the proposed decree. The Government stated that while it would
 not oppose the inclusion of a monitoring provision in the
 decree, it would oppose all other changes.

The Government has declined to provide the Court any meaningful
 information concerning the substance of its investigation, i.e.,
 what it investigated and the findings it made. Microsoft has
 gone a little further than the Government and tried to allay
certain of the Court's concerns. However, based on information
 received from the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, some of the
 assurances provided by Microsoft have proved to be unreliable
 and contrary to fact.

If a Court is asked to approve a decree without information
 regarding the effect of the decree, then the Court's role
 becomes a nullity, exactly what the Tunney Act sought to
 prevent. The Justice Department and Microsoft's attempt to
 prevent the Court from considering information provided by third
parties when
they have not been forthcoming serves to thwart the Court's
 inquiry mandated by the Tunney Act. It was not until the third
 party motions were received that the Justice Department even
filed an affidavit by an economist regarding whether the proposed
decree will restore competitive balance to the operating systems
market.

The Court will invoke the procedures found in   16(f). In such an
important and complex case, if the Court were not to invoke 
16(f) procedures for gathering relevant information, the proper
exercise of the Court's discretion could be questioned. As
Senator Tunney observed:

[A]ll of the procedural devices cont[ain]ed in this subsection
are discretionary in nature. They are tools available to the
 district court for its use, but use of a particular procedure is
not required . . . . There are some cases in which none of
these procedures may be needed. On the other hand, there have
been
and will continue to be cases where the use of many or even all
 of them may be necessary. In fact, in a very few complex cases,
 failure to use some of the procedures might give rise to
an indication that the district court had failed to exercise
its discretion properly.

119 Cong. Rec. 3453 (statement of Sen. Tunney).

All third party submissions received prior to the January 20,
 1995 hearing will be made part of the record and have been
 considered in the Court's decision. Submissions by outside
 participants after the January 20, 1995 hearings were only
 considered
 if they had already been permitted by the Court (IDEA's January
 24, 1995 and related filings) and to the extent that they
 offered legal arguments on the record already before the Court
 (Wilson, Sonsini's February 1, 1995 filing). The Court specific
ally did not consider the section of the February 1, 1995 filing
 by the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini that dealt with a certain
 redacted document. FN16 Nor did the Court consider recent
 comments
(dated February 13, 1995) submitted by Apple Computer, Inc.

While untimely filings ordinarily should not be condoned, the
 Court has allowed them in this case for two reasons. First and
 foremost, the information and arguments submitted are helpful,
 particularly the submissions received from Wilson, Sonsini.
Second, the parties have not provided the Court with adequate,
 meaningful information. The Government, time after time, has
 refused to provide the Court with information concerning the
 substance of its investigation, i.e., what it investigated and
the findings it made.

The next question presented to the Court is whether the motions
to participate as interveners and/or amici curiae should be
granted in the form requested.

IV.D. Intervention

Both IDEA and CCIA have filed motions to intervene under Rule 24
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. FN 17 Intervention is
 not a matter of right under the Tunney Act, as IDEA concedes.
 United States v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co., 1993-1 Trade
 Cas. (CCH) sec. 70,191, at 69,894 (D.D.C. Mar. 8, 1993) ("there
is no right to intervene in a Tunney Act proceeding to determine
whether a proposed consent decree is in the public interest.").
As such, it is within the Court's discretion to grant or
withhold intervention.

The Court declines to confer party status on IDEA and CCIA, with
the concomitant right to participate fully in the proceeding,
including the right to file an appeal. Pursuant to Rule 24(b),
 "[i]n exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether
the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the
 adjudication of the rights of the original parties." The Tunney
Act allows for a variety of alternatives for the Court to
receive relevant information in making its public interest
determination. Intervention, while one method for gathering such
information, would be too cumbersome and would unduly complicate
these proceedings. Although the Court welcomes the submissions
by IDEA and CCIA and will consider them in making its public
interest determination, the Court does not find that allowing
IDEA and
CCIA to intervene would enhance the Court's inquiry. Moreover,
such intervention could serve unduly to delay the resolution of
this case. The rights of IDEA and CCIA to proceed as private
litigants remain unaffected.

The Court will deny the motions by IDEA and CCIA to intervene. In
the alternative, the Court will permit IDEA and CCIA to
participate in the proceedings under the Court's authority
pursuant to   16(f)(3) to allow "participation in any other
manner and extent which serves the public interest as the court
may deem appropriate."

IV.E. Participation as Amicus

The law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati by its
partner, Gary Reback, filed a motion to enter an appearance
amicus curiae on behalf of certain clients in the computer
industry, who wish to remain anonymous. Both the Government and
Microsoft argue that amici's request to appear anonymously is
inappropriate. Section 16(f), however, authorizes the Court to
accept submissions by "any interested persons or agencies."
Thus, the Court could accept the submission directly from the
law firm or the economists identified in the submission. FN 18

The Tunney Act confers broad powers to gather information. There
is nothing in the statute that would preclude the Court from
 receiving information from those unwilling to identify
 themselves. It is preferable for persons to identify themselves
 to permit the Court to ascertain any bias on their part.
However,
there could be instances where the fear of retaliation by an
alleged monopolist could deprive the public of relevant,
 material information. Indeed, Mr. Reback's clients have asserted
 the
fear of retaliation as their reason for requesting anonymity.
 Nothing has been presented that would put into question the
 sincerity of their position.

Microsoft argues that to allow the amici to appear anonymously
stymies the efforts of the parties and the Court to determine if
there would be grounds for the Court's recusal. The Court does
not know the identity of Mr. Reback's clients, whom Mr. Reback
has identified as competitors of Microsoft. As a member of
the Bar, it clearly would be incumbent on Mr. Reback to bring
any disqualifying information to the Court's attention.

Microsoft's next challenge is that the submission goes beyond an
analysis of the legal issues presented and seeks to introduce
factual matters into the record. Microsoft contends that it is
not the function of an amicus curiae to seek to introduce
factual matters or to present the opinions of experts.

The actual label of "amicus curiae" on the submission is not
 relevant. Section 16(f) specifically permits the Court to
 authorize Participation in any other manner and extent which
 serves the public interest as the court may deem appropriate."
 To argue that the Court should not consider the amici submission
 because it goes beyond the role of the usual amici submission
 runs counter to the plain language and purpose of the statute.
 That the law enables this Court to consider a brief such as was
 submitted by amici is without question. Accordingly, the Court
 hereby grants the motion to file the memorandum of amici curiae
 in opposition to the proposed final judgment. FN19

The Tunney Act envisions participation by interested persons in
the consent decree approval process, and such participation is
meant to ensure that the Court's public interest determination
is fully informed. The Court as well as the parties would have
preferred to receive these motions to participate at an
earlier date during these proceedings. However, the substantive
comments received from these third parties provide the process
with the information necessary to foster an appropriate public
airing of the issues. If the Court is to serve its role as an
independent check, then it is vital that the Court receive
responsible information from the public. The delay caused, which
was minimal, certainly is justified by the need to consider
the important issues presented.

V. The Public Interest Determination

V.A. Standard and Scope of Review

The Tunney Act requires that "before entering any consent
judgment proposed by the United States . . ., the court shall
determine that entry of such judgment is in the public
interest." 15 U.S.C.   16(e). Congress passed the Tunney Act so
 that the courts would play an independent role in the review
 of consent  decrees as opposed to serving as a mere rubber stamp.
See S. Rep., at 4; H.R. Rep., at 8. In determining whether to approve
or reject a consent decree, the Court must consider that "[t]he
balancing of competing social and political interests affected
by a proposed antitrust decree must be left, in the first
 instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General." United
 States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir.
 1993) (quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666
 (9th Cir. 1981)). It is not for the Court to determine whether
 the settlement is the best possible in the Court's view, but
instead, whether it is "within the reaches of the public
interest." United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716
(D. Mass. 1975).

In passing the Tunney Act Congress was concerned with the secrecy
 of corporations' dealings with the Government and the immense
 power that such corporations may wield. Senate Hearings, at 1
(statement of Sen. Tunney). Therefore, it would be an abdication
of the Court's responsibility, as mandated by Congress, not
to conduct a thorough review of this proposed decree. The role
of the Court is to scrutinize the exercise not only of the
Government's expertise but also of its good faith. See Gillette,
406 F. Supp. at 715. Approval should not automatically follow
 the review process no matter how incomplete or ineffective the
 Court finds the decree to be. See United States v. American Tel.
 and Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982) aff'd
 sub nom Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983) ("It
 does not follow from these principles, however, that courts must
 unquestioningly accept a proffered decree as long as it somehow,
 and however inadequately, deals with the antitrust and other
public policy problems implicated in the lawsuit.")

The Department of Justice argues that the scope of the Court's
review is limited to both the alleged anticompetitive practices
and the relevant markets set forth in the complaint. This
position is not supported by the language of the statute, its
legislative history, precedent or common sense.

The Justice Department relies on the Act's reference to both
 "termination of the alleged violations" and the "violation set
 forth in the complaint" to support its position. 15 U.S.C. 
 16(e)(1)-(2). In citing small portions of the Act's language,
the Government fails to consider the language of the statute as a
whole:

Before entering any consent judgment proposed by the United
States under this section, the court shall determine that the
 entry of such judgment is in the public interest. For the
purpose of such determination, the court may consider-

(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including
termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement
 and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects
 of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other
 considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;

(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public
generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of
the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination
of the issues at trial.

15 U.S.C.   16(e)(1-2). Fifteen U.S.C.   16(e)(1) merely informs
the Court that the "termination of alleged violations" is one
factor the Court "may consider" in making its determination.
Section 16(e)(1) also explicitly states that the Court may
consider . . . any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy
of such judgment." The broad language of this last provision
clearly shows that the court is not limited in its inquiry to
the more specific provisions set forth in the same section.

The Justice Department also narrowly focuses on the wording in
one part of Section 16(e)(2) (i.e. Violations set forth in the
complaint."). In so doing, it ignores the language of the rest
of the provision and therefore misreads its meaning. FN 20

Section 16(e)(2) states "the court may consider . . . the impact
of entry of  such judgment upon the public generally and individuals
alleging specific injury from the violation set forth in the
complaint." 15 U.S.C.   16(e)(2).FN21 This section gives
the Court the authority to consider not only the effect of the
entry of the decree on those claiming to be hurt by the
violations alleged in the complaint, but also the effect on the
public. The language of the Act does not restrict the scope of
inquiry into the effect of the decree on the public to the
specific injuries alleged in the complaint.

The legislative history supports the position that the Court may
look beyond the face of the complaint in evaluating the public
interest. FN 22 In hearings on the Tunney Act, the then Deputy
Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division made clear
that the Justice Department's interpretation of the bill was
 that the Court, in certain circumstances, would look not only at
 whether the decree adequately addressed the complaint, but
also at whether the complaint itself war adequate. "[T]his
 inquiry apparently would encompass not only whether the relief
 is adequate in view of that sought in the complaint, but whether
 the Government sought appropriate relief in the complaint
itself." Consent Decree Bills: Hearings Before the Subcommittee
on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the Judiciary
 House of Representatives, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 87 (1973)
 (statement of Hon. Bruce B. Wilson, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General, Antitrust Division, United States Department of
Justice). FN 23

In some instances, courts evaluating consent decrees under the
 provisions of the Tunney Act have considered markets and
 practices outside the scope of the complaint. For example, in
 AT&T, Judge Harold Greene conditioned the Court's approval of
 the decree, in part, on the addition of a provision that would
bar AT&T's entry into the nascent electronic publishing market.
AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 181-83. Judge Greene did this even though
the Government had not alleged any anticompetitive practices by
AT&T in this market.
In addition, the electronic publishing market is arguably not
 part of the relevant market identified in the complaint.

Judge Greene's opinion in AT&T clearly explained why, in some
 instances, the Court cannot limit itself to the decree's effect
 on the practices alleged in the complaint. In order to determine
 whether a decree is in the public interest, the Court must
 evaluate whether it meets the test of a valid antitrust remedy,
 to "effectively pry open to competition a market that has been
 closed by defendant['s] illegal restraints." AT&T, 552 F.Supp.
 at 150 (quoting International Salt Co. v. United States,
332 U.S. 392, 401 (1947)). Simply prohibiting repetition of the
 specific conduct in the complaint may not in all cases achieve
 that goal. Therefore, the Court cannot limit the scope of its
 considerations in the way the Government has suggested.

While the Court must show some deference to the discretion of the
 Justice Department, see Western Electric, 993 F.2d at 1577, such
 deference does not preclude the Court's taking into
 consideration practices and markets that the Government has
 failed
 to address. Cf. Gillette, 406 F. Supp. at 715 ("Congress did not
 intend the court's action to be merely pro forma, or to be
 limited to what appears on the surface.").

Senator Tunney, the law's co-sponsor, recognized the possible
 adverse consequences from entry of a consent decree that fails
 to address anticompetitive practices outside the scope of the
 decree. "[A] bad or inadequate consent decree may as a practical
matter foreclose further review of a defendant's practices
 both inside and outside the scope of the decree." 119 Cong. Rec.
 3451 (statement of Sen.
served if the Court can look only at the market and practices
alleged in the complaint because of the opportunity costs of
failing to address severe anticompetitive practices that do not
appear in the complaint.

If the Court's scope of review is as narrow as the Government
claims, the Government could effectively foreclose judicial
review of the decree. For example, the Government could initiate
a massive antitrust probe and find significant violations in a
large market. Then, bowing to political or other pressures, the
Government could write a complaint that alleges only minor
 anticompetitive practices in a very small market and file it
contemporaneously with a decree that addresses those limited
violations. Under the Government's rationale, the Court could
only
consider whether the decree adequately addressed the alleged
 violations. If its scope of review were so limited, the Court
 would have to approve the decree. The Tunney Act as well as
common sense dictate that entry of such a decree would not be in
the public interest.

V.B. Public Interest Determination

The Court cannot find the proposed decree to be in the public
interest for four reasons. First, the Government has declined to
provide the Court with the information it needs to make a proper
public interest determination. Second, the scope of the decree
is too narrow. Third, the parties have been unable and
 unwilling adequately to address certain anticompetitive
 practices, which Microsoft states it will continue to employ in
 the future and with respect to which the decree is silent. Thus,
 the
 decree does not constitute an effective antitrust remedy.
 Fourth, the Court is not satisfied that the enforcement and
 compliance mechanisms in the decree are satisfactory.

V.B.1. Insufficient Information

The parties did not create the necessary record to enable the
Court to make its public interest determination. While the
scrutiny that a proposed consent decree requires is dependent
upon the particular facts of the case, at a minimum, the Court
should be apprised of the following:

(1) The broad contours of the investigation i.e., the particular
 practices and conduct of the defendant that were under
 investigation along with the nature, scope and intensity of the
 inquiry;

(2) With respect to such particular practices and conduct, what
 were the conclusions reached by the Government;

(3) In the settlement discussions between the Government and
 defendant: (a) what were the areas that were discussed, and (b)
 what, if any, areas were bargained away and the reasons for
 their non-inclusion in the decree;

(4) With respect to the areas not discussed at the bargaining
 table or not bargained away, what are the plans for the
 Government to deal with them i.e.. is the investigation to
 continue, and, if so, at what intensity, or if the investigation
 is to be closed, then the Government must explain why it is in
the public interest to do so.

Basically, other than being told the Government spent a great
deal of time on a wide ranging inquiry and that the defendant is
a tough bargainer, the Court has not been provided with the
essential information it needs to make its public interest
finding. FN 24 To make an objective determination, a court must
know
not only what is included in the decree but also what has been
negotiated out, directly as well as indirectly, i.e. what is the
 understanding of the parties as to what, if any, additional
action the Government will or will not take with respect to
 matters that were inquired into, but with respect to which the
 decree is silent.

One of the main purposes of the Tunney Act was to bring the
 consent decree process into the open. Senate Hearings, at 1
 (statement of Sen. Tunney). In this case, the Government has
 filed its complaint and decree contemporaneously so the Court
 has no
 insight into what charges the Government originally intended to
 file. The Court does not know whether the Government has
 bargained
away other pernicious practices that were deleterious to the
 public. The Government has steadfastly refused to address any
 conduct of the defendant beyond that presented in the four
 corners of the decree. The Government has taken the position
that the Tunney Act limits the Court's review to only those
matters
contained in the decree and the Court in not permitted to
explore any other areas and cannot even consider evidence
received from third parties (i.e., pursuant to their comments)
that legitimately raise questions as to whether the defendant
has been
engaged in anticompetitive practices not included in the decree.
The Tunney Act does not dictate this kind of sterile review nor
does it justify the stonewalling that has taken place in
these proceedings. There is absolutely nothing in the Tunney Act
that would circumscribe the Court's review as the Government
suggests. See Section V. A., supra. To so hold would render the
Act a nullity. "Tunney Act courts" are not mushrooms to be
placed in a dark corner and sprinkled with fertilizer.

V.B.2. Scope of the Decree

The Court finds the decree on its face to be too narrow. Its
 coverage is restricted to PCs with x86 or Intel x86 compatible
microprocessors. The decree covers only MS-DOS and Windows and
 its predecessor and successor products. Neither party has even
 addressed the Court's concern that the decree be expanded to
 cover all of Microsoft's commercially marketed operating
 systems. Given the pace of technological change, the decree must
 anticipate covering operating systems developed for new
microprocessors. FN25 In addition, taking into account
Microsoft's
penchant for narrowly defining the antitrust laws, the Court
fears there may be endless debate as to whether a new operating
system is covered by the decree. FN 26

V.B.3. Ineffective Remedy

The Court cannot find the proposed decree to be in the public
 interest because it does not find that the decree will
 "effectively pry open to competition a market that has been
 closed by defendant['s] illegal restraints." AT&T, 552 F.Supp. at
 150. During the period in which this matter was before the Court
the
Government did little to show that the decree would meet this
test beyond telling the Court that it had labored hard, that the
decree was good, and that it should be approved. At the eleventh
hour, only after the Court again requested information to
allay its concerns, did the Government finally produce an
affidavit from Nobel Laureate economist, Professor Kenneth
Arrow. FN 27

The affidavit made three main points: 1) that the market is an
 increasing returns market with large barriers to entry; 2) that
 the violations set forth in the complaint contributed in some
 part to Microsoft's monopoly position; and 3) that the decree
 will eliminate "artificial barriers that Microsoft had erected
 to prevent or slow the entry of competing suppliers of operating
 system software products."

The Court does not doubt the Government's position that the
practices alleged in the complaint are artificial barriers. FN 28
Nor does it doubt that the decree does address those practices.
But what the Government fails to show is that the proposed
decree will open the market and remedy the unfair advantage
 Microsoft gained in the market through its anticompetitive
 practices.

Professor Arrow's affidavit states that the operating systems
 market is an increasing returns market. In layman's terms that
 means that once a company has a monopoly position, it is
 extremely hard to dislodge it. Professor Arrow and the
 Government also concur that part of Microsoft's monopoly
position is
attributable to the artificial barriers it erected. Professor
Arrow only argues that the decree prospectively removes these
artificial barriers. He does not explain how the decree remedies
the
monopolist position Microsoft has achieved through alleged
illegal means in an increasing returns market. If it is
concededly difficult to open up an increasing returns market to
competition once a company has obtained a monopoly position, the
Government has not shown how
prospectively prohibiting violative conduct that contributed to
 defendant's achieving its monopoly position will serve to return
 the market to where it should have been absent its
 anticompetitive practices.FN29 Simply telling a defendant to go
 forth
 and sin no more does little or nothing to address the unfair
 advantage it has already gained. In short, given the Government's
expert's own analysis of this market, the decree is "too
 little, too late."

The proposed decree without going further, is not in the public
interest because it does not meet the test of an effective
antitrust remedy. FN 30 The decree deals with licensing and
 nondisclosure practices that the Government found to be
 anticompetitive and detrimental to a free and open market. What
the decree
does not address are a number of other anticompetitive practices
that from time to time Microsoft has been accused of engaging in
by others in the industry. Since a Court cannot shut it
s eyes to the obvious, it has asked the parties to discuss these
 widespread public allegations. The Government has refused, and
Microsoft has claimed that the accusations are false.

The accusations range from charges that Microsoft engages in the
 practice of vaporware i.e., the public announcement of a
 computer product before it is ready for market for the sole
 purpose of causing consumers not to purchase a competitor's
 product
 that has been developed and is either currently available for
 sale or momentarily about to enter the market. Other allegations
 include charges that Microsoft uses its dominant position in
 operating systems to give it an undue advantage in developing
applications software and that it manipulates its operating
 systems so competitors' applications software are inoperable or
 more difficult for the consumers to utilize effectively.

Throughout these proceedings this Court has expressed repeated
 concern about these allegations, in part, because it is
 concerned that if they are true and defendant continues to
 engage in them, it will continue to hold and possibly expand its
 monopoly position, even if it ceases the practices alleged in
the complaint.

The Court has been particularly concerned about the accusations
 of "vaporware." Microsoft has a dominant position in the
 operating systems market, from which the Government's expert
 concedes it would be very hard to dislodge it. Given this fact,
 Microsoft could unfairly hold onto this position with aggressive
 preannouncements of new products in the face of the introduction
 of possibly superior competitive products. In other words, all
 participants concede that consumers and OEMs will be reluctant
to shift to a new operating system, even a superior one,
 because it will mean not only giving up on both its old
 operating systems and applications, but also risking the
 possibility that there will not be adequate applications to run
 on the superior product. If this is true, Microsoft can hold
onto its market
 share gained allegedly illegally, even with the introduction of
 a competitor's operating system superior to its own. By telling
 the public, "we have developed a product that we are about
to introduce into the market (when such is not the case) that
 is just as good and is compatible with all your old
 applications," Microsoft can discourage consumers and OEMs from
 considering switching to the new product. It is for this reason
that courts may consider practices outside the complaint. See
AT&T,
 552 F. Supp. at 150. FN 31

With respect to the vaporware claim when this matter was raised
 at the November 2, 1994 status call, counsel for Microsoft
 stated the charge was false. The colloquy with the Court was as
 follows:

The Court: Well how do you answer those charges?

Counsel for Microsoft: Those charges we believe are entirely
 false.

The Court: In other words, the vaporware charge is false?

Counsel for Microsoft: That's correct.
Transcript of Hearing, September 29, 1994, p. 15.

When questioned about the practice, the Government refused to
disclose what it knew about the practice or what investigation
it had conducted with respect to it.

This was the state of the record until Mr. Reback submitted two
documents to the Court (Court Exhibits 1 and 2). FN 32 Both of
 these documents are internal Microsoft records. They are part of
 two Microsoft employee evaluation forms. In the first, the
 Microsoft employee writes that during the past six months he
 engaged in the following beneficial activities for Microsoft,
 "QB3 preannounce to hold off Turbo buyers." FN 33

The second document is even more specific. In a self-evaluation,
 a Microsoft employee wrote, "I developed a rollout plan for
 QuickC and CS that focused on minimizing Borland's first mover
 advantage by preannouncing with an aggressive communications
campaign." (emphasis added) These documents indicate that the
 highest officials of the company knew of the practices that were
 utilized to impact adversely on the market plans of a
 competitor. Whether the documents are actionable or not,
 certainly at a minimum they require explanation from the
parties. No
satisfactory explanation has been given.

Although Microsoft acknowledges the authenticity of the
documents, it denies they describe the practice of vaporware and
indeed, states that the practice that is described is a
perfectly legitimate competitive practice. When pressed as to
why the practices described in the documents were not vaporware,
counsel
for Microsoft stated he would limit "vaporware" to those
instances where no product at all exists at the time of the so-
called "preannouncement." According to counsel, it does not
 even matter that the date for introduction of the preannounced
 product is not met. Counsel further advised the Court that he
 would advise his client to continue to engage in the described
 practices. FN 34

At the January 20, 1995 hearing, the Government merely
acknowledged receipt of the documents. It outright refused to
 discuss them or to state what consideration it has given to
 them. It declined to state whether it had even interviewed the
 authors of the documents. In a subsequent filing, the Government
has taken
the following position: "[P]roduct preannouncements do not
violate antitrust laws unless those preannouncements are
 knowingly false and contribute to the acquisition, maintenance,
 or
exercise of market share." Of course, this is not the time or
place to debate the Government's rather narrow view of this
highly questionable practice. It is obvious that the Government
has adopted a criminal standard and may have ignored the fact
that it also has plenary civil authority to enjoin violative
practices without having to prove criminal culpability.

Regardless of how narrow the Government's view is, it is
incumbent on the Government to address whether the defendant has
 been preannouncing products and what effect, if any, such
 preannouncements have had in eliminating competition in an
increasing
 returns market where the market has clearly been tipped. Even if
 Microsoft's current practice of "preannouncing" did not meet the
 Government's definition of vaporware, shouldn't the Court be
 advised whether there is a basis for seeking to limit the
 practice in fashioning an antitrust remedy? As Judge Green held
 in the AT&T case, even practices that have not been found to be
 unlawful can be prohibited if they prevent the prying open of
 the market that has been closed through illegal restraints.
AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150. Even if these practices might be
 legal in another context, defendant's ability to use them to
 maintain a monopoly position that it gained in part through
 improper licensing and nondisclosure agreements certainly raises
the question whether a decree that does not address such
 anticompetitive practices, is in the public interest.

This Court cannot ignore the obvious. Here is the dominant firm
 in the software industry admitting it "preannounces" products to
 freeze the current software market and thereby defeat the
 marketing plans of competitors that have products ready for
market. Microsoft admits that the preannouncement is solely for
the purpose of having an adverse impact on a competitor's
product. Its counsel states it has advised its client that the
practice
is perfectly legal and it may continue the practice. This
 practice of an alleged monopolist would seem to contribute to
the acquisition, maintenance, or exercise of market share.

The Government has pressed for the adoption of its decree on the
 grounds that it will open up competition. Given the Government's
 desire to open up competition why does it not want to take on
 the vaporware issue?

When the Court gave Microsoft the opportunity to disavow this
 practice by an undertaking it declined to do so. What is more,
 the Government told the Court that if it conditioned its
 approval on Microsoft's undertaking no longer to engage in the
 practice, the Government would withdraw its approval of the
decree even if Microsoft agreed to the undertaking.

The Court cannot sign off on a decree knowing that the defendant
 intends to continue to engage in an anticompetitive practice
 without the Government providing a full explanation as to its
 "no action" stance. It would almost be the equivalent of a
Court accepting a probationary plea from a defendant who has told
 the Court he will go out and again engage in inappropriate
 conduct.

V.B.4. Compliance

The only change in the decree that the Government stated it would
 accept is the Court's suggestion that Microsoft establish an
 internal mechanism to monitor the decree. This too Microsoft has
 declined even to consider. Microsoft's position is that its
50 or so in-house lawyers, along with its outside retained
 counsel, are sufficient to monitor the decree. This is the same
 group that has advised its client that "product
 preannouncements" to impede competition is proper behavior.

This Court finds itself in a position similar to that of Judge
 Greene in AT&T, who refused to approve the decree without
 modification because of his concern as to its compliance and
 enforcement. FN 35 AT&T, 552 F.Supp at 214-17.

Based on Microsoft's counsel's representations to this Court, the
 Court is concerned about the question of compliance. This
 concern is heightened because even though the Company on prior
 occasions has publicly stated at does not and will not abuse
its dominant position in the operating systems market vis-a-vis
its development of application products, it has refused to give
the Court the same assurance. Without a compliance mechanism,
the Court cannot make the public interest finding. This is
particularly so because Microsoft denies that the conduct charged
in the Government's complaint to which it has consented,
violates the antitrust laws.

This is clearly the kind of case that Congress had in mind when
it passed the Tunney Act. Microsoft is a company that has a
monopolist position in a field that is central to this country's
well being, not only for the balance of this century, but
also for the 21st Century. The Court is certainly mindful of the
heroic efforts of the Antitrust Division to negotiate the
decree. There is no doubt its task was formidable. Here is a
company that is so feared by its competitors that they believe
they
will be retaliated against if they disclose their identity even
in an open proceeding before a U.S. District Court Judge.

The picture that emerges from these proceedings is that the U.S.
 Government is either incapable or unwilling to deal effectively
 with a potential threat to this nation's economic well being.
 How else can the four year deadlocked investigation conducted
by the FTC be explained. What is more, the Justice
 Department, although it labored hard in its follow up
 investigation, likewise was unable to come up with a meaningful
 result.

It is clear to this Court that if it signs the decree presented
 to it, the message will be that Microsoft is so powerful that
 neither the market nor the Government is capable of dealing with
 all of its monopolistic practices. The attitude of Microsoft
confirms these observations. While it has denied publicly that
 it engages in anticompetitive practices, it refuses to give the
 Court in any respect the same assurance. FN 36 It has refused to
 take even a small step to meet any of the reasonable concerns
that have been raised by the Court. FN 37

The Government itself is so anxious to close this deal that it
 has interpreted certain anticompetitive practices so narrowly
 that it possibly has given the green light for persons to engage
 in anticompetitive practices with impunity. To in any way
condone the practice of announcing products before they are ready
 for market to freeze a competitor's product is terribly
 bothersome to this Court. "Vaporware is a practice that is
 deceitful on its face and everybody in the business community
 known it. Why else has the business community dubbed the
practice
 "vaporware?" It is interesting that business leaders know that
 the practice is improper but the Government does not. Philip K.
 Howard's comment from his book "The Death of Common Sense" might
well be right: "Law designed to make Americans' lives safer and
 fairer has now become an enemy of the people."

The Tunney Act provides that a Court must find that a proposed
 consent decree is in the public interest before it shall enter
 an order to that effect. Because of the many concerns that the
 Court has, that finding cannot be made on the present record.

The Court fully understands the role the judiciary plays in this
 society. It has no interest in intruding on the prerogatives of
 the executive branch. The Courts only reason for being involved
 in this case is because of the dictates of the Tunney Act.
To make the public interest finding required by the Tunney
Act, the Court has to be confident of its decision. It does not
have the
confidence in the proposed antitrust decree that has been
presented to it. In part, this lack of confidence is a result of
the Government's "stonewalling" position.

Microsoft has done extremely well in its business in a relatively
 short period of time, which is a tribute both to its talented
 personnel and to this nation's great ethic that affords every
 citizen the ability to rise to the top. Microsoft, a rather
new corporation, may not have matured to the position where it
 understands how it should act with respect to the public
 interest and the ethics of the market place. In this
technological age, this nation's cutting edge companies must
 guard against
 being captured by their own technology and becoming robotized.

Some might suggest that disapproval of the proposed decree serves
 little purpose since all that the Government will be able to
 achieve if it prevails after a lengthy trial would be the relief
 set forth in the proposed consent decree.

This is not necessarily so. First after a fully successful
 litigated case and findings made, the judgment may have
 preclusive effect in other cases. Second, unlike a denial in a
consent decree, once a court issues its findings and
conclusions, a party's denial of liability has no effect unless
the party is
successful on appeal. Third, a court of equity has a wide range
 of remedies it can fashion to protect the public interest. After
 a trial in which the Government prevails, the Court is not
limited solely to the relief set forth in the Governments earlier
 proposed negotiated settlement. Certainly, all parties to a
 litigation face certain risks. While the risks are greater, so
are the rewards. FN 38 For all of the above reasons, the Court
finds that the proposed antitrust consent decree is not in the
public interest. An appropriate order accompanies this
 memorandum opinion.

agencies. See 17 C.F.R.   202.5(e) (1994) (Securities and
Exchange Commission).

FN 13 The Tunney Act envisioned that the courts were to be an
 "independent force" rather than a "rubber stamp in reviewing
 consent decrees." Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act:
 Hearings on S.782 and S.1088 Before the Subcomm. on Antitrust
and Monopoly of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 93d Cong.,
1st Sess. 1 (1973) [hereinafter "Senate Hearings"] (statement of
Sen. Tunney).

FN 14 The law firm of Chan & Jodziewicz submitted a comment on
behalf of a number of small computer companies. The comment
 charged that Microsoft violated copyright laws by not allowing
purchasers of MS-DOS to resell it in any manner they choose. In
addition, the comment charged that Microsoft engaged in illegal
tying by leasing MS-DOS to OEMs and not selling it to the
public. The basis of the claim that this is illegal is that
Microsoft "ties" the purchase of MS-DOS to the purchase of a PC.

Micro Systems Option commented that Microsoft's inclusion of a
graphics feature in its operating systems would reduce demand
for Micro Systems own product, which performs similar functions.
Anthony Martin commented that Microsoft had begun to engage in
 new anticompetitive conduct, specifically pressuring software
 suppliers to switch from old versions of Windows to the next
 version to be released. Mr. Martin suggested that the Department
of Justice should reopen its investigation.

IDE Corporation, an OEM which has a licensing agreement with
 Microsoft, commented that the decree should have forced
 Microsoft to repay certain royalties received from IDE in an
 agreement of a type prospectively forbidden in the decree.

Finally, J. Adam Burden commented that the Government should have
 brought no action at all against Microsoft, whose success is
 attributable to good products.

FN 15 On January 19, 1995 the Court issued the following order in
 an attempt to supplement the record and obtain information
 necessary to make its public interest determination.



A hearing in the above captioned case has been scheduled for
January 20, 1995. At that hearing, the Court requests the
parties to respond to the following:

(1) How the proposed consent decree will restore competitive
 balance to the operating systems market?

(2) Why the proposed consent decree should not be amended to
 include:

(a) A provision that would clearly state that the consent decree
 applies to all operating systems commercially offered by
 Microsoft;

(b) A provision barring Microsoft from engaging in the practice
 of "vaporware" i.e., releasing misleading information concerning
 the status of the introduction into the marketplace of new
 software products;

(c) A provision establishing a wall between the development of
 operating systems software and the development of applications
 software at Microsoft;

(d) A provision requiring disclosure of all instruction codes
 built into operating systems software designed to give Microsoft
 an advantage over competitors in the applications software
 market;

(e) A provision establishing an appropriate compliance apparatus
 (e.g., private inspector general, business practices officer or
 compliance officer) to ensure compliance with the decree;

(g) In the event Microsoft chooses not to pay I.D.E. Corporation
 the damages that it seeks, a provision that would avoid costly
 litigation. For example, allowing this Court to refer the matter
 to a Special Master.

FN 16 In response to the allegations made in the submissions that
this Court has considered, the Government has insisted that
 Microsoft's illicit activities covered by the proposed consent
 decree be considered apart from the other matters addressed in
the submissions. The Court knows of no theory of
 compartmentalization in carrying out its responsibilities under
 the Tunney Act. Of course, related relevant conduct must be
 considered and all such conduct has been considered except for
 conduct outlined in the redacted document attached to the
supplemental
 submission filed by Gary Reback on February 1, 1995. Since that
 information has not been made available to Microsoft, it has not
 been considered by the Court. This, however, should not preclude
the Government from considering the new submission it has
 received from Mr. Reback, and if it believes such information is
 pertinent to this case, on notice to defendant, it may request
 the Court to reopen these proceedings so the information
appropriately may be considered.

FN 17 CCIA is comprised of approximately 25 member companies,
many
 of whom are manufacturers and/or providers of computer products,
 computer software and services.

FN 18 It is interesting to note that one of the public comments
 was filed by a law firm on behalf of certain unnamed clients and
 neither the Justice Department nor Microsoft objected.

FN 19 But see footnote 16, supra, with respect to certain
 materials not considered by the Court because they were not
 submitted to Microsoft.

FN 20 By focusing only on snippets of Section 16 to defend its
 position as to the narrow scope of the Tunney Act, the
 Department ignores the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation
 "that a statute is to be read as a whole." Kind v. St. Vincent's
Hospital, 112 S.Ct 570, 574 (1991); see also DAE Corporation v.
 Engeleiter, 958 F.2d 436, 439 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

FN 21 The legislative history shows that the inclusion in the
bill
 of specific factors that the Court "may consider," such as
 "termination of [the] alleged violations was not intended to
 limit the scope of the Court's inquiry. 119 Cong. Rec. 24,599
(1973) (statements of Sen. Tunney).

FN 22 The Justice Department has cited a statement from the
Senate Reports to support its position that the Court is
restricted to
considering only the allegations in the complaint in analyzing
whether the decree is in the public interest. See Department
of Justice Motion for Final Judgment at 12 (citing S. Rep.
No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. at 3 (1973)). Their motion
mischaracterizes the statement. The statement simply stands for
the proposition that the Court needs to know what other relief
the Department considered when the Court evaluates whether relief
 is appropriate with reference to the allegations in the
 complaint. The statement does not support the Government's
 assertion the Court may consider only the relationship between
 the actual allegations and the remedies in the decree. In fact,
the statute gives the Court a much broader scope of review. See
supra.

FN 23 The then Deputy Attorney General made clear that the
Justice
Department did not approve of the broad scope of the bill. His
testimony made equally clear that the bill appeared to give the
Court authority to look beyond the allegations in the
complaint. Id.

FN 24 In the hearing on January 20, 1995, the following colloquy
took place:

The Court: Well, every time I ask you I get stonewalled. Every
time -- not you -- I ask your people what is it? What are the
facts? They stone-wall me. And I don't like to be stonewalled.

Ms. Bingaman: Okay. You know why I'm stone-walling you? You bet.

Transcript of Hearing, January 20, 1995, p. 46.

FN 25 It is difficult to imagine in this dynamic area that by the
 end of the period (7 years) the decree will be in effect, there
 will not be wholesale change with respect to microprocessors and
 operating systems.

FN 26 See discussion infra, at page 46.

FN 27 When
to testify, the Government stated he was not available to
testify at the hearing.

FN 28 "The decree is to be tested on the basis of the relief
provided, on the assumption that the government would have won."
Gillette, 406 F.Supp. at 716 n.2; see also United States v.
Airline Tariff Pub. Co., 836 F. Supp. 9, 12 n.4 (D.D.C. 1993).

FN 29 The legislative history of The Tunney Act gives further
 support to the argument that the Court may find a decree is not
 in the public interest because of its failure to go beyond mere
prospective remedies. Senator Tunney cited the antitrust
decrees in the "smog case and the IT&T consent decree as examples
of
 abuses the Act was drafted to remedy. In the "smog case" Senator
 Tunney noted the failure of the decree to "require the auto
 industry to undo its past damage." Senator Tunney criticized
the failure of the IT&T decree to force IT&T to disgorge its
 profits even though IT&T prospectively had to divest itself of
 certain companies. 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973). See also
 testimony of Judge J. Skelly Wright, Senate Hearings, at 147.

FN 30 The goal of the remedy is not only to prevent future
occurrences of illegal conduct, but also to cure the ill effects
of such conduct and to deny the violator future benefits of that
conduct. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340
U.S. 76, 88-89 (1950); Wilk v. American Medical Association, 671
F.Supp. 1465, 1484-85 (N.D.Ill. 1987), aff'd 895 F.2d 352 (7th
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 927 (199O).

FN 31 The Court may not only consider practices outside the
complaint, it may also prohibit such practices even if they have
not been found to be unlawful if that is necessary to formulate
an effective decree to prevent the recurrence of monopolization.
See AT&T, 552 F.Supp. at 150 n.80 (citing with approval
United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F.Supp 295,
346-47, aff'd, 347 U.S. 521 (1954) and Hartford-Empire Co. v.
United States, 323 U.S. 386, 409 (1945)); see also United States
Gypsum Co., 340 U.S. at 89.

FN 32 According to Mr. Reback, these documents come from public
sources.

FN 33 QB3 is Microsoft software; Turbo is software developed by
Borland, one of Microsoft's competitors.

FN 34 Transcript of Hearing, January 20, 1995, p. 110-11.

FN 35 The proposed AT&T decree and the decree before this Court
contain almost identical provisions regarding the Court's role in
enforcement and continuing jurisdiction.

FN 36 Microsoft has stated to the press over the years that there
 is a "Chinese Wall" between its operating systems and
 applications divisions. See Memorandum of Amici Curiae in
 Opposition to Proposed Final Judgment, p. 19. In Microsoft's
 submission
to the Court, it maintains that there is no such separation and
 that one is not necessary. See Memorandum of Microsoft
 Corporation in Support of Proposed Final Judgment, p. 7 n.12.

FN 37 See footnote 15, supra.

FN 38 The Government has expressed concern that if the Court
rejects the consent decree, Microsoft would be able to
reinstitute the prohibited practices that have been banned by
the consent decree with which Microsoft has voluntarily agreed
to comply
pending this Court's determination. The Government's fears are
misplaced. The Government is reminded that it has filed with the
Court a complaint in which it has prayed for an injunction
against Microsoft enjoining it "from engaging or carrying out,
renewing or attempting to engage, carry out or renew any
contracts, agreements, practices or understandings in violation
of the Sherman Act [and] (4) that plaintiffs have such other
relief that the court may consider necessary or appropriate to
restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by
Microsoft's unlawful conduct."

If Microsoft wants to dissolve its "standstill" agreement with
the Government pending the completion of these proceedings, the
Government certainly can move for a preliminary injunction
pending conclusion of the litigation. If it can prove to the
Court the merits of its position, it will be entitled to
appropriate relief.

THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO ENTER THE PROPOSED

          BRIEF FOR APPELLANT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
_________________________



                    STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION


The district court had jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. 4 and 28
U.S.C. 1331 & 1337.

This Court's jurisdiction over the appeal from the district
court's order refusing to approve the proposed consent decree
rests on 15 U.S.C. 29(a) and 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1). Without
immediate appeal, the parties will suffer the serious and perhaps
irreparable deprivation of the opportunity to settle their case
on the negotiated terms, and the government's antitrust
enforcement program will be gravely damaged./1 See Carson v.
American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83-84, 86, 89 (1981); see
also United States v. Colorado, 937 F.2d 505, 509 & n.1 (10th
Cir. 1991); Sierra Club v. Electronic Controls Design, Inc., 909
F.2d 1350, 1353, 1354 n.3 (9th Cir. 1990); Durrett v. Housing
Auth., 896 F.2d 600, 602 (1st Cir. 1990).

The district court order was entered on February 14, 1995,
and the United States timely filed a notice of appeal on February
16, 1995.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS

The pertinent statutes, the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1-2, and
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act ("Tunney Act" or
"Act"), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), are reproduced in the addendum to
this brief.

STATEMENT OF ISSUES

1. Whether the district court erred as a matter of law in
extending its Tunney Act review to competitive issues beyond the
adequacy of the relief the government obtained to remedy the
violations charged in the complaint.

2. Whether the government had a reasonable basis for
concluding that the relief in the consent decree adequately and
reasonably remedied the violations alleged in the complaint.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A. Proceedings in the District Court

On July 15, 1994, the United States filed a complaint
charging Microsoft Corporation with unlawfully maintaining a
monopoly in personal computer operating systems and restraining
trade in violation of the Sherman Act through certain practices
set forth in the complaint (J.A. 1, 10-25). Simultaneously, it
filed a proposed consent decree to settle the case (J.A. 26-40).
The United States on August 19, 1994, published the proposed
decree and a competitive impact statement in the Federal
Register. See 59 Fed. Reg. 42,845, 42,845-57 (1994). Five
comments were received (J.A. 120, 137-54), to which the United
States responded on October 31, 1994 (J.A. 119-36).
Subsequently, in January 1995, three proposed amici (two of which
sought party status) submitted comments in opposition to the
settlement (J.A. 5-7, 269-603, 794-802), to which the United
States responded (J.A. 6, 625-41, 667-752). At the same time,
the United States moved entry of the proposed Final Judgment
(J.A. 667-69a). The district court (Sporkin, J.) heard oral
argument on January 20, 1995 (J.A. 7, 810-961). On February 14,
1995, it entered an order refusing to approve the proposed decree
(J.A. 8, 1190-91).

B. Statement of Facts

The consent decree in this case arose from two separate
investigations by two separate antitrust enforcement agencies.

In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation
into possible antitrust violations by Microsoft. That inquiry
focused on Microsoft's acquisition and maintenance of monopoly
power over personal computer operating systems (J.A. 121-22.
When the issue of filing a complaint reached the Commission in
1993, however, the agency deadlocked 2-2 on whether to bring a
case much like the one the government brought here. The FTC then
suspended its investigation (J.A. 158-60).

Upon learning that the FTC would not proceed, the Department
of Justice's Antitrust Division initiated its own investigation
(J.A. 122). The starting point was receipt of the Commission's
extensive investigatory file, but the Department then undertook
its own investigation. The Department issued 21 Civil
Investigative Demands, see 15 U.S.C. 1312, to Microsoft and third
parties (J.A. 123, 715). It interviewed over 100 people,
including former Microsoft employees, and individuals at roughly
80 companies that make, use, or compete with Microsoft software
(J.A. 122, 715). And it took depositions of 22 persons,
including Microsoft's Chairman and other top Microsoft executives
(J.A. 213-14, 715). The investigation consumed 14,000 attorney
hours, 5,500 paralegal hours, and 3,650 economist hours (J.A.
715).

By June 1994, the Department had reached two principal
conclusions. First, there was no basis for an antitrust
challenge to Microsoft's acquisition of monopoly power in the
market for operating system software for IBM-compatible personal
computers; the government concluded that this had resulted from
Microsoft's obtaining an enormous installed base on millions of
personal computers ("PCs") through its successful exploitation of
its initial advantage as IBM's chosen PC operating system (J.A.
14, 16, 60-61, 696-97).

Second, the Department concluded that Microsoft had engaged
in certain anticompetitive practices that, to some degree, may
have contributed to the maintenance of its monopoly power after
1988 and, more significantly, threatened seriously to impede
future innovation and competition in operating systems. The
central such practice was the per processor license, under which
Microsoft licensed certain of its software to manufacturers of
PCs at an attractively low royalty paid on all the PCs containing
a particular processor (chip), whether or not the machine
contained a Microsoft operating system (J.A. 17-19). This
license's practical effect was to impose a "tax" on
manufacturers' use of competing operating systems and thus to
diminish the viability of any actual or potential competing
operating systems (J.A. 17-19, 61-62). The anticompetitive
danger of the per processor license was increased by Microsoft's
practice of using it in long-term licenses with minimum purchase
commitments (J.A. 17-18, 62). Additionally, the Department
concluded that Microsoft had attempted to impose unreasonably
restrictive non-disclosure agreements on applications software
manufacturers who were testing Microsoft's prototype "Chicago"
(now known as "Windows 95") operating system, so that they could
not develop applications for operating systems of Microsoft
competitors (J.A. 20-22, 62-63)./2

The government was determined to eliminate these practices
by negotiating a consent decree if possible or by litigating if
necessary. The negotiations were difficult. The United States
would not yield on the need to end the anticompetitive practices
(J.A. 835-36), while Microsoft consistently maintained that it
had not violated the antitrust laws (J.A. 215). Negotiations
broke down (J.A. 834-36). Finally, on July 15, 1994, the parties
reached an agreement with respect to the practices the government
challenged (J.A. 834). The government filed its complaint,
stipulation for entry of consent decree, and proposed decree with
the district court that day (J.A. 119-20). In the same
negotiations, Microsoft and the Directorate-General IV of the
European Commission For Competition reached a substantially
identical settlement (J.A. 200, 214).

The government's complaint alleged that the anticompetitive
practices described above violated sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1-2. See Complaint 40-44 (J.A. 23).
Specifically, the complaint challenged Microsoft's per processor
licenses, see id. 19-22 (J.A. 16-17), long-term licenses, see
id. 23-24 (J.A. 17), minimum commitment licensing, see id.
23 (J.A. 17), and unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure
agreements, see id. 34 (J.A. 21).

The proposed decree was designed to eliminate immediately
all the anticompetitive practices challenged in the complaint.
It prohibits Microsoft from entering into per processor licenses,
see Decree IV(C) (J.A. 32), licenses with a term exceeding one-
year (unless the customer opted to renew for an additional year),
Decree IV(A) (J.A. 30-31), licenses containing a minimum
commitment, see Decree IV(F) (J.A. 32), or unduly restrictive
non-disclosure agreements of a kind Microsoft introduced, see
Decree IV(K) (J.A. 36-37). The proposed decree includes
additional prophylactic relief as well (J.A. 64-65, 67),
prohibiting a number of licensing practices, such as exclusivity
clauses, tying or line-forcing clauses, and variants of per
system licensing, that could be used to achieve effects similar
to those achieved by the practices challenged in the complaint,
see Decree IV(B), (E), (G), (H) (J.A. 31-35, 68-70).

In keeping with the requirements of the Tunney Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), the United States promptly published the
proposed decree in the Federal Register, accompanied by an
explanatory competitive impact statement, and invited public
comment. See 59 Fed. Reg. 42,845, 42,845-57 (1994). Five
members of the public responded during the 60-day comment period,
with comments ranging from a citizen's criticism of the
government for suing Microsoft to a manufacturer's criticism of
the agreement for not requiring the refund of money it had paid
Microsoft under a minimum commitment contract (J.A. 137-54). On
October 31, 1994, the United States replied to the five comments
(J.A.119-54).

The district court initially scheduled a hearing on the
proposed decree for December 15, 1994, but rescheduled it for
January 20, 1995 (J.A. 5).

On January 10, 1995, the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich & Rosati, on behalf of three anonymous proposed amici,
filed a lengthy (96-pages plus appendices) comment urging the
court to reject the decree. The amici asserted, without
evidentiary support, that the six-fold increase in Microsoft's
installed base during 1988-94 was attributable in large measure
to the practices challenged in this case. (J.A. 289, 292, 323-
24, 364, 370). Noting the impact of "network externalities" and
"increasing returns to scale," they maintained that Microsoft's
present installed base made effective rivalry with Microsoft
impossible. They further contended that, if the decree is
approved as proposed, Microsoft inevitably will leverage this
market power into other markets unchecked by the antitrust laws,
and they argued that sweeping remedies, possibly including
dissolution of Microsoft, were required (J.A. 316-75).

The United States filed a response to the amici's comments
and a motion to enter the final judgment (J.A. 667-717), appended
to which was the supporting affidavit of Nobel Prize-winning
economist Kenneth J. Arrow (J.A. 718-52), which further explained
the basis for the government's judgments and determinations in
filing the case./3 Professor Arrow pointed out that the six-fold
increase in Microsoft's installed base in the five years
following 1988 "is primarily the result of the extraordinary
commercial success of the IBM-compatible PC platform, in which
Microsoft's product development and marketing played a part."
Arrow Dec'l at 11 (J.A. 728). Professor Arrow concluded that
Microsoft's per processor licenses (coupled with long terms and
minimum commitments) had made only a minor and nonmaterial
contribution to its continuing market dominance. See id. at 11-
12 (J.A. 728-29). Consequently, Professor Arrow strongly
supported entry of the proposed decree on the ground that it
would eliminate artificial barriers to the entry of new operating
systems and help "maintain the openness of markets so that new
technologies can have an opportunity to enter and show their
value relative to older ones." Id. at 13 (J.A. 730). Professor
Arrow saw no need for, and substantial risk of economic harm in,
breaking up Microsoft or imposing other, more drastic remedies
than those contained in the proposed decree. See id. at 9-10
(J.A. 726-27). The United States assured the court that, if it
were to find that Microsoft had violated the antitrust laws by
other conduct and the government had a reasonable chance of
proving such a case, the government would not hesitate to invoke
the antitrust laws (J.A. 836-37, 950-51).

On January 20, 1995, the district court held a hearing in
which the United States and Microsoft urged approval of the
decree, and Wilson, Sonsini, CCIA, and I.D.E. Corporation urged
disapproval (J.A. 7, 810-961).

On February 14, 1995, the district court entered an order
refusing to accept the decree, concluding that to do so would not
be in the public interest for four reasons (J.A. 8, 1190-91).
First, the court held that the United States improperly had
failed to inform the court about the details of its investigation
and negotiations with Microsoft. See Op. at 29-31 (J.A. 1222-
24). Second, the court concluded that the decree was too narrow
"on its face," because it did not apply to all Microsoft
operating systems. Id. at 31-32 (J.A. 1224-25). Third, the
court held that the remedy was ineffective. See id. at 34 (J.A.
1227). The court conceded that the "decree does address those
practices" alleged in the complaint. Id. at 33 (emphasis
omitted) (J.A. 1226). But, according to the court, the
government failed to show that it "will open the market and
remedy the unfair advantage Microsoft gained in the market
through its anticompetitive practices." Id. (J.A. 1226). In
this regard, the court was particularly concerned that the decree
did not address accusations of Microsoft's practice of
"vaporware," or construction of a "wall" between Microsoft's
operating system and applications developers. Op. at 35-42 (J.A.
1228-35). Finally, the court found the decree deficient because
it lacked decree-compliance mechanisms beyond the usual ones,
which the decree provided. See id. at 40-41 (J.A. 1233-34).

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

The district court, in wrongfully denying entry of the
decree, converted a Tunney Act proceeding designed to determine
whether entry of a negotiated consent decree was within the
reaches of the public interest into a sweeping judicial
investigation of Microsoft. In so doing, it vastly exceeded its
authority and threatened substantial damage to the public
interest in effective antitrust enforcement, including potential
disruption of, and prejudice to, any ongoing or future
enforcement efforts as well as a greatly decreased likelihood
that government antitrust cases can be settled at all.

The primary reason for the district court's refusal to enter
the decree was its determination to conduct a broad-ranging
inquiry into practices the government did not challenge as
violations in the complaint. Consistent with the separate and
distinct roles of prosecutor and judge in our constitutional
scheme, the Tunney Act authorizes no such inquiry. The Act,
which directs the court to focus on how the decree remedies the
"alleged violations," 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1), reflects the time-
honored structural limitation that it is not the court's role to
determine the scope of any particular case that the government
brings against Microsoft or any other defendant. That is clearly
a prosecutorial rather than a judicial function. With respect to
the content of a proposed decree, the Tunney Act thus limits the
court's role to determining whether the government reasonably
concluded that the settlement provides an adequate and reasonable
remedy for the violations alleged in the complaint.

Countenancing the district court's intrusion into the
Justice Department's prosecutorial discretion would destroy the
consent decree as an effective tool for public antitrust
enforcement. The prospect of protracted Tunney Act proceedings
involving public disclosure of investigatory files relating to
conduct with which a defendant has not been charged, and to the
government's intentions with respect to ongoing or future
investigations of such conduct, would surely deter defendants and
prosecutors alike from settling antitrust cases. Indeed, this
procedure is an invitation to anarchy in the enforcement of the
antitrust laws, which depend upon the ability of the Department
of Justice to dispose of most or many cases by the agreement of
the parties. This is a result that cannot be reconciled with the
intent of Congress or the public interest.

To the extent that the court even focused on the decree as a
remedy for the violations the government charged, it merely
sought to substitute its assessment of competitive effects for
that of the government. Under the public interest standard,
however, it must approve the government's proposed relief if it
falls "within the reaches of the public interest." United States
v. Western Elec. Co. (Triennial Review Opinion), 900 F.2d 283,
309 (D.C. Cir.) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added by
Court), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 911 (1990).

There is no doubt that the proposed decree met that
standard. The United States concluded that Microsoft was
engaging in particular unlawful practices that diminished the
prospects for innovation and competition. It negotiated a decree
providing for complete and prompt termination of those practices.
The government complied with the procedures mandated by the
Tunney Act and provided a full explanation -- including an
affidavit from an internationally recognized economist -- of how
the decree effectively remedies the violations alleged. The
government is entitled to entry of the decree.

ARGUMENT
THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO ENTER THE PROPOSED DECREE

A. Standard of Review

The proper scope of a district court's review of a proposed
consent decree under the Tunney Act is a question of statutory
interpretation that is reviewed de novo. See, e.g., FLRA v.
Department of the Treasury, 884 F.2d 1446, 1451 (D.C. Cir. 1989),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1055 (1990).

Where a district court's scope of review is properly
bounded, courts of appeals generally have reviewed refusals to
enter a proposed consent decree for abuse of discretion. See,
e.g., Donovan v. Robbins, 752 F.2d 1170, 1177-78 (7th Cir, 1985);
cf. Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117,
1120 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1219 (1984).
An error of law, however, constitutes an abuse of discretion.
See, e.g., Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405
(1990). And in the context of the Tunney Act, a district court
commits an error of law, and thus abuses its discretion, by
failing to accord appropriate deference to the government's
settlement proposal. See United States v. Western Elec. Co.
(Triennial Review Remand), 993 F.2d 1572, 1577-78 (D.C.Cir.),
cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 (1993). Similarly, this Court has
suggested that the district court's underlying findings are
reviewed de novo. See id. (analogizing the deference extended to
the government in a Tunney Act proceeding to that accorded to
agencies when a court undertakes substantial evidence review).

B. The District Court Exceeded Its Authority Under
The Tunney Act In Seeking To Review The Entirety Of The
Government's Investigation

Although the district court offered four reasons for its
refusal to enter the decree, three of the asserted justifications
depend wholly or substantially on its conclusion that the Tunney
Act authorizes broad-ranging judicial review of the Department's
investigatory process and its exercise of prosecutorial
discretion with respect to practices not challenged in the
complaint before the court. See Op. at 22-31 (J.A. 1215-24).
The Tunney Act authorizes no such inquiry, a conclusion supported
fully by the statutory language, its legislative history, and
background principles concerning the appropriate role of the
Executive and the courts in our constitutional scheme.

Section 16(e) of the Tunney Act requires the court to
determine, when the government proposes an antitrust consent
decree, that the "entry of such judgment is in the public
interest." 15 U.S.C. 16(e). In so doing, the court may
consider:

(1) the competitive impact of such judgment,
including termination of alleged violations, provisions for
enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought,
anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually
considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the
adequacy of such judgment;

(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the
public generally and individuals alleging specific injury
from the violations set forth in the complaint including
consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived
from a determination of the issues at trial.
Id.

This language directs the district court to assess the
effect of the proposed relief as a remedy for the violations
alleged in the complaint. Thus, subsection (e)(1), which relates
specifically to "the competitive impact of [the] judgment,"
expressly focuses on the "alleged violations." 15 U.S.C.
16(e)(1). The "adequacy of [the] judgment" must be measured in
light of some goal, and the only one suggested by the subsection
is that of remedying the "alleged violations," meaning those
alleged in the complaint, see 15 U.S.C. 16(b)(2). Thus, read in
context, the "catch-all" phrase at the end of subsection (e)(1),
"any other considerations bearing on the adequacy of such
judgment," 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1), denotes the broad range of factors
potentially relevant to that inquiry. See, e.g., Ford Motor Co.
v. United States, 405 U.S. 562, 575 (1972) (ancillary provisions
necessary to make divestiture work as a remedy in merger case);
International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 400-01
(1947) (permissible to enjoin unlawful conduct enabled by and
related to the violation). But it cannot fairly be understood,
as the district court here suggested, see Op. at 24 (J.A. 1217),
to expand the competitive impact inquiry to cover violations the
government did not charge.

Subsection (e)(2) focuses on factors other than the
competitive impact of the judgment on the market. Thus, it
permits the court to consider whether the proposed remedy impairs
important public policies other than competition, see United
States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988), and to
take account of the impact on particular individuals alleging
specific injury "from the violations set forth in the complaint,"
15 U.S.C. 16(e)(2). But there is no hint that the Act's
reference to "the impact of entry of such judgment upon the
public generally," id., is, as the district court concluded, see
Op. at 24-25 (J.A. 1217-18), a broad invitation for courts to
consider whether the government should have alleged different
violations. By its terms the phrase focuses on the "impact"
caused by entry of the "judgment." But entry of the judgment by
itself has no impact on practices and markets neither challenged
in the complaint nor addressed by the decree nor by any side
deal. Moreover, the final phrase of subsection (e)(2) confirms
the limited scope of the court's inquiry: the alternative to
entry of the decree is "a determination of the issue at trial,"
15 U.S.C. 16(e)(2). The "issue" necessarily is defined by the
complaint and the relief that could be obtained at trial for the
practices alleged therein.

For these reasons, the language of the Tunney Act undermines
rather than supports the district court's ruling. The text is
not naturally read to authorize a broad-ranging inquiry into the
Justice Department's exercise of its prosecutorial discretion not
to bring a particular case at a particular time. Rather, the
statutory text implies a limitation of the judicial inquiry to
the case that the Justice Department did bring.

Any other reading of the Tunney Act would require the
surprising conclusion that Congress meant radically to transform
the fundamental roles of judges and prosecutors in the Federal
system. The Supreme Court long has recognized that "an agency's
decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or
criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an
agency's absolute discretion." Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821,
831 (1985) (citing, inter alia, Confiscation Cases, 74 U.S. (7
Wall.) 454 (1869)). As the Court explained, "[t]his recognition
of the existence of discretion is attributable in no small part
to the general unsuitability for judicial review of agency
decisions to refuse enforcement." Id. at 831. It also is rooted
in the Constitution. "[A]n agency's refusal to institute
proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the
decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to indict --
a decision which has long been regarded as the special province
of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is the Executive who is
charged by the Constitution to `take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed.' U.S. Const., Art. II, 3." Id. at 832.
The district court's holding, which sanctions judicial intrusion
into the Justice Department's prosecutorial decisions about what
cases not to bring, rests on the implausible assumption that
Congress meant to upset this tradition.

Indeed, if the Tunney Act were read to permit an inquiry
into the government's exercise of prosecutorial discretion, it
would raise difficult, and perhaps insurmountable, questions
concerning the Act's constitutionality. Cf. United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 694 (1974) ("[T]he Executive Branch has
exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to
prosecute a case."); United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167, 171 (5th
Cir.) (en banc) ("It follows, as an incident of the
constitutional separation of powers, that the courts are not free
to interfere with the free exercise of the discretionary powers
of the attorneys of the United States in their control over
criminal prosecutions.") (cited approvingly in Nixon, 418 U.S. at
693), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 935 (1965); Community for Creative
Non-Violence v. Pierce, 786 F.2d 1199, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1986)
("The power to decide when to investigate, and when to prosecute,
lies at the core of the Executive's duty to see to the faithful
executive of the laws . . . ."); In re International Bus. Machs.
Corp. (IBM), 687 F.2d 591, 602 (2d Cir. 1982) (refusing to
construe the Tunney Act to apply to a voluntary dismissal by the
government in part because "[t]he district court's involvement in
the executive branch's decision to abandon litigation might
impinge upon the doctrine of separation of powers")./4
Consequently, it would take the most compelling showing of a
congressional intent to transform the traditional roles of
prosecutor and judge before the district court's interpretation
could be adopted as the proper reading of the Tunney Act. For,
"[w]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would
raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe
the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is
plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp v. Florida Gulf Coast Build. & Const. Trades Council, 485
U.S. 568, 575 (1988); see also United States v. X-Citement Video,
Inc., 115 S. Ct. 464, 472 (1994).

As we have shown, however, the language of the Tunney Act
demonstrates no congressional intention to mandate such an
intrusion into the government's prosecutorial discretion. This
is confirmed by the Act's legislative history. In codifying the
"public interest" requirement in section 16(e) of the Tunney Act,
15 U.S.C. 16(e), Congress intended only to ensure that courts
properly exercised the power they already possessed to make an
"independent determination," S. Rep. No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st
Sess. 5 (1973), and did not "rubber stamp" the government's
proposals, H.R. Rep. No. 1463, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1974); see
also 119 Cong. Rec. 3,452 (1973) (statement of Sen. Tunney). But
Congress intended no change in the substantive scope of the
public interest test. See H.R. Rep. No. 1463, supra, at 11
("Preservation of antitrust precedent, rather than innovation in
the usage of the phrase, `public interest,' is, therefore,
unambiguous.").

And pre-Tunney Act law, of which Congress was well aware,
see H.R. Rep. No. 1463, supra, at 11; Antitrust Procedures and
Penalties Act: Hearings on S. 782 and S. 1088 Before the Subcomm.
on Antitrust and Monopolies of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary,
93d Cong., 1st Sess. 147-48 (1973) (testimony of Hon. J. Skelly
Wright) [hereinafter Senate Hearings] (discussing pre-Tunney Act
law); see also United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co. (AT&T),
552 F. Supp. 131, 149 n.74 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd sub. nom.
Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983) (Mem.), is
entirely at odds with the district court's reading of the
statute. It was well established prior to the passage of the
Tunney Act that, because entry of a consent decree is a "judicial
act," United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115 (1932), a
decree's approval required "a determination by the chancellor
that [the proposed decree] is equitable and in the public
interest." E.g., United States v. Radio Corp. of Am., 46 F.
Supp. 654, 655 (D. Del. 1942), appeal dismissed, 318 U.S. 796
(1943). But under this "public interest" inquiry, courts
considered whether the government had acted in good faith,
whether the settlement adequately and reasonably remedied the
violations specifically alleged in the complaint, and whether the
consent decree unnecessarily impaired public policies other than
competition. See, e.g., United States v. Ling-Temco-Vought,
Inc., 315 F. Supp. 1301, 1308-09 (W.D. Pa. 1970); United States
v. CIBA Corp., 50 F.R.D. 507, 513-14 (S.D.N.Y. 1970); United
States v. Carter Prods., Inc., 211 F. Supp. 144, 147-48 (S.D.N.Y.
1962). Consistent with the principles articulated in Heckler and
Nixon, there is no suggestion in pre-Tunney Act opinions that a
court could consider whether the government should have remedied
other practices not challenged in the complaint or violations in
other markets except where necessary to fashion an adequate
remedy for the violations alleged.

Consequently, the legislative history demonstrates
Congress's specific intent to ratify the traditional relationship
between court and prosecutor in antitrust consent-decree cases
when it enacted the Tunney Act. Those portions of the
legislative history relied upon by the district court evidence no
contrary congressional understanding. The district court pointed
to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Wilson's testimony before
the House that the public interest inquiry "`apparently would
encompass not only whether the relief is adequate in view of that
sought in the complaint, but whether the Government sought
appropriate relief in the complaint itself.'" Op. at 26 (quoting
Consent Decree Bills: Hearings on H.R. 9203, H.R. 9947, and S.
782 Before the Subcomm. on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the
House Comm. on the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 87 (1973)
[hereinafter House Hearings]) (J.A. 1219). But even on its face,
this testimony, which mirrors Senate testimony given by Assistant
Attorney General Kauper, see Senate Hearings, supra, at 93,
refers only to the relief sought in the complaint, not to the
scope of the violations challenged. The full context confirms
that Deputy Wilson meant simply that the Act would permit a court
to enquire whether the relief sought in the complaint adequately
remedied the specific anticompetitive conduct alleged, including
whether additional relief should have been included in the
complaint to achieve that objective. See House Hearings, supra,
at 74 (Wilson); Senate Hearings, supra, at 104-07 (Kauper).

Indeed, Congress was aware that the Justice Department and
defendants often file complaints and consent decrees
simultaneously, see, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 1463, supra, at 7,
raising the possibility that the prayer for relief in the
complaint would be drafted to reflect the proposed decree, see,
e.g., Senate Hearings, supra, at 197-99 (statement of Sen.
Tunney). Thus, Congress rejected a proposal that the Act apply
only when the relief obtained in a decree differed from that
prayed for in the complaint. See id. at 176-78, 197-99. But the
legislative history is devoid of suggestion that courts were to
review the Department's decision concerning which violations
should be alleged. On the contrary, Senator Tunney expressly
agreed with Assistant Attorney General Kauper that the judge's
inquiry properly centered on whether the relief was appropriate
to achieve "the goals of the complaint." Senate Hearings, supra,
at 106 (questioning by Sen. Tunney); see also House Hearings,
supra, at 158-59 (comments of Rep. Rodino) (expressing similar
views)./5

In sum, there is no evidence that Congress "clearly
withdrew," Heckler, 470 U.S. at 834, the Justice Department's
discretion to be the sole arbiter of what case to bring and when.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the interpretation of the statute
adopted by the court below has been rejected consistently in
post-
Tunney Act precedent. See, e.g., BNS, 858 F.2d at 462-63
(explaining that, in assessing the antitrust consequences of a
proposed decree, the court may not "`look beyond the strict
relationship between complaint and remedy'" or to "markets other
than those alleged in the government's complaint" (quoting United
States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert.
denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981))); AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150
(explaining that "the Court's determination . . . is concerned
solely with remedies"); see also IBM, 687 F.2d at 601-02 (Tunney
Act does not apply to voluntary dismissal by the government)./6

Although the district court cited AT&T for the proposition
that courts "have considered markets and practices outside the
scope of the complaint," Op. at 26 (J.A. 1219), that case offers
no support for its position that Tunney Act review extends to
violations that the government did not allege. A court may
properly consider other practices and markets when the provisions
of the proposed decree themselves address such practices and
markets. Thus, the proposed decree in AT&T modified an existing
decree so as to permit AT&T to enter a market that the parties
believed previously was foreclosed -- the electronic publishing
market. The district court, therefore, had to consider the
effect of the modification on that market. In making that
assessment, which did not rest on competition considerations, the
court relied on First Amendment concerns, an analysis consistent
with courts' traditional role of ensuring that a decree itself
does not unnecessarily impair other public policies. See AT&T,
552 F. Supp. at 184-85. Nothing in that holding, however,
suggests that, in the absence of decree provisions addressing
practices outside the complaint, Tunney Act review properly
extends to markets or practices outside of the scope of the
government's case except to the extent necessary to remedy the
violations specifically alleged.

To hold otherwise would have serious adverse practical
consequences for the important values and policies furthered by
the traditionally distinct roles of court and prosecutor. Free-
ranging demand for disclosure of government thinking on cases
that the government did not bring plainly would chill future
investigations. And when investigations are opened, the persons
or entities subject to a government probe might suffer
substantial prejudice from judicial scrutiny of practices that
the government has not yet decided to challenge.

The district court's construction of the Tunney Act,
moreover, would have a devastating effect on the government's
ability to obtain consent decrees. Antitrust defendants who
agreed to negotiate would have to be prepared for public
disclosure of the details of the government's investigation,
including information concerning unproven allegations that the
government had decided not to pursue at that time. And the
government would have to accept the possibility that information
about its internal deliberations would be disclosed, including
information about its intentions as to continued investigation or
possible future prosecution of other violations./7 Even if the
court could formulate judicially manageable standards for
reviewing the government's exercise of prosecutorial discretion,
see generally Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831; cf. Maryland v. United
States, 460 U.S. 1001, 1003-06 (1983) (Mem.) (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting), this prospect would "as a practical matter
[eliminate the consent decree] as an antitrust enforcement tool,
despite Congress' directive that it be preserved." AT&T, 552 F.
Supp. at 151 (citing S. Rep. No. 298, supra, at 6; and H.R. Rep.
No. 1463, supra, at 6). Given the importance of consent decrees
in resolving antitrust cases, such a result would seriously
impair antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice.

Accordingly, the district court in this case overstepped
its authority in asserting the right to consider whether the
government should have brought a different case.

C. A District Court Applying the Correct Legal
Standard Would Find That Entry of this Decree Serves
the Public Interest

The district court must approve a proposed
government antitrust consent decree under the Tunney
Act if the "`settlement is within the reaches of the
public interest.'" Triennial Review Opinion, 900 F.2d
at 30 (quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d
660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981)
(internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added by
Court)). In making that determination, the court must
accord substantial deference to the government's
judgments. Thus, the district court's role is not "to
make a de novo determination of facts and issues," but
"to determine whether the Department of Justice's
explanations were reasonable under the circumstances,"
for "[t]he balancing of competing social and political
interests affected by a proposed antitrust decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of
the Attorney General." Triennial Review Remand, 993
F.2d at 1577 (internal quotations omitted).

In particular, the court must defer to the Department
of Justice's assessment of likely competitive consequences. Id.
(citing Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. NRDC, 462 U.S. 87, 103
(1983)). In negotiating a consent decree, the Department must
make judgments as to the effect of the challenged conduct on the
marketplace, and the efficacy of particular remedies to undo the
anticompetitive effects of the violations. The Department also
must make litigation judgments about the costs, delays, risks and
potential benefits of proceeding to trial, weighed against the
potential settlement at hand. See United States v. Armour & Co.,
402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971). This Court has likened the deference
owed the Department of Justice on such issues, which require
judgments within its expertise, to the deference owed an
administrative agency under a "substantial evidence" standard,
with the district court required to defer to the government's
assessment unless the court has "exceptional confidence" that the
government is wrong. See Triennial Review Remand, 993 F.2d at
1577-78.

1. The Government Reasonably Concluded that
the Decree Provides Effective Relief

The record before the district court was more than
sufficient to establish that the proposed decree reflects
eminently reasonable determinations by the government. The
decree, with certainty and without delay, fully stops the
anticompetitive practices. In providing such urgently needed
complete prospective relief, the decree "`effectively pr[ied]
open to competition,'" AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150 (quoting
International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 401
(1947)), the relevant market to the extent that the government
reasonably found (as a practical rather than theoretical matter)
it had been closed by the challenged practices. This conclusion
required entry of the decree.

There is no dispute that for at least a decade Microsoft has
been the dominant supplier of operating systems for IBM-
compatible personal computers, with a market share consistently
above 70% (J.A. 14, 60-61). There is also no dispute that it
achieved its monopoly lawfully by exploiting its position as the
first and, originally, effective provider of operating systems
for IBM-compatible PCs, which quickly became the dominant PCs in
America. As amici themselves explained (J.A. 316-17), and as
Professor Arrow agreed, see Arrow Dec'l at 5-6 (J.A. 722-23),
this software market is characterized by increasing returns and
tends quickly toward a single standard.

Microsoft, however, did not confine itself to legitimate
exploitation of its natural advantages, but maintained its
monopoly through restrictive practices. It introduced "per
processor" contracts for major computer makers. As the complaint
and competitive impact statement explained, these contracts in
effect constituted a tax on the customer's use of any other
operating system (J.A. 17-19, 61-62). Professor Arrow described
them as "artificial barriers to the entry and growth of competing
operating system vendors." Arrow Dec'l at 2 (J.A. 719). These
contracts have the potential to prevent a non-Microsoft operating
system from obtaining a large enough installed base of its own to
reap the benefits of increasing returns and set a new, non-
Microsoft standard (J.A. 16-19, 64, 722-27, 730).

The proposed consent decree secures immediate and complete
prospective relief -- at a time when, with Windows '95 on the
horizon, such relief is urgently needed. The decree addresses
Microsoft's anticompetitive practices with precision, prohibiting
not only the offending conduct, but also other licensing
practices that could be used with similar effect. The decree
flatly prohibits per processor licenses (J.A. 32), and limits
Microsoft to per copy licensing, except for strictly defined per
system licenses (J.A. 32-35). Moreover, because Microsoft
increased the danger of per processor licenses by using them in
long-term contracts with minimum commitments, the decree bans
minimum commitments and prohibits contracts of longer than one-
year duration (with a one-year customer's renewal option) (J.A.
30-31). As Professor Arrow showed, terminating these practices
effectively eliminates the threat to competition they pose,
because that threat derives overwhelmingly from their future, and
not their pre-complaint, impact. See Arrow Dec'l at 11-12 (J.A.
728-29).

In proposing this decree, the government reasonably
concluded that, as a matter of practical reality (as opposed to
some theoretical possibility), there were no provable,
measurable, significant effects of the challenged practices on
Microsoft's installed based that might conceivably be the subject
of a remedy to be obtained after trial. Microsoft's enormous
market share predates the challenged practices and, as Professor
Arrow demonstrated, the subsequent substantial increase in the
absolute size of Microsoft's installed base also results to all
but a minor extent from natural market forces. See Arrow Dec'l
at 11-12 (J.A. 728-29). The challenged contracts, which were not
introduced until 1988, did not cover a majority of Microsoft's
sales to computer manufacturers until FY 1992, and made an
unquantifiable, but likely immaterial, contribution to
Microsoft's installed base prior to the filing of the complaint.
See id. at 11-12 (J.A. 728-29). Thus, it was entirely reasonable
for the government to determine that the real competitive concern
here was the threat to future competition.

At the same time, the government, in framing the decree,
took proper account of the dangers of intervention to override
natural market forces, including those which (as everyone agrees)
tend to create monopolies in markets like the market for PC
operating systems. The decree is thus consistent with Professor
Arrow's admonition against "penalizing market successes that are
not the result of anticompetitive practices," Arrow Dec'l at 10
(J.A. 727), and trying to "pick the winner of [a] dynamic
[market] process," id. at 9 (J.A. 726). Moreover, the decree
leaves the government free to challenge any other Microsoft
conduct in this market or other markets that appears warranted by
the facts in the future./8

The proposed Final Judgment, then, adequately and reasonably
remedies the violations alleged. A district court that showed
the proper deference to the government's findings and judgments
could not find otherwise. The district court's contrary
conclusion rests on fundamental misapprehensions of the record
and relevant legal standard and on a failure to accord the
government any deference.

2. The Court Gave No Legally Sufficient
Reason for Rejecting the Decree

a. The district court's first reason for rejecting the
decree was that the parties did not give it adequate information.
See Op. at 29 (J.A. 1222). Notably, the district court did not
claim any inadequacy in the information regarding the practices
challenged in the complaint. Rather, the court complained of
insufficient information concerning the details of the
government's investigation and its exercise of prosecutorial
discretion with respect to practices not challenged in the
complaint. See id. at 29-31 (J.A. 1222-24). As we have
explained above, see supra pp.13-23, this information was
unnecessary to an assessment of whether the proposed decree
adequately remedied the violation alleged, and so the court had
no authority to demand it. Therefore, the court had no authority
to reject the decree because the government refused to provide
the requested information.

The district court's opinion also suggested that delving
into the Department's investigations and negotiations was
necessary because of the possibility that the government
improperly bargained away its discretion to bring appropriate
antitrust actions in the future. See Op. at 30-31 (J.A. 1223-
24). But, as explained above, the Assistant Attorney General in
charge of the Antitrust Division specifically represented to the
court that no deal, tacit or otherwise, had been struck with
respect to future cases (J.A. 827, 836-38, 846, 950-51), and
Microsoft's Description of Written or Oral Communications, filed
in accordance with section 16(g) of the Act, similarly reveals no
agreement concerning future cases (J.A. 80-82). The court had no
reason to doubt the accuracy of these representations and
therefore no right to demand more information going beyond them.
Accordingly, there was nothing for the district court to review.

b. The court also said that "the decree on its face [is]
too narrow" because it does not cover "all of Microsoft's
commercially marketed operating systems" nor systems yet to be
developed. Op. 31-32 (J.A. 1224-25). To the extent that the
complaint could be construed as encompassing other PC operating
systems, the decree is patently reasonable in focusing on only
the operating systems it identified. The decree reaches all
Microsoft PC operating systems that have a significant share of a
relevant market, (J.A. 65), as well as any Microsoft operating
system marketed as a successor for these operating systems (J.A.
65). Microsoft does sell other operating systems, but, because
they have small market shares, the decree reasonably did not
address them. As for technologically superior systems that may
yet be developed, see Op. at 31-32 & n.25 (J.A. 1224-25),
Professor Arrow opined that the possibility of fast-developing
technology in markets in which Microsoft lacks the natural
advantages from increasing returns offers the greatest likelihood
of ending Microsoft's current monopoly, and that "interference to
pick the winner [of] this dynamic process is likely to be
counterproductive." Arrow Dec'l at 9 (J.A. 726)./9 The court
had no basis for rejecting the government's judgment that a
reasonable antitrust remedy could properly be limited to the
operating systems covered by the proposed decree.

c. The district court also erred in concluding that the
government had failed to show that the decree would "remedy the
unfair advantage Microsoft [had] gained in the market through its
anticompetitive practices" alleged in the complaint. Op. at 33
(J.A. 1226). As we have already explained, see supra p.27,
Professor Arrow concluded that the Microsoft practices actually
challenged in the complaint "did not have a material impact on
the installed base" and hence on Microsoft's maintenance of
monopoly power, Arrow Dec'l at 12 (J.A. 729), and nothing in the
record shows a material impact. The government understood that,
to some unquantifiable extent, these unlawful practices may have
increased Microsoft's installed base. But the government's
judgment was that such an effect was minor and any proof of past
effects would be difficult, given Microsoft's substantial market
power unrelated to the challenged practices. The government also
believed that immediate opening of the market, well before
Microsoft's introduction of Windows '95, was vital (J.A. 62, 693-
94). The government, accordingly, reasonably determined that the
consent decree it obtained was by far the best conclusion to the
case. That judgment was reasonable, and the district court had
no sound basis for not entering the decree. Cf. United States v.
Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 715-16 (D. Mass. 1975) ("The
court is not settling the case. It is determining whether the
settlement achieved is within the reaches of the public interest.
Basically [the court] must look at the overall picture not
hypercritically, nor with a microscope, but with an artist's
reducing glass.").

The court was also obviously dissatisfied with the
government's failure to "address . . . a number of other
anticompetitive practices that from time to time Microsoft has
been accused of engaging in by others in the industry" -- in
particular, "the practice of vaporware," Op. at 35-40 (J.A. 1228-
33), and the absence of a "wall" between Microsoft's operating
systems and applications developers, id. at 15 n.15, 35, 42 &
n.36 (J.A. 1208, 1228, 1235). This criticism too is unsound.

To the extent that the district court's analysis faults the
United States for not including claims involving vaporware or the
absence of a wall, it is wrong as a matter of law. As was
previously explained, the Tunney Act does not authorize a
district court to review that exercise of prosecutorial
discretion. See supra pp.13-23.

To the extent the court thought that a prohibition on
vaporware and the construction of a wall were essential to the
"prying open of the market that has been closed through illegal
restraints," Op. at 39 (J.A. 1232), it failed to accord proper
deference to the government's sound judgments about the remedial
action needed in view of the minor effect the conduct challenged
had in closing the market in the past. See supra p.26. To the
extent the court thought such prohibitions were necessary to
prevent a recurrence of the violations alleged, it again erred.
Vaporware has no connection to any of the licensing practices
alleged in the complaint (except that it is alleged to be engaged
in by Microsoft). Similarly, the presence or absence of a wall
between Microsoft's operating systems and applications developers
is not remotely connected to the violation that the government
charged. The public interest does not require that a decree
enjoin all means by which a defendant might violate the antitrust
laws. See Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386,
410 (1945). The government was well within the reaches of the
public interest in concluding that the important relief it
achieved in the decree -- the immediate termination of every
practice challenged in the complaint along with additional
prophylactic prohibitions -- afforded an effective remedy for the
violations it challenged.

d. Section V of the proposed decree contains compliance
mechanisms that have long been standard in government antitrust
consent decrees./10 The government's choice of these time-tested
compliance mechanisms in this decree was surely reasonable and
within the reaches of the public interest.

The district court's insistence on further compliance
mechanisms also is unsound. The fact that Microsoft did not
admit to wrongdoing obviously troubled the court. See Op. at 41
(J.A. 1234). But no antitrust consent decree entered in the last
25 years contains an admission of violation.

The district court also found support in Judge Greene's
insistence on further compliance mechanisms in the AT&T case.
See Op. at 41 (J.A. 1234). Whatever the merits of that action
(which the United States and AT&T chose not to contest), it is
irrelevant in this vastly different case. As Judge Greene
pointed out, the AT&T settlement involved "the largest, most
complicated divestiture since the passage of the Tunney Act,"
with a decree that contemplated a myriad of requirements for AT&T
and the divested telephone operating companies. AT&T, 552 F.
Supp at 216. Moreover, the district court in that case saw what
it considered troubling conduct by AT&T and the United States in
connection with the consent decree settlement of an earlier
antitrust case. Id. at 135-38. By contrast, in this case there
is no divestiture; the decree only prohibits certain
anticompetitive practices; and the district court expressly
endorsed the government's good faith when it publicly stated
"they [Justice Department] represent the public interest." "They
sure did a heck of a job here, and I think the record should
indicate that" (J.A. 863).

CONCLUSION

The record before the district court amply established that
the proposed Final Judgment was "within the reaches of the public
interest," and the district court's justifications for holding to
the contrary were legally insufficient. Accordingly, the Court
should vacate the district court's Order Re Motion to Approve the
Consent Decree and remand with instructions to enter the proposed
decree. See Triennial Review Remand, 993 F.2d at 1578;
cf. Apache Survival Coalition v. United States,
21 F.3d 895, 906-07 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that when the
district court had abused its discretion by applying the
incorrect laches standard, resolving the laches issue on appeal
was appropriate because further factual development was
unnecessary and doing so furthered judicial economy).

ENDNOTES
_______________________________

     1 See Motion For Expedited Consideration And For Briefing
Schedule 1-7 (Feb. 16, 1995).

     2 The government decided that there was no basis at that
time to file other charges against Microsoft (J.A. 688). It of
course reserves the right to pursue other charges should a basis
for doing so develop (J.A. 688, 696, 836).

     3 The United States also asked the district court not to
accept the Wilson, Sonsini filing, both because it was an
inexcusably late comment and because there was no justification
under the Tunney Act for the refusal to identify the true parties
in interest (J.A. 6, 625- 41). Microsoft also filed an
opposition (J.A. 6, 615-24). The district court, at the same
time it rejected the proposed decree, also accepted the Wilson,
Sonsini filing, as well as an even later opposing amicus filing
by the Computer and Communications Industry Association ("CCIA").
See Op. at 10-17 (J.A. 1192-93, 1203-11). Microsoft, but not the
United States, has appealed from that ruling.

     4 Although in Heckler the Court stated that "Congress may
limit an [administrative] agency's exercise of enforcement power
if it wishes," Heckler, 470 U.S. at 833, the Court indicated that
a more exacting constitutional analysis might apply to
substantive limits placed on the prosecutorial discretion of the
Executive Branch itself, see id. at 832. And, in Morrison v.
Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), the Court, in sustaining the Ethics
in Government Act against a number of constitutional challenges,
placed particular emphasis on the fact that Congress
"specifically prevented [the courts] from reviewing the Attorney
General's decision not to seek appointment [of an independent
counsel]." Id. at 695.

     5 The district court also noted legislative history
indicating that the section 16(e) factors were not meant to be
exhaustive. Slip op. at 25 n.21 (J.A. 1218); accord AT&T, 552 F.
Supp. 149 n.77. But, as explained above, because Congress
intended to codify preexisting law concerning the public interest
inquiry, the fact that the section 16(e) factors are nonexclusive
does not support the court's conclusion that it may inquire into
violations not alleged.

     6 The district court argued that the government's ability
to define the scope of the violations challenged in the complaint
would give it power to control the court's scope of review. See
Op. at 28 (J.A. 1221). But, as this Court has explained, "that
kind of authority is inherent in prosecutorial discretion, and it
is surely late in the day for it to be challenged by a circuit
judge." Ayuda, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 948 F.2d 742, 751 (D.C. Cir.
1991) (citing Heckler), vacated and remanded on other grounds,
113 S. Ct. 3026 (1993), jurisdictional holding readopted, 7 F.3d
246 (D.C. Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 70 (1994).
Indeed, such power is regularly exercised when the government
decides not to bring a case in the first instance or to dismiss a
case voluntarily. See IBM, 687 F.2d at 601-02.

     7 The Act requires certain government disclosures including
a description of the circumstances under which the proposed
decree was formulated and an evaluation of alternative remedies
actually considered. See 15 U.S.C. 16(b). But these disclosures
are limited to the possibility that the government entered into
impermissible side-deals with defendants and whether the
"proposed relief is sufficient with respect to the conduct
alleged in the complaint," S. Rep. No. 298, supra, at 3. As
discussed below, there is no evidence of any inappropriate
agreements to forgo future investigations, see infra p.29, and
the district court did not contend that the government had failed
to comply with section 16(b).

     8 For example, the Department has acknowledged publicly
that it is investigating Microsoft's planned acquisition of
Intuit Corp., a major maker of applications software, to
determine whether the acquisition would violate the antitrust
laws (J.A. 1021-22).

     9 The objective definitional test of Paragraph II(A) of the
decree (J.A. 27) adequately answers the court's "fears [that]
there may be endless debate as to whether a new operating system
is covered by the decree," Op. at 32 (J.A. 1225) -- an
insufficient reason to disapprove the decree in the absence of
such debate.

     10 These mechanisms allow the government to determine
compliance with the decree on reasonable notice and without
resort to legal process; to inspect and copy all Microsoft
documents; to interview any Microsoft employees; and to require
Microsoft to submit written reports under oath. See Decree
V(A)-(B) (J.A. 37-38). Moreover, the decree itself, once
entered, is a permanent injunction, and violations are punishable
by the court's contempt power. See, e.g., United States v.
Western Elec. Co., 1991-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 69,329, at 65,267-69
(D.D.C. Feb. 15, 1991) ($10 million civil penalty for violation
of antitrust consent decree); United States v. Twentieth Century
Fox Film Corp., 882 F.2d 656, 659 (2d Cir. 1989) (criminal
contempt conviction of corporation and employee for violating
antitrust decree) (conviction of corporation vacated), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 1021 (1990).
