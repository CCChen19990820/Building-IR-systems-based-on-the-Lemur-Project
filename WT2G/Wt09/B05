<P>The Court's June 28, 1996, ruling to uphold one section of a 1992 law that permits cable television operators to decide whether to show sexually explicit programs on leased access channels. But the court struck down a provision requiring cable operators who choose to carry indecent programming to have a separate channel for it and to block out the channel until a subscriber requests it in writing, and a separate provision dealing with public, educational and governmental channels. The justices said the two provisions that were struck down violate constitutional free-speech guarantees under the First Amendment.</P>

v.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

No. 95-124.  Argued February 21, 1996-Decided June 28, 1996*

These cases involve three sections of the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Act), as
implemented by Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
regulations. Both Section 10(a) of the Act--which applies to "leased
access channels" reserved under federal law for commercial lease by
parties unaffiliated with the cable television system operator--and
Section 10(c)--which regulates "public access channels" required by
local governments for public, educational, and governmental
programming--essentially permit the operator to allow or prohibit
"programming" that it "reasonably believes . . . depicts sexual . . .
activities or organs in a patently offensive manner."  Under Section
10(b), which applies only to leased access channels, operators are
required to segregate "patently offensive" programming on a single
channel, to block that channel from viewer access, and to unblock it
(or later to reblock it) within 30 days of a subscriber's written
request. Between 1984, when Congress authorized municipalities
to require operators to create public access channels, and the Act's
passage, federal law prohibited operators from exercising any
editorial control over the content of programs broadcast over either
type of access channel. Petitioners sought judicial review of
Sections 10(a), (b), and (c), and the en banc Court of Appeals held
that all three sections (as implemented) were consistent with the First
Amendment.


Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part. 56 F.
3d 105, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Part III, concluding that Section 10(b) violates the First
Amendment. That section's ``segregate and block'' requirements
have obvious speech-restrictive effects for viewers, who cannot
watch programs segregated on the "patently offensive" channel
without considerable advance planning or receive just an occasional
few such programs, and who may judge a program's value through
the company it keeps or refrain from subscribing to the segregated
channel out of fear that the operator will disclose its subscriber list.
Moreover, Section 10(b) is not appropriately tailored to achieve its
basic, legitimate objective of protecting children from exposure to
"patently offensive" materials. Less restrictive means utilized by
Congress elsewhere to protect children from "patently offensive"
sexual material broadcast on cable channels indicate that Section
10(b) is overly restrictive while its benefits are speculative. These
include some provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which utilizes blocking without written request, ``V-chips,'' and
other significantly less restrictive means, and the "lockbox"
requirement that has been in place since the Cable Act of 1984. Pp.
23-30.

JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SOUTER, concluded in Parts I and II
that Section 10(a) is consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 6-23.

(a) Close scrutiny demonstrates that Section 10(a) properly
addresses a serious problem without imposing, in light of the
relevant competing interests, an unnecessarily great restriction on
speech. First, the section comes accompanied with the extremely
important child-protection justification that this Court has often
found compelling. See, e.g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.
FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126. Second, Section 10(a) arises in a very
particular context--congressional permission for cable operators to
regulate programming that, but for a previous Act of Congress,
would have had no path of access to cable channels free of an
operator's control. The First Amendment interests involved are
therefore complex, and require a balance between those interests
served by the access requirements themselves (increasing the
availability of avenues of expression to programmers who otherwise
would not have them), see H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, pp. 31-36
(1984), and the disadvantage to the First Amendment interests of
cable operators and other programmers (those to whom the operator
would have assigned the channels devoted to access). See Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___, ___. Third, the
problem Section 10(a) addresses is analogous to the "indecent" radio
broadcasts at issue in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726,
and the balance Congress struck here is commensurate with the
balance the Court approved in that case. Fourth, Section 10(a)'s
permissive nature means that it likely restricts speech less than, not
more than, the ban at issue in Pacifica. The importance of the
interest at stake here--protecting children from exposure to patently
offensive depictions of sex; the accommodation of the interests of
programmers in maintaining access channels and of cable operators
in editing the contents of their channels; the similarity of the problem
and its solution to those at issue in Pacifica; and the flexibility
inherent in an approach that permits private cable operators to make
editorial decisions, persuasively establishes that Section 10(a) is a
sufficiently tailored response to an extraordinarily important problem
involving a complex balance of interests. Sable, supra, at 128, and
Turner, supra, at ___, distinguished. Pp. 6-18.

(b) Petitioners' reliance on this Court's "public forum" cases is
unavailing. It is unnecessary and unwise to decide whether or how
to apply the public forum doctrine to leased access channels. First,
it is not clear whether that doctrine should be imported wholesale
into common carriage regulation of such a new and changing area.
Second, although limited public forums are permissible, the Court
has not yet determined whether the decision to limit a forum is
necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny, and these cases
do not require that it do so now. Finally, and most important, the
features that make Section 10(a) an acceptable constraint on speech
also make it an acceptable limitation on access to the claimed public
forum. Pp. 18-20.

(c) Section 10(a)'s definition of the materials it regulates is not
impermissibly vague. Because the language used is similar to that
adopted in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24, as a
``guidelin[e]'' for state obscenity laws, it would appear to narrow
cable operators' program-screening authority to materials that
involve the same kind of sexually explicit materials that would be
obscene under Miller, but that might have "serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value" or nonprurient purposes, ibid. That the
definition is not overly broad is further indicated by this Court's
construction of the phrase "patently offensive," see Pacifica, supra,
at 748, 750, which would narrow the category late at night when the
audience is basically adult, and by the fact that Section 10(a) permits
operators to screen programs only pursuant to a "written and
published policy."  The definition's "reasonabl[e] belie[f]" qualifier
seems designed to provide a legal excuse for the operator's honest
mistake, and it constrains the operator's discretion as much as it
protects it. Pp. 20-23.

JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE
SOUTER, concluded in Part IV that Section 10(c) violates the First
Amendment. Section 10(c), although like Section 10(a) a
permissive provision, is different from Section 10(a) for four
reasons. First, cable operators have not historically exercised
editorial control over public access channels, such that Section
10(c)'s restriction on programmers' capacity to speak does not effect
a countervailing removal of a restriction on cable operators' speech.
Second, programming on those channels is normally subject to
complex supervisory systems composed of both public and private
elements, and Section 10(c) is therefore likely less necessary to
protect children. Third, the existence of a system that encourages
and secures programming that the community considers valuable
strongly suggests that a "cable operator's veto" is more likely to
erroneously exclude borderline programs that should be broadcast,
than to achieve the statute's basic objective of protecting children.
Fourth, the Government has not shown that there is a significant
enough problem of patently offensive broadcasts to children, over
public access channels, that justifies the restriction imposed by
Section 10(c). Consequently, Section 10(c) violates the First
Amendment. Pp. 31-37.

JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,
concurred in the judgment that Section 10(c) is invalid, but for
different reasons. Because the public access channels regulated by
Section 10(c) are required by local cable franchise authorities, those
channels are ``designated public forums,'' i.e., property that the
government has opened for expressive activity by the public.
International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.
S. 672, 678. Section 10(c) vests the cable operator with a power
under federal law, defined by reference to the content of speech, to
override the franchise agreement and undercut the public forum the
agreement creates. Where the government thus excludes speech
from a public forum on the basis of its content, the Constitution
requires that the regulation be given the most exacting scrutiny.
See, e.g., ibid. Section 10(c) cannot survive strict scrutiny.
Although Congress has a compelling interest in protecting children
from indecent speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications, 492 U. S.,
at 126, Section 10(c) is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest,
since, among other things, there is no basis in the record
establishing that Section 10(c) is the least restrictive means to
accomplish that purpose. See, e.g., Sable Communications, supra,
at 128-130. The Government's argument for not applying strict
scrutiny here, that indecent cablecasts are subject to the lower
standard of review applied in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.
S. 726, 748, is not persuasive, since that lower standard does not
even apply to infringements on the liberties of cable operators,
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. __, __.
There is less cause for a lower standard when the rights of cable
programmers and viewers are at stake. Pp. 2-5, 12-16, 24-31.

JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE SCALIA,  agreed that Section 10(a) is constitutionally
permissible. Cable operators are generally entitled to much the same
First Amendment protection as the print media. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. __, __, __. Because
Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, and
Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S.
1, are therefore applicable, see Turner, supra, at __ (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the cable operator's
editorial rights have general primacy under the First Amendment
over the rights of programmers to transmit and of viewers to watch.
None of the petitioners are cable operators; they are all cable viewers
or access programmers or their representative organizations.
Because the cable access provisions are part of a scheme that
restricts operators' free speech rights and expands the speaking
opportunities of programmers who have no underlying
constitutional right to speak through the cable medium, the
programmers cannot challenge the scheme, or a particular part of it,
as an abridgment of their "freedom of speech."  Sections 10(a) and
(c) merely restore part of the editorial discretion an operator would
have absent Government regulation. Pp. 1-15.

STEVENS, O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, SOUTER, and
GINSBURG, JJ., joined, an opinion with respect to Parts I, II, and

in part and dissenting in part. KENNEDY, J., filed an opinion
concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]


JUSTICE BREYER announced the judgment of the Court and
delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III, an
opinion with respect to Parts I, II, and V, in which JUSTICE
STEVENS, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SOUTER join,
and an opinion with respect to Parts IV and VI, in which JUSTICE
STEVENS and JUSTICE SOUTER join.

These cases present First Amendment challenges to three statutory
provisions that seek to regulate the broadcasting of "patently
offensive" sex-related material on cable television. Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Act or
Act), 106 Stat. 1486, Sections 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c), 47 U. S. C.
Sections 532(h), 532(j), and note following Section 531. The
provisions apply to programs broadcast over cable on what are
known as "leased access channels" and "public, educational, or
governmental channels."  Two of the provisions essentially permit a
cable system operator to prohibit the broadcasting of "programming"
that the "operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner." 1992
Act, Section 10(a); see Section 10(c). See also In re Implementation
of Section 10 of the Cable Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992: Indecent Programming and Other Types of Materials
on Cable Access Channels, First Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd 998
(1993) (First Report and Order); In re Implementation of Section 10
of the Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,
Indecent Programming and Other Types of Materials on Cable
Access Channels, Second Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd 2638
(1993) (Second Report and Order). The remaining provision
requires cable system operators to segregate certain "patently
offensive" programming, to place it on a single channel, and to
block that channel from viewer access unless the viewer requests
access in advance and in writing. 1992 Act, Section 10(b); 47 CFR
Section 76.701(g) (1995).

We conclude that the first provision--that permits the operator to
decide whether or not to broadcast such programs on leased access
channels--is consistent with the First Amendment. The second
provision, that requires leased channel operators to segregate and to
block that programming, and the third provision, applicable to
public, educational, and governmental channels, violate the First
Amendment, for they are not appropriately tailored to achieve the
basic, legitimate objective of protecting children from exposure to
"patently offensive" material.



Cable operators typically own a physical cable network used to
convey programming over several dozen cable channels into
subscribers' houses. Program sources vary from channel to
channel. Most channels carry programming produced by
independent firms, including "many national and regional cable
programming networks that have emerged in recent years,"  Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994)
(slip op., at 3), as well as some programming that the system
operator itself (or an operator affiliate) may provide. Other channels
may simply retransmit through cable the signals of over-the-air
broadcast stations. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3-4). Certain special
channels here at issue, called "leased channels" and "public,
educational, or governmental channels," carry programs provided
by those to whom the law gives special cable system access rights.

A "leased channel" is a channel that federal law requires a cable
system operator to reserve for commercial lease by unaffiliated third
parties. About 10 to 15 percent of a cable system's channels would
typically fall into this category. See 47 U. S. C. Section 532(b).
"[P]ublic, educational, or governmental channels" (which we shall
call "public access" channels) are channels that, over the years, local
governments have required cable system operators to set aside for
public, educational, or governmental purposes as part of the
consideration an operator gives in return for permission to install
cables under city streets and to use public rights-of-way. See
Section 531; see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, p. 30 (1984)
(authorizing local authorities to require creation of public access
channels). Between 1984 and 1992 federal law (as had much pre-
1984 state law, in respect to public access channels) prohibited cable
system operators from exercising any editorial control over the
content of any program broadcast over either leased or public access
channels. See 47 U. S. C. Sections 531(e) (public access),
532(c)(2) (leased access).

In 1992, in an effort to control sexually explicit programming
conveyed over access channels, Congress enacted the three
provisions before us. The first two provisions relate to leased
channels. The first says:

"This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce
prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting
programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes
or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards."  1992 Act, Section 10(a)(2), 106 Stat. 1486.

The second provision applicable only to leased channels requires
cable operators to segregate and to block similar programming if
they decide to permit, rather than to prohibit, its broadcast. The
provision tells the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or
Commission) to promulgate regulations that will (a) require
"programmers to inform cable operators if the program[ming] would
be indecent as defined by Commission regulations"; (b) require
"cable operators to place" such material "on a single channel"; and
(c) require "cable operators to block such single channel unless the
subscriber requests access to such channel in writing."  1992 Act,
Section 10(b)(1). The Commission issued regulations defining the
material at issue in terms virtually identical to those we have already
set forth, namely as descriptions or depictions of "sexual or
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner" as
measured by the cable viewing community. First Report and Order,
Paragraphs 33-38, 8 FCC Rcd, at 1003-1004. The regulations
require the cable operators to place this material on a single channel
and to block it (say, by scrambling). They also require the system
operator to provide access to the blocked channel "within 30 days"
of a subscriber's written request for access and to re-block it within
30 days of a subscriber's request to do so. 47 CFR Section
76.701(c) (1995).

The third provision is similar to the first provision, but applies only
to public access channels. The relevant statutory section instructs
the FCC to promulgate regulations that will

"enable a cable operator of a cable system to prohibit the use, on
such system, of any channel capacity of any public, educational, or
governmental access facility for any programming which contains
obscene material, sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting or
promoting unlawful conduct."  1992 Act, Section 10(c), ibid.

The FCC, carrying out this statutory instruction, promulgated
regulations defining "sexually explicit" in language almost identical
to that in the statute's leased channel provision, namely as
descriptions or depictions of "sexual or excretory activities or organs
in a patently offensive manner" as measured by the cable viewing
community. See 47 CFR Section 76.702 (1995) (incorporating
definition from 47 CFR Section 76.701(g)).

The upshot is, as we said at the beginning, that the federal law
before us (the statute as implemented through regulations) now
permits cable operators either to allow or to forbid the transmission
of "patently offensive" sex-related materials over both leased and
public access channels, and requires those operators, at a minimum,
to segregate and to block transmission of that same material on
leased channels.

Petitioners, claiming that the three statutory provisions, as
implemented by the Commission regulations, violate the First
Amendment, sought judicial review of the Commission's First
Report and Order and its Second Report and Order in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A
panel of that Circuit agreed with petitioners that the provisions
violated the First Amendment. Alliance for Community Media v.
FCC, 10 F. 3d 812 (1993). The entire Court of Appeals, however,
heard the case en banc and reached the opposite conclusion. It held
all three statutory provisions (as implemented) were consistent with
the First Amendment. Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56
F. 3d 105 (1995). Four of the eleven en banc appeals court judges
dissented. Two of the dissenting judges concluded that all three
provisions violated the First Amendment. Two others thought that
either one, or two, but not all three of the provisions, violated the
First Amendment. We granted certiorari to review the en banc
Court's First Amendment determinations.



We turn initially to the provision that permits cable system operators
to prohibit "patently offensive" (or "indecent") programming
transmitted over leased access channels. 1992 Act, Section 10(a).
The Court of Appeals held that this provision did not violate the
First Amendment because the First Amendment prohibits only
"Congress" (and, through the Fourteenth Amendment, a "State"),
not private individuals, from "abridging the freedom of speech."
Although the court said that it found no "state action," 56 F. 3d, at
113, it could not have meant that phrase literally, for, of course,
petitioners attack (as "abridg[ing] . . . speech") a congressional
statute--which, by definition, is an Act of "Congress." More likely,
the court viewed this statute's "permissive" provisions as not
themselves restricting speech, but, rather, as simply reaffirming the
authority to pick and choose programming that a private entity, say,
a private broadcaster, would have had in the absence of intervention
by any federal, or local, governmental entity.

We recognize that the First Amendment, the terms of which apply to
governmental action, ordinarily does not itself throw into
constitutional doubt the decisions of private citizens to permit, or to
restrict, speech--and this is so ordinarily even where those decisions
take place within the framework of a regulatory regime such as
broadcasting. Were that not so, courts might have to face the
difficult, and potentially restrictive, practical task of deciding which,
among any number of private parties involved in providing a
program (for example, networks, station owners, program editors,
and program producers), is the "speaker" whose rights may not be
abridged, and who is the speech-restricting "censor."  Furthermore,
as this Court has held, the editorial function itself is an aspect of
"speech," see Turner, 512 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11-12), and a
court's decision that a private party, say, the station owner, is a
"censor," could itself interfere with that private "censor's" freedom
to speak as an editor. Thus, not surprisingly, this Court's First
Amendment broadcasting cases have dealt with governmental efforts
to restrict, not governmental efforts to provide or to maintain, a
broadcaster's freedom to pick and to choose programming.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National
Committee, 412 U. S. 94 (1973) (striking restrictions on
broadcaster's ability to refuse to carry political advertising);  Red
Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969) (upholding
restrictions on editorial authority); FCC v. League of Women Voters
of Cal., 468 U. S. 364 (1984) (striking restrictions); cf.
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.
Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980) (striking ban on political speech by public
utility using its billing envelopes as a broadcast medium); Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557 (1980) (striking restriction on public utility advertising).

Nonetheless, petitioners, while conceding that this is ordinarily so,
point to circumstances that, in their view, make the analogy with
private broadcasters inapposite and make this case a special one,
warranting a different constitutional result. As a practical matter,
they say, cable system operators have considerably more power to
"censor" program viewing than do broadcasters, for individual
communities typically have only one cable system, linking
broadcasters and other program providers with each community's
many subscribers. See Turner, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8) (only
one cable system in most communities; nationally more than 60% of
homes subscribe to cable, which then becomes the primary or sole
source of video programming in the overwhelming majority of these
homes). Moreover, concern about system operators' exercise of
this considerable power originally led government--local and
federal--to insist that operators provide leased and public access
channels free of operator editorial control. H. R. Rep. No. 98-934,
at 30-31. To permit system operators to supervise programming on
leased access channels will create the very private-censorship risk
that this anticensorship effort sought to avoid. At the same time,
petitioners add, cable systems have two relevant special
characteristics. They are unusually involved with government, for
they depend upon government permission and government facilities
(streets, rights-of-way) to string the cable necessary for their
services. And in respect to leased channels, their speech interests
are relatively weak because they act less like editors, such as
newspapers or television broadcasters, than like common carriers,
such as telephone companies.

Under these circumstances, petitioners conclude, Congress'
"permissive" law, in actuality, will "abridge" their free speech. And
this Court should treat that law as a congressionally imposed,
content-based, restriction unredeemed as a properly tailored effort to
serve a "compelling interest."  See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118
(1991); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S.
115, 126 (1989). They further analogize the provisions to
constitutionally forbidden content-based restrictions upon speech
taking place in "public forums" such as public streets, parks, or
buildings dedicated to open speech and communication. See
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.
788, 802 (1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983); see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, supra, at
30 (identifying public access channels as the electronic equivalent of
a "speaker's soap box"). And, finally, petitioners say that the legal
standard the law contains (the "patently offensive" standard) is
unconstitutionally vague. See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v.
Dallas, 390 U. S. 676 (1968) (rejecting censorship ordinance as
vague, even though it was intended to protect children).

Like the petitioners, JUSTICES KENNEDY and THOMAS would
have us decide this case simply by transferring and applying literally
categorical standards this Court has developed in other contexts.
For JUSTICE KENNEDY, leased access channels are like a
common carrier, cablecast is a protected medium, strict scrutiny
applies, Section 10(a) fails this test, and, therefore, Section 10(a) is
invalid. Post, at 17-20, 27-30. For JUSTICE THOMAS, the case
is simple because the cable operator who owns the system over
which access channels are broadcast, like a bookstore owner with
respect to what it displays on the shelves, has a predominant First
Amendment interest. Post, at 6-7, 12-13. Both categorical
approaches suffer from the same flaws: they import law developed
in very different contexts into a new and changing environment, and
they lack the flexibility necessary to allow government to respond to
very serious practical problems without sacrificing the free exchange
of ideas the First Amendment is designed to protect.

The history of this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence,
however, is one of continual development, as the Constitution's
general command that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press," has been applied to new
circumstances requiring different adaptations of prior principles and
precedents. The essence of that protection is that Congress may not
regulate speech except in cases of extraordinary need and with the
exercise of a degree of care that we have not elsewhere required.
See, e.g., Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, 51-52 (1919);
Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 627-628 (1919) (Holmes,
J., dissenting); West Viginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,
639 (1943); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 418-420 (1989). At
the same time, our cases have not left Congress or the States
powerless to address the most serious problems. See, e.g.,
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942); Young v.
American Mini Theaters, Inc. 427 U. S. 50 (1976); FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978).

Over the years, this Court has restated and refined these basic First
Amendment principles, adopting them more particularly to the
balance of competing interests and the special circumstances of each
field of application. See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254 (1964) (allowing criticism of public officials to be
regulated by civil libel only if the plaintiff shows actual malice);
Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (allowing
greater regulation of speech harming individuals who are not public
officials, but still requiring a negligence standard); Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969) (employing highly
flexible standard in response to the scarcity problem unique to over-
the-air broadcast); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U. S. 221, 231-232 (1987) (requiring "compelling state interest"
and a "narrowly drawn" means in context of differential taxation of
media); Sable, supra, at 126, 131 (applying "compelling interest,"
"least restrictive means," and "narrowly tailored" requirements to
indecent telephone communications); Turner, 512 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 16) (using "heightened scrutiny" to address content-neutral
regulations of cable system broadcasts); Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp., 447 U. S., at 566 (restriction on commercial speech
cannot be "more extensive than is necessary" to serve a "substantial"
government interest).

This tradition teaches that the First Amendment embodies an
overarching commitment to protect speech from Government
regulation through close judicial scrutiny, thereby enforcing the
Constitution's constraints, but without imposing judicial formulae
so rigid that they become a straightjacket that disables Government
from responding to serious problems. This Court, in different
contexts, has consistently held that the Government may directly
regulate speech to address extraordinary problems, where its
regulations are appropriately tailored to resolve those problems
without imposing an unnecessarily great restriction on speech.
JUSTICES KENNEDY AND THOMAS would have us further
declare which, among the many applications of the general approach
that this Court has developed over the years, we are applying here.
But no definitive choice among competing analogies (broadcast,
common carrier, bookstore) allows us to declare a rigid single
standard, good for now and for all future media and purposes. That
is not to say that we reject all the more specific formulations of the
standard--they appropriately cover the vast majority of cases
involving Government regulation of speech. Rather, aware as we
are of the changes taking place in the law, the technology, and the
industrial structure, related to telecommunications, see, e.g.,
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56; S. Rep. No. 104-23
(1995); H. R. Rep. No. 104-204 (1995), we believe it unwise and
unnecessary definitively to pick one analogy or one specific set of
words now. See Columbia Broadcasting, 412 U. S., at 102 ("The
problems of regulation are rendered more difficult because the
broadcast industry is dynamic in terms of technological change;
solutions adequate a decade ago are not necessarily so now, and
those acceptable today may well be outmoded 10 years hence");
Pacifica, supra, at 748 ("We have long recognized that each medium
of expression presents special First Amendment problems.") We
therefore think it premature to answer the broad questions that
JUSTICES KENNEDY AND THOMAS raise in their efforts to find
a definitive analogy, deciding, for example, the extent to which
private property can be designated a public forum, compare post, at
14-16 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),
with post, at 15-19 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part and concurring
in judgment); whether public access channels are a public forum,
post, at 12-13 (KENNEDY J.); whether the Government's
viewpoint neutral decision to limit a public forum is subject to the
same scrutiny as a selective exclusion from a pre-existing public
forum, post, at 20-25 (KENNEDY, J.); whether exclusion from
common carriage must for all purposes be treated like exclusion
from a public forum, post, at 18-19 (KENNEDY, J.); and whether
the interests of the owners of communications media always
subordinate the interests of all other users of a medium, post, at 6-7
(THOMAS, J.).

Rather than decide these issues, we can decide this case more
narrowly, by closely scrutinizing Section 10(a) to assure that it
properly addresses an extremely important problem, without
imposing, in light of the relevant interests, an unnecessarily great
restriction on speech. The importance of the interest at stake here--
protecting children from exposure to patently offensive depictions of
sex; the accommodation of the interests of programmers in
maintaining access channels and of cable operators in editing the
contents of their channels; the similarity of the problem and its
solution to those at issue in Pacifica, supra; and the flexibility
inherent in an approach that permits private cable operators to make
editorial decisions, lead us to conclude that Section 10(a) is a
sufficiently tailored response to an extraordinarily important
problem.

First, the provision before us comes accompanied with an extremely
important justification, one that this Court has often found
compelling--the need to protect children from exposure to patently
offensive sex-related material. Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at
126; Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639-640 (1968); New
York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 756-757 (1982).

Second, the provision arises in a very particular context--
congressional permission for cable operators to regulate
programming that, but for a previous Act of Congress, would have
had no path of access to cable channels free of an operator's control.
The First Amendment interests involved are therefore complex, and
involve a balance between those interests served by the access
requirements themselves (increasing the availability of avenues of
expression to programmers who otherwise would not have them),
H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, pp. 31-36 (1984), and the disadvantage to
the First Amendment interests of cable operators and other
programmers (those to whom the cable operator would have
assigned the channels devoted to access). See Turner, 512 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 11-12).

Third, the problem Congress addressed here is remarkably similar to
the problem addressed by the FCC in Pacifica, and the balance
Congress struck is commensurate with the balance we approved
there. In Pacifica this Court considered a governmental ban of a
radio broadcast of "indecent" materials, defined in part, like the
provisions before us, to include

"`language that describes, in terms patently offensive as measured
by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium,
sexual or excretory activities and organs, at times of the day when
there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.'"  438
U. S., at 732 (quoting 56 F. C. C. 2d 94, 98 (1975)).

The Court found this ban constitutionally permissible primarily
because "broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children" and
children were likely listeners to the program there at issue--an
afternoon radio broadcast. Id., at 749-750. In addition, the Court
wrote, "the broadcast media have established a uniquely pervasive
presence in the lives of all Americans," id., at 748, "[p]atently
offensive, indecent material . . . confronts the citizen, not only in
public, but also in the privacy of the home," generally without
sufficient prior warning to allow the recipient to avert his or her eyes
or ears, ibid.; and "[a]dults who feel the need may purchase tapes
and records or go to theaters and nightclubs" to hear similar
performances. Id., at 750, n. 28.

All these factors are present here. Cable television broadcasting,
including access channel broadcasting, is as "accessible to children"
as over-the-air broadcasting, if not more so. See Heeter,
Greenberg, Baldwin, Paugh, Srigley, & Atkin, Parental Influences
on Viewing Style, in Cableviewing 140 (C. Heeter & B. Greenberg
eds. 1988) (children spend more time watching television and view
more channels than do their parents, whether their household
subscribes to cable or receives television over the air). Cable
television systems, including access channels, "have established a
uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans."  Pacifica,
supra, at 748. See Jost, The Future of Television, 4 The CQ
Researcher 1131, 1146 (Dec. 23, 1994) (63% of American homes
subscribe to cable); Greenberg, Heeter, D'Alessio, & Sipes, Cable
and Noncable Viewing Style Comparisons, in Cableviewing, at 207
(cable households spend more of their day, on average, watching
television, and will watch more channels, than households without
cable service). "Patently offensive" material from these stations can
"confron[t] the citizen" in the "privacy of the home," Pacifica,
supra, at 748, with little or no prior warning. Cableviewing, at 217-
218 (while cable subscribers tend to use guides more than do
broadcast viewers, there was no difference among these groups in
the amount of viewing that was planned, and, in fact, cable
subscribers tended to sample more channels before settling on a
program, thereby making them more, not less, susceptible to
random exposure to unwanted materials). There is nothing to stop
"adults who feel the need" from finding similar programming
elsewhere, say, on tape or in theaters. In fact, the power of cable
systems to control home program viewing is not absolute. Over-
the-air broadcasting and direct broadcast satellites already provide
alternative ways for programmers to reach the home, and are likely
to do so to a greater extent in the near future. See generally
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, Sections 201
(advanced television services), 205 (direct broadcast satellite), 302
(video programming by telephone companies), and 304 (availability
of navigation devices to enhance multichannel programming); L.
Johnson, Toward Competition in Cable Television (1994).

Fourth, the permissive nature of Section 10(a) means that it likely
restricts speech less than, not more than, the ban at issue in Pacifica.
The provision removes a restriction as to some speakers--namely,
cable operators. See supra, at 13. Moreover, although the provision
does create a risk that a program will not appear, that risk is not the
same as the certainty that accompanies a governmental ban. In fact,
a glance at the programming that cable operators allow on their own
(nonaccess) channels suggests that this distinction is not theoretical,
but real. See App. 393 (regular channel broadcast of Playboy and
"Real Sex" programming). Finally, the provision's permissive
nature brings with it a flexibility that allows cable operators, for
example, not to ban broadcasts, but, say, to rearrange broadcast
times, better to fit the desires of adult audiences while lessening the
risks of harm to children. See First Report and Order Paragraph 31,
8 FCC Rcd, at 1003 (interpreting the Act's provisions to allow cable
operators broad discretion over what to do with offensive materials).
In all these respects, the permissive nature of the approach taken by
Congress renders this measure appropriate as a means of achieving
the underlying purpose of protecting children.


Of course, cable system operators may not always rearrange or
reschedule patently offensive programming. Sometimes, as
petitioners fear, they may ban the programming instead. But the
same may be said of Pacifica's ban. In practice, the FCC's daytime
broadcast ban could have become a total ban, depending upon how
private operators (programmers, station owners, networks)
responded to it. They would have had to decide whether to
reschedule the daytime show for nighttime broadcast in light of
comparative audience demand and a host of other practical factors
that similarly would determine the practical outcomes of the
provisions before us. The upshot, in both cases, must be
uncertainty as to practical consequences--of the governmental ban in
the one case and of the permission in the other. That common
uncertainty makes it difficult to say the provision here is, in any
respect, more restrictive than the order in Pacifica. At the same
time, in the respects we discussed, the provision is significantly less
restrictive.

The existence of this complex balance of interests persuades us that
the permissive nature of the provision, coupled with its viewpoint-
neutral application, is a constitutionally permissible way to protect
children from the type of sexual material that concerned Congress,
while accommodating both the First Amendment interests served by
the access requirements and those served in restoring to cable
operators a degree of the editorial control that Congress removed in
1984.

Our basic disagreement with JUSTICE KENNEDY is narrow. Like
him, we believe that we must scrutinize Section 10(a) with the
greatest care. Like JUSTICES KENNEDY and THOMAS, we
believe that the interest of protecting children that Section 10(a)
purports to serve is compelling. But we part company with
JUSTICE KENNEDY on two issues. First, JUSTICE
KENNEDY'S focus on categorical analysis forces him to disregard
the cable system operators' interests. Post, at 27-28. We, on the
other hand, recognize that in the context of cable broadcast that
involves an access requirement (here, its partial removal), and unlike
in most cases where we have explicitly required "narrow tailoring,"
the expressive interests of cable operators do play a legitimate role.
Cf. Turner, 512 U. S., at __-__ (slip op., at 11-12). While we
cannot agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that everything turns on the
rights of the cable owner, see post, at 12-13, we also cannot agree
with JUSTICE KENNEDY that we must ignore the expressive
interests of cable operators altogether. Second, JUSTICE
KENNEDY'S application of a very strict "narrow tailoring" test
depends upon an analogy with a category ("the public forum
cases"), which has been distilled over time from the similarities of
many cases. Rather than seeking an analogy to a category of cases,
however, we have looked to the cases themselves. And, as we have
said, we found that Pacifica provides the closest analogy and lends
considerable support to our conclusion.

Petitioners and JUSTICE KENNEDY, see post, at 19, 25, argue
that the opposite result is required by two other cases: Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989), a
case in which this Court found unconstitutional a statute that banned
"indecent" telephone messages, and Turner, in which this Court
stated that cable broadcast receives full First Amendment protection.
See Turner, supra, at __ (slip op., at 12-16). The ban at issue in
Sable, however, was not only a total governmentally imposed ban
on a category of communications, but also involved a
communications medium, telephone service, that was significantly
less likely to expose children to the banned material, was less
intrusive, and allowed for significantly more control over what
comes into the home than either broadcasting or the cable
transmission system before us. See 492 U. S., at 128. The Court's
distinction in Turner, furthermore, between cable and broadcast
television, relied on the inapplicability of the spectrum scarcity
problem to cable. See 512 U. S., at ___, (slip op., at 12-16).
While that distinction was relevant in Turner to the justification for
structural regulations at issue there (the "must carry" rules), it has
little to do with a case that involves the effects of television viewing
on children. Those effects are the result of how parents and children
view television programming, and how pervasive and intrusive that
programming is. In that respect, cable and broadcast television
differ little, if at all. See supra, at 14-15. JUSTICE KENNEDY
would have us decide that all common carriage exclusions are
subject to the highest scrutiny, see post, at 18-21, and then decide
the case on the basis of categories that provide imprecise analogies
rather than on the basis of a more contextual assessment, consistent
with our First Amendment tradition, of assessing whether Congress
carefully and appropriately addressed a serious problem.

The petitioners also rely on this Court's "public forum" cases. They
point to Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.
S., at 45, a case in which this Court said that "public forums" are
"places" that the government "has opened for use by the public as a
place for expressive activity," or which "by long tradition . . . have
been devoted to assembly and debate."  Id., at 45. See also
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.,
at 801 (assuming public forums may include "private property
dedicated to public use"). They add that the government cannot
"enforce a content-based exclusion" from a public forum unless
"necessary to serve a compelling state interest" and "narrowly
drawn."  Perry, supra, at 45. They further argue that the statute's
permissive provisions unjustifiably exclude material, on the basis of
content, from the "public forum" that the government has created in
the form of access channels. JUSTICE KENNEDY adds by
analogy that the decision to exclude certain content from common
carriage is similarly subject to strict scrutiny, and here does not
satisfy that standard of review. See post, at 18-21.

For three reasons, however, it is unnecessary, indeed, unwise, for
us definitively to decide whether or how to apply the public forum
doctrine to leased access channels. First, while it may be that
content-based exclusions from the right to use common carriers
could violate the First Amendment, see post, at 18-21 (KENNEDY,
J.), it is not at all clear that the public forum doctrine should be
imported wholesale into the area of common carriage regulation. As
discussed above, we are wary of the notion that a partial analogy in
one context, for which we have developed doctrines, can compel a
full range of decisions in such a new and changing area. See supra,
at 9-12. Second, it is plain from this Court's cases that a public
forum "may be created for a limited purpose."  Perry, supra, at 46,
n. 7; see also Cornelius, supra, at 802 ("[T]he government `is not
required to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility'")
(quoting Perry, supra, at 46). Our cases have not yet determined,
however, that the Government's decision to dedicate a public forum
to one type of content or another is necessarily subject to the highest
level of scrutiny. Must a local government, for example, show a
compelling state interest if it builds a band shell in the park and
dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is
not obvious. Cf. Perry, supra, at 46, n. 7. But, at a minimum, this
case does not require us to answer it. Finally, and most important,
the effects of Congress' decision on the interests of programmers,
viewers, cable operators, and children are the same, whether we
characterize Congress' decision as one that limits access to a public
forum, discriminates in common carriage, or constrains speech
because of its content. If we consider this particular limitation of
indecent television programming acceptable as a constraint on
speech, we must no less accept the limitation it places on access to
the claimed public forum or on use of a common carrier.

Consequently, if one wishes to view the permissive provisions
before us through a "public forum" lens, one should view those
provisions as limiting the otherwise totally open nature of the forum
that leased access channels provide for communication of other than
patently offensive sexual material--taking account of the fact that the
limitation was imposed in light of experience gained from
maintaining a totally open "forum."  One must still ask whether the
First Amendment forbids the limitation. But unless a label alone
were to make a critical First Amendment difference (and we think
here it does not), the features of this case that we have already
discussed--the government's interest in protecting children, the
"permissive" aspect of the statute, and the nature of the medium--
sufficiently justify the "limitation" on the availability of this forum.

Finally, petitioners argue that the definition of the materials subject
to the challenged provisions is too vague, thereby granting cable
system operators too broad a program-screening authority. Cf.
Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S.
489, 498 (1982) (citing Grayned v. Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-
109 (1972)) (vague laws may lead to arbitrary enforcement);
Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486-487 (1965)
(uncertainty may perniciously chill speech). That definition,
however, uses language similar to language previously used by this
Court for roughly similar purposes.

The provisions, as augmented by FCC regulations, permit cable
system operators to prohibit

"programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes
or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards."  1992 Act, Section 10(a), 106 Stat. 1486.

See also 47 CFR Section 76.702 (1995) (reading approximately the
same definition into Section 10(c)). This language is similar to
language adopted by this Court in Miller v. California, 413 U. S.
15, 24 (1973) as a "guidelin[e]" for identifying materials that states
may constitutionally regulate as obscene. In Miller, the Court
defined obscene sexual material (material that lacks First
Amendment protection) in terms of

"(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community
standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest . . . ; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a
patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the
applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole,
lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."  Ibid.
(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).

The language, while vague, attempts to identify the category of
materials that Justice Stewart thought could be described only in
terms of "I know it when I see it." Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S.
184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). In Section 10(a) and the
FCC regulations, without Miller's qualifiers, the language would
seem to refer to material that would be offensive enough to fall
within that category but for the fact that the material also has
"serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value" or nonprurient
purposes.

This history suggests that the statute's language aims at the kind of
programming to which its sponsors referred--pictures of oral sex,
bestiality, and rape, see 138 Cong. Rec. S642, S646 (Jan. 30,
1992) (statement of Sen. Helms)--and not at scientific or educational
programs (at least unless done with a highly unusual lack of concern
for viewer reaction). Moreover, as this Court pointed out in
Pacifica, what is "patently offensive" depends on context (the kind
of program on which it appears), degree (not "an occasional
expletive"), and time of broadcast (a "pig" is offensive in "the
parlor" but not the "barnyard"). 438 U. S., at 748, 750.
Programming at two o'clock in the morning is seen by a basically
adult audience and the "patently offensive" must be defined with that
fact in mind.

Further, the statute protects against overly broad application of its
standards insofar as it permits cable system operators to screen
programs only pursuant to a "written and published policy."  1992
Act, Section 10(a), 106 Stat. 1486. A cable system operator would
find it difficult to show that a leased access program prohibition
reflects a rational "policy" if the operator permits similarly
"offensive" programming to run elsewhere on its system at
comparable times or in comparable ways. We concede that the
statute's protection against overly broad application is somewhat
diminished by the fact that it permits a cable operator to ban
programming that the operator "reasonably believes" is patently
offensive. Ibid. (emphasis added). But the "reasonabl[e] belie[f]"
qualifier here, as elsewhere in the law, seems designed not to
expand the category at which the law aims, but, rather, to provide a
legal excuse, for (at least) one honest mistake, from liability that
might otherwise attach. Cf. Waters v. Churchill, 511 U. S. ___,
___ (1994) (slip op., at 1) (SOUTER, J., concurring) (public
employer's reasonable belief that employee engaged in unprotected
speech excuses liability); United States v. United States Gypsum
Co., 438 U. S. 422, 453-455, and n. 29 (1978) ("`meeting
competition'" defense in antitrust based on reasonable belief in the
necessity to meet competition); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555-
557 (1967) (police officer has defense to constitutional claim, as did
officers of the peace at common law in actions for false arrest, when
the officer reasonably believed the statute whose violation
precipitated the arrest was valid). And the contours of the shield--
reasonableness--constrain the discretion of the cable operator as
much as they protect it. If, for example, a court had already found
substantially similar programming to be beyond the pale of "patently
offensive" material, or if a local authority overseeing the local
public, governmental, or educational channels had indicated that
materials of the type that the cable operator decides to ban were not
"patently offensive" in that community, then the cable operator
would be hard pressed to claim that the exclusion of the material was
"reasonable."  We conclude that the statute is not impermissibly
vague.

For the reasons discussed, we conclude that Section 10(a) is
consistent with the First Amendment.


The statute's second provision significantly differs from the first,
for it does not simply permit, but rather requires, cable system
operators to restrict speech--by segregating and blocking "patently
offensive" sex-related material appearing on leased channels (but not
on other channels). 1992 Act, Section 10(b). In particular, as
previously mentioned, see supra, at 4-5, this provision and its
implementing regulations require cable system operators to place
"patently offensive" leased channel programming on a separate
channel; to block that channel; to unblock the channel within 30 days
of a subscriber's written request for access; and to reblock the
channel within 30 days of a subscriber's request for reblocking.
1992 Act, Section 10(b); 47 CFR Sections 76.701(b), (c), (g)
(1995). Also, leased channel programmers must notify cable
operators of an intended "patently offensive" broadcast up to 30
days before its scheduled broadcast date. Sections 76.701(d), (g).

These requirements have obvious restrictive effects. The several up-
to-30-day delays, along with single channel segregation, mean that a
subscriber cannot decide to watch a single program without
considerable advance planning and without letting the "patently
offensive" channel in its entirety invade his household for days,
perhaps weeks, at a time. These restrictions will prevent
programmers from broadcasting to viewers who select programs
day by day (or, through "surfing," minute by minute); to viewers
who would like occasionally to watch a few, but not many, of the
programs on the "patently offensive" channel; and to viewers who
simply tend to judge a program's value through channel reputation,
i.e., by the company it keeps. Moreover, the "written notice"
requirement will further restrict viewing by subscribers who fear for
their reputations should the operator, advertently or inadvertently,
disclose the list of those who wish to watch the "patently offensive"
channel. Cf. Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301, 307
(1965) (finding unconstitutional a requirement that recipients of
Communist literature notify the Post Office that they wish to receive
it). Further, the added costs and burdens that these requirements
impose upon a cable system operator may encourage that operator to
ban programming that the operator would otherwise permit to run,
even if only late at night.

The Government argues that, despite these adverse consequences,
the "segregate and block" requirements are lawful because they are
"the least restrictive means of realizing" a "compelling interest,"
namely "protecting the physical and psychological well-being of
minors."  See Brief for Federal Respondents 11 (quoting Sable, 492
U. S., at 126). It adds that, in any event, the First Amendment, as
applied in Pacifica, "does not require that regulations of indecency
on television be subject to the strictest" First Amendment "standard
of review."  Ibid.

We agree with the Government that protection of children is a
"compelling interest."  See supra, at 10. But we do not agree that the
"segregate and block" requirements properly accommodate the
speech restrictions they impose and the legitimate objective they seek
to attain. Nor need we here determine whether, or the extent to
which, Pacifica does, or does not, impose some lesser standard of
review where indecent speech is at issue, compare 438 U. S., at
745-748 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (indecent materials enjoy lesser
First Amendment protection), with id., at 761-762 (Powell, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (refusing to accept a
lesser standard for nonobscene, indecent material). That is because
once one examines this governmental restriction, it becomes
apparent that, not only is it not a "least restrictive alternative," and is
not "narrowly tailored" to meet its legitimate objective, it also seems
considerably "more extensive than necessary."  That is to say, it
fails to satisfy this Court's formulations of the First Amendment's
"strictest," as well as its somewhat less "strict," requirements. See,
e.g., Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 ("compelling interest" and "least
restrictive means" requirements applied to indecent telephone
communications); id., at 131 (requiring "narrowly tailored" law);

scrutiny" to address content-neutral structural regulations of cable

Amendment scrutiny); Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566

(1995) (slip op., at 5) (restriction must be "narrowly drawn"); id., at
14 (there must be a "reasonable" "fit" with the objective that
legitimates speech restriction). The provision before us does not
reveal the caution and care that the standards underlying these
various verbal formulas impose upon laws that seek to reconcile the
critically important interest in protecting free speech with very
important, or even compelling, interests that sometimes warrant
restrictions.

Several circumstances lead us to this conclusion. For one thing, the
law, as recently amended, uses other means to protect children from
similar "patently offensive" material broadcast on unleased cable
channels, i.e., broadcast over any of a system's numerous ordinary,
or public access, channels. The law, as recently amended, requires
cable operators to "scramble or . . . block" such programming on
any (unleased) channel "primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented
programming."  Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 505, 110
Stat. 136 (emphasis added). In addition, cable operators must
honor a subscriber's request to block any, or all, programs on any
channel to which he or she does not wish to subscribe. Section 504,
ibid. And manufacturers, in the future, will have to make television
sets with a so-called "V-chip"--a device that will be able
automatically to identify and block sexually explicit or violent
programs. Section 551, id., at 139-142.

Although we cannot, and do not, decide whether the new provisions
are themselves lawful (a matter not before us), we note that they are
significantly less restrictive than the provision here at issue. They
do not force the viewer to receive (for days or weeks at a time) all
"patently offensive" programming or none; they will not lead the
viewer automatically to judge the few by the reputation of the many;
and they will not automatically place the occasional viewer's name
on a special list. They therefore inevitably lead us to ask why, if
they adequately protect children from "patently offensive" material
broadcast on ordinary channels, they would not offer adequate
protection from similar leased channel broadcasts as well?
Alternatively, if these provisions do not adequately protect children
from "patently offensive" material broadcast on ordinary channels,
how could one justify more severe leased channel restrictions when
(given ordinary channel programming) they would yield so little
additional protection for children?

The record does not answer these questions. It does not explain
why, under the new Act, blocking alone--without written access-
requests--adequately protects children from exposure to regular sex-
dedicated channels, but cannot adequately protect those children
from programming on similarly sex-dedicated channels that are
leased. It does not explain why a simple subscriber blocking
request system, perhaps a phone-call based system, would
adequately protect children from "patently offensive" material
broadcast on ordinary non-sex-dedicated channels (i.e., almost all
channels) but a far more restrictive segregate/block/written-access
system is needed to protect children from similar broadcasts on what
(in the absence of the segregation requirement) would be non-sex-
dedicated channels that are leased. Nor is there any indication
Congress thought the new ordinary channel protections less than
adequate.

The answers to the questions are not obvious. We have no
empirical reason to believe, for example, that sex-dedicated channels
are all (or mostly) leased channels, or that "patently offensive"
programming on non-sex-dedicated channels is found only (or
mostly) on leased channels. To the contrary, the parties' briefs (and
major city television guides) provide examples of what seems likely
to be such programming broadcast over both kinds of channels.

We recognize, as the Solicitor General properly points out, that
Congress need not deal with every problem at once. Cf. Semler v.
Oregon Bd. of Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608, 610 (1935) (the
legislature need not "strike at all evils at the same time"); and
Congress also must have a degree of leeway in tailoring means to
ends. Columbia Broadcasting, 412 U. S., at 102-103. But in light
of the 1996 statute, it seems fair to say that Congress now has tried
to deal with most of the problem. At this point, we can take
Congress' different, and significantly less restrictive, treatment of a
highly similar problem at least as some indication that more
restrictive means are not "essential" (or will not prove very helpful).
Cf. Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 329 (1988) (existence of a less
restrictive statute suggested that a challenged ordinance, aimed at the
same problem, was overly restrictive).

The record's description and discussion of a different alternative--
the "lockbox"--leads, through a different route, to a similar
conclusion. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 required
cable operators to provide

"upon the request of a subscriber, a device by which the subscriber
can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service during periods
selected by the subscriber."  47  U. S. C. Section 544(d)(2).

This device--the "lockbox"--would help protect children by
permitting their parents to "lock out" those programs or channels
that they did not want their children to see. See FCC 85-179,
Paragraph 132, 50 Fed. Reg. 18637, 18655 (1985) ("[T]he
provision for lockboxes largely disposes of issues involving the
Commission's standard for indecency"). The FCC, in upholding
the "segregate and block" provisions said that lockboxes protected
children (including, say, children with inattentive parents) less
effectively than those provisions. See First Report and Order
Paragraphs 14-15, 8 FCC Rcd, at 1000. But it is important to
understand why that is so.

The Government sets forth the reasons as follows:

"In the case of lockboxes, parents would have to discover that such
devices exist; find out that their cable operators offer them for sale;
spend the time and money to buy one; learn how to program the
lockbox to block undesired programs; and, finally, exercise
sufficient vigilance to ensure that they have, indeed, locked out
whatever indecent programming they do not wish their children to
view."  Brief for Federal Respondents 37.

We assume the accuracy of this statement. But, the reasons do not
show need for a provision as restrictive as the one before us.
Rather, they suggest  a set of provisions very much like those that
Congress placed in the 1996 Act.

No provision, we concede, short of an absolute ban, can offer
certain protection against assault by a determined child. We have
not, however, generally allowed this fact alone to justify
"`"reduc[ing] the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit for
children."'" Sable, 492 U. S., at 128 (quoting Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 73 (1983), in turn quoting
Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957)); see Sable, supra,
at 130, and n. 10. But, leaving that problem aside, the Solicitor
General's list of practical difficulties would seem to call, not for
"segregate and block" requirements, but, rather, for informational
requirements, for a simple coding system, for readily available
blocking equipment (perhaps accessible by telephone), for imposing
cost burdens upon system operators (who may spread them through
subscription fees); or perhaps even for a system that requires
lockbox defaults to be set to block certain channels (say, sex-
dedicated-channels). These kinds of requirements resemble those
that Congress has recently imposed upon all but leased channels.
For that reason, the "lockbox" description and the discussion of its
frailties reinforces our conclusion that the leased channel provision
is overly restrictive when measured against the benefits it is likely to
achieve. (We add that the record's discussion of the "lockbox" does
not explain why the law now treats leased channels more
restrictively than ordinary channels.)


There may, of course, be other explanations. Congress may simply
not have bothered to change the leased channel provisions when it
introduced a new system for other channels. But responses of this
sort, like guesses about the comparative seriousness of the problem,
are not legally adequate. In other cases, where, as here, the record
before Congress or before an agency provides no convincing
explanation, this Court has not been willing to stretch the limits of
the plausible, to create hypothetical nonobvious explanations in
order to justify laws that impose significant restrictions upon
speech. See, e.g., Sable, supra, at 130 ("[T]he congressional record
presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or
ineffective the FCC's most recent regulations were or might prove to
be"); Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 120; Minneapolis Star &
Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575,
585-586 (1983); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U. S. 221, 231-232 (1987).

Consequently, we cannot find that the "segregate and block"
restrictions on speech are a narrowly, or reasonably, tailored effort
to protect children. Rather, they are overly restrictive,
"sacrific[ing]" important First Amendment interests for too
"speculative a gain." Columbia Broadcasting, 412 U. S., at 127; see
League of Women Voters, 468 U. S., at 397. For that reason they
are not consistent with the First Amendment.


The statute's third provision, as implemented by FCC regulation, is
similar to its first provision, in that it too permits a cable operator to
prevent transmission of "patently offensive" programming, in this
case on public access channels. 1992 Act, Section 10(c); 47 CFR
Section 76.702 (1995). But there are four important differences.


The first is the historical background. As JUSTICE KENNEDY
points out, see post, at 9-12, cable operators have traditionally
agreed to reserve channel capacity for public, governmental, and
educational channels as part of the consideration they give
municipalities that award them cable franchises. See H. R. Rep.
No. 98-934, at 30. In the terms preferred by JUSTICE THOMAS,
see post, at 17-18, the requirement to reserve capacity for public
access channels is similar to the reservation of a public easement, or
a dedication of land for streets and parks, as part of a municipality's
approval of a subdivision of land. Cf. post, at 15-16 (KENNEDY,
J.). Significantly, these are channels over which cable operators
have not historically exercised editorial control. H. R. Rep. No. 98-
934, supra, at 30. Unlike Section 10(a) therefore, Section 10(c)
does not restore to cable operators editorial rights that they once had,
and the countervailing First Amendment interest is nonexistent, or at
least much diminished. See also post, at 13-15 (KENNEDY, J.).

The second difference is the institutional background that has
developed as a result of the historical difference. When a "leased
channel" is made available by the operator to a private lessee, the
lessee has total control of programming during the leased time slot.
See 47 U. S. C. Section 532(c)(2). Public access channels, on the
other hand, are normally subject to complex supervisory systems of
various sorts, often with both public and private elements. See
Section 531(b) (franchising authorities "may require rules and
procedures for the use of the [public access] channel capacity").
Municipalities generally provide in their cable franchising
agreements for an access channel manager, who is most commonly
a nonprofit organization, but may also be the municipality, or, in
some instances, the cable system owner. See D. Brenner, M. Price,
& M. Myerson, Cable Television and Other Nonbroadcast Video
Paragraph 6.04[7] (1993); P. Aufderheide, Public Access Cable
Programming, Controversial Speech, and Free Expression (1992)
(hereinafter Aufderheide), reprinted in App. 61, 63 (surveying 61
communities; the access manager was: a nonprofit organization in
41, a local government official in 12, the cable operator in 5, and an
unidentified entity in 3); D. Agosta, C. Rogoff, & A. Norman, The
Participate Report: A Case Study of Public Access Cable Television
in New York State 28 (1990), attached as Exh. K to Joint
Comments for the Alliance for Community Media et al., filed with
the FCC under MM Docket No. 92-258 (materials so filed
hereinafter FCC Record) ("In 88% [of New York public access
systems] access channels were programmed jointly between the
cable operator and another institution such as a university, library,
or non-profit access organization"); Agosta, at 28-32, FCC Record;
Comments of National Cable Television Association Inc., at 14,
FCC Record ("Operators often have no involvement in PEG
channels that are run by local access organizations"). Access
channel activity and management are partly financed with public
funds--through franchise fees or other payments pursuant to the
franchise agreement, or from general municipal funds, see Brenner,
Paragraph 6.04[3][c]; Aufderheide, App. 59-60--and are commonly
subject to supervision by a local supervisory board. See, e.g., D.
C. Code Ann. Section 43-1829 (1990 and Supp. 1996); Lynchburg
City Code Section 12.1-44(d)(2) (1988).

This system of public, private, and mixed nonprofit elements,
through its supervising boards and nonprofit or governmental access
managers, can set programming policy and approve or disapprove
particular programming services. And this system can police that
policy by, for example, requiring indemnification by programmers,
certification of compliance with local standards, time segregation,
adult content advisories, or even by prescreening individual
programs. See Second Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd, Paragraph
26 ("[F]rom the comments received, it appears that a number of
access organizations already have in place procedures that require
certification statements [of compliance with local standards], or their
equivalent, from access programmers"); Comments of the Boston
Community Access and Programming Foundation, App. 163-164;

Communications Commission, at 2, FCC Record; Reply Comments
of Waycross Community Television, at 4-6, FCC Record; Reply
Comments of Columbus Community Cable Access, Inc., App. 329;

Comments of Erik Mollberg, Public Access Coordinator, Ft.
Wayne, Ind., at 3, FCC Record; Comments of Defiance Community
Television, at 3, FCC Record; Comments of Nutmeg Public Access
Television, Inc., at 3-4, FCC Record. Whether these locally
accountable bodies prescreen programming, promulgate rules for the
use of public access channels, or are merely available to respond
when problems arise, the upshot is the same: there is a locally
accountable body capable of addressing the problem, should it arise,
of patently offensive programming broadcast to children, making it
unlikely that many children will in fact be exposed to programming
considered patently offensive in that community. See 56 F. 3d, at
127-128; Second Report and Order, supra, Paragraph 26.

Third, the existence of a system aimed at encouraging and securing
programming that the community considers valuable strongly
suggests that a "cable operator's veto" is less likely necessary to
achieve the statute's basic objective, protecting children, than a
similar veto in the context of leased channels. Of course, the system
of access managers and supervising boards can make mistakes,
which the operator might in some cases correct with its veto power.
Balanced against this potential benefit, however, is the risk that the
veto itself may be mistaken; and its use, or threatened use, could
prevent the presentation of programming, that, though borderline, is
not "patently offensive" to its targeted audience. See Aufderheide,
App. 64-66 (describing the programs that were considered
borderline by access managers, including sex education, health
education, broadcasts of politically marginal groups, and various
artistic experiments). And this latter threat must bulk large within a
system that already has publicly accountable systems for maintaining
responsible programs.

Finally, our examination of the legislative history and the record
before us is consistent with what common sense suggests, namely
that the public/nonprofit programming control systems now in place
would normally avoid, minimize, or eliminate any child-related
problems concerning "patently offensive" programming. We have
found anecdotal references to what seem isolated instances of
potentially indecent programming, some of which may well have
occurred on leased, not public access channels. See 138 Cong.
Rec. S642, S650 (Jan. 30, 1992) (statement of Sen. Wirth)
(mentioning "abuses" on Time Warner's New York City channel);
but see Comments of Manhattan Neighborhood Network, App.
235, 238 (New York access manager noting that leased, not public
access channels, regularly carry sexually explicit programming in
New York, and that no commercial programs or advertising are
allowed on public access channels); Brief for Time Warner Cable as
Amicus Curiae 2-3 (indicating that relevant "abuses" likely occurred
on leased channels). See also 138 Cong. Rec., at S649 (Jan. 30,
1992) (statement of Sen. Fowler) (describing solicitation of
prostitution); id., at S646 (statement of Sen. Helms) (identifying
newspaper headline referring to mayor's protest of a "strip act"); 56
F. 3d, at 117-118 (recounting comments submitted to the FCC
describing three complaints of offensive programming); Letter from
Mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes, FCC Record; Resolution of San
Antonio City Council, No. 92-49-40, FCC Record.

But these few examples do not necessarily indicate a significant
nationwide pattern. See 56 F. 3d, at 127-128 (public access
channels "did not pose dangers on the order of magnitude of those
identified on leased access channels," and "local franchising
authorities could respond" to such problems "by issuing `rules and
procedures' or other `requirements'"). The Commission itself did
not report any examples of "indecent" programs on public access
channels. See Second Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd 2638 (1993);
see also Comments of Boston Community Access and Programming
Foundation, App. 162-163 (noting that the FCC's Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking, 7 FCC Rcd 7709 (1992) did not identify any
"inappropriate" programming that actually exists on public access
channels). Moreover, comments submitted to the FCC undermine
any suggestion that prior to 1992 there were significant problems of
indecent programming on public access channels. See Agosta, at
10, 28, FCC Record (surveying 76 public access systems in New
York over two years, and finding "only two examples of
controversial programming, and both had been settled by the
producers and the access channel"); Reply Comments of Staten
Island Community Television, at 2, FCC Record ("Our access
channels have been on the air since 1986 without a single incident
which would be covered by Section 10 of the new law"); Reply
Comments of Waycross Community Television, at 2, FCC Record
("[I]ndecent and obscene programs . . . [have] never been cablecast
through Waycross Community Television during our entire ten year
programming history"); Reply Comments of Cambridge Community
Television, App. 314 ("In Cambridge less than one hour out of
15,000 hours of programming CCTV has run in the past five year[s]
may have been affected by the Act"); ibid. ("CCTV feels that there
simply is not a problem which needs to be fixed"); Reply Comments
of Columbus Community Cable Access, Inc., App. 329 ("ACTV is
unaware of any actions taken by the cable operators under [a local
law authorizing them to prohibit "legally obscene matter"] within the
last 10 years"); Reply Comments of Cincinnati Community Video,
Inc., App., at 316 ("[I]n 10 years of access operations with over
30,000 access programs cablecast not a single obscenity violation
has ever occurred"); Comments of Defiance Community Television,
at 2-3, FCC Record (in eight years of operation, "there has never
been a serious problem with the content of programming on the
channel").

At most, we have found borderline examples as to which people's
judgment may differ, perhaps acceptable in some communities but
not others, of the type that petitioners fear the law might prohibit.
See, e.g., Aufderheide, App. 64-66; Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-
124, p. 7 (describing depiction of a self-help gynecological
examination); Comments of Time Warner Entertainment Co., App.
252 (describing an Austin, Tex., program from that included "nude
scenes from a movie," and an Indianapolis, Ind., "safe sex"
program). It is difficult to see how such borderline examples could
show a compelling need, nationally, to protect children from
significantly harmful materials. Compare 138 Cong. Rec., at S646
(Jan. 30, 1992) (statement of Sen. Helms) (justifying regulation of
leased access channels in terms of programming that depicts
"bestiality" and "rape"). In the absence of a factual basis
substantiating the harm and the efficacy of its proposed cure, we
cannot assume that the harm exists or that the regulation redresses it.
See Turner, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op. at 40-41).

The upshot, in respect to the public access channels, is a law that
could radically change present programming-related relationships
among local community and nonprofit supervising boards and
access managers, which relationships are established through
municipal law, regulation, and contract. In doing so, it would not
significantly restore editorial rights of cable operators, but would
greatly increase the risk that certain categories of programming (say,
borderline offensive programs) will not appear. At the same time,
given present supervisory mechanisms, the need for this particular
provision, aimed directly at public access channels, is not obvious.
Having carefully reviewed the legislative history of the Act, the
proceedings before the FCC, the record below, and the submissions
of the parties and amici here, we conclude that the Government
cannot sustain its burden of showing that Section 10(c) is necessary
to protect children or that it is appropriately tailored to secure that
end. See, e.g., Columbia Broadcasting, 412 U. S., at 127; League
of Women Voters, 468 U. S., at 398-399; Sable, 492 U. S., at 126.
Consequently, we find that this third provision violates the First
Amendment.


Finally, we must ask whether Section 10(a) is severable from the
two other provisions. The question is one of legislative intent:
Would Congress still "have passed" Section 10(a) "had it known"
that the remaining "provision[s were] invalid"? Brockett v. Spokane
Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 506 (1985). If so, we need not
invalidate all three provisions. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S., at
769, n. 24 (citing United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402
U. S. 363 (1971)).

Although the 1992 Act contains no express "severability clause," we
can find the Act's "severability" intention in its structure and
purpose. It seems fairly obvious Congress would have intended its
permissive "leased access" channels provision, Section 10(a), to
stand irrespective of Section 10(c)'s legal fate. That is because the
latter provision concerns only public, educational, and governmental
channels. Its presence had little, if any, effect upon "leased access"
channels; hence its absence in respect to those channels could not
make a significant difference.

The "segregate and block" requirement's invalidity does make a
difference, however, to the effectiveness of the permissive "leased
access" provision, Section 10(a). Together they told the cable
system operator: "either ban a `patently offensive' program or
`segregate and block' it."  Without the "segregate and block"
provision, cable operators are afforded broad discretion over what to
do with a patently offensive program, and because they will no
longer bear the costs of segregation and blocking if they refuse to
ban such programs, cable operators may choose to ban fewer
programs.

Nonetheless, this difference does not make the two provisions
unseverable. Without the "segregate and block" provision, the law
simply treats leased channels (in respect to patently offensive
programming) just as it treats all other channels. And judging by the
absence of similar segregate-and-block provisions in the context of
these other channels, Congress would probably have thought that
Section 10(a), standing alone, was an effective (though, perhaps,
not the most effective) means of pursuing its objective. Moreover,
we can find no reason why, in light of Congress' basic objective
(the protection of children), Congress would have preferred no
provisions at all to the permissive provision standing by itself. That
provision, capable of functioning on its own, still helps to achieve
that basic objective. Consequently, we believe the valid provision is
severable from the others.


For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed
insofar as it upheld Section 10(a); the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed insofar as it upheld Section 10(b) and Section
10(c).

It is so ordered.

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.

The difference between Section 10(a) and Section 10(c) is the
difference between a permit and a prohibition. The former restores
the freedom of cable operators to reject indecent programs; the latter
requires local franchising authorities to reject such programs. While
I join the Court's opinion, I add these comments to emphasize the
difference between the two provisions and to endorse the analysis in
Part III-B of JUSTICE KENNEDY's opinion even though I do not
think it necessary to characterize the public access channels as public
fora. Like JUSTICE SOUTER, I am convinced that it would be
unwise to take a categorical approach to the resolution of novel First
Amendment questions arising in an industry as dynamic as this. Cf.
R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 426-427 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment).


Federal law requires cable system operators to reserve about 15
percent of their channels for commercial lease to unaffiliated
programmers. See 47 U. S.C. Section 532(b). On these channels,
federal law generally prohibits the cable operator from exercising
any control over program content, see 47 U. S. C. 532(c)(2), with
one exception: Section 10(a) allows the operator to refuse to air
"indecent" programs. In my view, that exception is permissible.

The Federal Government established the leased access requirements
to ensure that certain programmers would have more channels
available to them. Section 10(a) is therefore best understood as a
limitation on the amount of speech that the Federal Government has
spared from the censorial control of the cable operator, rather than a
direct prohibition against the communication of speech that, in the
absence of federal intervention, would flow freely.

I do not agree, however, that Section 10(a) established a public
forum. Unlike sidewalks and parks, the Federal Government
created leased access channels in the course of its legitimate
regulation of the communications industry. In so doing, it did not
establish an entirely open forum, but rather restricted access to
certain speakers, namely unaffiliated programmers able to lease the
air time. By facilitating certain speech that cable operators would
not otherwise carry, the leased access channels operate like the
must-carry rules that we considered in Turner Broadcasting
System,. Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. __, __ (1994) (slip op., at 19-
21), without reference to our public forum precedents.

When the Federal Government opens cable channels that would
otherwise be left entirely in private hands, it deserves more
deference than a rigid application of the public forum doctrine would
allow. At this early stage in the regulation of this developing
industry, Congress should not be put to an all or nothing-at-all
choice in deciding whether to open certain cable channels to
programmers who would otherwise lack the resources to participate
in the marketplace of ideas.

Just as Congress may legitimately limit access to these channels to
unaffiliated programmers, I believe it may also limit, within certain
reasonable bounds, the extent of the access that it confers upon
those programmers.1   If the Government had a reasonable basis for
concluding that there were already enough classical musical
programs or cartoons being telecast--or, perhaps, even enough
political debate--I would find no First Amendment objection to an
open access requirement that was extended on an impartial basis to
all but those particular subjects. A contrary conclusion would ill-
serve First Amendment values by dissuading the Government from
creating access rights altogether.2

Of course, the fact that the Federal Government may be entitled to
some deference in regulating access for cable programmers does not
mean that it may evade First Amendment constraints by selectively
choosing which speech should be excepted from private control. If
the Government spared all speech but that communicated by
Republicans from the control of the cable operator, for example, the
First Amendment violation would be plain. See Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,
806 (1985). More subtle viewpoint-based limitations on access also
may be prohibited by the First Amendment. See Southeastern
Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 564 (1975) (Douglas,
J., dissenting in part and concurring in result in part).

Even though it is often difficult to determine whether a given access
restriction impermissibly singles out certain ideas for repression, in
this case I find no basis for concluding that Section 10(a) is a
species of viewpoint discrimination. By returning control over
indecent programming to the cable operator, Section 10(a) treats
indecent programming on access channels no differently from
indecent programming on regular channels. The decision to permit
the operator to determine whether to show indecent programming on
access channels therefore cannot be said to reflect a Governmental
bias against the indecent programming that appears on access
channels in particular.

Nor can it be argued that indecent programming has no outlet other
than leased access channels, and thus that the exclusion of such
speech from special protection is designed to prohibit its
communication altogether. Petitioners impliedly concede this point
when they contend that the indecency restrictions are arbitrarily
underinclusive because they do not affect the similarly indecent
programming that appears on regular channels. Moreover, the
criteria Section 10(a) identifies for limiting access are fully
consistent with the Government's contention that the speech
restrictions are not designed to suppress "a certain form of
expression that the Government dislikes," ante, at 24 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), but rather to protect
children from sexually explicit programming on a pervasive
medium. In other cases, we have concluded that such a justification
is both viewpoint-neutral and legitimate. Sable Communications of
Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989); FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). There is no reason to conclude
otherwise here.

Finally, Section 10(a) cannot be assailed on the somewhat broader
ground that it nevertheless reduces the programming available to the
adult population to what is suitable for children. Butler v.
Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957); ante, at 29 (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). Section 10(a) serves only
to ensure that the newly created access right will not require
operators to expose children to more unsuitable communications
than would otherwise be the case. It is thus far different in both
purpose and effect from the provision at issue in Butler, which
criminalized the sale of certain books. Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.
S., at 381.

In sum, Section  10(a) constitutes a reasonable, viewpoint neutral
limitation on a federally-created access right for certain cable
programmers. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals as to this provision.


As both JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE KENNEDY have
explained, the public, educational and governmental access channels
that are regulated by Section 10(c) are not creations of the Federal
Government. They owe their existence to contracts forged between
cable operators and local cable franchising authorities. Ante, at 3,
30-32 (opinion of BREYER, J.); ante, at 9, 11, 13-15 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). As their name reflects,
so-called PEG channels are subject to a variety of local
governmental controls and regulations that--apart from any federal
requirement--may result either in a prohibition or a requirement that
certain types of programs be carried. Ante, at 31-33 (opinion of
BREYER, J.). Presumably, as JUSTICE BREYER explains, the
local authorities seldom permit programming of the type described
by Section 10(c) to air. Ante, at 32-33.

What is of critical importance to me, however, is that if left to their
own devices, those authorities may choose to carry some
programming that the Federal Government has decided to restrict.
As I read Section 10(c), the federal statute would disable local
governments from making that choice. It would inject federally
authorized private censors into forums from which they might
otherwise be excluded, and it would therefore limit local forums that
might otherwise be open to all constitutionally protected speech.3

Section 10(c) operates as a direct restriction on speech that, in the
absence of federal intervention, might flow freely. The Federal
Government is therefore not entitled to the same leeway that I
believe it deserves when it enacts provisions such as Section 10(a),
which define the limits of federally created access rights. See supra,
at 2-3. The Federal Government has no more entitlement to restrict
the power of a local authority to disseminate materials on channels
of its own creation, then it has to restrict the power of cable
operators to do so on channels that they own. In this respect, I
agree entirely with JUSTICE KENNEDY, save for his designation
of these channels as public fora.

That is not to say that the Federal Government may not impose
restrictions on the dissemination of indecent materials on cable
television. Although indecent speech is protected by the First
Amendment, the Government may have a compelling interest in
protecting children from indecent speech on such a pervasive
medium. Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S.
115 (1989); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978).
When the Government acts to suppress directly the dissemination of
such speech, however, it may not rely solely on speculation and
conjecture. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S., at 129-131.

JUSTICE BREYER persuasively demonstrates that the Government
has made no effort to identify the harm caused by permitting local
franchising authorities to determine the quantum of so-called
"indecent" speech that may be aired in their communities. Ante, at
33-37. Nor has the Government attempted to determine whether the
intervention of the discretionary censorial authority of a private cable
operator constitutes an appropriately limited means of addressing
that harm. Ibid. Given the direct nature of the restriction on speech
that Section 10(c) imposes, the Government has failed to carry its
burden of justification. Accordingly, I agree that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals with respect to Section 10(c) should be reversed.

CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring.

JUSTICE KENNEDY's separate opinion stresses the worthy point
that First Amendment values generally are well-served by
categorizing speech protection according to the respective characters
of the expression, its context, and the restriction at issue.
Reviewing speech regulations under fairly strict categorical rules
keeps the starch in the standards for those moments when the daily
politics cries loudest for limiting what may be said.1   JUSTICE
KENNEDY sees no warrant in this case for anything but a
categorical and rule-based approach applying a fixed level of
scrutiny, the strictest, to judge the content-based provisions of
Sections 10(a), (b), and (c), and he accordingly faults the plurality
opinion for declining to decide the precise doctrinal categories that
should govern the issue at hand. The value of the categorical
approach generally to First Amendment security prompts a word to
explain why I join the Court's unwillingness to announce a
definitive categorical analysis in this case.

Neither the speech nor the limitation at issue here may be categorized
simply by content. Our prior case most nearly on point dealt not
with a flat restriction covering a separate category of indecency at the
First Amendment's periphery, but with less than a total ban, directed
to instances of indecent speech easily available to children through
broadcasts readily received in the household and difficult or
impossible to control without immediate supervision. See FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 747 (1978) (plurality opinion)
("It is a characteristic of speech such as this that both its capacity to
offend and its `social value' . . . vary with the circumstances").2   It
is not surprising that so contextually complex a category was not
expressly assigned a standard level of scrutiny for reviewing the
Government's limitation at issue there.3

Nor does the fact that we deal in this case with cable transmission
necessarily suggest that a simple category subject to a standard level
of scrutiny ought to be recognized at this point; while we have found
cable television different from broadcast with respect to the factors
justifying intrusive access requirements under the rule in Red Lion,
see Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___, ___
(1994) (slip op., at 12-13) (finding that Red Lion's spectrum
scarcity rationale had no application to cable), today's plurality
opinion rightly observes that the characteristics of broadcast radio
that rendered indecency particularly threatening in Pacifica, that is,
its intrusion into the house and accessibility to children, are also
present in the case of cable television, ante, at 14. It would seem,
then, that the appropriate category for cable indecency should be as
contextually detailed as the Pacifica example, and settling upon a
definitive level-of-scrutiny rule of review for so complex a category
would require a subtle judgment; but there is even more to be
considered, enough more to demand a subtlety tantamount to
prescience.

All of the relevant characteristics of cable are presently in a state of
technological and regulatory flux. Recent and far-reaching
legislation not only affects the technical feasibility of parental control
over children's access to undesirable material, see, e.g.,
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 551, Pub. L. 104-104,
110 Stat. 139-142 (Feb. 8, 1996) (provision for "V-chip" to block
sexually explicit or violent programs), but portends fundamental
changes in the competitive structure of the industry and, therefore,
the ability of individual entities to act as bottlenecks to the free flow
of information, see id., Title III, 110 Stat. 114-128 (promoting
competition in cable services). As cable and telephone companies
begin their competition for control over the single wire that will
carry both their services, we can hardly settle rules for review of
regulation on the assumption that cable will remain a separable and
useful category of First Amendment scrutiny. And as broadcast,
cable, and the cyber-technology of the Internet and the World Wide
Web approach the day of using a common receiver, we can hardly
assume that standards for judging the regulation of one of them will
not have immense, but now unknown and unknowable, effects on
the others.4

Accordingly, in charting a course that will permit reasonable
regulation in light of the values in competition, we have to accept the
likelihood that the media of communication will become less
categorical and more protean. Because we cannot be confident that
for purposes of judging speech restrictions it will continue to make
sense to distinguish cable from other technologies, and because we
know that changes in these regulated technologies will enormously
alter the structure of regulation itself, we should be shy about saying
the final word today about what will be accepted as reasonable
tomorrow. In my own ignorance I have to accept the real possibility
that "if we had to decide today . . . just what the First Amendment
should mean in cyberspace, . . . we would get it fundamentally
wrong." Lessig, The Path of Cyberlaw, 104 Yale L. J. 1743, 1745
(1995).

The upshot of appreciating the fluidity of the subject that Congress
must regulate is simply to accept the fact that not every nuance of
our old standards will necessarily do for the new technology, and
that a proper choice among existing doctrinal categories is not
obvious. Rather than definitively settling the issue now, JUSTICE
BREYER wisely reasons by direct analogy rather than by rule,
concluding that the speech and the restriction at issue in this case
may usefully be measured against the ones at issue in Pacifica.5   If
that means it will take some time before reaching a final method of
review for cases like this one, there may be consolation in recalling
that 16 years passed, from Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476
(1957), to Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), before the
modern obscenity rule jelled; that it took over 40 years, from Hague
v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939), to Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37 (1983), for the public forum
category to settle out; and that a round half-century passed before the
clear and present danger of Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47
(1919), evolved into the modern incitement rule of Brandenburg v.
Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969).

I cannot guess how much time will go by until the technologies of
communication before us today have matured and their relationships
become known. But until a category of indecency can be defined
both with reference to the new technology and with a prospect of
durability, the job of the courts will be just what JUSTICE
BREYER does today: recognizing established First Amendment
interests through a close analysis that constrains the Congress,
without wholly incapacitating it in all matters of the significance
apparent here, maintaining the high value of open communication,
measuring the costs of regulation by exact attention to fact, and
compiling a pedigree of experience with the changing subject.
These are familiar judicial responsibilities in times when we know
too little to risk the finality of precision, and attention to them will
probably take us through the communications revolution. Maybe the
judicial obligation to shoulder these responsibilities can itself be
captured by a much older rule, familiar to every doctor of medicine:
"First, do no harm."

CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree that Section 10(a) is constitutional and that Section 10(b) is
unconstitutional, and I join Parts I, II, III, and V, and the judgment
in part. I am not persuaded, however, that the asserted "important
differences" between Sections 10(a) and 10(c), ante, at 30, are
sufficient to justify striking down Section 10(c). I find the features
shared by Section 10(a), which covers leased access channels, and
Section 10(c), which covers public access channels, to be more
significant than the differences. For that reason, I would find that
Section 10(c) too withstands constitutional scrutiny.

Both Sections 10(a) and 10(c) serve an important governmental
interest: the well-established compelling interest of protecting
children from exposure to indecent material. See Sable
Communications of Cal. Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989);
Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639-640 (1968). Cable
television, like broadcast television, is a medium that is uniquely
accessible to children, see ante, at 13-14, and of course, children
have equally easy access to public access channels as to leased
access channels. By permitting a cable operator to prevent
transmission of patently offensive sex-related programming,
Sections 10(a) and 10(c) further the interest of protecting children.

Furthermore, both provisions are permissive. Neither presents an
outright ban on a category of speech, such as we struck down in
Sable Communications of Cal. Inc. v. FCC, supra. Sections 10(a)
and 10(c) leave to the cable operator the decision whether or not to
broadcast indecent programming, and, therefore, are less restrictive
than an absolute governmental ban. Certainly Section 10(c) is not
more restrictive than Section 10(a) in this regard.

It is also significant that neither Section 10(a) nor Section 10(c) is
more restrictive than the governmental speech restriction we upheld
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). I agree with
JUSTICE BREYER that we should not yet undertake fully to adapt
our First Amendment doctrine to the new context we confront here.
Because we refrain from doing so, the precedent established by
Pacifica offers an important guide. Section 10(c), no less than
Section 10(a), is within the range of acceptability set by Pacifica.
See ante, at 13-16.

The distinctions upon which the Court relies in deciding that Section
10(c) must fall while Section 10(a) survives are not, in my view,
constitutionally significant. Much emphasis is placed on the
differences in the origins of leased access and public access
channels. To be sure, the leased access channels covered by Section
10(a) were a product of the Federal Government, while the public
access channels at issue in Section 10(c) arose as part of the cable
franchises awarded by municipalities, see ante at 30-31, but I am not
persuaded that the difference in the origin of the access channels is
sufficient to justify upholding Section 10(a) and striking down
Section 10(c). The interest in protecting children remains the same,
whether on a leased access channel or a public access channel, and
allowing the cable operator the option of prohibiting the
transmission of indecent speech seems a constitutionally permissible
means of addressing that interest. Nor is the fact that public access
programming may be subject to supervisory systems in addition to
the cable operator, see ante, at 31-33, sufficient in my mind to
render Section 10(c) so ill-tailored to its goal as to be
unconstitutional.      Given the compelling interest served by
Section 10(c), its permissive nature, and fit within our precedent, I
would hold Section 10(c), like Section 10(a), constitutional.

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]

JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and
dissenting in part.

The plurality opinion, insofar as it upholds Section 10(a) of the
1992 Cable Act, is adrift. The opinion treats concepts such as
public forum, broadcaster, and common carrier as mere labels rather
than as categories with settled legal significance; it applies no
standard, and by this omission loses sight of existing First
Amendment doctrine. When confronted with a threat to free speech
in the context of an emerging technology, we ought to have the
discipline to analyze the case by reference to existing elaborations of
constant First Amendment principles. This is the essence of the
case-by-case approach to ensuring protection of speech under the
First Amendment, even in novel settings. Rather than undertake this
task, however, the plurality just declares that, all things considered,
Section 10(a) seems fine. I think the implications of our past cases
for this one are clearer than the plurality suggests, and they require
us to hold Section 10(a) invalid. Though I join Part III of the
opinion (there for the Court) striking down Section 10(b) of the Act,
and concur in the judgment that Section 10(c) is unconstitutional,
with respect I dissent from the remainder.


Two provisions of the 1992 Act, Sections 10(a) and (c), authorize
the operator of a cable system to exclude certain programming from
two different kinds of channels. Section 10(a) concerns leased
access channels. These are channels the cable operator is required
by federal law to make available to unaffiliated programmers without
exercising any control over program content. The statute allows a
cable operator to enforce a written and published policy of
prohibiting on these channels any programming it "reasonably
believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs
in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary
community standards," speech we can refer to as "indecent
programming."

Section 10(c) involves public, educational, and governmental access
channels (or PEG access channels, as they are known). These are
channels set aside for use by members of the public, governmental
authorities, and local school systems. As interpreted by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), Section 10(c) requires the
agency to make regulations enabling cable operators to prohibit
indecent programming on PEG access channels. See ante, at 3-5
(quoting statutory provisions in full and discussing interpretive
regulations).*

Though the two provisions differ in significant respects, they have
common flaws. In both instances, Congress singles out one sort of
speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where
content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted. The
plurality at least recognizes this as state action, ante, at 6, avoiding
the mistake made by the Court of Appeals, Alliance for Community
Media v. FCC, 56 F. 3d 105, 112-121 (1995). State action lies in
the enactment of a statute altering legal relations between persons,
including the selective withdrawal from one group of legal
protections against private acts, regardless of whether the private
acts are attributable to the State. Cf. Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S.
385, 389-390 (1969) (state action under the Fourteenth
Amendment).

The plurality balks at taking the next step, however, which is to
advise us what standard it applies to determine whether the state
action conforms to the First Amendment. Sections 10(a) and (c)
disadvantage nonobscene, indecent programming, a protected
category of expression, Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.
FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989), on the basis of its content. The
Constitution in general does not tolerate content-based restriction of
or discrimination against speech. R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S.
377, 382 (1992) ("Content-based regulations are presumptively
invalid"); Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 461-463 (1980); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972). In the realm
of speech and expression, the First Amendment envisions the citizen
shaping the government, not the reverse; it removes "governmental
restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as
to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in
the hope that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more
capable citizenry and more perfect polity."  Cohen v. California, 403
U. S. 15, 24 (1971). "[E]ach person should decide for him or
herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration,
and adherence. Our political system and cultural life rest upon this
ideal."  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___,
___ (1994) (slip op., at 16). We therefore have given "the most
exacting scrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or
impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content."
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17).

Sections 10(a) and (c) are unusual. They do not require direct action
against speech, but do authorize a cable operator to deny the use of
its property to certain forms of speech. As a general matter, a
private person may exclude certain speakers from his or her property
without violating the First Amendment, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.
S. 507 (1976), and if Sections 10(a) and (c) were no more than
affirmations of this principle they might be unremarkable. Access
channels, however, are property of the cable operator dedicated or
otherwise reserved for programming of other speakers or the
government. A public access channel is a public forum, and laws
requiring leased access channels create common carrier obligations.
When the government identifies certain speech on the basis of its
content as vulnerable to exclusion from a common carrier or public
forum, strict scrutiny applies. These laws cannot survive this
exacting review. However compelling Congress' interest in
shielding children from indecent programming, the provisions in
this case are not drawn with enough care to withstand scrutiny under
our precedents.


Before engaging the complexities of cable access channels and
explaining my reasons for thinking all of Section 10
unconstitutional, I start with the most disturbing aspect of the
plurality opinion: its evasion of any clear legal standard in deciding
this case. See ante, at 11 (disavowing need to "declare which,
among the many applications of the general approach that this Court
has developed over the years, we are applying here").

The plurality begins its flight from standards with a number of
assertions nobody disputes. I agree, of course, that it would be
unwise "to declare a rigid single standard, good for now and for all
future media and purposes," ante, at 11. I do think it necessary,
however, to decide what standard applies to discrimination against
indecent programming on cable access channels in the present state
of the industry. We owe at least that much to public and leased
access programmers whose speech is put at risk nationwide by these
laws.

In a similar vein, we are admonished this case is complicated, not
simple; the importance of contextual review, we are told, cannot be
evaded by recourse to simple analogies. Ante, at 9-13, 18. All this
is true, but use of a standard does not foreclose consideration of
context. Indeed, if strict scrutiny is an instance of "judicial formulae
so rigid that they become a straitjacket that disables Government
from responding to serious problems," ante, at 11, this is a grave
indictment of our First Amendment jurisprudence, which relies on
strict scrutiny in a number of settings where context is important. I
have expressed misgivings about judicial balancing under the First
Amendment, see Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 211-212
(1992) (concurring opinion); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members
of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124-125 (1991)
(opinion concurring in judgment), but strict scrutiny at least confines
the balancing process in a manner protective of speech; it does not
disable government from addressing serious problems, but does
ensure that the solutions do not sacrifice speech to a greater extent
than necessary.

The plurality claims its resistance to standards is in keeping with our
case law, where we have shown a willingness to be flexible in
confronting novel First Amendment problems. The cases it cites,
ante, at 10-11, however, demonstrate the opposite of what the
plurality supposes: in each, we developed specialized or more or
less stringent standards when certain contexts demanded them; we
did not avoid the use of standards altogether. Indeed, the creation of
standards and adherence to them, even when it means affording
protection to speech unpopular or distasteful, is the central
achievement of our First Amendment jurisprudence. Standards are
the means by which we state in advance how to test a law's validity,
rather than letting the height of the bar be determined by the apparent
exigencies of the day. They also provide notice and fair warning to
those who must predict how the courts will respond to attempts to
suppress their speech. Yet formulations like strict scrutiny, used in
a number of constitutional settings to ensure that the inequities of the
moment are subordinated to commitments made for the long run, see
Simon & Schuster, supra, at 115-116; Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983), mean little if they
can be watered down whenever they seem too strong. They mean
still less if they can be ignored altogether when considering a case
not on all fours with what we have seen before.

The plurality seems distracted by the many changes in technology
and competition in the cable industry. See ante, at 11-12; ante, at 3-
4 (SOUTER, J., concurring). The laws challenged here, however,
do not retool the structure of the cable industry or (with the
exception of Section 10(b)) involve intricate technologies. The
straightforward issue here is whether the Government can deprive
certain speakers, on the basis of the content of their speech, of
protections afforded all others. There is no reason to discard our
existing First Amendment jurisprudence in answering this question.

While it protests against standards, the plurality does seem to favor
one formulation of the question in this case: namely, whether the Act
"properly addresses an extremely important problem, without
imposing, in light of the relevant interests, an unnecessarily great
restriction on speech."  Ante, at 12. (Though the plurality frowns
on any effort to settle on a form of words, it likes this formulation
well enough to repeat it; see ante, at 11). This description of the
question accomplishes little, save to clutter our First Amendment
case law by adding an untested rule with an uncertain relationship to
the others we use to evaluate laws restricting speech. The plurality
cannot bring itself to apply strict scrutiny, yet realizes it cannot
decide the case without uttering some sort of standard; so it has
settled for synonyms. "[C]lose judicial scrutiny," ante, at 11, 12, is
substituted for strict scrutiny, and "extremely important problem,"
ante, at 12, or "extraordinary proble[m]," ante, at 11, is substituted
for "compelling interest."  The admonition that the restriction not be
unnecessarily great in light of the interest it serves, ante, at 12, is
substituted for the usual narrow tailoring requirements. All we
know about the substitutes is that they are inferior to their
antecedents. We are told the Act must be "appropriately tailored,"
ante, at 11, "sufficiently tailored," ante, at 12, or "carefully and
appropriately addressed," ante, at 18, to the problems at hand--
anything, evidently, except narrowly tailored.

These restatements have unfortunate consequences. The first is to
make principles intended to protect speech easy to manipulate. The
words end up being a legalistic cover for an ad hoc balancing of
interests; in this respect the plurality succeeds after all in avoiding
the use of a standard. Second, the plurality's exercise in pushing
around synonyms for the words of our usual standards will sow
confusion in the courts bound by our precedents. Those courts, and
lawyers in the communications field, now will have to discern what
difference there is between the formulation the plurality applies
today and our usual strict scrutiny. I can offer little guidance, except
to note the unprotective outcome the plurality reaches here. This is
why comparisons and analogies to other areas of our First
Amendment case law become a responsibility, rather than the luxury
the plurality considers them to be. The comparisons provide
discipline to the Court and guidance for others, and give clear
content to our standards--all the things I find missing in the
plurality's opinion. The novelty and complexity of the case is a
reason to look for help from other areas of our First Amendment
jurisprudence, not a license to wander into uncharted areas of the
law with no compass other than our own opinions about good
policy.

Another troubling aspect of the plurality's approach is its suggestion
that Congress has more leeway than usual to enact restrictions on
speech where emerging technologies are concerned, because we are
unsure what standard should be used to assess them. JUSTICE
SOUTER recommends to the Court the precept "`First, do no
harm,'" ante, at 6. The question, though, is whether the harm is in
sustaining the law or striking it down. If the plurality is concerned
about technology's direction, it ought to begin by allowing speech,
not suppressing it. We have before us an urgent claim for relief
against content-based discrimination, not a dry run.

I turn now to the issues presented, and explain why strict scrutiny is
warranted.


Cable operators deliver programming from four sources:
retransmission of broadcast stations; programming purchased from
professional vendors (including national services like ESPN and
Nickelodeon) and delivered by satellite; programs created by the
cable operator itself; and access channels (PEG and leased), the two
kinds of programming at issue here. See Mueller, Note,
Controversial Programming on Cable Television's Public Access
Channels: The Limits of Governmental Response, 38 DePaul L.
Rev. 1051, 1056-1057 (1989) (hereinafter Mueller). See also
Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3).

PEG access channels grew out of local initiatives in the late 1960's
and early 1970's, before the Federal Government began regulating
cable television. Mueller 1061. Local franchising was the first form
of cable regulation, arising from the need of localities to control
access to public rights-of-way and easements and to minimize
disruption to traffic and other public activity from the laying of cable
lines. See D. Brenner, M. Price, & M. Meyerson, Cable Television
and Other Nonbroadcast Video Section 3.01[3] (1996) (hereinafter
Brenner); Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2-3)
("[T]he cable medium may depend for its very existence upon
express permission from local governing authorities"). A local
government would set up a franchise authority to oversee the cable
system and to negotiate a franchise agreement specifying the cable
operator's rights and obligations. See Brenner Section 3.01; Section
3.01[4] (discussing States where local franchising has now been
displaced by state regulation). Cf. 47 U. S. C. Section 522(10)
(defining franchise authority). A franchise, now mandatory under
federal law except for systems operating without them prior to 1984,
Section 541(b), is an authorization, akin to a license, by a franchise
authority permitting the construction or operation of a cable system.
Section 522(8). From the early 1970's onward, franchise
authorities began requiring operators to set aside access channels as
a condition of the franchise. See Mueller 1061-1062; D. Agosta, C.
Rogoff, & A. Norman, The Participate Report: A Case Study of
Public Access Cable Television in New York State 24 (1990)
(hereinafter Agosta), attached as Exhibit K to Joint Comments for
the Alliance for Community Media et al., filed with the FCC under
MM Docket No. 92-258.

The FCC entered the arena in 1972, requiring the cable companies
servicing the country's largest television markets to set aside four
access channels (one each for public, educational, governmental,
and leased programming) by a date certain, and to add channel
capacity if necessary to meet the requirement. Cable Television
Report and Order, 36 F. C. C. 2d 141, 189-198 (1972). See also
In re Amendment of Part 76 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations Concerning the Cable Television Channel Capacity and
Access Channel Requirements of Section 76.251, 59 F. C. C. 2d
294, 303, 321 (1976) (modifying the 1972 rules). We struck down
the access rules as beyond the FCC's authority under the
Communications Act of 1934. FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 440
U. S. 689, 708-709 (1979).

When Congress turned its attention to PEG access channels in 1984,
it recognized that "reasonable third-party access to cable systems
will mean a wide diversity of information sources for the public--the
fundamental goal of the First Amendment--without the need to
regulate the content of programming provided over cable."  H. R.
Rep. No. 98-934, p. 30 (1984). It declined, however, to set new
federal mandates or authorize the FCC to do so. Since "[a]lmost all
recent franchise agreements provide for access by local
governments, schools, and non-profit and community groups" over
some channels, the 1984 Act instead "continue[d] the policy of
allowing cities to specify in cable franchises that channel capacity
and other facilities be devoted to such use."  Ibid.

Section 611 of the Communications Act of 1934, added by the
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (1984 Act), authorized
local franchise authorities to require cable operators to set aside
channel capacity for PEG access when seeking new franchises or
renewal of old ones. 47 U. S. C. Section 531(b). Franchise
authorities may enforce franchise agreements, Section 531(c), but
they lack the power to impose requirements beyond those authorized
by federal law, Section 531(a). But cf. Section 557(a)
(grandfathering as valid all pre-1984 franchise agreements for the
remainder of their term). Federal law also allows a franchise
authority to "require adequate assurance that the cable operator will
provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, facilities, or financial support."  Section
541(a)(4)(B). Prior to the passage of Section 10(c) of the 1992 Act,
the cable operator, save for implementing provisions of its franchise
agreement limiting obscene or otherwise constitutionally unprotected
cable programming, Section 544(d), was forbidden any editorial
control over PEG access channels. 47 U. S. C. Section 531(e)
(1988 ed.).

Congress has not, in the 1984 Act or since, defined what public,
educational, or governmental access means or placed substantive
limits on the types of programming on those channels. Those tasks
are left to franchise agreements, so long as the channels comport in
some sense with the industry practice to which Congress referred in
the statute.

My principal concern is with public access channels (the P of PEG).
These are the channels open to programming by members of the
public. Petitioners here include public access programmers and
viewers who watch their shows. By contrast, educational and
governmental access channels (the E and G of PEG) serve other
speakers. Under many franchises, educational channels are
controlled by local school systems, which use them to provide
school information and educational programs. Governmental access
channels are committed by the cable franchise to the local municipal
government, which uses them to distribute information to
constituents on public affairs. Mueller 1065-1066. No local
governmental entity or school system has petitioned for relief in this
case, and none of the petitioners who are viewers has asserted an
interest in viewing educational or governmental programming or
briefed the relevant issues.


The public access channels established by franchise agreements tend
to have certain traits. They are available at low or no cost to
members of the public, often on a first-come, first-served basis.
Brenner Section 6.04[3][a]-[b], at 6-38. The programmer on one of
these channels most often has complete control over, as well as
liability for, the content of its show. Ibid.; Mueller 1064. The
entity managing the technical aspects of public access, such as
scheduling and transmission, is not always the cable operator; it may
be the local government or a third party that runs the access centers,
which are facilities made available for the public to produce
programs and transmit them on the access channels. Brenner
Section 6.04[7], at 6-48.

Public access channels meet the definition of a public forum. We
have recognized two kinds of public forums. The first and most
familiar are traditional public forums, like streets, sidewalks, and
parks, which by custom have long been open for public assembly
and discourse. Perry, 460 U. S., at 45; Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S.
496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.). "The second category of
public property is the designated public forum, whether of a limited
or unlimited character--property that the State has opened for
expressive activity by part or all of the public." International Soc.
for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678
(1992).

Public access channels fall in the second category. Required by the
franchise authority as a condition of the franchise and open to all
comers, they are a designated public forum of unlimited character.
The House Report for the 1984 Cable Act is consistent with this
view. It characterized public access channels as "the video
equivalent of the speaker's soapbox or the electronic parallel to the
printed leaflet. They provide groups and individuals who generally
have not had access to the electronic media with the opportunity to
become sources of information in the electronic marketplace of
ideas."  H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, at 30. Public forums do not have
to be physical gathering places, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 8-9), nor
are they limited to property owned by the government, Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense and Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800
(1985). Indeed, in the majority of jurisdictions, title to some of the
most traditional of public forums, streets and sidewalks, remains in
private hands. 10A E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations
Section 30.32 (3d ed. 1990); Hague v. CIO, supra, at 515
("Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have
immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time
out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public
questions"). Public access channels are analogous; they are public
forums even though they operate over property to which the cable
operator holds title.

It is important to understand that public access channels are public
forums created by local or state governments in the cable franchise.
Section Section 10(c) does not, as the Court of Appeals thought,
just return rightful First Amendment discretion to the cable operator,
see Alliance for Community Media, 56 F. 3d, at 114. Cable
operators have First Amendment rights, of course; restrictions on
entry into the cable business may be challenged under the First
Amendment, Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476
U. S. 488, 494 (1986), and a cable operator's activities in
originating programs or exercising editorial discretion over
programs others provide on its system also are protected, Turner
Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). But cf. id., at
___ (slip op., at 31-32) (distinguishing discretion of cable operators
from that of newspaper editors). Yet the editorial discretion of a
cable operator is a function of the cable franchise it receives from
local government. The operator's right to exercise any editorial
discretion over cable service disappears if its franchise is terminated.
See 47 U. S. C. Section 541(b) (cable service may not be offered
without a franchise); Section 546 (prescribing procedures and
standards for renewal). Cf. Brenner Section 3.07[9][a] (franchise
terms of 15 years are the norm); Section 3.07[15] (typical franchise
agreements recognize the absolute right of the franchisor to refuse
renewal at expiration of term). If the franchise is transferred to
another, so is the right of editorial discretion. The cable operator
may own the cables transmitting the signal, but it is the franchise--
the agreement between the cable operator and the local government--
that allocates some channels to the full discretion of the cable
operator while reserving others for public access.

In providing public access channels under their franchise
agreements, cable operators therefore are not exercising their own
First Amendment rights. They serve as conduits for the speech of
others. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74,
87 (1980). Section 10(c) thus restores no power of editorial
discretion over public access channels that the cable operator once
had; the discretion never existed. It vests the cable operator with a
power under federal law, defined by reference to the content of
speech, to override the franchise agreement and undercut the public
forum the agreement creates. By enacting a law in 1992 excluding
indecent programming from protection but retaining the prohibition
on cable operators' editorial control over all other protected speech,
the Federal Government at the same time ratified the public-forum
character of public access channels but discriminated against certain
speech based on its content.

The plurality refuses to analyze public access channels as public
forums because it is reluctant to decide "the extent to which private
property can be designated a public forum," ante, at 12. We need
not decide here any broad issue of whether private property can be
declared a public forum by simple governmental decree. That is not
what happens in the creation of public access channels. Rather, in
return for granting cable operators easements to use public rights-of-
way for their cable lines, local governments have bargained for a
right to use cable lines for public access channels. JUSTICE
THOMAS resists public-forum analysis because he sees no evidence
of a "formal easement." Post, at 18. Under general principles of
property law, no particular formalities are necessary to create an
easement. Easements may be created by contract. 2 G. Thompson,
Commentaries on the Modern Law of Real Property Sections 331-
332 (1980); 3 H. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property Section 776
(3d ed. 1939). A franchise agreement is a contract, and in those
agreements the cable operator surrenders his power to exclude
certain programmers from use of his property for specific purposes.
A state court confronted with the issue would likely hold the
franchise agreement to create a right of access equivalent to an
easement in land. So one can even view this case as a local
government's dedication of its own property interest to speech by
members of the public. In any event, it seems to me clear that when
a local government contracts to use private property for public
expressive activity, it creates a public forum.

Treating access channels as public forums does not just place a label
on them, as the plurality suggests, see ante, at 20. It defines the
First Amendment rights of speakers seeking to use the channels.
When property has been dedicated to public expressive activities, by
tradition or government designation, access is protected by the First
Amendment. Regulations of speech content in a designated public
forum, whether of limited or unlimited character, are "subject to the
highest scrutiny" and "survive only if they are narrowly drawn to
achieve a compelling state interest."  Lee, 505 U. S., at 678. Unless
there are reasons for applying a lesser standard, Section 10(c) must
satisfy this stringent review.


Leased access channels, as distinct from public access channels, are
those the cable operator must set aside for unaffiliated programmers
who pay to transmit shows of their own without the cable operator's
creative assistance or editorial approval. In my view, strict scrutiny
also applies to Section 10(a)'s authorization to cable operators to
exclude indecent programming from these channels.

Congress created leased access channels in the 1984 Cable Act.
Section 612 of the Act, as amended, requires a cable system with
more than 36 channels to set aside a certain percentage of its
channels (up to 15%, depending on the size of the system) "for
commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator."  47 U. S.
C. Section 532(b)(1). Commercial use means "provision of video
programming, whether or not for profit."  Section 532(b)(5). When
an unaffiliated programmer seeks access, the cable operator shall set
"the price, terms, and conditions of such use which are at least
sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the
operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable
system," Section 532(c)(1). Cf. 47 CFR Section 76.971 (1995)
(rules governing terms and conditions of leased access). The price
may not exceed the maximum charged any unaffiliated programmer
in the same program category for the use of non-access channels.
Section 76.970. Aggrieved programmers have recourse to federal
district court and the FCC (if there are repeated violations) to compel
access on appropriate terms. 47 U. S. C. Sections 532(d), (e).

Before 1992, cable operators were forbidden editorial control over
any video programming on leased access channels, and could not
consider the content of the programming except to set the price of
access, Section 532(c)(2) (1988 ed.). But cf. 47  U. S. C. Section
532(h) (prohibiting programs which are obscene or otherwise
unprotected under the Constitution on leased access channels).
Section 10(a) of the 1992 Act modifies the no-discretion rule by
allowing cable operators to reject, pursuant to a written and
published policy, programs they reasonably believe to be indecent.
Section 532(h). Under Section 10(b) of the Act, any indecent
programming must be segregated onto one channel and blocked
unless the subscriber requests that the channel be provided to him.
Section 532(j); 47 CFR Section 76.701 (1995).

Two distinctions between public and leased access channels are
important. First, whereas public access channels are required by
state and local franchise authorities (subject to certain federal
limitations), leased access channels are created by federal law.
Second, whereas cable operators never have had editorial discretion
over public access channels under their franchise agreements, the
leased access provisions of the 1984 Act take away channels the
operator once controlled. Cf. Midwest Video, 440 U. S., at 708, n.
17 (federal mandates "compelling cable operators indiscriminately to
accept access programming will interfere with their determinations
regarding the total service offering to be extended to subscribers").
In this sense, Section 10(a) now gives back to the operator some of
the discretion it had before Congress imposed leased access
requirements in the first place.

The constitutionality under Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 38-40), of requiring a cable operator to set aside leased
access channels is not before us. For purposes of this case, we
should treat the cable operator's rights in these channels as
extinguished, and address the issue these petitioners present:
namely, whether the Government can discriminate on the basis of
content in affording protection to certain programmers. I cannot
agree with JUSTICE THOMAS, post, at 11, that the cable
operator's rights inform this analysis.

Laws requiring cable operators to provide leased access are the
practical equivalent of making them common carriers, analogous in
this respect to telephone companies: They are obliged to provide a
conduit for the speech of others. The plurality resists any
classification of leased access channels (as created in the 1984 Act)
as a common carrier provision, ante, at 9, although we described in
just those terms the access (including leased access) rules
promulgated by the FCC in 1976:

"The access rules plainly impose common-carrier obligations on
cable operators. Under the rules, cable systems are required to hold
out dedicated channels on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis.
Operators are prohibited from determining or influencing the content
of access programming. And the rules delimit what operators may
charge for access and use of equipment."  Midwest Video, supra, at
701-702 (citations and footnotes omitted).


Indeed, we struck down the FCC's rules as beyond the agency's
statutory authority at the time precisely because they made cable
operators common carriers. Id., at 702-709. The FCC
characterizes Section 612 as a form of common-carrier requirement,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a-140a, as does the Government, Brief for
Federal Respondents 23.

Section 10(a) authorizes cable operators to ban indecent
programming on leased access channels. We have held that a law
precluding a common carrier from transmitting protected speech is
subject to strict scrutiny, Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 131
(striking down ban on indecent telephonic communications), but we
have not had occasion to consider the standard for reviewing a law,
such as Section 10(a), permitting a carrier in its discretion to exclude
specified speech.

Laws removing common-carriage protection from a single form of
speech based on its content should be reviewed under the same
standard as content-based restrictions on speech in a public forum.
Making a cable operator a common carrier does not create a public
forum in the sense of taking property from private control and
dedicating it to public use; rather, regulations of a common carrier
dictate the manner in which private control is exercised. A common-
carriage mandate, nonetheless, serves the same function as a public
forum. It ensures open, nondiscriminatory access to the means of
communication. This purpose is evident in the statute itself and in
the committee findings supporting it. Congress described the leased
access requirements as intended "to promote competition in the
delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that
the widest possible diversity of information sources are made
available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent
with growth and development of cable systems."  47 U. S. C.
Section 532(a). The House Committee reporting the 1984 cable bill
acknowledged that, in general, market demand would prompt cable
operators to provide diverse programming. It recognized, though,
the incentives cable operators might have to exclude "programming
which represents a social or political viewpoint that a cable operator
does not wish to disseminate, or . . . competes with a program
service already being provided by that cable system."  H. R. Rep.
No. 98-934,  at 48. In its view, the leased access provisions were
narrowly drawn structural regulations of private industry, cf.
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1 (1945), to enhance
the free flow and diversity of information available to the public
without governmental intrusion into decisions about program
content. H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, supra, at 32-35. The functional
equivalence of designating a public forum and mandating common
carriage suggests the same scrutiny should be applied to attempts in
either setting to impose content discrimination by law. Under our
precedents, the scrutiny is strict.

"The Constitution forbids a State to enforce certain exclusions from
a forum generally open to the public even if it was not required to
create the forum in the first place. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.
263 (1981) (university meeting facilities); City of Madison Joint
School District v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 429
U. S. 167 (1976) (school board meeting); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546 (1975) (municipal theater). Although
a State is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of the
facility, as long as it does so it is bound by the same standards as
apply in a traditional public forum. Reasonable time, place, and
manner regulations are permissible, and a content-based prohibition
must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest."
Perry, 460 U. S., at 45-46.

In Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972), we
made clear that selective exclusions from a public forum were
unconstitutional. Invoking the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
strike down a city ordinance allowing only labor picketing on any
public way near schools, we held the "government may not grant the
use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny
use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial
views."  Id., at 96.

"Once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some
groups, government may not prohibit others from assembling or
speaking on the basis of what they intend to say. Selective
exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone,
and may not be justified by reference to content alone."  Ibid. Since
the same standard applies to exclusions from limited or unlimited
designated public forums as from traditional forums, Lee, 505 U.
S., at 678, there is no reason the kind of selective exclusion we
condemned in Mosley should be tolerated here.

The plurality acknowledges content-based exclusions from the right
to use a common carrier could violate the First Amendment. It tells
us, however, that it is wary of analogies to doctrines developed
elsewhere, and so does not address this issue. Ante, at 19. This
newfound aversion to analogical reasoning strikes at a process basic
to legal analysis. See E. Levi, An Introduction to Legal Reasoning
1-2 (1949). I am not suggesting the plurality should look far afield
to other areas of law; these are settled First Amendment doctrines
dealing with state action depriving certain speakers of protections
afforded to all others.

In all events, the plurality's unwillingness to consider our public-
forum precedents does not relieve it of the burden of explaining why
strict scrutiny should not apply. Except in instances involving well-
settled categories of proscribable speech, see R. A. V., 505 U. S.,
at 382-390, strict scrutiny is the baseline rule for reviewing any
content-based discrimination against speech. The purpose of forum
analysis is to determine whether, because of the property or medium
where speech takes place, there should be any dispensation from
this rule. See Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service
Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U. S. 530, 538-539 (1980). In the context
of government property, we have recognized an exception "[w]here
the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal
operations, rather than acting as lawmaker with the power to
regulate or license," and in those circumstances, we have said,
regulations of speech need only be reasonable and viewpoint-
neutral. Lee, 505 U. S., at 678-679. Here, of course, the
Government has not dedicated the cable operator's property for
leased access to serve some proprietary function of its own; it has
done so to provide a forum for a vital class of programmers who
otherwise would be excluded from cable television.

The question remains whether a dispensation from strict scrutiny
might be appropriate because Section 10(a) restores in part an
editorial discretion once exercised by the cable operator over speech
occurring on its property. This is where public-forum doctrine gives
guidance. Common-carrier requirements of leased access are little
different in function from designated public forums, and no different
standard of review should apply. It is not that the functional
equivalence of leased access channels to designated public forums
compels strict scrutiny; rather, it simply militates against recognizing
an exception to the normal rule.

Perhaps, as the plurality suggests, ante, at 19-20, Section 10(a)
should be treated as a limitation on a forum rather than an exclusion
from it. This would not change the analysis, however. If
Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in
limiting a forum than in excluding someone from it, the First
Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums;
every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. See Post, Between
Governance and Management: the History and Theory of the Public
Forum, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1713, 1753 (1987). We have allowed
content-based limitations of public forums, but only when necessary
to serve specific institutional ends. See Perry, 460 U. S., at 48
(school mailboxes, if considered designated public forums, could be
limited to mailings from "organizations that engage in activities of
interest and educational relevance to students"); Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U. S. 263, 267-268, n. 5 (1981) (recognizing a public
university could limit the use of its facilities by reasonable
regulations compatible with its mission of education); Madison Joint
School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations
Comm'n, 429 U. S. 167, 175, n. 8 (1976) (in assessing a teacher's
right to speak at a school board meeting, considering it obvious that
"public bodies may confine their meetings to specified subject
matter"). The power to limit or redefine forums for a specific
legitimate purpose, see Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
8), does not allow the government to exclude certain speech or
speakers from them for any reason at all.

Madison Joint School District, supra, illustrates the point. The
Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission had ordered a school
board to prohibit school employees other than union representatives
from speaking at its meetings on matters subject to collective
bargaining between the board and the union. Id., at 173. While
recognizing the power of a State to limit school board meetings to
certain subject matter, we held it could not confine the forum "to one
category of interested individuals."  Id., at 175. The exclusion
would skew the debate and deprive decisionmakers of the benefit of
other voices. Id., at 175-176.

It is no answer to say Congress does not have to create access
channels at all, so it may limit access as it pleases. Whether or not a
government has any obligation to make railroads common carriers,
under the Equal Protection Clause it could not define common
carriage in ways that discriminate against suspect classes. See
Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 33 (1962) (per curiam) (States
may not require railroads to segregate the races). For the same
reason, even if Congress has no obligation to impose common
carriage rules on cable operators or retain them forever, it is not at
liberty to exclude certain forms of speech from their protection on
the suspect basis of content. See Perry, supra, at 45-46.

I do not foreclose the possibility that the Government could create a
forum limited to certain topics or to serving the special needs of
certain speakers or audiences without its actions being subject to
strict scrutiny. This possibility seems to trouble the plurality, which
wonders if a local government must "show a compelling state
interest if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to
classical music (but not to jazz)." Ante, at 19. This is not the correct
analogy. Our case is more akin to the Government's creation of a
band shell in which all types of music might be performed except for
rap music. The provisions here are content-based discriminations in
the strong sense of suppressing a certain form of expression that the
Government dislikes, or otherwise wishes to exclude on account of
its effects, and there is no justification for anything but strict
scrutiny here.

Giving government free rein to exclude speech it dislikes by
delimiting public forums (or common carriage provisions) would
have pernicious effects in the modern age. Minds are not changed in
streets and parks as they once were. To an increasing degree, the
more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of public
consciousness occur in mass and electronic media. Cf. United
States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 737 (1990) (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring in judgment). The extent of public entitlement to
participate in those means of communication may be changed as
technologies change; and in expanding those entitlements the
Government has no greater right to discriminate on suspect grounds
than it does when it effects a ban on speech against the backdrop of
the entitlements to which we have been more accustomed. It
contravenes the First Amendment to give Government a general
license to single out some categories of speech for lesser protection
so long as it stops short of viewpoint discrimination.


The Government advances a different argument for not applying
strict scrutiny in this case. The nature of access channels to one
side, it argues the nature of the speech in question--indecent
broadcast (or cablecast)--is subject to the lower standard of review it
contends was applied in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S.
726, 748 (1978) (upholding an FCC order declaring the radio
broadcast of indecent speech during daytime hours to be
sanctionable).

Pacifica did not purport, however, to apply a special standard for
indecent broadcasting. Emphasizing the narrowness of its holding,
the Court in Pacifica conducted a context-specific analysis of the
FCC's restriction on indecent programming during daytime hours.
See id., at 750. See also Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at
127-128 (underscoring the narrowness of Pacifica). It relied on the
general rule that "broadcasting . . . has received the most limited
First Amendment protection."  Id., at 748. We already have rejected
the application of this lower broadcast standard of review to
infringements on the liberties of cable operators, even though they
control an important communications medium. Turner
Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12-16). There is even
less cause for a lower standard here.

Pacifica did identify two important considerations relevant to the
broadcast of objectionable material. First, indecent broadcasting
"confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of
the home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly
outweighs the First Amendment rights of intruder."  438 U. S., at
748. Second, "broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even
those too young to read."  Id., at 749. Pacifica teaches that access
channels, even if analogous to ordinary public forums from the
standpoint of the programmer, must also be considered from the
standpoint of the viewer. An access channel is not a forum confined
to a discrete public space; it can bring indecent expression into the
home of every cable subscriber, where children spend astounding
amounts of time watching television, cf. ante, at 14 (citing studies).
Though in Cohen we explained that people in public areas may have
to avert their eyes from messages that offend them, 403 U. S., at
21, we further acknowledged that "government may properly act in
many situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of
unwelcome views and ideas which cannot be totally banned from the
public dialogue," ibid. See Hess v. Indiana, 414 U. S. 105, 108
(1973) (per curiam); Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728,
736-738 (1970). This is more true when the interests of children are
at stake. See id., at 738 ("[T]he householder [should not] have to
risk that offensive material come into the hands of his children
before it can be stopped").

These concerns are weighty and will be relevant to whether the law
passes strict scrutiny. They do not justify, however, a blanket rule
of lesser protection for indecent speech. Other than the few
categories of expression which can be proscribed, see R. A. V., 505
U. S., at 382-390, we have been reluctant to mark off new
categories of speech for diminished constitutional protection. Our
hesitancy reflects skepticism about the possibility of courts' drawing
principled distinctions to use in judging governmental restrictions on
speech and ideas, Cohen, supra, at 25, a concern heightened here by
the inextricability of indecency from expression. "[W]e cannot
indulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular words
without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the
process."  403 U. S., at 26. The same is true of forbidding
programs indecent in some respect. In artistic or political settings,
indecency may have strong communicative content, protesting
conventional norms or giving an edge to a work by conveying
"otherwise inexpressible emotions," Ibid. In scientific programs,
the more graphic the depiction (even if to the point of
offensiveness), the more accurate and comprehensive the portrayal
of the truth may be. Indecency often is inseparable from the ideas
and viewpoints conveyed, or separable only with loss of truth or
expressive power. Under our traditional First Amendment
jurisprudence, factors perhaps justifying some restriction on
indecent cable programming may all be taken into account without
derogating this category of protected speech as marginal.


At a minimum, the proper standard for reviewing Sections 10(a) and
(c) is strict scrutiny. The plurality gives no reason why it should be
otherwise. I would hold these enactments unconstitutional because
they are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

The Government has no compelling interest in restoring a cable
operator's First Amendment right of editorial discretion. As to
Section 10(c), Congress has no interest at all, since under most
franchises operators had no rights of editorial discretion over PEG
access channels in the first place. As to Section 10(a), any
governmental interest in restoring operator discretion over indecent
programming on leased access channels is too minimal to justify the
law. First, the transmission of indecent programming over leased
access channels is not forced speech of the operator. Turner
Broadcasting, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 31-32); PruneYard, 447 U.
S., at 87. Second, the discretion conferred by the law is slight. The
operator is not authorized to place programs of its own liking on the
leased access channels, nor to remove other speech (racist or
violent, for example) that might be offensive to it or to viewers. The
operator is just given a veto over the one kind of lawful speech
Congress disdains.

Congress does have, however, a compelling interest in protecting
children from indecent speech. Sable Communications, 492 U. S.,
at 126; Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639-640 (1968).
See also Pacifica, 438 U. S., at 749-750 (same). So long as society
gives proper respect to parental choices, it may, under an
appropriate standard, intervene to spare children exposure to
material not suitable for minors. This interest is substantial enough
to justify some regulation of indecent speech even under, I will
assume, the indecency standard used here.

Sections 10(a) and (c) nonetheless are not narrowly tailored to
protect children from indecent programs on access channels. First,
to the extent some operators may allow indecent programming,
children in localities those operators serve will be left unprotected.
Partial service of a compelling interest is not narrow tailoring. FCC
v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 396 (1984)
(asserted interest in keeping noncommercial stations free from
controversial or partisan opinions not served by ban on station
editorials, if such opinions could be aired through other
programming); The Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540-
541 (1989) (selective ban on publication of rape victim's name in
some media but not others not narrowly tailored). Cf. Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 73 (1983) (restriction
that "provides only the most limited incremental support for the
interest asserted" cannot pass muster under commercial-speech
standards). Put another way, the interest in protecting children from
indecency only at the caprice of the cable operator is not compelling.
Perhaps Congress drafted the law this way to avoid the clear
constitutional difficulties of banning indecent speech from access
channels, but the First Amendment does not permit this sort of ill fit
between a law restricting speech and the interest it is said to serve.

Second, to the extent cable operators prohibit indecent programming
on access channels, not only children but adults will be deprived of
it. The Government may not "reduce the adult population . . . to
[viewing] only what is fit for children."  Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.
S. 380, 383 (1957). It matters not that indecent programming might
be available on the operator's other channels. The Government has
no legitimate interest in making access channels pristine. A block-
and-segregate requirement similar to Section 10(b), but without its
constitutional infirmity of requiring persons to place themselves on a
list to receive programming, see ante, at 26-27, protects children
with far less intrusion on the liberties of programmers and adult
viewers than allowing cable operators to ban indecent programming
from access channels altogether. When applying strict scrutiny, we
will not assume plausible alternatives will fail to protect compelling
interests; there must be some basis in the record, in legislative
findings or otherwise, establishing the law enacted as the least
restrictive means. Sable Communications, supra, at 128-130. Cf.
Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 40-45).
There is none here.

Sections 10(a) and (c) present a classic case of discrimination
against speech based on its content. There are legitimate reasons
why the Government might wish to regulate or even restrict the
speech at issue here, but Sections 10(a) and 10(c) are not drawn to
address those reasons with the precision the First Amendment
requires.


Not only does the plurality fail to apply strict scrutiny, but its
reasoning is unpersuasive on its own terms.

The plurality declares Section 10(c) unconstitutional because it
interferes with local supervisory systems that "can set programming
policy and approve or disapprove particular programming services."
Ante, at 32-33. Replacing these local schemes with a cable operator
veto would, in the plurality's view, "greatly increase the risk that
certain categories of programming (say, borderline offensive
programs) will not appear," ante, at 37. Although the plurality terms
these local schemes "public/nonprofit programming control
systems," ante, at 34, it does not contend (nor does the record
suggest) that any local board or access center has the authority to
exclude indecent programming, or to do anything that would cast
doubt on the status of public access channels as public forums. Cf.
Agosta 88 (New York state law forbids editorial control over public
access programs by either the cable operator or the municipality);
Comments of Hillsborough County Board of County
Commissioners, FCC Record, at 2 (explaining county's inability to
exclude indecent programming). Indeed, "[m]ost access centers
surveyed do not prescreen at all, except, as in [two named
localities], a high speed run-through for technical quality."  P.
Aufderheide, Public Access Cable Programming, Controversial
Speech, and Free Expression (1992), reprinted in App. 61, 68. As
the plurality acknowledges, the record indicates no response to
indecent programming by local access centers (whether they
prescreen or not) other than "requiring indemnification by
programmers, certification of compliance with local standards, time
segregation, [and] adult content advisories," ante, at 33. Those are
measures that, if challenged, would likely survive strict scrutiny as
narrowly tailored to safeguard children. If those measures, in the
words of the plurality, "normally avoid, minimize, or eliminate any
child-related problems concerning `patently offensive'
programming" on public access channels, ante, at 34, one is left to
wonder why the cable operator veto over leased access
programming authorized in Section 10(a) is constitutional even
under the plurality's First Amendment analysis. Although I concur
in its judgment that Section 10(c) is invalid, I cannot agree with the
plurality's reasoning.

In regard to Section 10(a), the plurality's analysis there undermines
its claims of faithfulness to our First Amendment jurisprudence and
close attention to context.

First, the plurality places some weight on there being "nothing to
stop `adults who feel the need' from finding [indecent]
programming elsewhere, say, on tape or in theaters," or on
competitive services like direct broadcast television, ante, at 15. The
availability of alternative channels of communication may be relevant
when we are assessing content-neutral time, place, and manner
restrictions, Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791,
802 (1989), but the fact that speech can occur elsewhere cannot
justify a content-based restriction, Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.
S., at 556; Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147,
163 (1939).

Second, the plurality suggests the permissive nature of Section 10(a)
at least does not create the same risk of exclusion as a total ban on
indecency. Ante, at 15. This states the obvious, but the possibility
the Government could have imposed more draconian limitations on
speech never has justified a lesser abridgment. Indeed, such an
argument almost always is available; few of our First Amendment
cases involve outright bans on speech. See, e. g., Forsyth County
v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 130-137 (1992) (broad
discretion of county administrator to award parade permits and to
adjust permit fee according to content of speech violates First
Amendment); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58 (1963)
(informal threats to recommend criminal prosecutions and other
pressure tactics by state morality commission against book
publishers violate the First Amendment).

Third, based on its own factual speculations, the plurality discounts
the risks created by the law that operators will not run indecent
programming on access channels. The plurality takes "a glance at
the programming that cable operators allow on their own (non-
access) channels," and, espying some indecent programming there,
supposes some cable operators may be willing to allow similar
programs on leased access channels. Ante, at 15. This sort of
surmise, giving the government the benefit of the doubt when it
restricts speech, is an unusual approach to the First Amendment, to
put it mildly. Worse, it ignores evidence of industry structure that
should cast doubt on the plurality's sanguine view of the probable
fate of programming considered "indecent" under Section 10(a). The
plurality fails to note that, aside from the indecency provisions of
Section 10 tacked on in a Senate floor amendment, the 1992 Act
strengthened the regulation of leased access channels because it was
feared cable operators would exercise their substantial market power
to exclude disfavored programmers. The congressional findings in
the statute and the conclusions of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation after more than two years
of hearings on the cable market, see S. Rep. No. 102-92, pp. 3-4
(1991), are instructive. Leased access channels had been underused
since their inception in 1984, the Senate Committee determined.
Id., at 30. Though it recognized the adverse economics of leased
access for programmers may have been one reason for the
underutilization, the Committee found the obstinacy of cable
operators and their control over prices, terms, and conditions also
were to blame. Id., at 31.

"The cable operator is almost certain to have interests that clash with
that of the programmer seeking to use leased access channels. If
their interests were similar, the operator would have been more than
willing to carry the programmer on regular cable channels. The
operator thus has already decided for any number of reasons not to
carry the programmer. For example, the operator may believe that
the programmer might compete with programming that the
[operator] owns or controls. To permit the operator to establish the
leased access rate thus makes little sense."  Ibid.

Perhaps some operators will choose to show the indecent
programming they now may banish if they can command a better
price than other access programmers are willing to pay. In the main,
however, leased access programs are the ones the cable operator, for
competitive reasons or otherwise, has no interest in showing. And
because the cable operator may put to his own commercial use any
leased access capacity not taken by unaffiliated programmers, 47 U.
S. C. Section 532(b)(4), operators have little incentive to allow
indecent programming if they have excess capacity on leased access
channels.

There is even less reason to think cable operators will choose to
show indecent programs on public access channels. The operator is
not paid, or paid much, for transmitting programs on these channels;
public access programs may compete with the operator's own
programs; the operator will wish to avoid unwanted controversy;
and, here as with leased access channels, the operator may reclaim
unused PEG capacity for its own paid use, 47 U. S. C. Section
531(d)(1).

In the 1992 Act, Congress recognized cable operators might want to
exclude unaffiliated or otherwise disfavored programmers from their
channels, but it granted operators discretion to do so in regard to but
a single category of speech. The obvious consequence invited by
the discretion is exclusion. I am not sure why the plurality would
suppose otherwise, or contend the practical consequences of Section
10(a) would be no worse for programmers than those flowing from
the sort of time-segregation requirement approved in Pacifica. See
ante, at 16. Despite its claim of making "a more contextual
assessment" of this case, ante, at 18, the plurality ignores a key
difference of this case from Pacifica. There, the broadcaster wanted
to air the speech in question; here, the cable operator does not. So
the safe harbor of late-night programming permitted by the FCC in
Pacifica would likely promote speech, whereas suppression will
follow from Section 10(a).


In agreement with the plurality's analysis of Section 10(b) of the
Act, insofar as it applies strict scrutiny, I join Part III of its opinion.
Its position there, however, cannot be reconciled with upholding
Section 10(a). In the plurality's view, Section 10(b), which
standing alone would guarantee an indecent programmer some
access to a cable audience, violates the First Amendment, but
Section 10(a), which authorizes exclusion of indecent programming
from access channels altogether, does not. There is little to
commend this logic or result. I dissent from the judgment of the
Court insofar as it upholds the constitutionality of Section 10(a).

*The Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, Sections
506(a), (b), 110 Stat. 136, 137, permits a cable operator to refuse to
transmit any leased or public access program or portion thereof
which contains "obscenity, indecency, or nudity."  The
constitutionality of the 1996 amendments, to the extent they differ
from the provisions here, is not before us.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
CIRCUIT

[June 28, 1996]

JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by the CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.

I agree with the plurality's conclusion that Section 10(a) is
constitutionally permissible, but I disagree with its conclusion that
Sections 10(b) and (c) violate the First Amendment. For many
years, we have failed to articulate how and to what extent the First
Amendment protects cable operators, programmers, and viewers
from state and federal regulation. I think it is time we did so, and I
cannot go along with the plurality's assiduous attempts to avoid
addressing that issue openly.


The text of the First Amendment makes no distinction between print,
broadcast, and cable media, but we have done so. In Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969), we held that, in
light of the scarcity of broadcasting frequencies, the Government
may require a broadcast licensee "to share his frequency with others
and to conduct himself as a proxy or fiduciary with obligations to
present those views and voices which are representative of his
community and which would otherwise, by necessity, be barred
from the airwaves."  Id., at 389. We thus endowed the public with
a right of access "to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas
and experiences."  Id., at 390. That public right left broadcasters
with substantial, but not complete, First Amendment protection of
their editorial discretion. See, e. g., Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94,
117-118 (1973) ("A broadcast licensee has a large measure of
journalistic freedom but not as large as that exercised by a
newspaper").

In contrast, we have not permitted that level of government
interference in the context of the print media. In Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974), for instance, we
invalidated a Florida statute that required newspapers to allow, free
of charge, a right of reply to political candidates whose personal or
professional character the paper assailed. We rejected the claim that
the statute was constitutional because it fostered speech rather than
restricted it, as well as a related claim that the newspaper could
permissibly be made to serve as a public forum. Id., at 256-258.
We also flatly rejected the argument that the newspaper's alleged
media monopoly could justify forcing the paper to speak in
contravention of its own editorial discretion. Id., at 256.

Our First Amendment distinctions between media, dubious from
their infancy,1  placed cable in a doctrinal wasteland in which
regulators and cable operators alike could not be sure whether cable
was entitled to the substantial First Amendment protections afforded
the print media or was subject to the more onerous obligations
shouldered by the broadcast media. See Los Angeles v. Preferred
Communications, Inc., 476 U. S. 488, 496 (1986) (Blackmun, J.,
concurring) ("In assessing First Amendment claims concerning
cable access, the Court must determine whether the characteristics of
cable television make it sufficiently analogous to another medium to
warrant application of an already existing standard or whether those
characteristics require a new analysis"). Over time, however, we
have drawn closer to recognizing that cable operators should enjoy
the same First Amendment rights as the nonbroadcast media.

Our first ventures into the world of cable regulation involved no
claims arising under the First Amendment, and we addressed only
the FCC's regulatory authority over cable operators.2   Only in later
cases did we begin to address the level of First Amendment
protection applicable to cable operators. In Preferred
Communications, for instance, when a cable operator challenged the
City of Los Angeles' auction process for a single cable franchise,
we held that the cable operator had stated a First Amendment claim
upon which relief could be granted. 476 U. S., at 493. We noted
that cable operators communicate various topics "through original
programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which
stations or programs to include in [their] repertoire."  Id., at 494.
Cf. FCC v. Midwest Video Corp. (Midwest Video II), 440 U. S.
689, 707 (1979) ("Cable operators now share with broadcasters a
significant amount of editorial discretion regarding what their
programming will include"). But we then likened the operators'
First Amendment interests to those of broadcasters subject to Red
Lion's right of access requirement. 476 U. S., at 494-495.

Five years later, in Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439 (1991), we
dropped any reference to the relaxed scrutiny permitted by Red
Lion. Arkansas had subjected cable operators to the State's general
sales tax, while continuing to exempt newspapers, magazines, and
scrambled satellite broadcast television. Cable operators, among
others, challenged the tax on First Amendment grounds, arguing
that the State could not discriminatorily apply the tax to some, but
not all, members of the press. Though we ultimately upheld the tax
scheme because it was not content-based, we agreed with the
operators that they enjoyed the protection of the First Amendment.
We found that cable operators engage in speech by providing news,
information, and entertainment to their subscribers and that they are
"part of the `press.'"  Id., at 444.

Two Terms ago, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. __ (1994), we stated expressly what we had implied in
Leathers: The Red Lion standard does not apply to cable television.
512 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 12) ("[T]he rationale for applying a
less rigorous standard of First Amendment scrutiny to broadcast
regulation . . . does not apply in the context of cable regulation");
id., at __ (slip op., at 14) ("[A]pplication of the more relaxed
standard of scrutiny adopted in Red Lion and the other broadcast
cases is inapt when determining the First Amendment validity of
cable regulation"). While Members of the Court disagreed about
whether the must-carry rules imposed by Congress were content-
based, and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, there was agreement
that cable operators are generally entitled to much the same First
Amendment protection as the print media. But see id., at __ (slip
op., at 1) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) ("Cable operators' control of essential facilities provides a
basis for intrusive regulation that would be inappropriate and
perhaps impermissible for other communicative media").

In Turner, by adopting much of the print paradigm, and by rejecting
Red Lion, we adopted with it a considerable body of precedent that
governs the respective First Amendment rights of competing
speakers. In Red Lion, we had legitimized consideration of the
public interest and emphasized the rights of viewers, at least in the
abstract. Under that view, "[i]t is the right of the viewers and
listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount."
395 U. S., at 390. After Turner, however, that view can no longer
be given any credence in the cable context. It is the operator's right
that is preeminent. If Tornillo and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v.
Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1 (1986), are
applicable, and I think they are, see Turner, supra, at __ (slip op., at
8-9) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),
then, when there is a conflict, a programmer's asserted right to
transmit over an operator's cable system must give way to the
operator's editorial discretion. Drawing an analogy to the print
media, for example, the author of a book is protected in writing the
book, but has no right to have the book sold in a particular book
store without the store owner's consent. Nor can government force
the editor of a collection of essays to print other essays on the same
subject.

The Court in Turner found that the FCC's must-carry rules
implicated the First Amendment rights of both cable operators and
cable programmers. The rules interfered with the operators'
editorial discretion by forcing them to carry broadcast programming
that they might not otherwise carry, and they interfered with the
programmers' ability to compete for space on the operators'
channels. Id., at __ (slip op., at 19-20); id., at __ (slip op., at 1-2)
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We
implicitly recognized in Turner that the programmer's right to
compete for channel space is derivative of, and subordinate to, the
operator's editorial discretion. Like a freelance writer seeking a
paper in which to publish newspaper editorials, a programmer is
protected in searching for an outlet for cable programming, but has
no free-standing First Amendment right to have that programming
transmitted. Cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.
S., at 256-258. Likewise, the rights of would-be viewers are
derivative of the speech rights of operators and programmers. Cf.
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 756-757 (1976) ("Freedom of speech
presupposes a willing speaker. But where a speaker exists, . . . the
protection afforded is to the communication, to its source and to its
recipients both"). Viewers have a general right to see what a willing
operator transmits, but, under Tornillo and Pacific Gas, they
certainly have no right to force an unwilling operator to speak.

By recognizing the general primacy of the cable operator's editorial
rights over the rights of programmers and viewers, Turner raises
serious questions about the merits of petitioners' claims. None of
the petitioners in these cases are cable operators; they are all cable
viewers or access programmers or their representative organizations.
See Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-124, pp. 5-6; Brief for
Petitioners New York Citizens Committee for Responsible Media et
al., in No. 95-227, p. 3; Brief for Petitioners Alliance for
Community Media et al., in No. 95-227, p. 3. It is not intuitively
obvious that the First Amendment protects the interests petitioners
assert, and neither petitioners nor the plurality have adequately
explained the source or justification of those asserted rights.

JUSTICE BREYER's detailed explanation of why he believes it is
"unwise and unnecessary," ante, at 11, to choose a standard against
which to measure petitioners' First Amendment claims largely
disregards our recent attempt in Turner to define that standard.3
His attempt to distinguish Turner on the ground that it did not
involve "the effects of television viewing on children," ante, at 18,
is meaningless because that factual distinction has no bearing on the
existence and ordering of the free speech rights asserted in these
cases.

In the process of deciding not to decide on a governing standard,
JUSTICE BREYER purports to discover in our cases an expansive,
general principle permitting government to "directly regulate speech
to address extraordinary problems, where its regulations are
appropriately tailored to resolve those problems without imposing an
unnecessarily great restriction on speech." Ante, at 11. This
heretofore unknown standard is facially subjective and openly
invites balancing of asserted speech interests to a degree not
ordinarily permitted. It is true that the standard I endorse lacks the
"flexibility" inherent in the plurality's balancing approach, ante, at 9,
but that relative rigidity is required by our precedents and is not of
my own making.

In any event, even if the plurality's balancing test were an
appropriate standard, it could only be applied to protect speech
interests that, under the circumstances, are themselves protected by
the First Amendment. But, by shifting the focus to the balancing of
"complex" interests, ante, at 13, JUSTICE BREYER never explains
whether (and if so, how) a programmer's ordinarily unprotected
interest in affirmative transmission of its programming acquires
constitutional significance on leased and public access channels.
See ante, at 12 ("interests of programmers in maintaining access
channels"); ante, at 13 ("interests served by the access
requirements"). It is that question, left unanswered by the plurality,
to which I now turn.


In 1984, Congress enacted 47 U. S. C. Section 532(b), which
generally requires cable operators to reserve approximately 10 to 15
percent of their available channels for commercial lease to
"unaffiliated persons."  Operators were prohibited from
"exercis[ing] any editorial control" over these leased access
channels. Section 532(c)(2). In 1992, Congress withdrew part of
its prohibition on the exercise of the cable operators' editorial control
and essentially permitted operators to censor privately programming
that the "operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner."
Section 532(h).

Since 1984, federal law has also permitted local franchise authorities
to require cable operators to set aside certain channels for "public,
educational, or governmental use" (PEG channels),4  Section
531(a), but unlike the leased access provisions, has not directly
required operators to do so. As with leased access, Congress
generally prohibited cable operators from exercising "any editorial
control" over public access channels, but provided that operators
could prohibit the transmission of obscene programming. Section
531(e); see Section 544(d). Section 10(c) of the 1992 Act
broadened the operators' editorial control and instructed the FCC to
promulgate regulations enabling a cable operator to ban from its
public access channels "any programming which contains obscene
material, sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting or
promoting unlawful conduct."  Note following 47 U. S. C. Section
531. The FCC subsequently promulgated regulations in its Second
Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd 2638 (1993). The FCC interpreted
Congress' reference to "sexually explicit conduct" to mean that the
programming must be indecent, and its regulations therefore permit
cable operators to ban indecent programming from their public
access channels. Id., at 2640.

As I read these provisions, they provide leased and public access
programmers with an expansive and federally enforced statutory
right to transmit virtually any programming over access channels,
limited only by the bounds of decency. It is no doubt true that once
programmers have been given, rightly or wrongly, the ability to
speak on access channels, the First Amendment continues to protect
programmers from certain government intrusions. Certainly, under
our current jurisprudence, Congress could not impose a total ban on
the transmission of indecent programming. See Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 127 (1989)
(striking down total ban on indecent dial-a-porn messages). At the
same time, however, the Court has not recognized, as entitled to full
constitutional protection, statutorily created speech rights that
directly conflict with the constitutionally protected private speech
rights of another person or entity.5   We have not found a First
Amendment violation in statutory schemes that substantially expand
the speech opportunities of the person or entity challenging the
scheme.

There is no getting around the fact that leased and public access are a
type of forced speech. Though the constitutionality of leased and
public access channels is not directly at issue in these cases,6  the
position adopted by the Court in Turner ineluctably leads to the
conclusion that the federal access requirements are subject to some
form of heightened scrutiny. See Turner, 512 U. S., at __ (slip
op., at 38) (citing Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781
(1989); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968)). Under
that view, content-neutral governmental impositions on an
operator's editorial discretion may be sustained only if they further
an important governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of
free speech and are no greater than is essential to further the asserted
interest. See id., at 377. Of course, the analysis I joined in Turner
would have required strict scrutiny. 512 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 7-
9) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Petitioners must concede that cable access is not a constitutionally
required entitlement and that the right they claim to leased and public
access has, by definition, been governmentally created at the
expense of cable operators' editorial discretion. Just because the
Court has apparently accepted, for now, the proposition that the
Constitution permits some degree of forced speech in the cable
context does not mean that the beneficiaries of a government-
imposed forced speech program enjoy additional First Amendment
protections beyond those normally afforded to purely private
speakers.

We have said that "[i]n the realm of private speech or expression,
government regulation may not favor one speaker over another,"
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. __,
__ (1995) (slip op., at 7), but this principle hardly supports
petitioners' claims, for, if they do anything, the leased and public
access requirements favor access programmers over cable operators.
I do not see Sections 10(a) and (c) as independent restrictions on
programmers, but as intricate parts of the leased and public access
restrictions imposed by Congress (and state and local governments)
on cable operators. The question petitioners pose is whether
Sections 10(a) and (c) are improper restrictions on their free speech
rights, but Turner strongly suggests that the proper question is
whether the leased and public access requirements (with Sections
10(a) and (c)) are improper restrictions on the operators' free speech
rights. In my view, the constitutional presumption properly runs in
favor of the operators' editorial discretion, and that discretion may
not be burdened without a compelling reason for doing so.
Petitioners' view that the constitutional presumption favors their
asserted right to speak on access channels is directly contrary to
Turner and our established precedents.


It is one thing to compel an operator to carry leased and public
access speech, in apparent violation of Tornillo, but it is another
thing altogether to say that the First Amendment forbids Congress to
give back part of the operators' editorial discretion, which all
recognize as fundamentally protected, in favor of a broader access
right. It is no answer to say that leased and public access are content
neutral and that Sections 10(a) and (c) are not, for that does not
change the fundamental fact, which petitioners never address, that it
is the operators' journalistic freedom that is infringed, whether the
challenged restrictions be content neutral or content based.

Because the access provisions are part of a scheme that restricts the
free speech rights of cable operators, and expands the speaking
opportunities of access programmers, who have no underlying
constitutional right to speak through the cable medium, I do not
believe that access programmers can challenge the scheme, or a
particular part of it, as an abridgment of their "freedom of speech."
Outside the public forum doctrine, discussed infra, at 15-21,
government intervention that grants access programmers an
opportunity to speak that they would not otherwise enjoy--and
which does not directly limit programmers' underlying speech
rights--cannot be an abridgement of the same programmers' First
Amendment rights, even if the new speaking opportunity is content-
based.

The permissive nature of Sections 10(a) and (c) is important in this
regard. If Congress had forbidden cable operators to carry indecent
programming on leased and public access channels, that law would
have burdened the programmer's right, recognized in Turner, supra,
at __ (slip op., at 20), to compete for space on an operator's system.
The Court would undoubtedly strictly scrutinize such a law. See
Sable, 492 U. S., at 126. But Sections 10(a) and (c) do not burden
a programmer's right to seek access for its indecent programming on
an operator's system. Rather, they merely restore part of the
editorial discretion an operator would have absent government
regulation without burdening the programmer's underlying speech
rights.7

The First Amendment challenge, if one is to be made, must come
from the party whose constitutionally protected freedom of speech
has been burdened. Viewing the federal access requirements as a
whole, it is the cable operator, not the access programmer,8  whose
speech rights have been infringed. Consequently, it is the operator,
and not the programmer, whose speech has arguably been infringed
by these provisions. If Congress passed a law forcing bookstores
to sell all books published on the subject of congressional politics,
we would undoubtedly entertain a claim by bookstores that this law
violated the First Amendment principles established in Tornillo and
Pacific Gas. But I doubt that we would similarly find merit in a
claim by publishers of gardening books that the law violated their
First Amendment rights. If that is so, then the petitioners in these
cases cannot reasonably assert that the Court should strictly
scrutinize the provisions at issue in a way that maximizes their
ability to speak over leased and public access channels and, by
necessity, minimizes the operators' discretion.


It makes no difference that the leased access restrictions may take the
form of common carrier obligations. See Midwest Video II, 440 U.
S., at 701; see also Brief for Federal Respondents 23. But see 47
U. S. C. Section 541(c) ("Any cable system shall not be subject to
regulation as a common carrier or utility by reason of providing any
cable service"). That the leased access provisions may be described
in common-carrier terms does not demonstrate that access
programmers have obtained a First Amendment right to transmit
programming over leased access channels. Labeling leased access a
common carrier scheme has no real First Amendment consequences.
It simply does not follow from common carrier status that cable
operators may not, with Congress' blessing, decline to carry
indecent speech on their leased access channels. Common carriers
are private entities and may, consistent with the First Amendment,
exercise editorial discretion in the absence of a specific statutory
prohibition. Concurring in Sable, JUSTICE SCALIA explained: "I
note that while we hold the Constitution prevents Congress from
banning indecent speech in this fashion, we do not hold that the
Constitution requires public utilities to carry it."  492 U. S., at 133.
See also Information Providers' Coalition for Defense of First
Amendment v. FCC, 928 F. 2d 866, 877 (CA9 1991) ("[A] carrier
is free under the Constitution to terminate service to dial-a-porn
operators altogether"); Carlin Communications, Inc. v. Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph Co., 827 F. 2d 1291, 1297 (CA9
1987) (same), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 1029 (1988); Carlin
Communication, Inc. v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph
Co., 802 F. 2d 1352, 1357 (CA11 1986) (same).

Nothing about common carrier status per se constitutionalizes the
asserted interests of the petitioners in these cases, and JUSTICE
KENNEDY provides no authority for his assertion that common
carrier regulations "should be reviewed under the same standard as
content-based restrictions on speech in a public forum." Ante, at 19.
Whether viewed as the creation of a common carrier scheme or
simply as a regulatory restriction on cable operators' editorial
discretion, the net effect is the same: operators' speech rights are
restricted to make room for access programmers. Consequently, the
fact that the leased access provisions impose a form of common
carrier obligation on cable operators does not alter my view that
Congress' leased access scheme burdens the constitutionally
protected speech rights of cable operators in order to expand the
speaking opportunities of access programmers, but does not
independently burden the First Amendment rights of programmers
or viewers.


Petitioners argue that public access channels are public fora in which
they have First Amendment rights to speak and that Section 10(c) is
invalid because it imposes content-based burdens on those rights.
Brief for Petitioners New York Citizens Committee for Responsible
Media et al., in No. 95-227, pp. 8-23; Brief for Petitioners Alliance
for Community Media et al., in No. 95-227, pp. 32-35. Though I
agree that content-based prohibitions in a public forum "must be
narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest," Perry Ed.
Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 46 (1983), I
do not agree with petitioners' antecedent assertion that public access
channels are public fora.

We have said that government may designate public property for use
by the public as a place for expressive activity and that, so
designated, that property becomes a public forum. Id., at 45.
Petitioners argue that "[a] local government does exactly that by
requiring as a condition of franchise approval that the cable operator
set aside a public access channel for the free use of the general
public on a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis."9
Brief for Petitioners Alliance for Community Media et al., in No.
95-227, p. 33. I disagree.

Cable systems are not public property.10   Cable systems are
privately owned and privately managed, and petitioners point to no
case in which we have held that government may designate private
property as a public forum. The public forum doctrine is a rule
governing claims of "a right of access to public property," Perry Ed.
Assn., supra, at 44, and has never been thought to extend beyond
property generally understood to belong to the government. See
International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.
S. 672, 681 (1992) (evidence of expressive activity at rail stations,
bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island was "irrelevant to public fora
analysis, because sites such as bus and rail terminals traditionally
have had private ownership" (emphasis in original)). See also id.,
at 678 (public forum is "government" or "public" property); Perry
Ed. Assn., supra, at 45 (designated public forum "consists of public
property").

Petitioners point to dictum in Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &
Educ. Fund, 473 U. S. 788, 801 (1985), that a public forum may
consist of "private property dedicated to public use," but that
statement has no applicability here. That statement properly refers to
the common practice of formally dedicating land for streets and
parks when subdividing real estate for developments. See 1A C.
Antieau & J. Antieau, Antieau's Local Government Law Section
9.05 (1991); 11A E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations
Section 33.03 (3d ed. 1991). Such dedications may or may not
transfer title, but they at least create enforceable public easements in
the dedicated land. 1A Antieau, supra, Section 9.15; 11A
McQuillin, supra, Section 33.68. To the extent that those easements
create a property interest in the underlying land, it is that
government-owned property interest that may be designated as a
public forum.

It may be true, as petitioners argue, that title is not dispositive of the
public forum analysis, but the nature of the regulatory restrictions
placed on cable operators by local franchising authorities are not
consistent with the kinds of governmental property interests we have
said may be formally dedicated as public fora. Our public forum
cases have involved property in which the government has held at
least some formal easement or other property interest permitting the
government to treat the property as its own in designating the
property as a public forum. See, e. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S.
496, 515 (1939) (streets and parks); Police Dept. of Chicago v.
Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972) (sidewalks adjoining public
school); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546,
555 (1975) (theater under long-term lease to city); Carey v. Brown,
447 U. S. 455, 460-462 (1980) (sidewalks in front of private
residence); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 267-268 (1981)
(university facilities that had been opened for student activities).
That is simply not true in these cases. Pursuant to federal and state
law, franchising authorities require cable operators to create public
access channels, but nothing in the record suggests that local
franchising authorities take any formal easement or other property
interest in those channels that would permit the government to
designate that property as a public forum.11

Similarly, assertion of government control over private property
cannot justify designation of that property as a public forum. We
have expressly stated that neither government ownership nor
government control will guarantee public access to property. See
Cornelius, supra, at 803; Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh
Civic Assns., 453 U. S. 114, 129 (1981). Government control
over its own property or private property in which it has taken a
cognizable property interest, like the theater in Southeastern
Promotions, is consistent with designation of a public forum. But
we have never even hinted that regulatory control, and particularly
direct regulatory control over a private entity's First Amendment
speech rights, could justify creation of a public forum. Properly
construed, our cases have limited the government's ability to declare
a public forum to property the government owns outright, or in
which the government holds a significant property interest consistent
with the communicative purpose of the forum to be designated.

Nor am I convinced that a formal transfer of a property interest in
public access channels would suffice to permit a local franchising
authority to designate those channels as a public forum. In no other
public forum that we have recognized does a private entity, owner or
not, have the obligation not only to permit another to speak, but to
actually help produce and then transmit the message on that person's
behalf. Cable operators regularly retain some level of managerial
and operational control over their public access channels, subject
only to the requirements of federal, state, and local law and the
franchise agreement. In more traditional public fora, the government
shoulders the burden of administering and enforcing the openness of
the expressive forum, but it is frequently a private citizen, the
operator, who shoulders that burden for public access channels.
For instance, it is often the operator who must accept and schedule
an access programmer's request for time on a channel.12   And, in
many places, the operator is actually obligated to provide production
facilities and production assistance to persons seeking to produce
access programming.13   Moreover, unlike a park picketer, an
access programmer cannot transmit its own message. Instead, it is
the operator who must transmit, or "speak," the access
programmer's message. That the speech may be considered the
operator's is driven home by 47 U. S. C. Section 559, which
authorizes a fine of up to $10,000 and two years' imprisonment for
any person who "transmits over any cable system any matter which
is obscene."  See also Section 558 (making operators immune for all
public access programming, except that which is obscene).14

Thus, even were I inclined to view public access channels as public
property, which I am not, the numerous additional obligations
imposed on the cable operator in managing and operating the public
access channels convince me that these channels share few, if any,
of the basic characteristics of a public forum. As I have already
indicated, public access requirements, in my view, are a regulatory
restriction on the exercise of cable operators' editorial discretion, not
a transfer of a sufficient property interest in the channels to support a
designation of that property as a public forum. Public access
channels are not public fora, and, therefore, petitioners' attempt to
redistribute cable speech rights in their favor must fail. For this
reason, and the other reasons articulated earlier, I would sustain
both Section 10(a) and Section 10(c).


Most sexually oriented programming appears on premium or pay-
per-view channels that are naturally blocked from nonpaying
customers by market forces, see First Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd
998, 1001, n. 20 (1993), and it is only governmental intervention in
the first instance that requires access channels, on which indecent
programming may appear, to be made part of the basic cable
package. Section 10(b) does nothing more than adjust the nature of
government-imposed leased access requirements in order to emulate
the market forces that keep indecent programming primarily on
premium channels (without permitting the operator to charge
subscribers for that programming).

Unlike Sections 10(a) and (c), Section 10(b) clearly implicates
petitioners' free speech rights. Though Section 10(b) by no means
bans indecent speech, it clearly places content-based restrictions on
the transmission of private speech by requiring cable operators to
block and segregate indecent programming that the operator has
agreed to carry. Consequently, Section 10(b) must be subjected to
strict scrutiny and can be upheld only if it furthers a compelling
governmental interest by the least restrictive means available. See
Sable, 492 U. S., at 126. The parties agree that Congress has a
"compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological
well-being of minors" and that its interest "extends to shielding
minors from the influence of [indecent speech] that is not obscene
by adult standards."  Ibid. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S.
629, 639 (1968) (persons "who have th[e] primary responsibility
for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed
to aid discharge of that responsibility"). Because Section 10(b) is
narrowly tailored to achieve that well-established compelling
interest, I would uphold it. I therefore dissent from the Court's
decision to the contrary.

Our precedents establish that government may support parental
authority to direct the moral upbringing of their children by
imposing a blocking requirement as a default position. For
example, in Ginsberg, in which we upheld a State's ability to
prohibit the sale of indecent literature to minors, we pointed out that
the State had simply imposed its own default choice by noting that
"the prohibition against sales to minors does not bar parents who so
desire from purchasing the magazines for their children."  390 U.
S., at 639. Likewise, in Sable we set aside a complete ban on
indecent dial-a-porn messages in part because the FCC had
previously imposed certain default rules intended to prevent access
by minors, and there was no evidence that those rules were
ineffective. 492 U. S., at 128-130.15

The Court strikes down Section 10(b) by pointing to alternatives,
such as reverse-blocking and lockboxes, that it says are less
restrictive than segregation and blocking. Though these methods
attempt to place in parents' hands the ability to permit their children
to watch as little, or as much, indecent programming as the parents
think proper, they do not effectively support parents' authority to
direct the moral upbringing of their children. See First Report and
Order, 8 FCC Rcd, at 1000-1001.16   The FCC recognized that
leased-access programming comes "from a wide variety of
independent sources, with no single editor controlling [its] selection
and presentation."  Id., at 1000. Thus, indecent programming on
leased access channels is "especially likely to be shown randomly or
intermittently between non-indecent programs."  Ibid. Rather than
being able to simply block out certain channels at certain times, a
subscriber armed with only a lockbox must carefully monitor all
leased-access programming and constantly reprogram the lockbox to
keep out undesired programming. Thus, even assuming that cable
subscribers generally have the technical proficiency to properly
operate a lockbox, by no means a given, this distinguishing
characteristic of leased access channels makes lockboxes and
reverse-blocking largely ineffective.

Petitioners argue that Section 10(b)'s segregation and blocking
scheme is not sufficiently narrowly tailored because it requires the
viewer's "written consent," 47 CFR Section 76.701(b) (1995); it
permits the cable operator 30 days to respond to the written request
for access, Section 76.701(c); and it is impermissibly underinclusive
because it reaches only leased access programming.

Relying on Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965),
petitioners argue that forcing customers to submit a written request
for access will chill dissemination of speech. In Lamont, we struck
down a statute barring the mail delivery of "`communist political
propaganda'" to persons who had not requested the Post Office in
writing to deliver such propaganda. Id., at 307. The law required
the Post Office to keep an official list of persons desiring to receive
communist political propaganda, id., at 303, which, of course, was
intended to chill demand for such materials. Here, however,
petitioners' allegations of an official list "of those who wish to
watch the `patently offensive' channel," as the majority puts it, ante,
at 24, are pure hyperbole. The FCC regulation implementing
Section 10(b)'s written request requirement, 47 CFR Section
76.701(b) (1995), says nothing about the creation of a list, much
less an official government list. It requires only that the cable
operator receive written consent. Other statutory provisions make
clear that the cable operator may not share that, or any other,
information with any other person, including the Government.
Section 551 mandates that all personally identifiable information
regarding a subscriber be kept strictly confidential and further
requires cable operators to destroy any information that is no longer
necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. 47 U. S. C.
Sections 551. None of the circumstances that figured prominently
in Lamont exists here.

Though petitioners cannot reasonably fear the specter of an officially
published list of leased-access indecency viewers, it is true that the
fact that a subscriber is unblocked is ascertainable, if only by the
cable operator. I find no legally significant stigma in that fact. If a
segregation and blocking scheme is generally permissible, then a
subscriber's access request must take some form, whether written or
oral, and I see nothing nefarious in Congress' choice of a written,
rather than an oral, consent.17   Any request for access to blocked
programming--by whatever method--ultimately will make the
subscriber's identity knowable.18   But this is hardly the kind of
chilling effect that implicates the First Amendment.

Though making an oral request for access, perhaps by telephone, is
slightly less bothersome than making a written request, it is also true
that a written request is less subject to fraud "by a determined child."
Ante, at 29. Consequently, despite the fact that an oral request is
slightly less restrictive in absolute terms, it is also less effective in
supporting parents' interest in denying enterprising, but parentally
unauthorized, minors access to blocked programming.

The segregation and blocking requirement was not intended to be a
replacement for lockboxes, V-chips, reverse-blocking, or other
subscriber-initiated measures. Rather, Congress enacted in Section
10(b) a default setting under which a subscriber receives no blocked
programming without a written request. Thus, subscribers who do
not want the blocked programming are protected, and subscribers
who do want it may request access. Once a subscriber requests
access to blocked programming, however, the subscriber remains
free to use other methods, such as lockboxes, to regulate the kind of
programming shown on those channels in that home.19   Thus,
petitioners are wrong to portray Section 10(b) as a highly ineffective
method of screening individual programs, see Brief for Petitioners
in No. 95-124, p. 43, and the majority is similarly wrong to suggest
that a person cannot "watch a single program . . . without letting the
`patently offensive' channel in its entirety invade his household for
days, perhaps weeks, at a time," ante, at 24; see ante, at 26. Given
the limited scope of Section 10(b) as a default setting, I see nothing
constitutionally infirm about Congress' decision to permit the cable
operator 30 days to unblock or reblock the segregated channel.

Petitioners also claim that Section 10(b) and its implementing
regulations are impermissibly underinclusive because they apply
only to leased access programming. In R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505
U. S. 377 (1992), we rejected the view that a content-based
restriction is subject to a separate and independent
"underinclusiveness" evaluation. Id., at 387 ("In our view, the First
Amendment imposes not an `underinclusiveness' limitation but a
`content discrimination' limitation upon a State's prohibition of
proscribable speech"). See also ante, at 28 ("Congress need not
deal with every problem at once"). Also, petitioners' claim is in
tension with the constitutional principle that Congress may not
impose a remedy that is more restrictive than necessary to satisfy its
asserted compelling interest and with their own arguments pressing
that very principle. Cf. R. A. V., supra, at 402 (White, J.,
concurring in judgment) (though the "overbreadth doctrine has the
redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chilling of protected
expression," an underbreadth challenge "serves no desirable
function").

In arguing that Congress could not impose a blocking requirement
without also imposing that requirement on public access and
nonaccess channels, petitioners fail to allege, much less argue, that
doing so would further Congress' compelling interest. While it is
true that indecent programming appears on nonaccess channels, that
programming appears almost exclusively on "per-program or per
channel services that subscribers must specifically request in
advance, in the same manner as under the blocking approach
mandated by section 10(b)."  First Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd, at
1001, n. 20.20   In contrast to these premium services, leased
access channels are part of the basic cable package, and the
segregation and blocking scheme Congress imposed does nothing
more than convert sexually oriented leased access programming into
a free "premium service."21   Similarly, Congress' failure to impose
segregation and blocking requirements on public access channels
may have been based on its judgment that those channels presented a
less severe problem of unintended indecency--it appears that most of
the anecdotal evidence before Congress involved leased access
channels. Congress may also have simply decided to permit the
States and local franchising authorities to address the issue of
indecency on public access channels at a local level, in accordance
with the local rule policies evinced in 47 U. S. C. Section 531. In
any event, if the segregation and blocking scheme established by
Congress is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental
interest, it does not become constitutionally suspect merely because
Congress did not extend the same restriction to other channels on
which there was less of a perceived problem (and perhaps no
compelling interest).

The United States has carried its burden of demonstrating that
Section 10(b) and its implementing regulations are narrowly tailored
to satisfy a compelling governmental interest. Accordingly, I would
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety. I
therefore concur in the judgment upholding Section 10(a) and
respectfully dissent from that portion of the judgment striking down
Sections 10(b) and (c).


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE STEVENS CONCURRING

1 Our precedents recognize that reasonable restraints may be placed
on access to certain well-regulated fora. There is no reason why
cable television should be treated differently. See Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. ___ (1995) (slip.
op., at 8); id., at ___ (slip op., at 31-34, 39) (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting); see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981)
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) ("I should think it
obvious, for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested
the use of a room at a particular time--one to view Mickey Mouse
cartoons and the other to rehearse an amateur performance of
Hamlet--the First Amendment would not require that the room be
reserved for the group that submitted its application first"); Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 394 (1969) (approving
access requirement limited to "matters of great public concern").

2 For purposes of this case, canons of constitutional avoidance
require us to assume that the Government has the authority to
impose leased access requirements on cable operators. Indeed, no
party to this litigation contends to the contrary. Because petitioners'
constitutional claim depends for its success on the constitutionality
of the underlying access rights, they certainly cannot complain if we
decide the case on that assumption.

3 Although in 1984 Congress essentially barred cable operators
from exercising editorial control over PEG channels, see 47 U. S.
C. Section 531(e), Section 10(c) does not merely restore the status
quo ante. Section 10(c) authorizes private operators to exercise
editorial discretion over "indecent" programming even if the
franchising authority objects. Under the pre-1984 practice, local
franchising authorities were free to exclude operators from
exercising any such control on PEG channels.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE SOUTER CONCURRING

1 See, e.g., Blasi, The Pathological Perspective and the First
Amendment, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 449, 474 (1985) (arguing that
"courts . . . should place a premium on confining the range of
discretion left to future decisionmakers who will be called upon to
make judgments when pathological pressures are most intense").

2 Our indecency cases since Pacifica have likewise turned as much
on the context or medium of the speech as on its content. See, e.g.,
Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 127-
128 (1989) (distinguishing Pacifica in part on the ground that the
telephonic medium at issue was less intrusive than broadcast
television); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 47, 54
(1986) (permitting zoning regulation of adult theatres based on their
"secondary effects"); Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.
S. 675, 685-686 (1986) (upholding restriction on indecent speech in
a public school).

3 Our analysis of another important strand of the present case, the
right of owners of the means of communication to refuse to serve as
conduits for messages they dislike, has been equally contextual.
Compare Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367
(1969) (upholding a right-of-reply requirement in the broadcasting
context), with Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S.
241 (1974) (rejecting such a requirement for print journalism).

ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by the CHIEF
JUSTICE and JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment in
part and dissenting in part.

1 See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. __, __,
and n. 5 (1994) (slip op., at 13-14, and n. 5).

2 See United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157
(1968); United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U. S. 649
(1972) (Midwest Video I). Our decisions in Southwestern Cable
and Midwest Video I were purely regulatory and gave no indication
whether, or to what extent, cable operators were protected by the
First Amendment.

3 Curiously, the plurality relies on "changes taking place in the law,
the technology, and the industrial structure, relating to
telecommunications," ante, at 11, to justify its avoidance of
traditional First Amendment standards. If anything, as the plurality
recognizes, ante, at 15, those recent developments--which include
the growth of satellite broadcast programming and the coming influx
of video dialtone services--suggest that local cable operators have
little or no monopoly power and create no programming bottleneck
problems, thus effectively negating the primary justifications for
treating cable operators differently from other First Amendment
speakers.

4 Because indecent programming on PEG channels appears
primarily on public access channels, I will generally refer to PEG
access as public access.

5 Even in PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74,
87-88 (1980), for instance, we permitted California's compelled
access rule only because it did not burden or conflict with the mall
owner's own speech.

6 Following Turner, some commentators have questioned the
constitutionality of leased and public access. See, e. g., J. Goodale,
All About Cable Section 6.04[5], pp. 6-38.6 to 6-38.7 (1995) ("In
the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in the Turner
Broadcasting case, the constitutionality of both PEG access and
leased access requirements would seem open to searching
reexamination.... To the extent that an access requirement . . . is
considered to be a content-based restriction on the speech of a cable
system operator, it seems clear, after Turner Broadcasting, that such
a requirement would be found to violate the operator's First
Amendment rights"); Ugland, Cable Television, New Technologies
and the First Amendment After Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
F. C. C., 60 Mo. L. Rev. 799, 837 (1995) ("PEG requirements are
content-based on their face because they force cable system
operators to carry certain types of programming" (emphasis in
original)); Perritt, Access to the National Information Infrastructure,
30 Wake Forest L. Rev. 51, 66 (1995) (leased access and public
access requirements "were called into question in Turner").
Moreover, as JUSTICE O'CONNOR noted in Turner, Congress'
imposition of common carrier-like obligations on cable operators
may raise Takings Clause questions. 512 U. S., at __ (slip op., at
11-12) (concurring in part and dissenting in part). Such questions
are not at issue here.

7 The plurality, in asserting that Section 10(c) "does not restore to
cable operators editorial rights that they once had," ante, at 31,
mistakes inability to exercise a right for absence of the right
altogether. That cable operators "have not historically exercised
editorial control" over public access channels, ibid., does not
diminish the underlying right to do so, even if the operator's
forbearance is viewed as a contractual quid pro quo for the local
franchise.

8 Turner recognized that the must-carry rules burden programmers
who must compete for space on fewer channels. 512 U. S., at __
(slip op., at 12). Leased access requirements may also similarly
burden programmers who compete for space on nonaccess
channels.

9 In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
__, __ (1995) (slip op., at 8-9), we found the university's student
activity fund, a nontangible channel of communication, to be a
limited public forum, but generally we have been quite reluctant to
find even limited public fora in such channels of communication.
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.
788, 804 (1985) (Combined Federal Campaign not a limited public
forum); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.
S. 37, 47-48 (1983) (school mail facilities not a limited public
forum). In any event, we certainly have never held that public
access channels are a fully designated public forum that entitles
programmers to freedom from content-based distinctions.

10 See G. Shapiro, P. Kurland, & J. Mercurio, "CableSpeech": The
Case for First Amendment Protection 119 (1983) ("Because cable
systems are operated by private rather than governmental entities,
cable television cannot be characterized as a public forum and,
therefore, rights derived from the public forum doctrine cannot be
asserted by those who wish to express themselves on cable
systems").


11 Petitioners' argument that a property right called "the right to
exclude" has been transferred to the government is not persuasive.
Though it is generally true that, excepting Section 10(c), cable
operators are forbidden to exercise editorial discretion over public
access channels, that prohibition is not absolute. Section 531(e)
provides that the prohibition on the exercise of editorial discretion is
subject to Section 544(d)(1), which permits operators and
franchising authorities to ban obscene or other constitutionally
unprotected speech. Some states, however, have not permitted
exercise of that authority. See, e. g., Minn. Stat. Section 238.11
(1994) (prohibiting any censorship of leased or public access
programming); N. Y. Pub. Serv. Law Section 229 (McKinney
Supp. 1996) (same). At any rate, the Court has never recognized a
public forum based on a property interest "taken" by regulatory
restriction.

12 See D. Brenner, M. Price & M. Meyerson, Cable Television and
Other Nonbroadcast Video Section 6.04[7] (1996) (hereinafter
Brenner). Some States and local governments have formed
nonprofit organizations to perform some of these functions. See D.
C. Code Ann. Section 43-1829(a) (1990 and Supp. 1996)
(establishing Public Access Corporation "for the purpose of
facilitating and governing nondiscriminatory use" of public access
channels).

13 See, e. g., 47 U. S. C. Section 541(a)(4)(B) (authorizing
franchise authorities to "require adequate assurance that the cable
operator will provide adequate public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial
support"); Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 16-331c (1995) (requiring
cable operators to contribute money or resources to cable advisory
councils that monitor compliance with public access standards); id.,
Section 16-333(c) (requiring the department of public utility control
to adopt regulations "establishing minimum standards for the
equipment supplied . . . for the community access programming");
D. C. Code Ann. Section 43-1829.1(c) (1990) ("For public access
channel users, the franchisee shall provide use of the production
facilities and production assistance at an amount set forth in the
request for proposal"); Minn. Stat. Section 238.084.3(b) (1994)
(requiring cable operators to "make readily available for public use at
least the minimal equipment necessary for the production of
programming and playback of prerecorded programs"). That these
activities are "partly financed with public funds," ante, at 32, does
not diminish the fact that these activities are also "partly financed"
with the operator's money. See Brenner Section 6.04[7], at 6-48
("Frequently, access centers receive money and equipment from the
cable operator"); id., Section 6.04[3][c], at 6-41 (discussing cable
operator financing of public access channels and questioning its
constitutionality as "forced subsidization of speech").

14 Petitioners argue that Section 10(d) of the 1992 Act, 47 U. S. C.
Section 558, which lifts cable operators' immunity for obscene
speech, forces or encourages operators to ban indecent speech.
Because Congress could directly impose an outright ban on obscene
programming, see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S. 115, 124 (1989), petitioners' encouragement argument is
meritless.

15 After Sable, Congress quickly amended the statute and the FCC
again promulgated those "safe harbor" rules. Those rules were later
upheld against a First Amendment challenge. See Dial Information
Servs. Corp. of N. Y. v. Thornburgh, 938 F. 2d 1535 (CA2 1991),
cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers'
Coalition for Defense of First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F. 2d 866
(CA9 1991). In promulgating regulations pursuant to Section
10(b), the FCC was well aware that the default rules established for
dial-a-porn had been upheld and asserted that similar rules were
necessary for leased access channels. See First Report and Order, 8
FCC Rcd 998, 1000 (1993) ("The blocking scheme upheld in these
cases is, in all relevant respects, identical to that required by section
10(b)"); ibid. ("[J]ust as it did in section 223 relating to `dial-a-porn'
telephone services--Congress has now determined that mandatory,
not voluntary, blocking is essential").

16 In the context of dial-a-porn, courts upholding the FCC's
mandatory blocking scheme have expressly found that voluntary
blocking schemes are not effective. See Dial Information Servs.,
supra, at 1542; Information Providers' Coalition, supra, at 873-874.

17 Because, under the circumstances of these cases, I see no
constitutionally significant difference between a written and an oral
request to see blocked programming, I also see no relevant
distinction between Section 10(b) and the blocking requirement
enacted in the 1996 Act, on which the majority places so much
reliance. See ante, at 26-27.

18 Indeed, persons who request access to blocked programming
pursuant to 47 CFR Section 76.701(c) (1995) are no more
identifiable than persons who subscribe to sexually oriented
premium channels, because those persons must specially request
that premium service.

19 The lockbox provision, originally passed in 1984, was
unaffected by the 1992 Act and remains fully available to every
subscriber. 47 U. S. C. Section 544(d)(2).

20 In examining the restrictions imposed by the 1996 Act, the
majority is probably correct to doubt that "sex-dedicated channels
are all (or mostly) leased channels," ante, at 27, but surely the
majority does not doubt that most nonleased sex-dedicated channels
are premium channels that must be expressly requested. I thus
disagree that the provisions of the 1996 Act address a "highly
similar problem."  Id., at 28.

21 Unlike Congress' blocking scheme, and the market norm of
requiring viewers to pay a premium for indecent programming,
lockboxes place a financial burden on those seeking to avoid
indecent programming on leased access channels. See 47 U. S. C.
Section 544(d)(2) ("[A] cable operator shall provide (by sale or
lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a
particular cable service during periods selected by that subscriber").

v.

TURPIN, WARDEN

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-8836 (A-890).  Argued June 3, 1996-Decided June 28,
1996

After he was convicted of murder and other crimes and sentenced to
death by a Georgia state court, petitioner was denied relief on direct
appeal, in two rounds of state collateral proceedings, and in a first
round of federal habeas corpus proceedings. While he was awaiting
execution, the President signed into law the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Act), Title I of which, as here
pertinent, requires dismissal of a claim presented in a state prisoner's
second or successive federal habeas application if the claim was also
presented in a prior application, Section 106(b)(1); compels dismissal
of a claim that was not presented in a prior federal application, unless
certain conditions apply, Section 106(b)(2); creates a "gatekeeping"
mechanism, whereby the prospective applicant files in the court of
appeals a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas
application in the district court, and a three-judge panel determines
whether the application makes a prima facie showing that it satisfies
Section 106(b)'s requirements, Section 106(b)(3); and declares that a
panel's grant or denial of authorization to file ``shall not be
appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for . . . writ of
certiorari,'' Section 106(b)(3)(E). Petitioner filed a motion for leave
to file a second federal habeas petition, which the Eleventh Circuit
denied on the grounds, inter alia, that the claims to be raised therein
had not been presented in his first petition and did not meet Section
106(b)(2)'s conditions. Petitioner then filed in this Court a pleading
styled a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus [and] for Appellate or
Certiorari Review . . . ."  The Court granted certiorari, ordering
briefing on the extent to which Title I's provisions apply to a habeas
petition filed in this Court, whether application of the Act suspended
habeas in this case, and whether Title I, especially Section
106(b)(3)(E), unconstitutionally restricts the Court's jurisdiction.


Held:

1. The Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an
application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the
standards governing the granting of such relief. Pp. 5-10.

(a) Title I does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain
habeas petitions filed as original matters pursuant to 28 U. S. C.
Sections 2241 and 2254. No Title I provision mentions the Court's
authority to entertain such original petitions; in contrast, Section 103
amends the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consideration
of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals. Although
Section 106(b)(3)(E) precludes the Court from reviewing, by appeal
or certiorari, the latter courts' decisions exercising the "gatekeeping"
function for second habeas petitions, it makes no mention of the
Court's original habeas jurisdiction. Thus, the Court declines to find
a repeal of Section 2241 by implication. See Ex parte Yerger, 8
Wall. 85, 105. This conclusion obviates any claim by petitioner
under the Constitution's Exceptions Clause, Art. III, Section 2,
which provides, inter alia, that, "[i]n all . . . Cases . . . the Supreme
Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with
such Exceptions . . . as the Congress shall make."  Since the Act
does not repeal the Court's authority to entertain a habeas petition,
there can be no plausible argument that it deprives the Court of
appellate jurisdiction in violation of that Clause. Pp. 6-9.

(b) Title I changes the standards governing this Court's consideration
of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements under 28 U. S. C.
Section 2254(a), which limits the Court's authority to grant relief to
state prisoners. Section 106(b)(3)'s "gatekeeping" system does not
apply to the Court because it is limited to applications "filed in the
district court."  There is no such limitation, however, on the
restrictions imposed by Sections 106(b)(1) and (2), and those
restrictions inform the Court's authority to grant relief on original
habeas petitions, whether or not the Court is bound by the
restrictions. Pp. 9-10.

2. The Act does not violate the Constitution's Suspension Clause,
Art. I, Section 9, cl. 2, which provides that "[t]he Privilege of the
Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended."  The new
restrictions on successive habeas petitions constitute a modified res
judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas practice "abuse of
the writ."  The doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and
evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by
historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions.
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489. The new restrictions are
well within the compass of this evolutionary process and do not
amount to a "suspension" of the writ. Pp. 10-12.

3. The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is denied.
Petitioner's claims do not satisfy the Section 106(b)(2) requirements,
let alone this Court's Rule 20.4(a), which requires that the habeas
petitioner show "exceptional circumstances" justifying the issuance
of the writ and says that habeas relief is rarely granted. Petitioner's
claims here do not materially differ from numerous other claims made
by successive habeas petitioners that the Court has had occasion to
review on stay applications. P. 12.

Certiorari dismissed for want of jurisdiction; writ of habeas corpus
denied.

STEVENS, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which SOUTER and
BREYER, JJ., joined. SOUTER, J., filed a concurring opinion, in

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-8836


ELLIS WAYNE FELKER, PETITIONER

v.

TONY TURPIN, WARDEN

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AND ON
PETITION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

[June 28, 1996]

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(Act) works substantial changes to chapter 153 of Title 28 of the
United States Code, which authorizes federal courts to grant the writ
of habeas corpus. Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217. We hold that
the Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application
for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards
governing the granting of such relief. We also conclude that the
availability of such relief in this Court obviates any claim by
petitioner under the Exceptions Clause of Article III, Section 2, of the
Constitution, and that the operative provisions of the Act do not
violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, Section 9.


On a night in 1976, petitioner approached Jane W. in his car as she
got out of hers. Claiming to be lost and looking for a party nearby,
he used a series of deceptions to induce Jane to accompany him to his
trailer home in town. Petitioner forcibly subdued her, raped her, and
sodomized her. Jane pleaded with petitioner to let her go, but he said
he could not because she would notify the police. She escaped later,
when petitioner fell asleep. Jane notified the police, and petitioner
was eventually convicted of aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12
years' imprisonment.

Petitioner was paroled four years later. On November 23, 1981, he
met Joy Ludlam, a cocktail waitress, at the lounge where she
worked. She was interested in changing jobs, and petitioner used a
series of deceptions involving offering her a job at "The Leather
Shoppe," a business he owned, to induce her to visit him the next
day. The last time Joy was seen alive was the evening of the next
day. Her dead body was discovered two weeks later in a creek.
Forensic analysis established that she had been beaten, raped, and
sodomized, and that she had been strangled to death before being left
in the creek. Investigators discovered hair resembling petitioner's on
Joy's body and clothes, hair resembling Joy's in petitioner's
bedroom, and clothing fibers like those in Joy's coat in the hatchback
of petitioner's car. One of petitioner's neighbors reported seeing
Joy's car at petitioner's house the day she disappeared.

A jury convicted petitioner of murder, rape, aggravated sodomy, and
false imprisonment. Petitioner was sentenced to death on the murder
charge. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction
and death sentence, Felker v. State, 252 Ga. 351, 314 S. E. 2d 621,
and we denied certiorari, 469 U. S. 873 (1984). A state trial court
denied collateral relief, the Georgia Supreme Court declined to issue
a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial, and we again
denied certiorari. Felker v. Zant, 502 U. S. 1064 (1992).

Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia,
alleging that (1) the State's evidence was insufficient to convict him;
(2) the State withheld exculpatory evidence, in violation of Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); (3) petitioner's counsel rendered
ineffective assistance at sentencing; (4) the State improperly used
hypnosis to refresh a witness' memory; and (5) the State violated
double jeopardy and collateral estoppel principles by using
petitioner's crime against Jane W. as evidence at petitioner's trial for
crimes against Joy Ludlam. The District Court denied the petition.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed,
52 F. 3d 907, extended on denial of petition for rehearing, 62 F. 3d
342 (1995), and we denied certiorari, 516 U. S. ___ (1996).

The State scheduled petitioner's execution for the period May 2-9,
1996. On April 29, 1996, petitioner filed a second petition for state
collateral relief. The state trial court denied this petition May 1, and
the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari May 2.

On April 24, 1996, the President signed the Act into law. Title I of
this Act contained a series of amendments to existing federal habeas
corpus law. The provisions of the Act pertinent to this case concern
second or successive habeas corpus applications by state prisoners.
Subsections 106(b)(1) and (b)(2) specify the conditions under which
claims in second or successive applications must be dismissed,
amending 28 U. S. C. Section 2244(b) to read:

"(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus
application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed.

"(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus
application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed unless--

"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of
constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by
the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or

"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been
discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and

"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of
the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and
convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable
factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying
offense."  110 Stat. 1220-1221.

Subsection 106(b)(3) creates a "gatekeeping" mechanism for the
consideration of second or successive applications in district court.
The prospective applicant must file in the court of appeals a motion
for leave to file a second or successive habeas application in the
district court. Section 106(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel has 30 days
to determine whether "the application makes a prima facie showing
that the application satisfies the requirements of" Section 106(b).
Section 106(b)(3)(C); see  Sections 106(b)(3)(B), (D). Section
106(b)(3)(E) specifies that "[t]he grant or denial of an authorization
by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall
not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for
rehearing or for a writ of certiorari."

On May 2, 1996, petitioner filed in the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit a motion for stay of execution and a
motion for leave to file a second or successive federal habeas corpus
petition under Section 2254. Petitioner sought to raise two claims in
his second petition, the first being that the state trial court violated
due process by equating guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" with
"moral certainty" of guilt in voir dire and jury instructions. See Cage
v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990). He also alleged that qualified
experts, reviewing the forensic evidence after his conviction, had
established that Joy must have died during a period when petitioner
was under police surveillance for Joy's disappearance and thus had a
valid alibi. He claimed that the testimony of the State's forensic
expert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and
that the new expert testimony so discredited the State's testimony at
trial that petitioner had a colorable claim of factual innocence.

The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day they were filed,
concluding that petitioner's claims had not been presented in his first
habeas petition, that they did not meet the standards of Section
106(b)(2) of the Act, and that they would not have satisfied pre-Act
standards for obtaining review on the merits of second or successive
claims. 83 F. 3d 1303 (CA11 1996). Petitioner filed in this Court a
pleading styled a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for Appellate
or Certiorari Review of the Decision of the United States Circuit
Court for the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution."  On May
3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petition for certiorari.
We ordered briefing on the extent to which the provisions of Title I
of the Act apply to a petition for habeas corpus filed in this Court,
whether application of the Act suspended the writ of habeas corpus in
this case, and whether Title I of the Act, especially Section
106(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on the
jurisdiction of this Court. 517 U. S. ___ (1996).


We first consider to what extent the provisions of Title I of the Act
apply to petitions for habeas corpus filed as original matters in this
Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. Sections 2241 and 2254. We
conclude that although the Act does impose new conditions on our
authority to grant relief, it does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction
to entertain original habeas petitions.


Section 106(b)(3)(E) of the Act prevents this Court from reviewing a
court of appeals order denying leave to file a second habeas petition
by appeal or by writ of certiorari. More than a century ago, we
considered whether a statute barring review by appeal of the
judgment of a circuit court in a habeas case also deprived this Court
of power to entertain an original habeas petition. Ex parte Yerger, 8
Wall. 85 (1869). We consider the same question here with respect to
Section 106(b)(3)(E).

Yerger's holding is best understood in the light of the availability of
habeas corpus review at that time. Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of
1789 authorized all federal courts, including this Court, to grant the
writ of habeas corpus, when prisoners were "in custody, under or by
colour of the authority of the United States, or [were] committed for
trial before some court of the same."  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20,
Section 14, 1 Stat. 82.1   Congress greatly expanded the scope of
federal habeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal courts to grant the
writ, "in addition to the authority already conferred by law," "in all
cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in
violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United
States."  Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385.2   Before the Act
of 1867, the only instances in which a federal court could issue the
writ to produce a state prisoner were if the prisoner was "necessary
to be brought into court to testify," Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20,
Section 14, 1 Stat. 82, was "committed . . . for any act done . . . in
pursuance of a law of the United States," Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch.
57, Section 7, 4 Stat. 634-635, or was a "subjec[t] or citize[n] of a
foreign State, and domiciled therein," and held under state law, Act
of Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.

The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to
authorize appeals to this Court from the final decision of any circuit
court on a habeas petition. 14 Stat. 386. This enactment changed the
result of Barry v. Mercein, 5 How. 103 (1847), in which we had
held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this Court to
conduct appellate review of circuit court habeas decisions. However,
in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it had given in
1867, repealing "so much of the [Act of 1867] as authorizes an
appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of
the United States."  Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch. 34, Section 2, 15 Stat.
44.

In Yerger, we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprived us not
only of power to hear an appeal from a inferior court's decision on a
habeas petition, but also of power to entertain a habeas petition to this
Court under Section 14 of the Act of 1789. We concluded that the
1868 Act did not affect our power to entertain such habeas petitions.
We explained that the 1868 Act's text addressed only jurisdiction
over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas jurisdiction
conferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867. We rejected the
suggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeas power by
implication. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals by implication are not
favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas
jurisdiction was not "repugnant" to a prohibition on review by appeal
of circuit court habeas judgments. Ibid.

Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I of the Act has
not repealed our authority to entertain original habeas petitions, for
reasons similar to those stated in Yerger. No provision of Title I
mentions our authority to entertain original habeas petitions; in
contrast, Section 103 amends the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure to bar consideration of original habeas petitions in the
courts of appeals.3   Although Section 106(b) (3)(E) precludes us
from reviewing, by appeal or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an
application for leave to file a second habeas petition in district court,
it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitions filed as
original matters in this Court. As we declined to find a repeal of
Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied to this Court by
implication then, we decline to find a similar repeal of Section 2241
of Title 28--its descendant, n. 1, supra--by implication now.

This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional challenges raised.
The critical language of Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution
provides that, apart from several classes of cases specifically
enumerated in this Court's original jurisdiction, "[i]n all the other
Cases... the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as
to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations
as the Congress shall make."  Previous decisions construing this
clause have said that while our appellate powers "are given by the
constitution," "they are limited and regulated by the [Judiciary Act of
1789], and by such other acts as have been passed on the subject."
Durousseau v. United States, 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also
United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805). The Act does
remove our authority to entertain an appeal or a petition for a writ of
certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercising its
"gatekeeping" function over a second petition. But since it does not
repeal our authority to entertain a petition for habeas corpus, there
can be no plausible argument that the Act has deprived this Court of
appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, Section 2.


We consider next how Title I affects the requirements a state prisoner
must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from
this Court. Title I of the Act has changed the standards governing
our consideration of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements
for the granting of relief to state prisoners. Our authority to grant
habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by Section 2254, which
specifies the conditions under which such relief may be granted to "a
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court."4
Section 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new
requirements for the granting of relief under this section, and they
therefore inform our authority to grant such relief as well.

Section 106(b) of the Act addresses second or successive habeas
petitions. Section 106(b)(3)'s "gatekeeping" system for second
petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeas petitions
because it applies to applications "filed in the district court."  Section
106(b)(3)(A). There is no such limitation, however, on the
restrictions on repetitive and new claims imposed by subsections
106(b)(1) and (2). These restrictions apply without qualification to
any "second or successive habeas corpus application under section
2254."  Sections 106(b)(1), (2). Whether or not we are bound by
these restrictions, they certainly inform our consideration of original
habeas petitions.


Next, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ of habeas
corpus in violation of Article I, Section 9, clause 2, of the
Constitution. This clause provides that "[t]he Privilege of the Writ of
Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of
Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."

The writ of habeas corpus known to the Framers was quite different
from that which exists today. As we explained previously, the first
Congress made the writ of habeas corpus available only to prisoners
confined under the authority of the United States, not under state
authority. Supra, at 6-7; see Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103 (1844).
The class of judicial actions reviewable by the writ was more
restricted as well. In Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193 (1830), we
denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner
"detained in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which court
possesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases."  Id., at
202. Reviewing the English common law which informed American
courts' understanding of the scope of the writ, we held that "[t]he
judgment of the circuit court in a criminal case is of itself evidence of
its own legality," and that we could not "usurp that power by the
instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus."  Id., at 207.

It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ generally available
in "all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty
in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United
States."  Supra, at 6. And it was not until well into this century that
this Court interpreted that provision to allow a final judgment of
conviction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas. See,
e.g., Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942); Brown v. Allen,
344 U. S. 443 (1953). But we assume, for purposes of decision
here, that the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ
as it exists today, rather than as it existed in 1789. See Swain v.
Pressley, 430 U. S. 372 (1977); id., at 385 (Burger, C. J.,
concurring).

The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave from the court of
appeals before filing a second habeas petition in the district court.
But this requirement simply transfers from the district court to the
court of appeals a screening function which would previously have
been performed by the district court as required by 28 U. S. C.
Section 2254 Rule 9(b). The Act also codifies some of the pre-
existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the
availability of relief to habeas petitioners. But we have long
recognized that "the power to award the writ by any of the courts of
the United States, must be given by written law," Ex parte Bollman,
4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognized that
judgments about the proper scope of the writ are "normally for
Congress to make."  Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. ___, ___ (slip
op., at 8).

The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res
judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice
"abuse of the writ."  In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991),
we said that "the doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and
evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by
historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions."
Id., at 489. The added restrictions which the Act places on second
habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary
process, and we hold that they do not amount to a "suspension" of
the writ contrary to Article I, Section 9.


We have answered the questions presented by the petition for
certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition for an
original writ of habeas corpus. Our Rule 20.4(a) delineates the
standards under which we grant such writs:

"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus shall
comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. Sections 2241 and
2242, and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of
Section 2242 requiring a statement of the `reasons for not making
application to the district court of the district in which the applicant is
held.'  If the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, the
petition shall set forth specifically how and wherein the petitioner has
exhausted available remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes
within the provisions of 28 U. S. C. Section 2254(b). To justify the
granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show
exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court's
discretionary powers and must show that adequate relief cannot be
obtained in any other form or from any other court. These writs are
rarely granted."

Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materially differ from
numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which
we have had occasion to review on stay applications to this Court.
Neither of them satisfies the requirements of the relevant provisions
of the Act, let alone the requirement that there be "exceptional
circumstances" justifying the issuance of the writ.

The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of
jurisdiction. The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is
denied.

It is so ordered.


ENDNOTES

1 Section 14 is the direct ancestor of 28 U. S. C. Section 2241,
subsection (a) of which now states in pertinent part: "Writs of habeas
corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the
district courts and any circuit judge within their respective
jurisdictions."

2 This language from the 1867 Act is the direct ancestor of Section
2241(c)(3), which states: "The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend
to a prisoner unless . . . [h]e is in custody in violation of the
Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."

3 Section 103 of the Act amends Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure
22(a) to read: "An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be
made to the appropriate district court. If application is made to a
circuit judge, the application shall be transferred to the appropriate
district court. If an application is made to or transferred to the district
court and denied, renewal of the application before a circuit judge
shall not be permitted. The applicant may, pursuant to section 2253
of title 28, United States Code, appeal to the appropriate court of
appeals from the order of the district court denying the writ."

4 As originally enacted in 1948, 28 U. S. C. Section 2254 specified
that "[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person
in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be
granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the
remedies available in the courts of the State."  28 U. S. C. Section
2254 (1946 ed., Supp. III). The reviser's notes, citing Ex parte
Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944), indicated that "[t]his new section is
declaratory of existing law as affirmed by the Supreme Court."
Reviser's Note following 28 U. S. C. Section 2254, p. 1109 (1946
ed., Supp. III). Hawk was one of a series of opinions in which we
applied the exhaustion requirement first announced in Ex parte
Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886), to deny relief to applicants seeking
writs of habeas corpus from this Court.

<P>The Court's decision ordering the all-male Virginia Military Institute to admit women. By a 7-1 vote, the court said offering female cadets a separate program does not provide an equal education. "Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less, under the state's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. The ruling also will affect The Citadel, South Carolina's state military school, which has a similar all-male policy and a similar alternative program for women.</P>

v.

VIRGINIA ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 94-1941.  Argued January 17, 1996-Decided June 26, 1996*

Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is the sole single-sex school among
Virginia's public institutions of higher learning. VMI's distinctive
mission is to produce "citizen-soldiers," men prepared for leadership
in civilian life and in military service. Using an "adversative method"
of training not available elsewhere in Virginia, VMI endeavors to
instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a
strong moral code. Reflecting the high value alumni place on their
VMI training, VMI has the largest per-student endowment of all
undergraduate institutions in the Nation. The United States sued
Virginia and VMI, alleging that VMI's exclusively male admission
policy violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause. The District Court ruled in VMI's favor. The Fourth Circuit
reversed and ordered Virginia to remedy the constitutional violation.
In response, Virginia proposed a parallel program for women:
Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), located at Mary
Baldwin College, a private liberal arts school for women. The
District Court found that Virginia's proposal satisfied the
Constitution's equal protection requirement, and the Fourth Circuit
affirmed. The appeals court deferentially reviewed Virginia's plan
and determined that provision of single-gender educational options
was a legitimate objective. Maintenance of single-sex programs, the
court concluded, was essential to that objective. The court
recognized, however, that its analysis risked bypassing equal
protection scrutiny, so it fashioned an additional test, asking whether
VMI and VWIL students would receive ``substantively comparable''
benefits. Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the
VWIL degree lacked the historical benefit and prestige of a VMI
degree, the court nevertheless found the educational opportunities at
the two schools sufficiently comparable.


Held:

1. Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must
demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for that action.
E.g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724.
Neither federal nor state government acts compatibly with equal
protection when a law or official policy denies to women, simply
because they are women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunity to
aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their
individual talents and capacities. To meet the burden of justification,
a State must show ``at least that the [challenged] classification serves
`important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means
employed' are `substantially related to the achievement of those
objectives.'"  Ibid., quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co.,
446 U. S. 142, 150. The justification must be genuine, not
hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it
must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents,
capacities, or preferences of males and females. See, e.g.,
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643, 648. The
heightened review standard applicable to sex-based classifications
does not make sex a proscribed classification, but it does mean that
categorization by sex may not be used to create or perpetuate the
legal, social, and economic inferiority of women. Pp. 13-16.

2. Virginia's categorical exclusion of women from the educational
opportunities VMI provides denies equal protection to women. Pp.
17-29.

(a) Virginia contends that single-sex education yields important
educational benefits and that provision of an option for such
education fosters diversity in educational approaches. Benign
justifications proffered in defense of categorical exclusions,
however, must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for
actions in fact differently grounded. Virginia has not shown that
VMI was established, or has been maintained, with a view to
diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational
opportunities within the State. A purpose genuinely to advance an
array of educational options is not served by VMI's historic and
constant plan to afford a unique educational benefit only to males.
However well this plan serves Virginia's sons, it makes no provision
whatever for her daughters. Pp. 17-22.

(b) Virginia also argues that VMI's adversative method of training
provides educational benefits that cannot be made available,
unmodified, to women, and that alterations to accommodate women
would necessarily be so drastic as to destroy VMI's program. It is
uncontested that women's admission to VMI would require
accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments and
physical training programs for female cadets. It is also undisputed,
however, that neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers, VMI's
raison d'tre, nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently
unsuitable to women. The District Court made ``findings'' on
``gender-based developmental differences'' that restate the opinions
of Virginia's expert witnesses about typically male or typically female
"tendencies."  Courts, however, must take ``a hard look'' at
generalizations or tendencies of the kind Virginia pressed, for state
actors controlling gates to opportunity have no warrant to exclude
qualified individuals based on "fixed notions concerning the roles
and abilities of males and females." Mississippi Univ. for Women,
458 U. S., at 725. The notion that admission of women would
downgrade VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with
it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved, a prediction hardly
different from other "self-fulfilling prophec[ies], see id., at 730, once
routinely used to deny rights or opportunities. Women's successful
entry into the federal military academies, and their participation in the
Nation's military forces, indicate that Virginia's fears for VMI's
future may not be solidly grounded. The State's justification for
excluding all women from "citizen-soldier" training for which some
are qualified, in any event, does not rank as "exceedingly
persuasive."  Pp. 22-29.

3. The remedy proffered by Virginia--maintain VMI as a male-only
college and create VWIL as a separate program for women--does not
cure the constitutional violation. Pp. 29-41.

(a) A remedial decree must closely fit the constitutional violation; it
must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an
opportunity or advantage in the position they would have occupied in
the absence of discrimination. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S.
267, 280. The constitutional violation in this case is the categorical
exclusion of women, in disregard of their individual merit, from an
extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. Virginia chose
to leave untouched VMI's exclusionary policy, and proposed for
women only a separate program, different in kind from VMI and
unequal in tangible and intangible facilities. VWIL affords women
no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which
VMI is famed. Kept away from the pressures, hazards, and
psychological bonding characteristic of VMI's adversative training,
VWIL students will not know the feeling of tremendous
accomplishment commonly experienced by VMI's successful cadets.
Virginia maintains that methodological differences are justified by the
important differences between men and women in learning and
developmental needs, but generalizations about "the way women
are," estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer
justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity
place them outside the average description. In myriad respects other
than military training, VWIL does not qualify as VMI's equal. The
VWIL program is a pale shadow of VMI in terms of the range of
curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni
support and influence. Virginia has not shown substantial equality in
the separate educational opportunities the State supports at VWIL and
VMI. Cf. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629. Pp. 30-37.

(b) The Fourth Circuit failed to inquire whether the proposed remedy
placed women denied the VMI advantage in the position they would
have occupied in the absence of discrimination, Milliken, 433  U. S.,
at 280, and considered instead whether the State could provide, with
fidelity to equal protection, separate and unequal educational
programs for men and women. In declaring the substantially
different and significantly unequal VWIL program satisfactory, the
appeals court displaced the exacting standard developed by this Court
with a deferential standard, and added an inquiry of its own
invention, the "substantive comparability" test. The Fourth Circuit
plainly erred in exposing Virginia's VWIL plan to such a deferential
analysis, for "all gender-based classifications today" warrant
"heightened scrutiny."  See J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511
U. S. 127, 136. Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education
cannot be offered anything less, under the State's obligation to afford
them genuinely equal protection. Pp. 37-41. 976 F. 2d 890,
affirmed; 44 F. 3d 1229, reversed and remanded.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

Virginia's public institutions of higher learning include an
incomparable military college, Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The
United States maintains that the Constitution's equal protection
guarantee precludes Virginia from reserving exclusively to men the
unique educational opportunities VMI affords. We agree.


Founded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex school among
Virginia's 15 public institutions of higher learning. VMI's distinctive
mission is to produce "citizen-soldiers," men prepared for leadership
in civilian life and in military service. VMI pursues this mission
through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in
Virginia. Assigning prime place to character development, VMI uses
an "adversative method" modeled on English public schools and once
characteristic of military instruction. VMI constantly endeavors to
instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a
strong moral code. The school's graduates leave VMI with
heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and
stress, and a large sense of accomplishment for completing the
hazardous course.

VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among
its alumni are military generals, Members of Congress, and business
executives. The school's alumni overwhelmingly perceive that their
VMI training helped them to realize their personal goals. VMI's
endowment reflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largest
per-student endowment of all undergraduate institutions in the
Nation.

Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor VMI's
implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. And
the school's impressive record in producing leaders has made
admission desirable to some women. Nevertheless, Virginia has
elected to preserve exclusively for men the advantages and
opportunities a VMI education affords.


From its establishment in 1839 as one of the Nation's first state
military colleges, see 1839 Va. Acts, ch. 20, VMI has remained
financially supported by Virginia and "subject to the control of the
[Virginia] General Assembly," Va. Code Ann. Section 23-92 (1993).
First southern college to teach engineering and industrial chemistry,
see H. Wise, Drawing Out the Man: The VMI Story 13 (1978) (The
VMI Story), VMI once provided teachers for the State's schools, see
1842 Va. Acts, ch. 24, Section 2 (requiring every cadet to teach in
one of the Commonwealth's schools for a 2-year period).1   Civil
War strife threatened the school's vitality, but a resourceful
superintendent regained legislative support by highlighting "VMI's
great potential[,] through its technical know-how," to advance
Virginia's postwar recovery. The VMI Story 47.

VMI today enrolls about 1,300 men as cadets.2   Its academic
offerings in the liberal arts, sciences, and engineering are also
available at other public colleges and universities in Virginia. But
VMI's mission is special. It is the mission of the school

"`to produce educated and honorable men, prepared for the varied
work of civil life, imbued with love of learning, confident in the
functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of
public service, advocates of the American democracy and free
enterprise system, and ready as citizen-soldiers to defend their
country in time of national peril.'"  766 F. Supp. 1407, 1425 (WD
Va. 1991) (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of
Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).

In contrast to the federal service academies, institutions maintained
"to prepare cadets for career service in the armed forces," VMI's
program "is directed at preparation for both military and civilian life";
"[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service."  766
F. Supp., at 1432.

VMI produces its "citizen-soldiers" through "an adversative, or
doubting, model of education" which features "[p]hysical rigor,
mental stress, absolute equality of treatment, absence of privacy,
minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable
values."  Id., at 1421. As one Commandant of Cadets described it,
the adversative method "dissects the young student," and makes him
aware of his "limits and capabilities," so that he knows "how far he
can go with his anger, . . . how much he can take under stress, . . .
exactly what he can do when he is physically exhausted." Id., at
1421-1422 (quoting Col. N. Bissell).

VMI cadets live in spartan barracks where surveillance is constant
and privacy nonexistent; they wear uniforms, eat together in the mess
hall, and regularly participate in drills. Id., at 1424, 1432. Entering
students are incessantly exposed to the rat line, "an extreme form of
the adversative model," comparable in intensity to Marine Corps boot
camp. Id., at 1422. Tormenting and punishing, the rat line bonds
new cadets to their fellow sufferers and, when they have completed
the 7-month experience, to their former tormentors. Ibid.

VMI's "adversative model" is further characterized by a hierarchical
"class system" of privileges and responsibilities, a "dyke system" for
assigning a senior class mentor to each entering class "rat," and a
stringently enforced "honor code," which prescribes that a cadet
"`does not lie, cheat, steal nor tolerate those who do.'"  Id., at 1422-
1423.

VMI attracts some applicants because of its reputation as an
extraordinarily challenging military school, and "because its alumni
are exceptionally close to the school." Id., at 1421. "[W]omen have
no opportunity anywhere to gain the benefits of [the system of
education at VMI]." Ibid.


In 1990, prompted by a complaint filed with the Attorney General by
a female high-school student seeking admission to VMI, the United
States sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and VMI, alleging that
VMI's exclusively male admission policy violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 1408.3
Trial of the action consumed six days and involved an array of expert
witnesses on each side. Ibid.

In the two years preceding the lawsuit, the District Court noted, VMI
had received inquiries from 347 women, but had responded to none
of them. Id., at 1436. "[S]ome women, at least," the court said,
"would want to attend the school if they had the opportunity."  Id., at
1414. The court further recognized that, with recruitment, VMI
could "achieve at least 10% female enrollment"--"a sufficient `critical
mass' to provide the female cadets with a positive educational
experience."  Id., at 1437-1438. And it was also established that
"some women are capable of all of the individual activities required
of VMI cadets."  Id., at 1412. In addition, experts agreed that if
VMI admitted women, "the VMI ROTC experience would become a
better training program from the perspective of the armed forces,
because it would provide training in dealing with a mixed-gender
army."  Id., at 1441.

The District Court ruled in favor of VMI, however, and rejected the
equal protection challenge pressed by the United States. That court
correctly recognized that Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,
458 U. S. 718 (1982), was the closest guide. 766 F. Supp., at
1410. There, this Court underscored that a party seeking to uphold
government action based on sex must establish an "exceedingly
persuasive justification" for the classification. Mississippi Univ. for
Women, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted). To
succeed, the defender of the challenged action must show "at least
that the classification serves important governmental objectives and
that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to
the achievement of those objectives."  Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted).

The District Court reasoned that education in "a single-gender
environment, be it male or female," yields substantial benefits. 766
F. Supp., at 1415. VMI's school for men brought diversity to an
otherwise coeducational Virginia system, and that diversity was
"enhanced by VMI's unique method of instruction."  Ibid. If single-
gender education for males ranks as an important governmental
objective, it becomes obvious, the District Court concluded, that the
only means of achieving the objective "is to exclude women from the
all-male institution--VMI." Ibid.

"Women are [indeed] denied a unique educational opportunity that is
available only at VMI," the District Court acknowledged. Id., at
1432. But "[VMI's] single-sex status would be lost, and some
aspects of the [school's] distinctive method would be altered" if
women were admitted, id., at 1413: "Allowance for personal privacy
would have to be made," id., at 1412; "[p]hysical education
requirements would have to be altered, at least for the women," id.,
at 1413; the adversative environment could not survive unmodified,
id., at 1412-1413. Thus, "sufficient constitutional justification" had
been shown, the District Court held, "for continuing [VMI's] single-
sex policy." Id., at 1413.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and vacated
the District Court's judgment. The appellate court held: "The
Commonwealth of Virginia has not . . . advanced any state policy by
which it can justify its determination, under an announced policy of
diversity, to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and not to
women."  976 F. 2d 890, 892 (1992).

The appeals court greeted with skepticism Virginia's assertion that it
offers single-sex education at VMI as a facet of the State's
overarching and undisputed policy to advance "autonomy and
diversity."  The court underscored Virginia's nondiscrimination
commitment: "`[I]t is extremely important that [colleges and
universities] deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to
sex, race, or ethnic origin.'"  Id., at 899 (quoting 1990 Report of the
Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century). "That
statement," the Court of Appeals said, "is the only explicit one that
we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has
expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions."  Ibid.
Furthermore, the appeals court observed, in urging "diversity" to
justify an all-male VMI, the State had supplied "no explanation for
the movement away from [single-sex education] in Virginia by public
colleges and universities."  Ibid. In short, the court concluded, "[a]
policy of diversity which aims to provide an array of educational
opportunities, including single-gender institutions, must do more
than favor one gender."  Ibid.

The parties agreed that "some women can meet the physical standards
now imposed on men," id., at 896, and the court was satisfied that
"neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMI's
implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women," id.,
at 899. The Court of Appeals, however, accepted the District
Court's finding that "at least these three aspects of VMI's program--
physical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative
approach--would be materially affected by coeducation."  Id., at 896-
897. Remanding the case, the appeals court assigned to Virginia, in
the first instance, responsibility for selecting a remedial course. The
court suggested these options for the State: Admit women to VMI;
establish parallel institutions or programs; or abandon state support,
leaving VMI free to pursue its policies as a private institution. Id., at
900. In May 1993, this Court denied certiorari. See 508 U. S. 946;
see also ibid. (opinion of SCALIA, J., noting the interlocutory
posture of the litigation).


In response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, Virginia proposed a
parallel program for women: Virginia Women's Institute for
Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsored undergraduate
program would be located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal
arts school for women, and would be open, initially, to about 25 to
30 students. Although VWIL would share VMI's mission--to
produce "citizen-soldiers"--the VWIL program would differ, as does
Mary Baldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methods of
education, and financial resources. See 852 F. Supp. 471, 476-477
(WD Va. 1994).

The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary Baldwin is
about 100 points lower than the score for VMI freshmen. See id., at
501. Mary Baldwin's faculty holds "significantly fewer Ph.D.'s
than the faculty at VMI," id., at 502, and receives significantly lower
salaries, see Tr. 158 (testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary
Baldwin College), reprinted in 2 App. in Nos. 94-1667 and 94-1717
(CA4) (hereinafter Tr.). While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, the
sciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial, offered
only bachelor of arts degrees. See 852 F. Supp., at 503. A VWIL
student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one,
without public support, by attending Washington University in St.
Louis, Missouri, for two years, paying the required private tuition.
See ibid.

Experts in educating women at the college level composed the Task
Force charged with designing the VWIL program; Task Force
members were drawn from Mary Baldwin's own faculty and staff.
Id., at 476. Training its attention on methods of instruction
appropriate for "most women," the Task Force determined that a
military model would be "wholly inappropriate" for VWIL. Ibid.;
see 44 F. 3d 1229, 1233 (CA4 1995).

VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs and a newly
established, "largely ceremonial" Virginia Corps of Cadets, id., at
1234, but the VWIL House would not have a military format, 852 F.
Supp., at 477, and VWIL would not require its students to eat meals
together or to wear uniforms during the school day, id., at 495. In
lieu of VMI's adversative method, the VWIL Task Force favored "a
cooperative method which reinforces self-esteem."  Id., at 476. In
addition to the standard bachelor of arts program offered at Mary
Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete
an off-campus leadership externship, participate in community
service projects, and assist in arranging a speaker series. See 44 F.
3d, at 1234.

Virginia represented that it will provide equal financial support for in-
state VWIL students and VMI cadets, 852 F. Supp., at 483, and the
VMI Foundation agreed to supply a $5.4625 million endowment for
the VWIL program, id., at 499. Mary Baldwin's own endowment is
about $19 million; VMI's is $131 million. Id., at 503. Mary
Baldwin will add $35 million to its endowment based on future
commitments; VMI will add $220 million. Ibid. The VMI Alumni
Association has developed a network of employers interested in
hiring VMI graduates. The Association has agreed to open its
network to VWIL graduates, id., at 499, but those graduates will not
have the advantage afforded by a VMI degree.


Virginia returned to the District Court seeking approval of its
proposed remedial plan, and the court decided the plan met the
requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 473. The
District Court again acknowledged evidentiary support for these
determinations: "[T]he VMI methodology could be used to educate
women and, in fact, some women . . . may prefer the VMI
methodology to the VWIL methodology." Id., at 481. But the
"controlling legal principles," the District Court decided, "do not
require the Commonwealth to provide a mirror image VMI for
women."  Ibid. The court anticipated that the two schools would
"achieve substantially similar outcomes." Ibid. It concluded: "If VMI
marches to the beat of a drum, then Mary Baldwin marches to the
melody of a fife and when the march is over, both will have arrived
at the same destination." Id., at 484.

A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment.
44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995). This time, the appellate court
determined to give "greater scrutiny to the selection of means than to
the [State's] proffered objective."  Id., at 1236. The official
objective or purpose, the court said, should be reviewed
deferentially. Ibid. Respect for the "legislative will," the court
reasoned, meant that the judiciary should take a "cautious approach,"
inquiring into the "legitima[cy]" of the governmental objective and
refusing approval for any purpose revealed to be "pernicious."  Ibid.

"[P]roviding the option of a single-gender college education may be
considered a legitimate and important aspect of a public system of
higher education," the appeals court observed, id., at 1238; that
objective, the court added, is "not pernicious," id., at 1239.
Moreover, the court continued, the adversative method vital to a VMI
education "has never been tolerated in a sexually heterogeneous
environment."  Ibid. The method itself "was not designed to exclude
women," the court noted, but women could not be accommodated in
the VMI program, the court believed, for female participation in
VMI's adversative training "would destroy . . . any sense of decency
that still permeates the relationship between the sexes."  Ibid.


Having determined, deferentially, the legitimacy of Virginia's
purpose, the court considered the question of means. Exclusion of
"men at Mary Baldwin College and women at VMI," the court said,
was essential to Virginia's purpose, for without such exclusion, the
State could not "accomplish [its] objective of providing single-gender
education."  Ibid.

The court recognized that, as it analyzed the case, means merged into
end, and the merger risked "bypass[ing] any equal protection
scrutiny."  Id., at 1237. The court therefore added another inquiry, a
decisive test it called "substantive comparability."  Ibid. The key
question, the court said, was whether men at VMI and women at
VWIL would obtain "substantively comparable benefits at their
institution or through other means offered by the [S]tate." Ibid.
Although the appeals court recognized that the VWIL degree "lacks
the historical benefit and prestige" of a VMI degree, it nevertheless
found the educational opportunities at the two schools "sufficiently
comparable."  Id., at 1241.

Senior Circuit Judge Phillips dissented. The court, in his judgment,
had not held Virginia to the burden of showing an "`exceedingly
persuasive [justification]'" for the State's action. Id., at 1247
(quoting Mississippi University for Women, 458 U. S., at 724). In
Judge Phillips' view, the court had accepted "rationalizations
compelled by the exigencies of this litigation," and had not
confronted the State's "actual overriding purpose." Ibid. That
purpose, Judge Phillips said, was clear from the historical record; it
was "not to create a new type of educational opportunity for women,
. . . nor to further diversify the Commonwealth's higher education
system[,]... but [was] simply . . . to allow VMI to continue to
exclude women in order to preserve its historic character and
mission."  Ibid.

Judge Phillips suggested that the State would satisfy the
Constitution's equal protection requirement if it "simultaneously
opened single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially
comparable curricular and extra-curricular programs, funding,
physical plant, administration and support services, and faculty and
library resources."  Id., at 1250. But he thought it evident that the
proposed VWIL program, in comparison to VMI, fell "far short . . .
from providing substantially equal tangible and intangible educational
benefits to men and women."  Ibid.

The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 52 F. 3d 90 (1995).
Circuit Judge Motz, joined by Circuit Judges Hall, Murnaghan, and
Michael, filed a dissenting opinion.4 Judge Motz agreed with Judge
Phillips that Virginia had not shown an "`exceedingly persuasive
justification'" for the disparate opportunities the State supported.
Id., at 92 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at
724). She asked: "[H]ow can a degree from a yet to be implemented
supplemental program at Mary Baldwin be held `substantively
comparable' to a degree from a venerable Virginia military institution
that was established more than 150 years ago?"  Id., at 93. "Women
need not be guaranteed equal `results,'" Judge Motz said, "but the
Equal Protection Clause does require equal opportunity... [and] that
opportunity is being denied here."  Ibid.


The cross-petitions in this case present two ultimate issues. First,
does Virginia's exclusion of women from the educational
opportunities provided by VMI--extraordinary opportunities for
military training and civilian leadership development--deny to women
"capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,"
766 F. Supp., at 1412, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment? Second, if VMI's "unique"
situation, id., at 1413--as Virginia's sole single-sex public institution
of higher education--offends the Constitution's equal protection
principle, what is the remedial requirement?


We note, once again, the core instruction of this Court's pathmarking
decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 136-
137, and n. 6 (1994), and Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S.,
at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted): Parties who seek to defend
gender-based government action must demonstrate an "exceedingly
persuasive justification" for that action.

Today's skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or
opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history. As a
plurality of this Court acknowledged a generation ago, "our Nation
has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination."
Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 684 (1973). Through a
century plus three decades and more of that history, women did not
count among voters composing "We the People";5  not until 1920 did
women gain a constitutional right to the franchise. Id., at 685. And
for a half century thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine that
government, both federal and state, could withhold from women
opportunities accorded men so long as any "basis in reason" could be
conceived for the discrimination. See, e.g., Goesaert v. Cleary, 335
U. S. 464, 467 (1948) (rejecting challenge of female tavern owner
and her daughter to Michigan law denying bartender licenses to
females--except for wives and daughters of male tavern owners;
Court would not "give ear" to the contention that "an unchivalrous
desire of male bartenders to . . . monopolize the calling" prompted
the legislation).

In 1971, for the first time in our Nation's history, this Court ruled in
favor of a woman who complained that her State had denied her the
equal protection of its laws. Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 73
(holding unconstitutional Idaho Code prescription that, among
"`several persons claiming and equally entitled to administer [a
decedent's estate], males must be preferred to females'"). Since
Reed, the Court has repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor
state government acts compatibly with the equal protection principle
when a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they
are women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunity to aspire,
achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their
individual talents and capacities. See, e.g., Kirchberg v. Feenstra,
450 U. S. 455, 462-463 (1981) (affirming invalidity of Louisiana
law that made husband "head and master" of property jointly owned
with his wife, giving him unilateral right to dispose of such property
without his wife's consent); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975)
(invalidating Utah requirement that parents support boys until age 21,
girls only until age 18).

Without equating gender classifications, for all purposes, to
classifications based on race or national origin,6  the Court, in post-
Reed decisions, has carefully inspected official action that closes a
door or denies opportunity to women (or to men). See J. E. B., 511
U. S., at 152 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (case law
evolving since 1971 "reveal[s] a strong presumption that gender
classifications are invalid"). To summarize the Court's current
directions for cases of official classification based on gender:
Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for
which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether
the proffered justification is "exceedingly persuasive."  The burden
of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State. See
Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724. The State must
show "at least that the [challenged] classification serves `important
governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed'
are `substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.'"
Ibid. (quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U. S.
142, 150 (1980)). The justification must be genuine, not
hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it
must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents,
capacities, or preferences of males and females. See Weinberger v.
Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643, 648 (1975); Califano v. Goldfarb,
430 U. S. 199, 223-224 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in
judgment).

The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not
make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed "inherent
differences" are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national
origin classifications. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967).
Physical differences between men and women, however, are
enduring: "[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up
exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of
both."  Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187, 193 (1946).

"Inherent differences" between men and women, we have come to
appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of
the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an
individual's opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to
compensate women "for particular economic disabilities [they have]
suffered," Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313, 320 (1977) (per
curiam), to "promot[e] equal employment opportunity," see
California Federal Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272,
289 (1987), to advance full development of the talent and capacities
of our Nation's people.7   But such classifications may not be used,
as they once were, see Goesaert, 335 U. S., at 467, to create or
perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.

Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just
described, we conclude that Virginia has shown no "exceedingly
persuasive justification" for excluding all women from the citizen-
soldier training afforded by VMI. We therefore affirm the Fourth
Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the
Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Because the
remedy proffered by Virginia--the Mary Baldwin VWIL program--
does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide
equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in
this case.


The Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had advanced no state
policy by which it could justify, under equal protection principles, its
determination "to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and
not to women."  976 F. 2d, at 892. Virginia challenges that
"liability" ruling and asserts two justifications in defense of VMI's
exclusion of women. First, the Commonwealth contends, "single-
sex education provides important educational benefits," Brief for
Cross-Petitioners 20, and the option of single-sex education
contributes to "diversity in educational approaches," id., at 25.
Second, the Commonwealth argues, "the unique VMI method of
character development and leadership training," the school's
adversative approach, would have to be modified were VMI to admit
women. Id., at 33-36. We consider these two justifications in turn.


Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some
students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is uncontested in this
litigation.8   Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public
educational institutions can serve the public good. But Virginia has
not shown that VMI was established, or has been maintained, with a
view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women,
educational opportunities within the State. In cases of this genre, our
precedent instructs that "benign" justifications proffered in defense of
categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable
justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations
for actions in fact differently grounded. See Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.,
at 648, and n. 16 ("mere recitation of a benign [or] compensatory
purpose" does not block "inquiry into the actual purposes" of
government-maintained gender-based classifications); Goldfarb, 430
U. S., at 212-213 (rejecting government-proffered purposes after
"inquiry into the actual purposes") (internal quotation marks
omitted).

Mississippi Univ. for Women is immediately in point. There the
State asserted, in justification of its exclusion of men from a nursing
school, that it was engaging in "educational affirmative action" by
"compensat[ing] for discrimination against women."  458 U. S., at
727. Undertaking a "searching analysis," id., at 728, the Court
found no close resemblance between "the alleged objective" and "the
actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification," id., at
730. Pursuing a similar inquiry here, we reach the same conclusion.

Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia's alleged pursuit
of diversity through single-sex educational options. In 1839, when
the State established VMI, a range of educational opportunities for
men and women was scarcely contemplated. Higher education at the
time was considered dangerous for women;9  reflecting widely held
views about women's proper place, the Nation's first universities
and colleges--for example, Harvard in Massachusetts, William and
Mary in Virginia--admitted only men. See E. Farello, A History of
the Education of Women in the United States 163 (1970). VMI was
not at all novel in this respect: In admitting no women, VMI followed
the lead of the State's flagship school, the University of Virginia,
founded in 1819.

"[N]o struggle for the admission of women to a state university," a
historian has recounted, "was longer drawn out, or developed more
bitterness, than that at the University of Virginia."  2 T. Woody, A
History of Women's Education in the United States 254 (1929)
(History of Women's Education). In 1879, the State Senate resolved
to look into the possibility of higher education for women,
recognizing that Virginia "`has never, at any period of her history,'"
provided for the higher education of her daughters, though she "`has
liberally provided for the higher education of her sons.'" Ibid.
(quoting 10 Educ. J. Va. 212 (1879)). Despite this recognition, no
new opportunities were instantly open to women.10

Virginia eventually provided for several women's seminaries and
colleges. Farmville Female Seminary became a public institution in
1884. See supra, at 3, n. 2. Two women's schools, Mary
Washington College and James Madison University, were founded
in 1908; another, Radford University, was founded in 1910. 766 F.
Supp., at 1418-1419. By the mid-1970's, all four schools had
become coeducational. Ibid.

Debate concerning women's admission as undergraduates at the main
university continued well past the century's midpoint. Familiar
arguments were rehearsed. If women were admitted, it was feared,
they "would encroach on the rights of men; there would be new
problems of government, perhaps scandals; the old honor system
would have to be changed; standards would be lowered to those of
other coeducational schools; and the glorious reputation of the
university, as a school for men, would be trailed in the dust."  2
History of Women's Education 255.

Ultimately, in 1970, "the most prestigious institution of higher
education in Virginia," the University of Virginia, introduced
coeducation and, in 1972, began to admit women on an equal basis
with men. See Kirstein v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Virginia,
309 F. Supp. 184, 186 (ED Va. 1970). A three-judge Federal
District Court confirmed: "Virginia may not now deny to women, on
the basis of sex, educational opportunities at the Charlottesville
campus that are not afforded in other institutions operated by the
[S]tate."  Id., at 187.

Virginia describes the current absence of public single-sex higher
education for women as "an historical anomaly."  Brief for Cross-
Petitioners 30. But the historical record indicates action more
deliberate than anomalous: First, protection of women against higher
education; next, schools for women far from equal in resources and
stature to schools for men; finally, conversion of the separate schools
to coeducation. The state legislature, prior to the advent of this
controversy, had repealed "[a]ll Virginia statutes requiring individual
institutions to admit only men or women."  766 F. Supp., at 1419.
And in 1990, an official commission, "legislatively established to
chart the future goals of higher education in Virginia," reaffirmed the
policy "of affording broad access" while maintaining "autonomy and
diversity."  976 F. 2d, at 898-899 (quoting Report of the Virginia
Commission on the University of the 21st Century). Significantly,
the Commission reported:

"`Because colleges and universities provide opportunities for
students to develop values and learn from role models, it is extremely
important that they deal with faculty, staff, and students without
regard to sex, race, or ethnic origin.'"  Id., at 899 (emphasis
supplied by Court of Appeals deleted).

This statement, the Court of Appeals observed, "is the only explicit
one that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth
has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions."  Ibid.

Our 1982 decision in Mississippi Univ. for Women prompted VMI
to reexamine its male-only admission policy. See 766 F. Supp., at
1427-1428. Virginia relies on that reexamination as a legitimate basis
for maintaining VMI's single-sex character. See Reply Brief for
Cross-Petitioners 6. A Mission Study Committee, appointed by the
VMI Board of Visitors, studied the problem from October 1983 until
May 1986, and in that month counseled against "change of VMI
status as a single-sex college." See 766 F. Supp., at 1429 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Whatever internal purpose the Mission
Study Committee served--and however well-meaning the framers of
the report--we can hardly extract from that effort any state policy
evenhandedly to advance diverse educational options. As the District
Court observed, the Committee's analysis "primarily focuse[d] on
anticipated difficulties in attracting females to VMI," and the report,
overall, supplied "very little indication of how th[e] conclusion was
reached."  Ibid.

In sum, we find no persuasive evidence in this record that VMI's
male-only admission policy "is in furtherance of a state policy of
`diversity.'"  See 976 F. 2d, at 899. No such policy, the Fourth
Circuit observed, can be discerned from the movement of all other
public colleges and universities in Virginia away from single-sex
education. See ibid. That court also questioned "how one institution
with autonomy, but with no authority over any other state institution,
can give effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."
Ibid. A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational
options, as the Court of Appeals recognized, is not served by VMI's
historic and constant plan--a plan to "affor[d] a unique educational
benefit only to males."  Ibid. However "liberally" this plan serves
the State's sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters.
That is not equal protection.


Virginia next argues that VMI's adversative method of training
provides educational benefits that cannot be made available,
unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would
necessarily be "radical," so "drastic," Virginia asserts, as to
transform, indeed "destroy," VMI's program. See Brief for Cross-
Petitioners 34-36. Neither sex would be favored by the
transformation, Virginia maintains: Men would be deprived of the
unique opportunity currently available to them; women would not
gain that opportunity because their participation would "eliminat[e]
the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from . . .
other institutions of higher education in Virginia."  Id., at 34 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

The District Court forecast from expert witness testimony, and the
Court of Appeals accepted, that coeducation would materially affect
"at least these three aspects of VMI's program--physical training, the
absence of privacy, and the adversative approach."  976 F. 2d, at
896-897. And it is uncontested that women's admission would
require accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments
and physical training programs for female cadets. See Brief for
Cross-Respondent 11, 29-30. It is also undisputed, however, that
"the VMI methodology could be used to educate women."  852 F.
Supp., at 481. The District Court even allowed that some women
may prefer it to the methodology a women's college might pursue.
See ibid. "[S]ome women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if
they had the opportunity," the District Court recognized, 766 F.
Supp., at 1414, and "some women," the expert testimony
established, "are capable of all of the individual activities required of
VMI cadets," id., at 1412. The parties, furthermore, agree that
"some women can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s]
on men." 976 F. 2d, at 896. In sum, as the Court of Appeals stated,
"neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers," VMI's raison d'tre,
"nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to
women."  Id., at 899.

In support of its initial judgment for Virginia, a judgment rejecting all
equal protection objections presented by the United States, the
District Court made "findings" on "gender-based developmental
differences." 766 F. Supp., at 1434-1435. These "findings" restate
the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses, opinions about typically
male or typically female "tendencies."  Id., at 1434. For example,
"[m]ales tend to need an atmosphere of adversativeness," while
"[f]emales tend to thrive in a cooperative atmosphere."  Ibid. "I'm
not saying that some women don't do well under [the] adversative
model," VMI's expert on educational institutions testified,
"undoubtedly there are some [women] who do"; but educational
experiences must be designed "around the rule," this expert
maintained, and not "around the exception."  Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).

The United States does not challenge any expert witness estimation
on average capacities or preferences of men and women. Instead, the
United States emphasizes that time and again since this Court's
turning point decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), we
have cautioned reviewing courts to take a "hard look" at
generalizations or "tendencies" of the kind pressed by Virginia, and
relied upon by the District Court. See O'Connor, Portia's Progress,
66 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1546, 1551 (1991). State actors controlling
gates to opportunity, we have instructed, may not exclude qualified
individuals based on "fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities
of males and females."  Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458  U. S.,
at 725; see J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 139, n. 11 (equal protection
principles, as applied to gender classifications, mean state actors may
not rely on "overbroad" generalizations to make "judgments about
people that are likely to . . . perpetuate historical patterns of
discrimination").

It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most women
would not choose VMI's adversative method. As Fourth Circuit
Judge Motz observed, however, in her dissent from the Court of
Appeals' denial of rehearing en banc, it is also probable that "many
men would not want to be educated in such an environment."  52 F.
3d, at 93. (On that point, even our dissenting colleague might
agree.) Education, to be sure, is not a "one size fits all" business.
The issue, however, is not whether "women--or men--should be
forced to attend VMI"; rather, the question is whether the State can
constitutionally deny to women who have the will and capacity, the
training and attendant opportunities that VMI uniquely affords. Ibid.

The notion that admission of women would downgrade VMI's
stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the
school,11  is a judgment hardly proved,12  a prediction hardly
different from other "self-fulfilling prophec[ies]," see Mississippi
Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 730, once routinely used to deny
rights or opportunities. When women first sought admission to the
bar and access to legal education, concerns of the same order were
expressed. For example, in 1876, the Court of Common Pleas of
Hennepin County, Minnesota, explained why women were thought
ineligible for the practice of law. Women train and educate the
young, the court said, which

"forbids that they shall bestow that time (early and late) and labor, so
essential in attaining to the eminence to which the true lawyer should
ever aspire. It cannot therefore be said that the opposition of courts
to the admission of females to practice . . . is to any extent the
outgrowth of . . . `old fogyism[.]' . . . [I]t arises rather from a
comprehension of the magnitude of the responsibilities connected
with the successful practice of law, and a desire to grade up the
profession."  In re Application of Martha Angle Dorsett to Be
Admitted to Practice as Attorney and Counselor at Law (Minn. C. P.
Hennepin Cty., 1876), in The Syllabi, Oct. 21, 1876, pp. 5, 6
(emphasis added).

A like fear, according to a 1925 report, accounted for Columbia Law
School's resistance to women's admission, although

"[t]he faculty . . . never maintained that women could not master
legal learning . . . . No, its argument has been... more practical. If
women were admitted to the Columbia Law School, [the faculty]
said, then the choicer, more manly and red-blooded graduates of our
great universities would go to the Harvard Law School!"  The
Nation, Feb. 18, 1925, p. 173.

Medical faculties similarly resisted men and women as partners in the
study of medicine. See R. Morantz-Sanchez, Sympathy and Science:
Women Physicians in American Medicine 51-54, 250 (1985); see
also M. Walsh, "Doctors Wanted: No Women Need Apply" 121-122
(1977) (quoting E. Clarke, Medical Education of Women, 4 Boston
Med. & Surg. J. 345, 346 (1869) ("`God forbid that I should ever
see men and women aiding each other to display with the scalpel the
secrets of the reproductive system . . . .'")); cf. supra, at 18-19, n.
9. More recently, women seeking careers in policing encountered
resistance based on fears that their presence would "undermine male
solidarity," see F. Heidensohn, Women in Control? 201 (1992);
deprive male partners of adequate assistance, see id., at 184-185; and
lead to sexual misconduct, see C. Milton et al., Women in Policing
32-33 (1974). Field studies did not confirm these fears. See
Women in Control? supra, at 92-93; P. Bloch & D. Anderson,
Policewomen on Patrol: Final Report (1974).

Women's successful entry into the federal military academies,13  and
their participation in the Nation's military forces,14  indicate that
Virginia's fears for the future of VMI may not be solidly
grounded.15   The State's justification for excluding all women from
"citizen-soldier" training for which some are qualified, in any event,
cannot rank as "exceedingly persuasive," as we have explained and
applied that standard.

Virginia and VMI trained their argument on "means" rather than
"end," and thus misperceived our precedent. Single-sex education at
VMI serves an "important governmental objective," they maintained,
and exclusion of women is not only "substantially related," it is
essential to that objective. By this notably circular argument, the
"straightforward" test Mississippi Univ. for Women described, see
458 U. S., at 724-725, was bent and bowed.

The State's misunderstanding and, in turn, the District Court's, is
apparent from VMI's mission: to produce "citizen-soldiers,"
individuals

"`imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and
attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service,
advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and
ready . . . to defend their country in time of national peril.'"  766 F.
Supp., at 1425 (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board
of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).

Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women, who today
count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men.
Just as surely, the State's great goal is not substantially advanced by
women's categorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual
merit, from the State's premier "citizen-soldier" corps.16 Virginia, in
sum, "has fallen far short of establishing the `exceedingly persuasive
justification,'" Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 731, that
must be the solid base for any gender-defined classification.


In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presented its remedial
plan--maintain VMI as a male-only college and create VWIL as a
separate program for women. The plan met District Court approval.
The Fourth Circuit, in turn, deferentially reviewed the State's
proposal and decided that the two single-sex programs directly
served Virginia's reasserted purposes: single-gender education, and
"achieving the results of an adversative method in a military
environment."  See 44 F. 3d, at 1236, 1239. Inspecting the VMI and
VWIL educational programs to determine whether they "afford[ed] to
both genders benefits comparable in substance, [if] not in form and
detail," id., at 1240, the Court of Appeals concluded that Virginia
had arranged for men and women opportunities "sufficiently
comparable" to survive equal protection evaluation, id., at 1240-
1241. The United States challenges this "remedial" ruling as
pervasively misguided.


A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the
constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons
unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in "the position
they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination]."  See
Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 280 (1977) (internal quotation
marks omitted). The constitutional violation in this case is the
categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational
opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional
exclusion, we have explained, aims to "eliminate [so far as possible]
the discriminatory effects of the past" and to "bar like discrimination
in the future."  Louisiana v. United States, 380 U. S. 145, 154
(1965).

Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched, VMI's
exclusionary policy. For women only, however, Virginia proposed
a separate program, different in kind from VMI and unequal in
tangible and intangible facilities.17   Having violated the
Constitution's equal protection requirement, Virginia was obliged to
show that its remedial proposal "directly address[ed] and relate[d] to"
the violation, see Milliken, 433 U. S., at 282, i.e., the equal
protection denied to women ready, willing, and able to benefit from
educational opportunities of the kind VMI offers. Virginia described
VWIL as a "parallel program," and asserted that VWIL shares VMI's
mission of producing "citizen-soldiers" and VMI's goals of
providing "education, military training, mental and physical
discipline, character . . . and leadership development." Brief for
Respondents 24 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the VWIL
program could not "eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past,"
could it at least "bar like discrimination in the future"? See
Louisiana, 380 U. S., at 154. A comparison of the programs said to
be "parallel" informs our answer. In exposing the character of, and
differences in, the VMI and VWIL programs, we recapitulate facts
earlier presented. See supra, at 2-5, 8-9.

VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous
military training for which VMI is famed. See 766 F. Supp., at
1413-1414 ("No other school in Virginia or in the United States,
public or private, offers the same kind of rigorous military training as
is available at VMI."); id., at 1421 (VMI "is known to be the most
challenging military school in the United States"). Instead, the
VWIL program "deemphasize[s]" military education, 44 F. 3d, at
1234, and uses a "cooperative method" of education "which
reinforces self-esteem," 852 F. Supp., at 476.

VWIL students participate in ROTC and a "largely ceremonial"
Virginia Corps of Cadets, see 44 F. 3d, at 1234, but Virginia
deliberately did not make VWIL a military institute. The VWIL
House is not a military-style residence and VWIL students need not
live together throughout the 4-year program, eat meals together, or
wear uniforms during the school day. See 852 F. Supp., at 477,
495. VWIL students thus do not experience the "barracks" life
"crucial to the VMI experience," the spartan living arrangements
designed to foster an "egalitarian ethic." See 766 F. Supp., at 1423-
1424. "[T]he most important aspects of the VMI educational
experience occur in the barracks," the District Court found, id., at
1423, yet Virginia deemed that core experience nonessential, indeed
inappropriate, for training its female citizen-soldiers.


VWIL students receive their "leadership training" in seminars,
externships, and speaker series, see 852 F. Supp., at 477, episodes
and encounters lacking the "[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, . . .
minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values"
made hallmarks of VMI's citizen-soldier training, see 766 F. Supp.,
at 1421.18   Kept away from the pressures, hazards, and
psychological bonding characteristic of VMI's adversative training,
see id., at 1422, VWIL students will not know the "feeling of
tremendous accomplishment" commonly experienced by VMI's
successful cadets, id., at 1426.

Virginia maintains that these methodological differences are "justified
pedagogically," based on "important differences between men and
women in learning and developmental needs," "psychological and
sociological differences" Virginia describes as "real" and "not
stereotypes."  Brief for Respondents 28 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The Task Force charged with developing the leadership
program for women, drawn from the staff and faculty at Mary
Baldwin College, "determined that a military model and, especially
VMI's adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for
educating and training most women."  852 F. Supp., at 476
(emphasis added). See also 44 F. 3d, at 1233-1234 (noting Task
Force conclusion that, while "some women would be suited to and
interested in [a VMI-style experience]," VMI's adversative method
"would not be effective for women as a group") (emphasis added).
The Commonwealth embraced the Task Force view, as did expert
witnesses who testified for Virginia. See 852 F. Supp., at 480-481.

As earlier stated, see supra, at 24, generalizations about "the way
women are," estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no
longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and
capacity place them outside the average description. Notably,
Virginia never asserted that VMI's method of education suits most
men. It is also revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to
make the VWIL experience "the entirely militaristic experience of
VMI" on the ground that VWIL "is planned for women who do not
necessarily expect to pursue military careers."  852 F. Supp., at 478.
By that reasoning, VMI's "entirely militaristic" program would be
inappropriate for men in general or as a group, for "[o]nly about 15%
of VMI cadets enter career military service."  See 766 F. Supp., at
1432.


In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia
rests, we note again these dispositive realties: VMI's "implementing
methodology" is not "inherently unsuitable to women," 976 F. 2d, at
899; "some women . . . do well under [the] adversative model," 766
F. Supp., at 1434 (internal quotation marks omitted); "some women,
at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity," id.,
at 1414; "some women are capable of all of the individual activities
required of VMI cadets," id., at 1412, and "can meet the physical
standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men," 976 F. 2d, at 896. It is on
behalf of these women that the United States has instituted this suit,
and it is for them that a remedy must be crafted,19 a remedy that will
end their exclusion from a state-supplied educational opportunity for
which they are fit, a decree that will "bar like discrimination in the
future."  Louisiana, 380 U. S., at 154.


In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL does not
qualify as VMI's equal. VWIL's student body, faculty, course
offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI's. Nor can the VWIL
graduate anticipate the benefits associated with VMI's 157-year
history, the school's prestige, and its influential alumni network.

Mary Baldwin College, whose degree VWIL students will gain,
enrolls first-year women with an average combined SAT score about
100 points lower than the average score for VMI freshmen. 852 F.
Supp., at 501. The Mary Baldwin faculty holds "significantly fewer
Ph.D.'s," id., at 502, and receives substantially lower salaries, see
Tr. 158 (testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College),
than the faculty at VMI.

Mary Baldwin does not offer a VWIL student the range of curricular
choices available to a VMI cadet. VMI awards baccalaureate degrees
in liberal arts, biology, chemistry, civil engineering, electrical and
computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. See 852 F.
Supp., at 503; Virginia Military Institute: More than an Education 11
(Govt. exh. 75, lodged with Clerk of this Court). VWIL students
attend a school that "does not have a math and science focus," 852 F.
Supp., at 503; they cannot take at Mary Baldwin any courses in
engineering or the advanced math and physics courses VMI offers,
see id., at 477.

For physical training, Mary Baldwin has "two multi-purpose fields"
and "[o]ne gymnasium."  Id., at 503. VMI has "an NCAA
competition level indoor track and field facility; a number of multi-
purpose fields; baseball, soccer and lacrosse fields; an obstacle
course; large boxing, wrestling and martial arts facilities; an 11-laps-
to-the-mile indoor running course; an indoor pool; indoor and
outdoor rifle ranges; and a football stadium that also contains a
practice field and outdoor track." Ibid.

Although Virginia has represented that it will provide equal financial
support for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets, id., at 483, and
the VMI Foundation has agreed to endow VWIL with $5.4625
million, id., at 499, the difference between the two schools' financial
reserves is pronounced. Mary Baldwin's endowment, currently
about $19 million, will gain an additional $35 million based on future
commitments; VMI's current endowment, $131 million--the largest
per-student endowment in the Nation--will gain $220 million. Id., at
503.

The VWIL student does not graduate with the advantage of a VMI
degree. Her diploma does not unite her with the legions of VMI
"graduates [who] have distinguished themselves" in military and
civilian life. See 976 F. 2d, at 892-893. "[VMI] alumni are
exceptionally close to the school," and that closeness accounts, in
part, for VMI's success in attracting applicants. See 766 F. Supp.,
at 1421. A VWIL graduate cannot assume that the "network of
business owners, corporations, VMI graduates and non-graduate
employers . . . interested in hiring VMI graduates," 852 F. Supp., at
499, will be equally responsive to her search for employment, see 44
F. 3d, at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting) ("the powerful political and
economic ties of the VMI alumni network cannot be expected to
open" for graduates of the fledgling VWIL program).

Virginia, in sum, while maintaining VMI for men only, has failed to
provide any "comparable single-gender women's institution."  Id., at
1241. Instead, the Commonwealth has created a VWIL program
fairly appraised as a "pale shadow" of VMI in terms of the range of
curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni
support and influence. See id., at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting).

Virginia's VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedy Texas
proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trial court's 1946 ruling
that, given the equal protection guarantee, African Americans could
not be denied a legal education at a state facility. See Sweatt v.
Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950). Reluctant to admit African
Americans to its flagship University of Texas Law School, the State
set up a separate school for Herman Sweatt and other black law
students. Id., at 632. As originally opened, the new school had no
independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation. Id., at
633. Nevertheless, the state trial and appellate courts were satisfied
that the new school offered Sweatt opportunities for the study of law
"substantially equivalent to those offered by the State to white
students at the University of Texas."  Id., at 632 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

Before this Court considered the case, the new school had gained "a
faculty of five full-time professors; a student body of 23; a library of
some 16,500 volumes serviced by a full-time staff; a practice court
and legal aid association; and one alumnus who ha[d] become a
member of the Texas Bar."  Id., at 633. This Court contrasted
resources at the new school with those at the school from which
Sweatt had been excluded. The University of Texas Law School had
a full-time faculty of 16, a student body of 850, a library containing
over 65,000 volumes, scholarship funds, a law review, and moot
court facilities. Id., at 632-633.

More important than the tangible features, the Court emphasized, are
"those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but
which make for greatness" in a school, including "reputation of the
faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of
the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige."  Id.,
at 634. Facing the marked differences reported in the Sweatt
opinion, the Court unanimously ruled that Texas had not shown
"substantial equality in the [separate] educational opportunities" the
State offered. Id., at 633. Accordingly, the Court held, the Equal
Protection Clause required Texas to admit African Americans to the
University of Texas Law School. Id., at 636. In line with Sweatt,
we rule here that Virginia has not shown substantial equality in the
separate educational opportunities the State supports at VWIL and
VMI.


When Virginia tendered its VWIL plan, the Fourth Circuit did not
inquire whether the proposed remedy, approved by the District
Court, placed women denied the VMI advantage in "the position they
would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination]."  Milliken,
433  U. S., at 280 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the
Court of Appeals considered whether the State could provide, with
fidelity to the equal protection principle, separate and unequal
educational programs for men and women.

The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that "the VWIL degree from Mary
Baldwin College lacks the historical benefit and prestige of a degree
from VMI."  44 F. 3d, at 1241. The Court of Appeals further
observed that VMI is "an ongoing and successful institution with a
long history," and there remains no "comparable single-gender
women's institution." Ibid. Nevertheless, the appeals court declared
the substantially different and significantly unequal VWIL program
satisfactory. The court reached that result by revising the applicable
standard of review. The Fourth Circuit displaced the standard
developed in our precedent, see supra, at 13-16, and substituted a
standard of its own invention.

We have earlier described the deferential review in which the Court
of Appeals engaged, see supra, at 10-11, a brand of review
inconsistent with the more exacting standard our precedent requires,
see supra, at 13-16. Quoting in part from Mississippi Univ. for
Women, the Court of Appeals candidly described its own analysis as
one capable of checking a legislative purpose ranked as "pernicious,"
but generally according "deference to [the] legislative will."  44 F.
3d, at 1235, 1236. Recognizing that it had extracted from our
decisions a test yielding "little or no scrutiny of the effect of a
classification directed at [single-gender education]," the Court of
Appeals devised another test, a "substantive comparability" inquiry,
id., at 1237, and proceeded to find that new test satisfied, id., at
1241.

The Fourth Circuit plainly erred in exposing Virginia's VWIL plan to
a deferential analysis, for "all gender-based classifications today"
warrant "heightened scrutiny."  See J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 136.
Valuable as VWIL may prove for students who seek the program
offered, Virginia's remedy affords no cure at all for the opportunities
and advantages withheld from women who want a VMI education
and can make the grade. See supra, at 31-36.20   In sum, Virginia's
remedy does not match the constitutional violation; the State has
shown no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for withholding
from women qualified for the experience premier training of the kind
VMI affords.


A generation ago, "the authorities controlling Virginia higher
education," despite long established tradition, agreed "to innovate
and favorably entertain[ed] the [then] relatively new idea that there
must be no discrimination by sex in offering educational
opportunity." Kirstein, 309 F. Supp., at 186. Commencing in 1970,
Virginia opened to women "educational opportunities at the
Charlottesville campus that [were] not afforded in other [State-
operated] institutions."  Id., at 187; see supra, at 20. A federal court
approved the State's innovation, emphasizing that the University of
Virginia "offer[ed] courses of instruction . . . not available
elsewhere."  309 F. Supp., at 187. The court further noted: "[T]here
exists at Charlottesville a `prestige' factor [not paralleled in] other
Virginia educational institutions."  Ibid.

VMI, too, offers an educational opportunity no other Virginia
institution provides, and the school's "prestige"--associated with its
success in developing "citizen-soldiers"--is unequaled. Virginia has
closed this facility to its daughters and, instead, has devised for them
a "parallel program," with a faculty less impressively credentialed
and less well paid, more limited course offerings, fewer
opportunities for military training and for scientific specialization.
Cf. Sweatt, 339  U. S., at 633. VMI, beyond question, "possesses
to a far greater degree" than the VWIL program "those qualities
which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for
greatness in a . . . school," including "position and influence of the
alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige."  Id., at
634. Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education cannot be
offered anything less, under the State's obligation to afford them
genuinely equal protection.

A prime part of the history of our Constitution, historian Richard
Morris recounted, is the story of the extension of constitutional rights
and protections to people once ignored or excluded.21   VMI's story
continued as our comprehension of "We the People" expanded. See
supra, at 29, n. 16. There is no reason to believe that the admission
of women capable of all the activities required of VMI cadets would
destroy the Institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the
"more perfect Union."

For the reasons stated, the initial judgment of the Court of Appeals,
976 F. 2d 890 (CA4 1992), is affirmed, the final judgment of the
Court of Appeals, 44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995), is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of this
case.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in judgment. The Court
holds first that Virginia violates the Equal Protection Clause by
maintaining the Virginia Military Institute's (VMI's) all-male
admissions policy, and second that establishing the Virginia
Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) program does not remedy
that violation. While I agree with these conclusions, I disagree with
the Court's analysis and so I write separately.


Two decades ago in Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976), we
announced that "[t]o withstand constitutional challenge, . . .
classifications by gender must serve important governmental
objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those
objectives."  We have adhered to that standard of scrutiny ever since.
See Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 210-211 (1977); Califano
v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313, 316-317 (1977); Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S.
268, 279 (1979); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380, 388 (1979);
Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 234-235, 235, n. 9 (1979);
Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 273
(1979); Califano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 85 (1979); Wengler v.
Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150 (1980); Kirchberg v.
Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 459-460 (1981); Michael M. v. Superior
Court, Sonoma Cty., 450 U. S. 464, 469 (1981); Mississippi Univ.
for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982); Heckler v.
Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 744 (1984); J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.
B., 511 U. S. ___, ___, n.6 (slip op., at 10, n.6) (1994). While the
majority adheres to this test today, ante, at 6, 15, it also says that the
State must demonstrate an "`exceedingly persuasive justification'" to
support a gender-based classification. See ante, at 6, 11, 12, 13, 15,
16, 28, 29, 39. It is unfortunate that the Court thereby introduces an
element of uncertainty respecting the appropriate test.

While terms like "important governmental objective" and
"substantially related" are hardly models of precision, they have more
content and specificity than does the phrase "exceedingly persuasive
justification."  That phrase is best confined, as it was first used, as an
observation on the difficulty of meeting the applicable test, not as a
formulation of the test itself. See, e.g., Feeney, supra, at 273
("[T]hese precedents dictate that any state law overtly or covertly
designed to prefer males over females in public employment require
an exceedingly persuasive justification"). To avoid introducing
potential confusion, I would have adhered more closely to our
traditional, "firmly established," Hogan, supra, at 723; Heckler,
supra, at 744, standard that a gender-based classification "must bear
a close and substantial relationship to important governmental
objectives."  Feeney, supra, at 273.

Our cases dealing with gender discrimination also require that the
proffered purpose for the challenged law be the actual purpose. See
ante, at 15, 18. It is on this ground that the Court rejects the first of
two justifications Virginia offers for VMI's single-sex admissions
policy, namely, the goal of diversity among its public educational
institutions. While I ultimately agree that the State has not carried the
day with this justification, I disagree with the Court's method of
analyzing the issue.

VMI was founded in 1839, and, as the Court notes, ante, at 18-19,
admission was limited to men because under the then-prevailing view
men, not women, were destined for higher education. However
misguided this point of view may be by present-day standards, it
surely was not unconstitutional in 1839. The adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment, with its Equal Protection Clause, was nearly
30 years in the future. The interpretation of the Equal Protection
Clause to require heightened scrutiny for gender discrimination was
yet another century away.

Long after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, and well into
this century, legal distinctions between men and women were
thought to raise no question under the Equal Protection Clause. The
Court refers to our decision in Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 466
(1948). Likewise representing that now abandoned view was Hoyt
v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961), where the Court upheld a Florida
system of jury selection in which men were automatically placed on
jury lists, but women were placed there only if they expressed an
affirmative desire to serve. The Court noted that despite advances in
women's opportunities, the "woman is still regarded as the center of
home and family life."  Id., at 62.

Then, in 1971, we decided Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, which the
Court correctly refers to as a seminal case. But its facts have nothing
to do with admissions to any sort of educational institution. An
Idaho statute governing the administration of estates and probate
preferred men to women if the other statutory qualifications were
equal. The statute's purpose, according to the Idaho Supreme Court,
was to avoid hearings to determine who was better qualified as
between a man and a woman both applying for letters of
administration. This Court held that such a rule violated the
Fourteenth Amendment because "a mandatory preference to members
of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the
elimination of hearings" was an "arbitrary legislative choice
forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause."  Id., at 76. The brief
opinion in Reed made no mention of either Goesaert or Hoyt.

Even at the time of our decision in Reed v. Reed, therefore, Virginia
and VMI were scarcely on notice that its holding would be extended
across the constitutional board. They were entitled to believe that
"one swallow doesn't make a summer" and await further
developments. Those developments were 11 years in coming. In
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982), a
case actually involving a single-sex admissions policy in higher
education, the Court held that the exclusion of men from a nursing
program violated the Equal Protection Clause. This holding did place
Virginia on notice that VMI's men-only admissions policy was open
to serious question.

The VMI Board of Visitors, in response, appointed a Mission Study
Committee to examine "the legality and wisdom of VMI's single-sex
policy in light of" Hogan. 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1427 (WD Va.
1991). But the committee ended up cryptically recommending
against changing VMI's status as a single-sex college. After three
years of study, the committee found "`no information'" that would
warrant a change in VMI's status. Id., at 1429. Even the District
Court, ultimately sympathetic to VMI's position, found that "[t]he
Report provided very little indication of how [its] conclusion was
reached" and that "the one and one-half pages in the committee's final
report devoted to analyzing the information it obtained primarily
focuses on anticipated difficulties in attracting females to VMI." Ibid.
The reasons given in the report for not changing the policy were the
changes that admission of women to VMI would require, and the
likely effect of those changes on the institution. That VMI would
have to change is simply not helpful in addressing the
constitutionality of the status after Hogan.

Before this Court, Virginia has sought to justify VMI's single-sex
admissions policy primarily on the basis that diversity in education is
desirable, and that while most of the public institutions of higher
learning in the State are coeducational, there should also be room for
single-sex institutions. I agree with the Court that there is scant
evidence in the record that this was the real reason that Virginia
decided to maintain VMI as men only.* But, unlike the majority, I
would consider only evidence that postdates our decision in Hogan,
and would draw no negative inferences from the State's actions
before that time. I think that after Hogan, the State was entitled to
reconsider its policy with respect to VMI, and to not have earlier
justifications, or lack thereof, held against it.

Even if diversity in educational opportunity were the State's actual
objective, the State's position would still be problematic. The
difficulty with its position is that the diversity benefited only one sex;
there was single-sex public education available for men at VMI, but
no corresponding single-sex public education available for women.
When Hogan placed Virginia on notice that VMI's admissions policy
possibly was unconstitutional, VMI could have dealt with the
problem by admitting women; but its governing body felt strongly
that the admission of women would have seriously harmed the
institution's educational approach. Was there something else the
State could have done to avoid an equal protection violation? Since
the State did nothing, we do not have to definitively answer that
question.

I do not think, however, that the State's options were as limited as
the majority may imply. The Court cites, without expressly
approving it, a statement from the opinion of the dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeals, to the effect that the State could have
"simultaneously opened single-gender undergraduate institutions
having substantially comparable curricular and extra-curricular
programs, funding, physical plant, administration and support
services, and faculty and library resources." Ante, at 11-12 (internal
quotation marks omitted). If this statement is thought to exclude
other possibilities, it is too stringent a requirement. VMI had been in
operation for over a century and a half, and had an established,
successful and devoted group of alumni. No legislative wand could
instantly call into existence a similar institution for women; and it
would be a tremendous loss to scrap VMI's history and tradition. In
the words of Grover Cleveland's second inaugural address, the State
faced a condition, not a theory. And it was a condition that had been
brought about, not through defiance of decisions construing gender
bias under the Equal Protection Clause, but, until the decision in
Hogan, a condition which had not appeared to offend the
Constitution. Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote
comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed
through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal
protection violation. I do not believe the State was faced with the
stark choice of either admitting women to VMI, on the one hand, or
abandoning VMI and starting from scratch for both men and women,
on the other.

But, as I have noted, neither the governing board of VMI nor the
State took any action after 1982. If diversity in the form of single-
sex, as well as coeducational, institutions of higher learning were to
be available to Virginians, that diversity had to be available to women
as well as to men.

The dissent criticizes me for "disregarding the four all-women's
private colleges in Virginia (generously assisted by public funds)."
Post, at 32. The private women's colleges are treated by the State
exactly as all other private schools are treated, which includes the
provision of tuition-assistance grants to Virginia residents. Virginia
gives no special support to the women's single-sex education. But
obviously, the same is not true for men's education. Had the State
provided the kind of support for the private women's schools that it
provides for VMI, this may have been a very different case. For in so
doing, the State would have demonstrated that its interest in
providing a single-sex education for men, was to some measure
matched by an interest in providing the same opportunity for women.

Virginia offers a second justification for the single-sex admissions
policy: maintenance of the adversative method. I agree with the
Court that this justification does not serve an important governmental
objective. A State does not have substantial interest in the
adversative methodology unless it is pedagogically beneficial. While
considerable evidence shows that a single-sex education is
pedagogically beneficial for some students, see 766 F. Supp., at
1414, and hence a State may have a valid interest in promoting that
methodology, there is no similar evidence in the record that an
adversative method is pedagogically beneficial or is any more likely
to produce character traits than other methodologies.


The Court defines the constitutional violation in this case as "the
categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational
opportunity afforded to men." Ante, at 30. By defining the violation
in this way, and by emphasizing that a remedy for a constitutional
violation must place the victims of discrimination in "`the position
they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination],'" ibid.,
the Court necessarily implies that the only adequate remedy would be
the admission of women to the all-male institution. As the foregoing
discussion suggests, I would not define the violation in this way; it is
not the "exclusion of women" that violates the Equal Protection
Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing
any--much less a comparable--institution for women.

Accordingly, the remedy should not necessarily require either the
admission of women to VMI, or the creation of a VMI clone for
women. An adequate remedy in my opinion might be a
demonstration by Virginia that its interest in educating men in a
single-sex environment is matched by its interest in educating women
in a single-sex institution. To demonstrate such, the State does not
need to create two institutions with the same number of faculty
PhD's, similar SAT scores, or comparable athletic fields. See ante,
at 34-35. Nor would it necessarily require that the women's
institution offer the same curriculum as the men's; one could be
strong in computer science, the other could be strong in liberal arts.
It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions
offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall
calibre.

If a state decides to create single-sex programs, the state would, I
expect, consider the public's interest and demand in designing
curricula. And rightfully so. But the state should avoid assuming
demand based on stereotypes; it must not assume a priori, without
evidence, that there would be no interest in a women's school of civil
engineering, or in a men's school of nursing.

In the end, the women's institution Virginia proposes, VWIL, fails
as a remedy, because it is distinctly inferior to the existing men's
institution and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. VWIL
simply is not, in any sense, the institution that VMI is. In particular,
VWIL is a program appended to a private college, not a self-standing
institution; and VWIL is substantially underfunded as compared to
VMI. I therefore ultimately agree with the Court that Virginia has not
provided an adequate remedy.

* The dissent equates our conclusion that VMI's "asserted interest in
promoting diversity" is not "`genuine,'" with a "charge" that the
diversity rationale is "a pretext for discriminating against women."
Post, at 15, 15-16. Of course, those are not the same thing. I do not
read the Court as saying that the diversity rationale is a pretext for
discrimination, and I would not endorse such a proposition. We may
find that diversity was not the State's real reason without suggesting,
or having to show, that the real reason was "antifeminism," post, at
16. Our cases simply require that the proffered purpose for the
challenged gender classification be the actual purpose, although not
necessarily recorded. See ante, at 15, 18. The dissent also says that
the interest in diversity is so transparent that having to articulate it is
"absurd on its face."  Post, at 29. Apparently, that rationale was not
obvious to the Mission Study Committee which failed to list it among
its reasons for maintaining VMI all-men admission policy.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.

Today the Court shuts down an institution that has served the people
of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and distinction for over
a century and a half. To achieve that desired result, it rejects
(contrary to our established practice) the factual findings of two
courts below, sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people. As to facts: it explicitly rejects the finding
that there exist "gender-based developmental differences" supporting
Virginia's restriction of the "adversative" method to only a men's
institution, and the finding that the all-male composition of the
Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is essential to that institution's
character. As to precedent: it drastically revises our established
standards for reviewing sex-based classifications. And as to history:
it counts for nothing the long tradition, enduring down to the present,
of men's military colleges supported by both States and the Federal
Government.

Much of the Court's opinion is devoted to deprecating the closed-
mindedness of our forebears with regard to women's education, and
even with regard to the treatment of women in areas that have nothing
to do with education. Closed-minded they were--as every age is,
including our own, with regard to matters it cannot guess, because it
simply does not consider them debatable. The virtue of a democratic
system with a First Amendment is that it readily enables the people,
over time, to be persuaded that what they took for granted is not so,
and to change their laws accordingly. That system is destroyed if the
smug assurances of each age are removed from the democratic
process and written into the Constitution. So to counterbalance the
Court's criticism of our ancestors, let me say a word in their praise:
they left us free to change. The same cannot be said of this most
illiberal Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one
after another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's law-
trained elite) into our Basic Law. Today it enshrines the notion that
no substantial educational value is to be served by an all-men's
military academy--so that the decision by the people of Virginia to
maintain such an institution denies equal protection to women who
cannot attend that institution but can attend others. Since it is entirely
clear that the Constitution of the United States--the old one--takes no
sides in this educational debate, I dissent.


I shall devote most of my analysis to evaluating the Court's opinion
on the basis of our current equal-protection jurisprudence, which
regards this Court as free to evaluate everything under the sun by
applying one of three tests: "rational basis" scrutiny, intermediate
scrutiny, or strict scrutiny. These tests are no more scientific than
their names suggest, and a further element of randomness is added
by the fact that it is largely up to us which test will be applied in each
case. Strict scrutiny, we have said, is reserved for state
"classifications based on race or national origin and classifications
affecting fundamental rights," Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461
(1988) (citation omitted). It is my position that the term
"fundamental rights" should be limited to "interest[s] traditionally
protected by our society," Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110,
122 (1989) (plurality opinion of SCALIA, J.); but the Court has not
accepted that view, so that strict scrutiny will be applied to the
deprivation of whatever sort of right we consider "fundamental."  We
have no established criterion for "intermediate scrutiny" either, but
essentially apply it when it seems like a good idea to load the dice.
So far it has been applied to content-neutral restrictions that place an
incidental burden on speech, to disabilities attendant to illegitimacy,
and to discrimination on the basis of sex. See, e.g., Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip
op., at 38); Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U. S. 91, 98-99 (1982); Craig
v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976).

I have no problem with a system of abstract tests such as rational-
basis, intermediate, and strict scrutiny (though I think we can do
better than applying strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny
whenever we feel like it). Such formulas are essential to evaluating
whether the new restrictions that a changing society constantly
imposes upon private conduct comport with that "equal protection"
our society has always accorded in the past. But in my view the
function of this Court is to preserve our society's values regarding
(among other things) equal protection, not to revise them; to prevent
backsliding from the degree of restriction the Constitution imposed
upon democratic government, not to prescribe, on our own authority,
progressively higher degrees. For that reason it is my view that,
whatever abstract tests we may choose to devise, they cannot
supersede--and indeed ought to be crafted so as to reflect--those
constant and unbroken national traditions that embody the people's
understanding of ambiguous constitutional texts. More specifically,
it is my view that "when a practice not expressly prohibited by the
text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of
open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the
beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it
down."  Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 95 (1990)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to a
practice asserted to be in violation of the post-Civil War Fourteenth
Amendment. See, e.g., Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County
of Marin, 495 U. S. 604 (1990) (plurality opinion of SCALIA, J.)
(Due Process Clause); J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S.
127, 156-163 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (Equal Protection Clause);
Planned Parenthood of S. E. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 979-984,
1000-1001 (1992) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (various alleged
"penumbras").

The all-male constitution of VMI comes squarely within such a
governing tradition. Founded by the Commonwealth of Virginia in
1839 and continuously maintained by it since, VMI has always
admitted only men. And in that regard it has not been unusual. For
almost all of VMI's more than a century and a half of existence, its
single-sex status reflected the uniform practice for government-
supported military colleges. Another famous Southern institution,
The Citadel, has existed as a state-funded school of South Carolina
since 1842. And all the federal military colleges--West Point, the
Naval Academy at Annapolis, and even the Air Force Academy,
which was not established until 1954--admitted only males for most
of their history. Their admission of women in 1976 (upon which the
Court today relies, see ante, at 27-28, nn. 13, 15), came not by court
decree, but because the people, through their elected representatives,
decreed a change. See, e.g., Pub. L. 94-106, Section 803(a), 89
Stat. 537-538 (1975). In other words, the tradition of having
government-funded military schools for men is as well rooted in the
traditions of this country as the tradition of sending only men into
military combat. The people may decide to change the one tradition,
like the other, through democratic processes; but the assertion that
either tradition has been unconstitutional through the centuries is not
law, but politics-smuggled-into-law.

And the same applies, more broadly, to single-sex education in
general, which, as I shall discuss, is threatened by today's decision
with the cut-off of all state and federal support. Government-run
nonmilitary educational institutions for the two sexes have until very
recently also been part of our national tradition. "[It is]
[c]oeducation, historically, [that] is a novel educational theory. From
grade school through high school, college, and graduate and
professional training, much of the Nation's population during much
of our history has been educated in sexually segregated classrooms."
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 736 (1982)
(Powell, J., dissenting); see id., at 736-739. These traditions may of
course be changed by the democratic decisions of the people, as they
largely have been.

Today, however, change is forced upon Virginia, and reversion to
single-sex education is prohibited nationwide, not by democratic
processes but by order of this Court. Even while bemoaning the
sorry, bygone days of "fixed notions" concerning women's
education, see ante, at 18-19, and n. 10, 20-21, 25-27, the Court
favors current notions so fixedly that it is willing to write them into
the Constitution of the United States by application of custom-built
"tests."  This is not the interpretation of a Constitution, but the
creation of one.


To reject the Court's disposition today, however, it is not necessary
to accept my view that the Court's made-up tests cannot displace
longstanding national traditions as the primary determinant of what
the Constitution means. It is only necessary to apply honestly the
test the Court has been applying to sex-based classifications for the
past two decades. It is well settled, as JUSTICE O'CONNOR stated
some time ago for a unanimous Court, that we evaluate a statutory
classification based on sex under a standard that lies "[b]etween th[e]
extremes of rational basis review and strict scrutiny."  Clark v. Jeter,
486 U. S., at 461. We have denominated this standard "intermediate
scrutiny" and under it have inquired whether the statutory
classification is "substantially related to an important governmental
objective."  Ibid. See, e.g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728,
744 (1984); Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142,
150 (1980); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S., at 197.

Before I proceed to apply this standard to VMI, I must comment
upon the manner in which the Court avoids doing so.
Notwithstanding our above-described precedents and their "`firmly
established principles,'" Heckler, supra, at 744 (quoting Hogan,
supra, at 723), the United States urged us to hold in this case "that
strict scrutiny is the correct constitutional standard for evaluating
classifications that deny opportunities to individuals based on their
sex." Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, p. 16. (This was in
flat contradiction of the Government's position below, which was, in
its own words, to "stat[e] unequivocally that the appropriate standard
in this case is `intermediate scrutiny.'"  2 Record, Doc. No. 88, p. 3
(emphasis added).) The Court, while making no reference to the
Government's argument, effectively accepts it.

Although the Court in two places recites the test as stated in Hogan,
see ante, at 6, 15, which asks whether the State has demonstrated
"that the classification serves important governmental objectives and
that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to
the achievement of those objectives," 458 U. S., at 724 (internal
quotation marks omitted), the Court never answers the question
presented in anything resembling that form. When it engages in
analysis, the Court instead prefers the phrase "exceedingly
persuasive justification" from Hogan. The Court's nine invocations
of that phrase, see ante, at 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 28, 29, 39, and
even its fanciful description of that imponderable as "the core
instruction" of the Court's decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.
B., 511 U. S. 127 (1994), and Hogan, supra, see ante, at 13, would
be unobjectionable if the Court acknowledged that whether a
"justification" is "exceedingly persuasive" must be assessed by
asking "[whether] the classification serves important governmental
objectives and [whether] the discriminatory means employed are
substantially related to the achievement of those objectives."  Instead,
however, the Court proceeds to interpret "exceedingly persuasive
justification" in a fashion that contradicts the reasoning of Hogan and
our other precedents.

That is essential to the Court's result, which can only be achieved by
establishing that intermediate scrutiny is not survived if there are
some women interested in attending VMI, capable of undertaking its
activities, and able to meet its physical demands. Thus, the Court
summarizes its holding as follows:

"In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia
rests, we note again these dispositive realities: VMI's implementing
methodology is not inherently unsuitable to women; some women do
well under the adversative model; some women, at least, would want
to attend VMI if they had the opportunity; some women are capable
of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets and can meet
the physical standards VMI now imposes on men."  Ante, at 33
(internal quotation marks, citations, and punctuation omitted,
emphasis added).

Similarly, the Court states that "[t]he State's justification for
excluding all women from `citizen-soldier' training for which some
are qualified... cannot rank as `exceedingly persuasive'. . . ."  Ante,
at 28.1

Only the amorphous "exceedingly persuasive justification" phrase,
and not the standard elaboration of intermediate scrutiny, can be
made to yield this conclusion that VMI's single-sex composition is
unconstitutional because there exist several women (or, one would
have to conclude under the Court's reasoning, a single woman)
willing and able to undertake VMI's program. Intermediate scrutiny
has never required a least-restrictive-means analysis, but only a
"substantial relation" between the classification and the state interests
that it serves. Thus, in Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313 (1977)
(per curiam), we upheld a congressional statute that provided higher
Social Security benefits for women than for men. We reasoned that
"women . . . as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as
much as men," but we did not require proof that each woman so
benefited had suffered discrimination or that each disadvantaged man
had not; it was sufficient that even under the former congressional
scheme "women on the average received lower retirement benefits
than men."  Id., at 318, and n. 5 (emphasis added). The reasoning
in our other intermediate-scrutiny cases has similarly required only a
substantial relation between end and means, not a perfect fit. In
Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57 (1981), we held that selective-
service registration could constitutionally exclude women, because
even "assuming that a small number of women could be drafted for
noncombat roles, Congress simply did not consider it worth the
added burdens of including women in draft and registration plans."
Id., at 81. In Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547,
579, 582-583 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U. S. ___, ___-___ (1995) (slip
op., at 25-26), we held that a classification need not be accurate "in
every case" to survive intermediate scrutiny so long as, "in the
aggregate," it advances the underlying objective. There is simply no
support in our cases for the notion that a sex-based classification is
invalid unless it relates to characteristics that hold true in every
instance.

Not content to execute a de facto abandonment of the intermediate
scrutiny that has been our standard for sex-based classifications for
some two decades, the Court purports to reserve the question
whether, even in principle, a higher standard (i.e., strict scrutiny)
should apply. "The Court has," it says, "thus far reserved most
stringent judicial scrutiny for classifications based on race or national
origin . . . ," ante, at 14, n. 6 (emphasis added); and it describes our
earlier cases as having done no more than decline to "equat[e] gender
classifications, for all purposes, to classifications based on race or
national origin," ante, at 14 (emphasis added). The wonderful thing
about these statements is that they are not actually false--just as it
would not be actually false to say that "our cases have thus far
reserved the `beyond a reasonable doubt' standard of proof for
criminal cases," or that "we have not equated tort actions, for all
purposes, to criminal prosecutions."  But the statements are
misleading, insofar as they suggest that we have not already
categorically held strict scrutiny to be inapplicable to sex-based
classifications. See, e.g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728
(1984) (upholding state action after applying only intermediate
scrutiny); Michael M. v. Superior Court, Somoma Cty., 450 U. S.
464 (1981) (same) (plurality and both concurring opinions); Califano
v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313 (1977) (same) (per curiam). And the
statements are irresponsible, insofar as they are calculated to
destabilize current law. Our task is to clarify the law--not to muddy
the waters, and not to exact over-compliance by intimidation. The
States and the Federal Government are entitled to know before they
act the standard to which they will be held, rather than be compelled
to guess about the outcome of Supreme Court peek-a-boo.

The Court's intimations are particularly out of place because it is
perfectly clear that, if the question of the applicable standard of
review for sex-based classifications were to be regarded as an
appropriate subject for reconsideration, the stronger argument would
be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it
to rational-basis review. The latter certainly has a firmer foundation
in our past jurisprudence: Whereas no majority of the Court has ever
applied strict scrutiny in a case involving sex-based classifications,
we routinely applied rational-basis review until the 1970's, see, e.g.,
Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.
S. 464 (1948). And of course normal, rational-basis review of sex-
based classifications would be much more in accord with the genesis
of heightened standards of judicial review, the famous footnote in
United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144 (1938),
which said (intimatingly) that we did not have to inquire in the case at
hand

"whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a
special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of
those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect
minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching
judicial inquiry."  Id., at 152-153, n. 4.

It is hard to consider women a "discrete and insular minorit[y]"
unable to employ the "political processes ordinarily to be relied
upon," when they constitute a majority of the electorate. And the
suggestion that they are incapable of exerting that political power
smacks of the same paternalism that the Court so roundly condemns.
See, e.g., ante, at 18-20, 25-28 (and accompanying notes).
Moreover, a long list of legislation proves the proposition false. See,
e.g., Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U. S. C. Section 206(d); Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. Section 2000e-2; Title
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. Section
1681; Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-533,
102 Stat. 2689; Violence Against Women Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-
322, Title IV, 108 Stat. 1902.


With this explanation of how the Court has succeeded in making its
analysis seem orthodox--and indeed, if intimations are to be believed,
even overly generous to VMI--I now proceed to describe how the
analysis should have been conducted. The question to be answered,
I repeat, is whether the exclusion of women from VMI is
"substantially related to an important governmental objective."


It is beyond question that Virginia has an important state interest in
providing effective college education for its citizens. That single-sex
instruction is an approach substantially related to that interest should
be evident enough from the long and continuing history in this
country of men's and women's colleges. But beyond that, as the
Court of Appeals here stated: "That single-gender education at the
college level is beneficial to both sexes is a fact established in this
case."  44 F. 3d 1229, 1238 (CA4 1995) (emphasis added).

The evidence establishing that fact was overwhelming--indeed,
"virtually uncontradicted" in the words of the court that received the
evidence, 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1415 (WD Va. 1991). As an initial
matter, Virginia demonstrated at trial that "[a] substantial body of
contemporary scholarship and research supports the proposition that,
although males and females have significant areas of developmental
overlap, they also have differing developmental needs that are deep-
seated."  Id., at 1434. While no one questioned that for many
students a coeducational environment was nonetheless not
inappropriate, that could not obscure the demonstrated benefits of
single-sex colleges. For example, the District Court stated as
follows:

"One empirical study in evidence, not questioned by any expert,
demonstrates that single-sex colleges provide better educational
experiences than coeducational institutions. Students of both sexes
become more academically involved, interact with faculty frequently,
show larger increases in intellectual self-esteem and are more
satisfied with practically all aspects of college experience (the sole
exception is social life) compared with their counterparts in
coeducational institutions. Attendance at an all-male college
substantially increases the likelihood that a student will carry out
career plans in law, business and college teaching, and also has a
substantial positive effect on starting salaries in business. Women's
colleges increase the chances that those who attend will obtain
positions of leadership, complete the baccalaureate degree, and aspire
to higher degrees." Id., at 1412.

See also id., at 1434-1435 (factual findings). "[I]n the light of this
very substantial authority favoring single-sex education," the District
Court concluded that "the VMI Board's decision to maintain an all-
male institution is fully justified even without taking into
consideration the other unique features of VMI's teaching and
training."  Id., at 1412. This finding alone, which even this Court
cannot dispute, see ante, at 17, should be sufficient to demonstrate
the constitutionality of VMI's all-male composition.

But besides its single-sex constitution, VMI is different from other
colleges in another way. It employs a "distinctive educational
method," sometimes referred to as the "adversative, or doubting,
model of education."  766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1421. "Physical rigor,
mental stress, absolute equality of treatment, absence of privacy,
minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values
are the salient attributes of the VMI educational experience."  Id., at
1421. No one contends that this method is appropriate for all
individuals; education is not a "one size fits all" business. Just as a
State may wish to support junior colleges, vocational institutes, or a
law school that emphasizes case practice instead of classroom study,
so too a State's decision to maintain within its system one school that
provides the adversative method is "substantially related" to its goal
of good education. Moreover, it was uncontested that "if the state
were to establish a women's VMI-type [i.e., adversative] program,
the program would attract an insufficient number of participants to
make the program work," 44 F. 3d, at 1241; and it was found by the
District Court that if Virginia were to include women in VMI, the
school "would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative
system altogether," 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Thus, Virginia's options
were an adversative method that excludes women or no adversative
method at all.

There can be no serious dispute that, as the District Court found,
single-sex education and a distinctive educational method "represent
legitimate contributions to diversity in the Virginia higher education
system."  Id., at 1413. As a theoretical matter, Virginia's educational
interest would have been best served (insofar as the two factors we
have mentioned are concerned) by six different types of public
colleges--an all-men's, an all-women's, and a coeducational college
run in the "adversative method," and an all-men's, an all-women's,
and a coeducational college run in the "traditional method."  But as a
practical matter, of course, Virginia's financial resources, like any
State's, are not limitless, and the Commonwealth must select among
the available options. Virginia thus has decided to fund, in addition to
some 14 coeducational 4-year colleges, one college that is run as an
all-male school on the adversative model: the Virginia Military
Institute.

Virginia did not make this determination regarding the make-up of its
public college system on the unrealistic assumption that no other
colleges exist. Substantial evidence in the District Court
demonstrated that the Commonwealth has long proceeded on the
principle that "`[h]igher education resources should be viewed as a
whole--public and private'"--because such an approach enhances
diversity and because "`it is academic and economic waste to permit
unwarranted duplication.'"  Id., at 1420-1421 (quoting 1974 Report
of the General Assembly Commission on Higher Education to the
General Assembly of Virginia). It is thus significant that, whereas
there are "four all-female private [colleges] in Virginia," there is only
"one private all-male college," which "indicates that the private sector
is providing for th[e] [former] form of education to a much greater
extent that it provides for all-male education."  766 F. Supp., at
1420-1421. In these circumstances, Virginia's election to fund one
public all-male institution and one on the adversative model--and to
concentrate its resources in a single entity that serves both these
interests in diversity--is substantially related to the State's important
educational interests.


The Court today has no adequate response to this clear demonstration
of the conclusion produced by application of intermediate scrutiny.
Rather, it relies on a series of contentions that are irrelevant or
erroneous as a matter of law, foreclosed by the record in this case, or
both.

1. I have already pointed out the Court's most fundamental error,
which is its reasoning that VMI's all-male composition is
unconstitutional because "some women are capable of all of the
individual activities required of VMI cadets," 766 F. Supp., at 1412,
and would prefer military training on the adversative model. See
supra, at 6-9. This unacknowledged adoption of what amounts to (at
least) strict scrutiny is without antecedent in our sex-discrimination
cases and by itself discredits the Court's decision.

2. The Court suggests that Virginia's claimed purpose in maintaining
VMI as an all-male institution--its asserted interest in promoting
diversity of educational options--is not "genuin[e]," but is a pretext
for discriminating against women. Ante, at 22; see ante, at 17-22.
To support this charge, the Court would have to impute that base
motive to VMI's Mission Study Committee, which conducted a 3-
year study from 1983 to 1986 and recommended to VMI's Board of
Visitors that the school remain all-male. The Committee, a majority
of whose members consisted of non-VMI graduates, "read materials
on education and on women in the military," "made site visits to
single-sex and newly coeducational institutions" including West
Point and the Naval Academy, and "considered the reasons that other
institutions had changed from single-sex to coeducational status"; its
work was praised as "thorough" in the accreditation review of VMI
conducted by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
See 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1428; see also id., at 1427-1430
(detailed findings of fact concerning the Mission Study Committee).
The Court states that "[w]hatever internal purpose the Mission Study
Committee served--and however well-meaning the framers of the
report--we can hardly extract from that effort any state policy
evenhandedly to advance diverse educational options."  Ante, at 22.
But whether it is part of the evidence to prove that diversity was the
Commonwealth's objective (its short report said nothing on that
particular subject) is quite separate from whether it is part of the
evidence to prove that anti-feminism was not. The relevance of the
Mission Study Committee is that its very creation, its sober 3-year
study, and the analysis it produced, utterly refute the claim that VMI
has elected to maintain its all-male student-body composition for
some misogynistic reason.

The Court also supports its analysis of Virginia's "actual state
purposes" in maintaining VMI's student body as all-male by stating
that there is no explicit statement in the record "`in which the
Commonwealth has expressed itself'" concerning those purposes.
Ante, at 18, 21 (quoting 976 F. 2d 890, 899 (CA4 1992)); see also
ante, at 7. That is wrong on numerous grounds. First and foremost,
in its implication that such an explicit statement of "actual purposes"
is needed. The Court adopts, in effect, the argument of the United
States that since the exclusion of women from VMI in 1839 was
based on the "assumptions" of the time "that men alone were fit for
military and leadership roles," and since "[b]efore this litigation was
initiated, Virginia never sought to supply a valid, contemporary
rationale for VMI's exclusionary policy," "[t]hat failure itself renders
the VMI policy invalid." Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, at
10. This is an unheard-of doctrine. Each state decision to adopt or
maintain a governmental policy need not be accompanied--in
anticipation of litigation and on pain of being found to lack a relevant
state interest--by a lawyer's contemporaneous recitation of the State's
purposes. The Constitution is not some giant Administrative
Procedure Act, which imposes upon the States the obligation to set
forth a "statement of basis and purpose" for their sovereign acts, see
5  U. S. C. Section 553(c). The situation would be different if what
the Court assumes to have been the 1839 policy had been enshrined
and remained enshrined in legislation--a VMI charter, perhaps,
pronouncing that the institution's purpose is to keep women in their
place. But since the 1839 policy was no more explicitly recorded
than the Court contends the present one is, the mere fact that today's
Commonwealth continues to fund VMI "is enough to answer [the
United States'] contention that the [classification] was the `accidental
by-product of a traditional way of thinking about females.'" Michael
M., 450 U. S., at 471, n. 6 (plurality opinion) (quoting Califano v.
Webster, 430 U. S. 313, 320 (1977)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

It is, moreover, not true that Virginia's contemporary reasons for
maintaining VMI are not explicitly recorded. It is hard to imagine a
more authoritative source on this subject than the 1990 Report of the
Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century to the
Governor and General Assembly (1990 Report). As the parties
stipulated, that report "notes that the hallmarks of Virginia's
educational policy are `diversity and autonomy.'" Stipulations of
Fact, at 37, reprinted in Lodged Materials from the Record 64
(Lodged Materials). It said: "The formal system of higher education
in Virginia includes a great array of institutions: state-supported and
independent, two-year and senior, research and highly specialized,
traditionally black and single-sex."  1990 Report, quoted in relevant
part at Lodged Materials 64-65 (emphasis added).2   The Court's
only response to this is repeated reliance on the Court of Appeals'
assertion that "`the only explicit [statement] that we have found in the
record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect
to gender distinctions'" (namely, the statement in the 1990 Report
that the Commonwealth's institutions must "deal with faculty, staff,
and students without regard to sex") had nothing to do with the
purpose of diversity. Ante, at 7, 21 (quoting 976 F. 2d, at 899).
This proves, I suppose, that the Court of Appeals did not find a
statement dealing with sex and diversity in the record; but the
pertinent question (accepting the need for such a statement) is
whether it was there. And the plain fact, which the Court does not
deny, is that it was.

The Court contends that "[a] purpose genuinely to advance an array
of educational options . . . is not served" by VMI. Ante, at 22. It
relies on the fact that all of Virginia's other public colleges have
become coeducational. Ibid.; see also ante, at 3, n. 2. The apparent
theory of this argument is that unless Virginia pursues a great deal of
diversity, its pursuit of some diversity must be a sham. This fails to
take account of the fact that Virginia's resources cannot support all
possible permutations of schools, see supra, at 14-15, and of the fact
that Virginia coordinates its public educational offerings with the
offerings of in-state private educational institutions that the
Commonwealth provides money for its residents to attend and
otherwise assists--which include four women's colleges.3

Finally, the Court unreasonably suggests that there is some pretext in
Virginia's reliance upon decentralized decisionmaking to achieve
diversity--its granting of substantial autonomy to each institution with
regard to student-body composition and other matters, see 766 F.
Supp., at 1419. The Court adopts the suggestion of the Court of
Appeals that it is not possible for "one institution with autonomy, but
with no authority over any other state institution, [to] give effect to a
state policy of diversity among institutions."  Ante, at 22 (internal
quotation marks omitted). If it were impossible for individual human
beings (or groups of human beings) to act autonomously in effective
pursuit of a common goal, the game of soccer would not exist. And
where the goal is diversity in a free market for services, that tends to
be achieved even by autonomous actors who act out of entirely
selfish interests and make no effort to cooperate. Each Virginia
institution, that is to say, has a natural incentive to make itself
distinctive in order to attract a particular segment of student
applicants. And of course none of the institutions is entirely
autonomous; if and when the legislature decides that a particular
school is not well serving the interest of diversity--if it decides, for
example, that a men's school is not much needed--funding will
cease.4

3. In addition to disparaging Virginia's claim that VMI's single-sex
status serves a state interest in diversity, the Court finds fault with
Virginia's failure to offer education based on the adversative training
method to women. It dismisses the District Court's "`findings' on
`gender-based developmental differences'" on the ground that
"[t]hese `findings' restate the opinions of Virginia's expert
witnesses, opinions about typically male or typically female
`tendencies.'"  Ante, at 23 (quoting 766 F. Supp., at 1434-1435).
How remarkable to criticize the District Court on the ground that its
findings rest on the evidence (i.e., the testimony of Virginia's
witnesses)! That is what findings are supposed to do. It is
indefensible to tell the Commonwealth that "[t]he burden of
justification is demanding and it rests entirely on [you]," ante, at 15,
and then to ignore the District Court's findings because they rest on
the evidence put forward by the Commonwealth--particularly when,
as the District Court said, "[t]he evidence in the case . . . is virtually
uncontradicted," 766 F. Supp., at 1415 (emphasis added).

Ultimately, in fact, the Court does not deny the evidence supporting
these findings. See ante, at 24-29. It instead makes evident that the
parties to this case could have saved themselves a great deal of time,
trouble, and expense by omitting a trial. The Court simply dispenses
with the evidence submitted at trial--it never says that a single finding
of the District Court is clearly erroneous--in favor of the Justices'
own view of the world, which the Court proceeds to support with (1)
references to observations of someone who is not a witness, nor
even an educational expert, nor even a judge who reviewed the
record or participated in the judgment below, but rather a judge who
merely dissented from the Court of Appeals' decision not to rehear
this case en banc, see ante, at 24, (2) citations of nonevidentiary
materials such as amicus curiae briefs filed in this Court, see ante, at
27, nn. 13, 14, and (3) various historical anecdotes designed to
demonstrate that Virginia's support for VMI as currently constituted
reminds the Justices of the "bad old days," see ante, at 25-28.

It is not too much to say that this approach to the case has rendered
the trial a sham. But treating the evidence as irrelevant is absolutely
necessary for the Court to reach its conclusion. Not a single witness
contested, for example, Virginia's "substantial body of `exceedingly
persuasive' evidence . . . that some students, both male and female,
benefit from attending a single-sex college" and "[that] [f]or those
students, the opportunity to attend a single-sex college is a valuable
one, likely to lead to better academic and professional achievement."
766 F. Supp., at 1411-1412. Even the United States' expert witness
"called himself a `believer in single-sex education,'" although it was
his "personal, philosophical preference," not one "born of
educational-benefit considerations," "that single-sex education should
be provided only by the private sector."  Id., at 1412.

4. The Court contends that Virginia, and the District Court, erred,
and "misperceived our precedent," by "train[ing] their argument on
`means' rather than `end,'" ante, at 28. The Court focuses on
"VMI's mission," which is to produce individuals "imbued with love
of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership,
possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American
democracy and free enterprise system, and ready... to defend their
country in time of national peril." 766 F. Supp., at 1425 (quoting
Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of Visitors, Report,
May 16, 1986). "Surely," the Court says, "that goal is great enough
to accommodate women."  Ante, at 28.

This is law-making by indirection. What the Court describes as
"VMI's mission" is no less the mission of all Virginia colleges.
Which of them would the Old Dominion continue to fund if they did
not aim to create individuals "imbued with love of learning, etc."
right down to being ready "to defend their country in time of national
peril"? It can be summed up as "learning, leadership, and
patriotism."  To be sure, those general educational values are
described in a particularly martial fashion in VMI's mission
statement, in accordance with the military, adversative, and all-male
character of the institution. But imparting those values in that
fashion--i.e., in a military, adversative, all-male environment--is the
distinctive mission of VMI. And as I have discussed (and both
courts below found), that mission is not "great enough to
accommodate women."

The Court's analysis at least has the benefit of producing foreseeable
results. Applied generally, it means that whenever a State's ultimate
objective is "great enough to accommodate women" (as it always will
be), then the State will be held to have violated the Equal Protection
Clause if it restricts to men even one means by which it pursues that
objective--no matter how few women are interested in pursuing the
objective by that means, no matter how much the single-sex program
will have to be changed if both sexes are admitted, and no matter
how beneficial that program has theretofore been to its participants.

5. The Court argues that VMI would not have to change very much if
it were to admit women. See, e.g., ante, at 22-25. The principal
response to that argument is that it is irrelevant: If VMI's single-sex
status is substantially related to the government's important
educational objectives, as I have demonstrated above and as the
Court refuses to discuss, that concludes the inquiry. There should be
no debate in the federal judiciary over "how much" VMI would be
required to change if it admitted women and whether that would
constitute "too much" change.

But if such a debate were relevant, the Court would certainly be on
the losing side. The District Court found as follows: "[T]he evidence
establishes that key elements of the adversative VMI educational
system, with its focus on barracks life, would be fundamentally
altered, and the distinctive ends of the system would be thwarted, if
VMI were forced to admit females and to make changes necessary to
accommodate their needs and interests."  766 F. Supp., at 1411.
Changes that the District Court's detailed analysis found would be
required include new allowances for personal privacy in the barracks,
such as locked doors and coverings on windows, which would
detract from VMI's approach of regulating minute details of student
behavior, "contradict the principle that everyone is constantly subject
to scrutiny by everyone else," and impair VMI's "total egalitarian
approach" under which every student must be "treated alike";
changes in the physical training program, which would reduce "[t]he
intensity and aggressiveness of the current program"; and various
modifications in other respects of the adversative training program
which permeates student life. See id., at 1412-1413, 1435-1443.
As the Court of Appeals summarized it, "the record supports the
district court's findings that at least these three aspects of VMI's
program--physical training, the absence of privacy, and the
adversative approach--would be materially affected by coeducation,
leading to a substantial change in the egalitarian ethos that is a critical
aspect of VMI's training."  976 F. 2d, at 896-897.

In the face of these findings by two courts below, amply supported
by the evidence, and resulting in the conclusion that VMI would be
fundamentally altered if it admitted women, this Court simply
pronounces that "[t]he notion that admission of women would
downgrade VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with
it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved."  Ante, at 25
(footnote omitted). The point about "downgrad[ing] VMI's stature"
is a strawman; no one has made any such claim. The point about
"destroy[ing] the adversative system" is simply false; the District
Court not only stated that "[e]vidence supports this theory," but
specifically concluded that while "[w]ithout a doubt" VMI could
assimilate women, "it is equally without a doubt that VMI's present
methods of training and education would have to be changed" by a
"move away from its adversative new cadet system."  766 F. Supp.,
at 1413, and n. 8, 1441. And the point about "destroy[ing] the
school," depending upon what that ambiguous phrase is intended to
mean, is either false or else sets a standard much higher than VMI
had to meet. It sufficed to establish, as the District Court stated, that
VMI would be "significantly different" upon the admission of
women, 766 F. Supp., at 1412, and "would eventually find it
necessary to drop the adversative system altogether," id., at 1413.5

6. Finally, the absence of a precise "all-women's analogue" to VMI
is irrelevant. In Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.
718 (1982), we attached no constitutional significance to the absence
of an all-male nursing school. As Virginia notes, if a program
restricted to one sex is necessarily unconstitutional unless there is a
parallel program restricted to the other sex, "the opinion in Hogan
could have ended with its first footnote, which observed that
`Mississippi maintains no other single-sex public university or
college.'"  Brief for Cross-Petitioners in No. 94-2107, at 38 (quoting
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, supra, at 720, n. 1).


Although there is no precise female-only analogue to VMI, Virginia
has created during this litigation the Virginia Women's Institute for
Leadership (VWIL), a state-funded all-women's program run by
Mary Baldwin College. I have thus far said nothing about VWIL
because it is, under our established test, irrelevant, so long as VMI's
all-male character is "substantially related" to an important state goal.
But VWIL now exists, and the Court's treatment of it shows how
far-reaching today's decision is.


VWIL was carefully designed by professional educators who have
long experience in educating young women. The program rejects the
proposition that there is a "difference in the respective spheres and
destinies of man and woman," Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 141
(1872), and is designed to "provide an all-female program that will
achieve substantially similar outcomes [to VMI's] in an all-female
environment," 852 F. Supp. 471, 481 (WD Va. 1994). After
holding a trial where voluminous evidence was submitted and
making detailed findings of fact, the District Court concluded that
"there is a legitimate pedagogical basis for the different means
employed [by VMI and VWIL] to achieve the substantially similar
ends." Ibid. The Court of Appeals undertook a detailed review of the
record and affirmed. 44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995).6   But it is Mary
Baldwin College, which runs VWIL, that has made the point most
succinctly:

"It would have been possible to develop the VWIL program to more
closely resemble VMI, with adversative techniques associated with
the rat line and barracks-like living quarters. Simply replicating an
existing program would have required far less thought, research, and
educational expertise. But such a facile approach would have
produced a paper program with no real prospect of successful
implementation."  Brief for Mary Baldwin College as Amicus Curiae
5.

It is worth noting that none of the United States' own experts in the
remedial phase of this case was willing to testify that VMI's
adversative method was an appropriate methodology for educating
women. This Court, however, does not care. Even though VWIL
was carefully designed by professional educators who have
tremendous experience in the area, and survived the test of
adversarial litigation, the Court simply declares, with no basis in the
evidence, that these professionals acted on "`overbroad'
generalizations," ante, at 24, 33.


A few words are appropriate in response to the concurrence, which
finds VMI unconstitutional on a basis that is more moderate than the
Court's but only at the expense of being even more implausible. The
concurrence offers three reasons: First, that there is "scant evidence
in the record," ante, at 5, that diversity of educational offering was
the real reason for Virginia's maintaining VMI. "Scant" has the
advantage of being an imprecise term. I have cited the clearest
statements of diversity as a goal for higher education in the 1990
Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st
Century to the Governor and General Assembly, the 1989 Virginia
Plan for Higher Education, the Budget Initiatives prepared in 1989
by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the 1974
Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher Education,
and the 1969 Report of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional
Revision. See supra, at 14, 17-18, and n. 2, 19-20, n. 3. There is
no evidence to the contrary, once one rejects (as the concurrence
rightly does) the relevance of VMI's founding in days when attitudes
towards the education of women were different. Is this conceivably
not enough to foreclose rejecting as clearly erroneous the District
Court's determination regarding "the Commonwealth's objective of
educational diversity"? 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Especially since it is
absurd on its face even to demand "evidence" to prove that the
Commonwealth's reason for maintaining a men's military academy is
that a men's military academy provides a distinctive type of
educational experience (i.e., fosters diversity). What other purpose
would the Commonwealth have? One may argue, as the Court does,
that this type of diversity is designed only to indulge hostility
towards women--but that is a separate point, explicitly rejected by the
concurrence, and amply refuted by the evidence I have mentioned in
discussing the Court's opinion.7   What is now under discussion--
the concurrence's making central to the disposition of this case the
supposedly "scant" evidence that Virginia maintained VMI in order to
offer a diverse educational experience--is rather like making crucial to
the lawfulness of the United States Army record "evidence" that its
purpose is to do battle. A legal culture that has forgotten the concept
of res ipsa loquitur deserves the fate that it today decrees for VMI.

Second, the concurrence dismisses out of hand what it calls
Virginia's "second justification for the single-sex admissions policy:
maintenance of the adversative method." Ante, at 7. The concurrence
reasons that "this justification does not serve an important
governmental objective" because, whatever the record may show
about the pedagogical benefits of single-sex education, "there is no
similar evidence in the record that an adversative method is
pedagogically beneficial or is any more likely to produce character
traits than other methodologies."  Ante, at 7-8. That is simply
wrong. See, e.g., 766 F. Supp., at 1426 (factual findings
concerning character traits produced by VMI's adversative
methodology); id., at 1434 (factual findings concerning benefits for
many college-age men of an adversative approach in general). In
reality, the pedagogical benefits of VMI's adversative approach were
not only proved, but were a given in this litigation. The reason the
woman applicant who prompted this suit wanted to enter VMI was
assuredly not that she wanted to go to an all-male school; it would
cease being all-male as soon as she entered. She wanted the
distinctive adversative education that VMI provided, and the battle
was joined (in the main) over whether VMI had a basis for excluding
women from that approach. The Court's opinion recognizes this,
and devotes much of its opinion to demonstrating that "`some women
. . . do well under [the] adversative model'" and that "[i]t is on behalf
of these women that the United States has instituted this suit."  Ante,
at 33-34 (quoting 766 F. Supp., at 1434). Of course, in the last
analysis it does not matter whether there are any benefits to the
adversative method. The concurrence does not contest that there are
benefits to single-sex education, and that alone suffices to make
Virginia's case, since admission of a woman will even more surely
put an end to VMI's single-sex education than it will to VMI's
adversative methodology.

A third reason the concurrence offers in support of the judgment is
that the Commonwealth and VMI were not quick enough to react to
the "further developments" in this Court's evolving jurisprudence.
Ante, at 4. Specifically, the concurrence believes it should have been
clear after Hogan that "[t]he difficulty with [Virginia's] position is
that the diversity benefited only one sex; there was single-sex public
education available for men at VMI, but no corresponding single-sex
public education available for women."  Ante, at 6. If only, the
concurrence asserts, Virginia had "made a genuine effort to devote
comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed
through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal
protection violation."  Ante, at 7. That is to say, the concurrence
believes that after our decision in Hogan (which held a program of
the Mississippi University for Women to be unconstitutional--
without any reliance on the fact that there was no corresponding
Mississippi all-men's program), the Commonwealth should have
known that what this Court expected of it was . . . yes!, the creation
of a state all-women's program. Any lawyer who gave that advice to
the Commonwealth ought to have been either disbarred or
committed. (The proof of that pudding is today's 6-Justice majority
opinion.) And any Virginia politician who proposed such a step
when there were already 4 4-year women's colleges in Virginia
(assisted by state support that may well exceed, in the aggregate,
what VMI costs, see n. 3, supra) ought to have been recalled.

In any event, "diversity in the form of single-sex, as well as
coeducational, institutions of higher learning," is "available to
women as well as to men" in Virginia. Ante, at 7. The concurrence
is able to assert the contrary only by disregarding the four all-
women's private colleges in Virginia (generously assisted by public
funds) and the Commonwealth's longstanding policy of coordinating
public with private educational offerings, see supra, at 14-15, 17-18,
and n. 2, 19, and n. 3. According to the concurrence, the reason
Virginia's assistance to its four all-women's private colleges does not
count is that "[t]he private women's colleges are treated by the State
exactly as all other private schools are treated."  Ante, at 7. But if
Virginia cannot get credit for assisting women's education if it only
treats women's private schools as it does all other private schools,
then why should it get blame for assisting men's education if it only
treats VMI as it does all other public schools? This is a great
puzzlement.


As is frequently true, the Court's decision today will have
consequences that extend far beyond the parties to the case. What I
take to be the Court's unease with these consequences, and its
resulting unwillingness to acknowledge them, cannot alter the reality.


Under the constitutional principles announced and applied today,
single-sex public education is unconstitutional. By going through the
motions of applying a balancing test--asking whether the State has
adduced an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for its sex-based
classification--the Court creates the illusion that government officials
in some future case will have a clear shot at justifying some sort of
single-sex public education. Indeed, the Court seeks to create even a
greater illusion than that: It purports to have said nothing of relevance
to other public schools at all. "We address specifically and only an
educational opportunity recognized . . . as `unique' . . . ."  Ante, at
16, n. 7.

The Supreme Court of the United States does not sit to announce
"unique" dispositions. Its principal function is to establish
precedent--that is, to set forth principles of law that every court in
America must follow. As we said only this Term, we expect both
ourselves and lower courts to adhere to the "rationale upon which the
Court based the results of its earlier decisions."  Seminole Tribe of
Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. ___, ___ (1996) (slip op., at 21)
(emphasis added). That is the principal reason we publish our
opinions.

And the rationale of today's decision is sweeping: for sex-based
classifications, a redefinition of intermediate scrutiny that makes it
indistinguishable from strict scrutiny. See supra, at 6-9. Indeed, the
Court indicates that if any program restricted to one sex is
"uniqu[e]," it must be opened to members of the opposite sex "who
have the will and capacity" to participate in it. Ante, at 25. I suggest
that the single-sex program that will not be capable of being
characterized as "unique" is not only unique but nonexistent.8

In any event, regardless of whether the Court's rationale leaves some
small amount of room for lawyers to argue, it ensures that single-sex
public education is functionally dead. The costs of litigating the
constitutionality of a single-sex education program, and the risks of
ultimately losing that litigation, are simply too high to be embraced
by public officials. Any person with standing to challenge any sex-
based classification can haul the State into federal court and compel it
to establish by evidence (presumably in the form of expert testimony)
that there is an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for the
classification. Should the courts happen to interpret that vacuous
phrase as establishing a standard that is not utterly impossible of
achievement, there is considerable risk that whether the standard has
been met will not be determined on the basis of the record evidence--
indeed, that will necessarily be the approach of any court that seeks
to walk the path the Court has trod today. No state official in his
right mind will buy such a high-cost, high-risk lawsuit by
commencing a single-sex program. The enemies of single-sex
education have won; by persuading only seven Justices (five would
have been enough) that their view of the world is enshrined in the
Constitution, they have effectively imposed that view on all 50
States.

This is especially regrettable because, as the District Court here
determined, educational experts in recent years have increasingly
come to "suppor[t] [the] view that substantial educational benefits
flow from a single-gender environment, be it male or female, that
cannot be replicated in a coeducational setting."  766 F. Supp., at
1415 (emphasis added). "The evidence in th[is] case," for example,
"is virtually uncontradicted" to that effect. Ibid. Until quite recently,
some public officials have attempted to institute new single-sex
programs, at least as experiments. In 1991, for example, the Detroit
Board of Education announced a program to establish three boys-
only schools for inner-city youth; it was met with a lawsuit, a
preliminary injunction was swiftly entered by a District Court that
purported to rely on Hogan, see Garrett v. Board of Education of
School Dist. of Detroit, 775 F. Supp. 1004, 1006 (ED Mich. 1991),
and the Detroit Board of Education voted to abandon the litigation
and thus abandon the plan, see Detroit Plan to Aid Blacks with All-
Boy Schools Abandoned, Los Angeles Times, Nov. 8, 1991, p. A4,
col. 1. Today's opinion assures that no such experiment will be tried
again.


There are few extant single-sex public educational programs. The
potential of today's decision for widespread disruption of existing
institutions lies in its application to private single-sex education.
Government support is immensely important to private educational
institutions. Mary Baldwin College--which designed and runs
VWIL--notes that private institutions of higher education in the 1990-
1991 school year derived approximately 19 percent of their budgets
from federal, state, and local government funds, not including
financial aid to students. See Brief for Mary Baldwin College as
Amicus Curiae 22, n. 13 (citing U. S. Dept. of Education, National
Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics, p. 38
and Note (1993)). Charitable status under the tax laws is also highly
significant for private educational institutions, and it is certainly not
beyond the Court that rendered today's decision to hold that a
donation to a single-sex college should be deemed contrary to public
policy and therefore not deductible if the college discriminates on the
basis of sex. See Note, The Independent Sector and the Tax Laws:
Defining Charity in an Ideal Democracy, 64 S. Cal. L. Rev. 461,
476 (1991). See also Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S.
574 (1983).

The Court adverts to private single-sex education only briefly, and
only to make the assertion (mentioned above) that "[w]e address
specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized by the
District Court and the Court of Appeals as `unique.'"  Ante, at 16, n.
7. As I have already remarked, see supra, at 32-33, that assurance
assures nothing, unless it is to be taken as a promise that in the future
the Court will disclaim the reasoning it has used today to destroy
VMI. The Government, in its briefs to this Court, at least purports to
address the consequences of its attack on VMI for public support of
private single-sex education. It contends that private colleges which
are the direct or indirect beneficiaries of government funding are not
thereby necessarily converted into state actors to which the Equal
Protection Clause is then applicable. See Brief for United States in
No. 94-2107, at 35-37 (discussing Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.
S. 830 (1982), and Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991 (1982)). That
is true. It is also virtually meaningless.

The issue will be not whether government assistance turns private
colleges into state actors, but whether the government itself would be
violating the Constitution by providing state support to single-sex
colleges. For example, in Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455
(1973), we saw no room to distinguish between state operation of
racially segregated schools and state support of privately run
segregated schools. "Racial discrimination in state-operated schools
is barred by the Constitution and `[i]t is also axiomatic that a state
may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish
what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.'"  Id., at 465
(quoting Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Ed., 267 F. Supp. 458, 475-
476 (MD Ala. 1967)); see also Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 19
(1958) ("State support of segregated schools through any
arrangement, management, funds, or property cannot be squared
with the [Fourteenth] Amendment's command that no State shall
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws"); Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 565 (1984) (case
arising under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and
stating that "[t]he economic effect of direct and indirect assistance
often is indistinguishable"). When the Government was pressed at
oral argument concerning the implications of these cases for private
single-sex education if government-provided single-sex education is
unconstitutional, it stated that the implications will not be so
disastrous, since States can provide funding to racially segregated
private schools, "depend[ing] on the circumstances," Tr. of Oral
Arg. 56. I cannot imagine what those "circumstances" might be, and
it would be as foolish for private-school administrators to think that
that assurance from the Justice Department will outlive the day it was
made, as it was for VMI to think that the Justice Department's
"unequivoca[l]" support for an intermediate-scrutiny standard in this
case would survive the Government's loss in the courts below.

The only hope for state-assisted single-sex private schools is that the
Court will not apply in the future the principles of law it has applied
today. That is a substantial hope, I am happy and ashamed to say.
After all, did not the Court today abandon the principles of law it has
applied in our earlier sex-classification cases? And does not the Court
positively invite private colleges to rely upon our ad-hocery by
assuring them this case is "unique"? I would not advise the
foundation of any new single-sex college (especially an all-male one)
with the expectation of being allowed to receive any government
support; but it is too soon to abandon in despair those single-sex
colleges already in existence. It will certainly be possible for this
Court to write a future opinion that ignores the broad principles of
law set forth today, and that characterizes as utterly dispositive the
opinion's perceptions that VMI was a uniquely prestigious all-male
institution, conceived in chauvinism, etc., etc. I will not join that
opinion.

Justice Brandeis said it is "one of the happy incidents of the federal
system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose,
serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments
without risk to the rest of the country."  New State Ice Co. v.
Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (dissenting opinion). But it is
one of the unhappy incidents of the federal system that a self-
righteous Supreme Court, acting on its Members' personal view of
what would make a "more perfect Union," ante, at 41 (a criterion
only slightly more restrictive than a "more perfect world"), can
impose its own favored social and economic dispositions nationwide.
As today's disposition, and others this single Term, show, this
places it beyond the power of a "single courageous State," not only
to introduce novel dispositions that the Court frowns upon, but to
reintroduce, or indeed even adhere to, disfavored dispositions that
are centuries old. See, e.g., BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,
517 U. S. ___ (1996); Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. ___ (1996). The
sphere of self-government reserved to the people of the Republic is
progressively narrowed.

In the course of this dissent, I have referred approvingly to the
opinion of my former colleague, Justice Powell, in Mississippi Univ.
for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982). Many of the points
made in his dissent apply with equal force here--in particular, the
criticism of judicial opinions that purport to be "narro[w]" but whose
"logic" is "sweepin[g]."  Id., at 745-746, n. 18. But there is one
statement with which I cannot agree. Justice Powell observed that
the Court's decision in Hogan, which struck down a single-sex
program offered by the Mississippi University for Women, had
thereby "[l]eft without honor... an element of diversity that has
characterized much of American education and enriched much of
American life." Id., at 735. Today's decision does not leave VMI
without honor; no court opinion can do that.

In an odd sort of way, it is precisely VMI's attachment to such old-
fashioned concepts as manly "honor" that has made it, and the
system it represents, the target of those who today succeed in
abolishing public single-sex education. The record contains a
booklet that all first-year VMI students (the so-called "rats") were
required to keep in their possession at all times. Near the end there
appears the following period-piece, entitled "The Code of a
Gentleman":

"Without a strict observance of the fundamental Code of Honor, no
man, no matter how `polished,' can be considered a gentleman. The
honor of a gentleman demands the inviolability of his word, and the
incorruptibility of his principles. He is the descendant of the knight,
the crusader; he is the defender of the defenseless and the champion
of justice . . . or he is not a Gentleman.

A Gentleman . . .

Does not discuss his family affairs in public or with acquaintances.

Does not speak more than casually about his girl friend.

Does not go to a lady's house if he is affected by alcohol. He is
temperate in the use of alcohol.

Does not lose his temper; nor exhibit anger, fear, hate,
embarrassment, ardor or hilarity in public.

Does not hail a lady from a club window.

A gentleman never discusses the merits or demerits of a lady.

Does not mention names exactly as he avoids the mention of what
things cost.

Does not borrow money from a friend, except in dire need. Money
borrowed is a debt of honor, and must be repaid as promptly as
possible. Debts incurred by a deceased parent, brother, sister or
grown child are assumed by honorable men as a debt of honor.

Does not display his wealth, money or possessions.

Does not put his manners on and off, whether in the club or in a
ballroom. He treats people with courtesy, no matter what their social
position may be.

Does not slap strangers on the back nor so much as lay a finger on a
lady.

Does not `lick the boots of those above' nor `kick the face of those
below him on the social ladder.'

Does not take advantage of another's helplessness or ignorance and
assumes that no gentleman will take advantage of him.

A Gentleman respects the reserves of others, but demands that others
respect those which are his.

A Gentleman can become what he wills to be. . ."

I do not know whether the men of VMI lived by this Code; perhaps
not. But it is powerfully impressive that a public institution of higher
education still in existence sought to have them do so. I do not think
any of us, women included, will be better off for its destruction.


ENDNOTES FOR OPINION

1 During the Civil War, school teaching became a field dominated by
women. See A. Scott, The Southern Lady: From Pedestal to
Politics, 1830-1930, p. 82 (1970).

2 Historically, most of Virginia's public colleges and universities
were single-sex; by the mid-1970's, however, all except VMI had
become coeducational. 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1418-1419 (WD Va.
1991). For example, Virginia's legislature incorporated Farmville
Female Seminary Association in 1839, the year VMI opened. 1839
Va. Acts, ch. 167. Originally providing instruction in "English,
Latin, Greek, French, and piano" in a "home atmosphere," R.
Sprague, Longwood College: A History 7-8, 15 (1989) (Longwood
College), Farmville Female Seminary became a public institution in
1884 with a mission to train "white female teachers for public
schools," 1884 Va. Acts, ch. 311. The school became Longwood
College in 1949, Longwood College 136, and introduced
coeducation in 1976, id., at 133.

3 The District Court allowed the VMI Foundation and the VMI
Alumni Association to intervene as defendants. 766 F. Supp., at
1408.

4 Six judges voted to rehear the case en banc, four voted against
rehearing, and three were recused. The Fourth Circuit's local rule
permits rehearing en banc only on the vote of a majority of the
Circuit's judges in regular active service (currently 13) without
regard to recusals. See 52 F. 3d, at 91, and n. 1.

5 As Thomas Jefferson stated the view prevailing when the
Constitution was new:

"Were our State a pure democracy . . . there would yet be excluded
from their deliberations . . . women, who, to prevent depravation of
morals and ambiguity of issue, should not mix promiscuously in the
public meetings of men."  Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel
Kercheval (Sept. 5, 1816), in 10 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 45-
46, n. 1 (P. Ford ed. 1899).

6 The Court has thus far reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for
classifications based on race or national origin, but last Term
observed that strict scrutiny of such classifications is not inevitably
"fatal in fact."  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U. S. __,
__ (1995) (slip op., at 35) (internal quotation marks omitted).

7 Several amici have urged that diversity in educational opportunities
is an altogether appropriate governmental pursuit and that single-sex
schools can contribute importantly to such diversity. Indeed, it is the
mission of some single-sex schools "to dissipate, rather than
perpetuate, traditional gender classifications."  See Brief for Twenty-
Six Private Women's Colleges as Amici Curiae 5. We do not
question the State's prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse
educational opportunities. We address specifically and only an
educational opportunity recognized by the District Court and the
Court of Appeals as "unique," see 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1432; 976
F. 2d, at 892, an opportunity available only at Virginia's premier
military institute, the State's sole single-sex public university or
college. Cf. Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.
718, 720, n. 1 (1982) ("Mississippi maintains no other single-sex
public university or college. Thus, we are not faced with the
question of whether States can provide `separate but equal'
undergraduate institutions for males and females.").

8 On this point, the dissent sees fire where there is no flame. See
post, at 33-34, 35-37. "Both men and women can benefit from a
single-sex education," the District Court recognized, although "the
beneficial effects" of such education, the court added, apparently "are
stronger among women than among men."  766 F. Supp., at 1414.
The United States does not challenge that recognition. Cf. C. Jencks
& D. Riesman, The Academic Revolution 297-298 (1968):

"The pluralistic argument for preserving all-male colleges is
uncomfortably similar to the pluralistic argument for preserving all-
white colleges . . . . The all-male college would be relatively easy to
defend if it emerged from a world in which women were established
as fully equal to men. But it does not. It is therefore likely to be a
witting or unwitting device for preserving tacit assumptions of male
superiority--assumptions for which women must eventually pay."

9 Dr. Edward H. Clarke of Harvard Medical School, whose
influential book, Sex in Education, went through 17 editions, was
perhaps the most well-known speaker from the medical community
opposing higher education for women. He maintained that the
physiological effects of hard study and academic competition with
boys would interfere with the development of girls' reproductive
organs. See E. Clarke, Sex in Education 38-39, 62-63 (1873); id.,
at 127 ("identical education of the two sexes is a crime before God
and humanity, that physiology protests against, and that experience
weeps over"); see also H. Maudsley, Sex in Mind and in Education
17 (1874) ("It is not that girls have not ambition, nor that they fail
generally to run the intellectual race [in coeducational settings], but it
is asserted that they do it at a cost to their strength and health which
entails life-long suffering, and even incapacitates them for the
adequate performance of the natural functions of their sex."); C.
Meigs, Females and Their Diseases 350 (1848) (after five or six
weeks of "mental and educational discipline," a healthy woman
would "lose . . . the habit of menstruation" and suffer numerous ills
as a result of depriving her body for the sake of her mind).

10 Virginia's Superintendent of Public Instruction dismissed the
coeducational idea as "`repugnant to the prejudices of the people'"
and proposed a female college similar in quality to Girton, Smith, or
Vassar. 2 History of Women's Education 254 (quoting 1 Report of
the Commissioner of Education, H. R. Doc. No. 5, 58th Cong., 2d
Sess., 438 (1904)).

11 See post, at 1, 35, 40. Forecasts of the same kind were made
regarding admission of women to the federal military academies.
See, e.g., Hearings on H. R. 9832 et al. before Subcommittee No. 2
on Military Personnel of the House Committee on Armed Services,
93d Cong., 2d Sess., 137 (1975) (statement of Lt. Gen. A. P.
Clark, Superintendent of U. S. Air Force Academy) ("It is my
considered judgment that the introduction of female cadets will
inevitably erode this vital atmosphere."); id., at 165 (statement of
Hon. H. H. Callaway, Secretary of the Army) ("Admitting women to
West Point would irrevocably change the Academy.... The Spartan
atmosphere--which is so important to producing the final product--
would surely be diluted, and would in all probability disappear.").

12 See 766 F. Supp., at 1413 (describing testimony of expert
witness David Riesman: "[I]f VMI were to admit women, it would
eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether,
and adopt a system that provides more nurturing and support for the
students."). Such judgments have attended, and impeded, women's
progress toward full citizenship stature throughout our Nation's
history. Speaking in 1879 in support of higher education for
females, for example, Virginia State Senator C. T. Smith of Nelson
recounted that legislation proposed to protect the property rights of
women had encountered resistance. 10 Educ. J. Va. 213 (1879). A
Senator opposing the measures objected that "there [was] no formal
call for the [legislation]," and "depicted in burning eloquence the
terrible consequences such laws would produce."  Ibid. The
legislation passed, and a year or so later, its sponsor, C. T. Smith,
reported that "not one of [the forecast "terrible consequences"] has or
ever will happen, even unto the sounding of Gabriel's trumpet."
Ibid. See also supra, at 20.

13 Women cadets have graduated at the top of their class at every
federal military academy. See Brief for Lieutenant Colonel Rhonda
Cornum et al. as Amici Curiae 11, n. 25; cf. Defense Advisory
Committee on Women in the Services, Report on the Integration and
Performance of Women at West Point 64 (1992).

New Era for the Old Guard, Washington Post, Mar. 23, 1996, p.
C1, col. 2 (reporting admission of Sergeant Heather Johnsen to elite
Infantry unit that keeps round-the-clock vigil at Tomb of the
Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery).

15 Inclusion of women in settings where, traditionally, they were not
wanted inevitably entails a period of adjustment. As one West Point
cadet squad leader recounted: "[T]he classes of '78 and '79 see the
women as women, but the classes of '80 and '81 see them as
classmates."  U. S. Military Academy, A. Vitters, Report of
Admission of Women (Project Athena II) 84 (1978) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

16 VMI has successfully managed another notable change. The
school admitted its first African-American cadets in 1968. See The
VMI Story 347-349 (students no longer sing "Dixie," salute the
Confederate flag or the tomb of General Robert E. Lee at ceremonies
and sports events). As the District Court noted, VMI established a
Program on "retention of black cadets" designed to offer academic
and social-cultural support to "minority members of a dominantly
white and tradition-oriented student body."  766 F. Supp., at 1436-
1437. The school maintains a "special recruitment program for
blacks" which, the District Court found, "has had little, if any, effect
on VMI's method of accomplishing its mission."  Id., at 1437.

17 As earlier observed, see supra, at 11-12, Judge Phillips, in
dissent, measured Virginia's plan against a paradigm arrangement,
one that "could survive equal protection scrutiny": single-sex schools
with "substantially comparable curricular and extra-curricular
programs, funding, physical plant, administration and support
services, . . . faculty[,] and library resources." 44 F. 3d, at 1250.
Cf. Bray v. Lee, 337 F. Supp. 934 (D. Mass. 1972) (holding
inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause admission of males to
Boston's Boys Latin School with a test score of 120 or higher (up to
a top score of 200) while requiring a score, on the same test, of at
least 133 for admission of females to Girls Latin School, but not
ordering coeducation). Measuring VMI/VWIL against the paradigm,
Judge Phillips said, "reveals how far short the [Virginia] plan falls
from providing substantially equal tangible and intangible educational
benefits to men and women."  44 F. 3d, at 1250.

18 Both programs include an honor system. Students at VMI are
expelled forthwith for honor code violations, see 766 F. Supp., at
1423; the system for VWIL students, see 852 F. Supp., at 496-497,
is less severe, see Tr. 414-415 (testimony of Mary Baldwin College
President Cynthia Tyson).

19 Admitting women to VMI would undoubtedly require alterations
necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex
in living arrangements, and to adjust aspects of the physical training
programs. See Brief for Petitioner 27-29; cf. note following 10 U.
S. C. Section 4342 (academic and other standards for women
admitted to the Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies "shall be
the same as those required for male individuals, except for those
minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of
physiological differences between male and female individuals").
Experience shows such adjustments are manageable. See U. S.
Military Academy, A. Vitters, N. Kinzer, & J. Adams, Report of
Admission of Women (Project Athena I-IV) (1977-1980) (4-year
longitudinal study of the admission of women to West Point);
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, Report on
the Integration and Performance of Women at West Point 17-18
(1992).

20 Virginia's prime concern, it appears, is that "plac[ing] men and
women into the adversative relationship inherent in the VMI program
. . . would destroy, at least for that period of the adversative training,
any sense of decency that still permeates the relationship between the
sexes."  44 F. 3d, at 1239; see supra, at 22-27. It is an ancient and
familiar fear. Compare In re Lavinia Goodell, 39 Wis. 232, 246
(1875) (denying female applicant's motion for admission to the bar
of its court, Wisconsin Supreme Court explained: "Discussions are
habitually necessary in courts of justice, which are unfit for female
ears. The habitual presence of women at these would tend to relax
the public sense of decency and propriety."), with Levine, Closing
Comments, 6 Law & Inequality 41, 41 (1988) (presentation at Eighth
Circuit Judicial Conference, Colorado Springs, Colorado, July 17,
1987) (footnotes omitted):

"Plato questioned whether women should be afforded equal
opportunity to become guardians, those elite Rulers of Platonic
society. Ironically, in that most undemocratic system of government,
the Republic, women's native ability to serve as guardians was not
seriously questioned. The concern was over the wrestling and
exercise class in which all candidates for guardianship had to
participate, for rigorous physical and mental training were
prerequisites to attain the exalted status of guardian. And in accord
with Greek custom, those exercise classes were conducted in the
nude. Plato concluded that their virtue would clothe the women's
nakedness and that Platonic society would not thereby be deprived of
the talent of qualified citizens for reasons of mere gender."

For Plato's full text on the equality of women, see 2 The Dialogues
of Plato 302-312 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953). Virginia, not
bound to ancient Greek custom in its "rigorous physical and mental
training" programs, could more readily make the accommodations
necessary to draw on "the talent of [all] qualified citizens."  Cf.
supra, at 34, n. 19.

21 R. Morris, The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789, p. 193 (1987);
see id., at 191, setting out letter to a friend from Massachusetts
patriot (later second President) John Adams, on the subject of
qualifications for voting in his home state:

"[I]t is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and
altercation as would be opened by attempting to alter the
qualifications of voters; there will be no end of it. New claims will
arise; women will demand a vote; lads from twelve to twenty-one
will think their rights not enough attended to; and every man who has
not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other, in all acts
of state. It tends to confound and destroy all distinctions, and
prostrate all ranks to one common level." Letter from John Adams to
James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 9 Works of John Adams 378 (C.
Adams ed. 1854).


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.


1 Accord, ante, at 23 ("In sum . . . , neither the goal of producing
citizen-soldiers, VMI's raison d'tre, nor VMI's implementing
methodology is inherently unsuitable to women") (internal quotation
marks omitted; emphasis added); ante, at 25 ("the question is whether
the State can constitutionally deny to women who have the will and
capacity, the training and attendant opportunities that VMI uniquely
affords"); ante, at 31 (the "violation" is that "equal protection [has
been] denied to women ready, willing, and able to benefit from
educational opportunities of the kind VMI offers"); ante, at 33 ("As
earlier stated, see supra, at 24, generalizations about `the way women
are,' estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer
justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity
place them outside the average description").

2 This statement is supported by other evidence in the record
demonstrating, by reference to both public and private institutions,
that Virginia actively seeks to foster its "rich heritage of pluralism and
diversity in higher education," 1969 Report of the Virginia
Commission on Constitutional Revision, quoted in relevant part at
Lodged Materials 53; that Virginia views "[o]ne special characteristic
of the Virginia system [as being] its diversity," 1989 Virginia Plan
for Higher Education, quoted in relevant part at Lodged Materials 64;
and that in the Commonwealth's view "[h]igher education resources
should be viewed as a whole--public and private" because "Virginia
needs the diversity inherent in a dual system of higher education,"
1974 Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher
Education to the General Assembly of Virginia, quoted in 766 F.
Supp., at 1420. See also Budget Initiatives for 1990-1992 of the
State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, p. 10 (June 21,
1989) (Budget Initiatives), quoted at infra, n. 3. It should be noted
(for this point will be crucial to our later discussion) that these official
reports quoted here, in text and footnote, regard the
Commonwealth's educational system--public and private--as a
unitary one.

3 The Commonwealth provides tuition assistance, scholarship
grants, guaranteed loans, and work-study funds for residents of
Virginia who attend private colleges in the Commonwealth. See,
e.g., Va. Code Ann. Sections 23-38.11 to 23-38.19 (1993 and
Supp. 1995) (Tuition Assistance Grant Act); Sections 23-38.30 to
23-38.44:3 (Virginia Student Assistance Authorities); Sections 23-
38.45 to 23-38.53 (1993) (College Scholarship Assistance Act);
Sections 23-38.53:1 to 23-38.53:3 (Virginia Scholars Program);
Sections 23-38.70, 23-38.71 (Virginia Work-Study Program).
These programs involve substantial expenditures: for example,
Virginia appropriated $4,413,750 (not counting federal funds it also
earmarked) for the College Scholarship Assistance Program for both
1996 and 1997, and for the Tuition Assistance Grant Program
appropriated $21,568,000 for 1996 and $25,842,000 for 1997. See
1996 Va. Appropriations Act, ch. 912, pt. 1, Section 160.

In addition, as the parties stipulated in the District Court, the
Commonwealth provides other financial support and assistance to
private institutions--including single-sex colleges--through low-cost
building loans, state-funded services contracts, and other programs.
See, e.g., Va. Code Ann. Sections 23-30.39 to 23.30.58
(Educational Facilities Authority Act). The State Council of Higher
Education for Virginia, in a 1989 document not created for purposes
of this litigation but introduced into evidence, has described these
various programs as a "means by which the Commonwealth can
provide funding to its independent institutions, thereby helping to
maintain a diverse system of higher education."  Budget Initiatives,
p. 10.

4 The Court, unfamiliar with the Commonwealth's policy of diverse
and independent institutions, and in any event careless of state and
local traditions, must be forgiven by Virginians for quoting a
reference to "the Charlottesville campus" of the University of
Virginia. See ante, at 20. The University of Virginia, an institution
even older than VMI, though not as old as another of the
Commonwealth's universities, the College of William and Mary,
occupies the portion of Charlottesville known, not as the "campus,"
but as "the grounds."  More importantly, even if it were a "campus,"
there would be no need to specify "the Charlottesville campus," as
one might refer to the Bloomington or Indianapolis campus of
Indiana University. Unlike university systems with which the Court
is perhaps more familiar, such as those in New York (e.g., the State
University of New York at Binghamton or Buffalo), Illinois
(University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign or at Chicago), and
California (University of California, Los Angeles or University of
California, Berkeley), there is only one University of Virginia. It
happens (because Thomas Jefferson lived near there) to be located at
Charlottesville. To many Virginians it is known, simply, as "the
University," which suffices to distinguish it from the
Commonwealth's other institutions offering four-year college
instruction, which include Christopher Newport College, Clinch
Valley College, the College of William and Mary, George Mason
University, James Madison University, Longwood College, Mary
Washington University, Norfolk State University, Old Dominion
University, Radford University, Virginia Commonwealth
University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
Virginia State University--and, of course, the Virginia Military
Institute.

5 The Court's do-it-yourself approach to factfinding, which
throughout is contrary to our well-settled rule that we will not
"undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below
in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error,"
Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271,
275 (1949) (and cases cited), is exemplified by its invocation of the
experience of the federal military academies to prove that not much
change would occur. See ante, at 25, n. 11; 27-28, and n. 15; 34, n.
19. In fact, the District Court noted that "the West Point experience"
supported the theory that a coeducational VMI would have to "adopt
a [different] system," for West Point found it necessary upon
becoming coeducational to "move away" from its adversative system.
766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1440. "Without a doubt . . . VMI's present
methods of training and education would have to be changed as West
Point's were."  Id., at 1413, n. 8; accord, 976 F. 2d, at 896-897
(upholding District Court's findings that "the unique characteristics
of VMI's program," including its "unique methodology," "would be
destroyed by coeducation").

6 The Court is incorrect in suggesting that the Court of Appeals
applied a "deferential" "brand of review inconsistent with the more
exacting standard our precedent requires."  Ante, at 38. That court
"inquir[ed] (1) whether the state's objective is `legitimate and
important,' and (2) whether `the requisite direct, substantial
relationship between objective and means is present,'" 44 F. 3d, at
1235 (quoting Hogan, 458 U. S., at 1235). To be sure, such review
is "deferential" to a degree that the Court's new standard is not, for it
is intermediate scrutiny. (The Court cannot evade this point or prove
the Court of Appeals too deferential by stating that that court "devised
another test, a `substantive comparability' inquiry,'" ante, at 38
(quoting 44 F. 3d, at 1237), for as that court explained, its
"substantive comparability" inquiry was an "additional step" that it
engrafted on "th[e] traditional test" of intermediate scrutiny, 44 F.
3d, at 1237 (emphasis added).)

7 The concurrence states that it "read[s] the Court" not "as saying that
the diversity rationale is a pretext" for discriminating against women,
but as saying merely that the diversity rationale is not genuine. Ante,
at 5, n. *. The Court itself makes no such disclaimer, which would
be difficult to credit inasmuch as the foundation for its conclusion
that the diversity rationale is not "genuin[e]," ante, at 22, is its
antecedent discussion of Virginia's "deliberate" actions over the past
century and a half, based on "[f]amiliar arguments," that sought to
enforce once "widely held views about women's proper place," ante,
at 17-22.

8 In this regard, I note that the Court--which I concede is under no
obligation to do so--provides no example of a program that would
pass muster under its reasoning today: not even, for example, a
football or wrestling program. On the Court's theory, any woman
ready, willing, and physically able to participate in such a program
would, as a constitutional matter, be entitled to do so.

COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE ET AL.

v.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-489.  Argued April 15, 1996-Decided June 26, 1996

Before the Colorado Republican Party selected its 1986 senatorial
candidate, its Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado Party), the
petitioner here, bought radio advertisements attacking the Democratic
Party's likely candidate. The Federal Election Commission (FEC)
brought suit charging that the Colorado Party had violated the "Party
Expenditure Provision" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 (FECA), 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(d)(3), which imposes dollar
limits upon political party "expenditure[s] in connection with the
general election campaign of a [congressional] candidate."  The
Colorado Party defended in part by claiming that the expenditure
limitations violated the First Amendment as applied to its
advertisements, and filed a counterclaim seeking to raise a facial
challenge to the Provision as a whole. The District Court interpreted
the ``in connection with'' language narrowly and held that the
Provision did not cover the expenditure at issue. It therefore entered
summary judgment for the Colorado Party, dismissing the
counterclaim as moot. In ordering judgment for the FEC, the Court
of Appeals adopted a somewhat broader interpretation of the
Provision, which, it said, both covered this expenditure and satisfied
the Constitution.

Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. 59 F. 3d
1015, vacated and remanded.

JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR and
JUSTICE SOUTER, concluded that the First Amendment prohibits
application of the Party Expenditure Provision to the kind of
expenditure at issue here--an expenditure that the political party has
made independently, without coordination with any candidate. Pp.
6-17.


(a) The outcome is controlled by this Court's FECA case law. After
weighing the First Amendment interest in permitting candidates (and
their supporters) to spend money to advance their political views,
against a "compelling" governmental interest in protecting the
electoral system from the appearance and reality of corruption, see,
e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14-23 (per curiam), the Court
has ruled unconstitutional FECA provisions that, inter alia, limited
the right of individuals, id., at 39-51, and political committees,
Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action
Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 497, to make "independent" expenditures
not coordinated with a candidate or a candidate's campaign, but has
permitted other FECA provisions that imposed contribution limits
both when an individual or political committee contributed money
directly to a candidate, and when they contributed indirectly by
making expenditures that they coordinated with the candidate, see
Buckley, supra, at 23-36, 46-48. The summary judgment record
indicates that the expenditure here at issue must be treated, for
constitutional purposes, as an "independent" expenditure entitled to
First Amendment protection, not as an indirect campaign contribution
subject to regulation. There is uncontroverted direct evidence that the
Colorado Party developed its advertising campaign independently
and not pursuant to any understanding with a candidate. Since the
Government does not point to evidence or legislative findings
suggesting any special corruption problem in respect to political
parties' independent expenditures, the Court's prior cases forbid
regulation of such expenditures.

Pp. 6-12.

(b) The Government's argument that this expenditure is not
"independent," but is rather a "coordinated expenditure" which this
Court has treated as a "contribution" that Congress may
constitutionally regulate, is rejected. The summary judgment record
shows no actual coordination with candidates as a matter of fact. The
Government's claim for deference to FEC interpretations rendering
all party expenditures "coordinated" is unpersuasive. Federal
Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454
U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1, distinguished. These regulations and
advisory opinions do not represent an empirical judgment by the FEC
that all party expenditures are coordinated with candidates or that
party independent and coordinated expenditures cannot be
distinguished in practice. Also unconvincing are the Government's
contentions that the Colorado Party has conceded that the expenditure
here is "coordinated," and that such coordination exists because a
party and its candidate are, in some sense, identical. Pp. 12-17.

(c) Because this expenditure is "independent," the Court need not
reach the broader question argued by the Colorado Party: whether, in
the special case of political parties, the First Amendment also forbids
congressional efforts to limit coordinated expenditures.  While the
Court is not deprived of jurisdiction to consider this facial challenge
by the failure of the parties and the lower courts to focus specifically
on the complex issues involved in determining the constitutionality of
political parties' coordinated expenditures, that lack of focus provides
a prudential reason for the Court not to decide the broader question.
This is the first case to raise the question, and the Court should defer
action until the lower courts have considered it in light of this
decision. Pp. 17-20.

JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that, on its face, FECA violates the
First Amendment when it restricts as a "contribution" a political
party's spending "in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with . . .
a candidate."  2 U. S. C. Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). The Court in
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam), had no occasion to
consider limitations on political parties' expenditures, id., at 58, n.
66, and its reasoning upholding ordinary contribution limitations
should not be extended to a case that does. Buckley's central holding
is that spending money on one's own speech must be permitted, id.,
at 44-58, and that is what political parties do when they make the
expenditures that Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i) restricts as
"contribution[s]." Party spending "in cooperation, consultation, or
concert with" a candidate is indistinguishable in substance from
expenditures by the candidate or his campaign committee. The First
Amendment does not permit regulation of the latter, see id., at 54-59,
and it should not permit this regulation of the former. Pp. 1-5.

JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Parts I and III that 2 U. S. C.
Section 441a(d)(3) is unconstitutional not only as applied to
petitioners, but also on its face. Pp. 1-5, 16-19.

(a) The Court should decide the Party's facial challenge to Section
441a(d)(3), addressing the constitutionality of limits on coordinated
expenditures by political parties. That question is squarely before the
Court, and the principal opinion's reasons for not reaching it are
unpersuasive. In addition, concerns for the chilling of First
Amendment expression counsel in favor of resolving the question.
Reaching the facial challenge will make clear the circumstances under
which political parties may engage in political speech without running
afoul of Section 441a(d)(3). Pp. 1-5.

(b) Section 441a(d)(3) cannot withstand a facial challenge under the
framework established by Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per
curiam). The anticorruption rationale that the Court has relied on is
inapplicable in the specific context of campaign funding by political
parties, since there is only a minimal threat of corruption when a
party spends to support its candidate or to oppose his competitor,
whether or not that expenditure is made in concert with the candidate.
Parties and candidates have traditionally worked together to achieve
their common goals, and when they engage in that work, there is no
risk to the Republic. To the contrary, the danger to lies in
Government suppression of such activity. Pp. 16-19.

JUSTICE THOMAS also concluded in Part II that, in resolving the
facial challenge, the Buckley framework should be rejected because
there is no constitutionally significant difference between campaign
contributions and expenditures: both involve core expression and
basic associational rights that are central to the First Amendment.
Curbs on such speech must be strictly scrutinized. See, e.g., Federal
Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,
470 U. S. 480, 501. Section 441a(d)(3)'s limits on independent and
coordinated expenditures fail strict scrutiny because the statute is not
narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interest in
preventing the fact or appearance of ``corruption,'' which this Court
has narrowly defined as a ``financial quid pro quo: dollars for
political favors,'' id., at 497. Contrary to the Court's ruling in
Buckley, supra, at 28, bribery laws and disclosure requirements
present less restrictive means of preventing corruption than does
Section 441a(d)(3), which indiscriminately covers many conceivable
instances in which a party committee could exceed spending limits
without any intent to extract an unlawful commitment from a
candidate. Pp. 11-15.

opinion, in which O'CONNOR and SOUTER, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-489


COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE AND DOUGLAS JONES, TREASURER,
PETITIONERS

v.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE BREYER announced the judgment of the Court and
delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE O'CONNOR and
JUSTICE SOUTER join.

In April 1986, before the Colorado Republican Party had selected its
senatorial candidate for the fall's election, that Party's Federal
Campaign Committee bought radio advertisements attacking Timothy
Wirth, the Democratic Party's likely candidate. The Federal Election
Commission (FEC) charged that this "expenditure" exceeded the
dollar limits that a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 (FECA) imposes upon political party "expenditure[s] in
connection with" a "general election campaign" for congressional
office. 90 Stat. 486, as amended, 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(d)(3).
This case focuses upon the constitutionality of those limits as applied
to this case. We conclude that the First Amendment prohibits the
application of this provision to the kind of expenditure at issue here--
an expenditure that the political party has made independently,
without coordination with any candidate.


To understand the issues and our holding, one must begin with
FECA as it emerged from Congress in 1974. That Act sought both
to remedy the appearance of a "corrupt" political process (one in
which large contributions seem to buy legislative votes) and to level
the electoral playing field by reducing campaign costs. See Buckley
v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 25-27 (1976) (per curiam). It consequently
imposed limits upon the amounts that individuals, corporations,
"political committees" (such as political action committees, or
PAC's), and political parties could contribute to candidates for
federal office, and it also imposed limits upon the amounts that
candidates, corporations, labor unions, political committees, and
political parties could spend, even on their own, to help a candidate
win election. See 18 U. S. C. Sections 608, 610 (1970 ed., Supp.
IV).

This Court subsequently examined several of the Act's provisions in
light of the First Amendment's free speech and association
protections. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens
for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986); Federal Election Comm'n v.
National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480
(1985) (NCPAC); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election
Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182 (1981); Buckley, supra. In these cases, the
Court essentially weighed the First Amendment interest in permitting
candidates (and their supporters) to spend money to advance their
political views, against a "compelling" governmental interest in
assuring the electoral system's legitimacy, protecting it from the
appearance and reality of corruption. See Massachusetts Citizens for
Life, supra, at 256-263; NCPAC, supra, at 493-501; California
Medical Assn., supra, at 193-199; Buckley, supra, at 14-23. After
doing so, the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited some
of FECA's provisions, but permitted others.

Most of the provisions this Court found unconstitutional imposed
expenditure limits. Those provisions limited candidates' rights to
spend their own money, Buckley, supra, at 51-54, limited a
candidate's campaign expenditures, 424 U. S., at 54-58, limited the
right of individuals to make "independent" expenditures (not
coordinated with the candidate or candidate's campaign), id., at 39-
51, and similarly limited the right of political committees to make
"independent" expenditures, NCPAC, supra, at 497. The provisions
that the Court found constitutional mostly imposed contribution
limits--limits that apply both when an individual or political
committee contributes money directly to a candidate and also when
they indirectly contribute by making expenditures that they coordinate
with the candidate, Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). See Buckley, supra, at
23-36. See also 424 U. S., at 46-48; California Medical Assn.,
supra, at 193-199 (limits on contributions to political committees).
Consequently, for present purposes, the Act now prohibits
individuals and political committees from making direct, or indirect,
contributions that exceed the following limits:

(a) For any "person": $1,000 to a candidate "with respect to any
election"; $5,000 to any political committee in any year; $20,000 to
the national committees of a political party in any year; but all within
an overall limit (for any individual in any year) of $25,000. 2 U. S.
C. Sections 441a(a)(1), (3).

(b) For any "multicandidate political committee": $5,000 to a
candidate "with respect to any election"; $5,000 to any political
committee in any year; and $15,000 to the national committees of a
political party in any year. Section 441a(a)(2).

FECA also has a special provision, directly at issue in this case, that
governs contributions and expenditures by political parties. Section
441a(d). This special provision creates, in part, an exception to the
above contribution limits. That is, without special treatment, political
parties ordinarily would be subject to the general limitation on
contributions by a "multicandidate political committee" just
described. See Section 441a(a)(4). That provision, as we said in (b)
above, limits annual contributions by a "multicandidate political
committee" to no more than $5,000 to any candidate. And as also
mentioned above, this contribution limit governs not only direct
contributions but also indirect contributions that take the form of
coordinated expenditures, defined as "expenditures made . . . in
cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or
suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or
their agents." Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). Thus, ordinarily, a party's
coordinated expenditures would be subject to the $5,000 limitation.

However, FECA's special provision, which we shall call the "Party
Expenditure Provision," creates a general exception from this
contribution limitation, and from any other limitation on
expenditures. It says:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law with respect to
limitations on expenditures or limitations on contributions, . . .
political party [committees] . . . may make expenditures in
connection with the general election campaign of candidates for
Federal office . . . ." Section 441a(d)(1) (emphasis added).

After exempting political parties from the general contribution and
expenditure limitations of the statute, the Party Expenditure Provision
then imposes a substitute limitation upon party "expenditures" in a
senatorial campaign equal to the greater of $20,000 or "2 cents
multiplied by the voting age population of the State," Section
441a(d)(3)(A)(i), adjusted for inflation since 1974, Section 441a(c).
The Provision permitted a political party in Colorado in 1986 to
spend about $103,000 in connection with the general election
campaign of a candidate for the United States Senate. See FEC
Record, vol. 12, no. 4, p. 1 (Apr. 1986). (A different provision, not
at issue in this case, Section 441a(d)(2), limits party expenditures in
connection with presidential campaigns. Since this case involves only
the provision concerning congressional races, we do not address
issues that might grow out of the public funding of Presidential
campaigns).

In January 1986, Timothy Wirth, then a Democratic Congressman,
announced that he would run for an open Senate seat in November.
In April, before either the Democratic primary or the Republican
convention, the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee
(Colorado Party), the petitioner here, bought radio advertisements
attacking Congressman Wirth. The State Democratic Party
complained to the Federal Election Commission. It pointed out that
the Colorado Party had previously assigned its $103,000 general
election allotment to the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
leaving it without any permissible spending balance. See Federal
Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454
U. S. 27 (1981) (state party may appoint national senatorial
campaign committee as agent to spend its Party Expenditure
Provision allotment). It argued that the purchase of radio time was
an "expenditure in connection with the general election campaign of a
candidate for Federal office," Section 441a(d)(3), which,
consequently, exceeded the Party Expenditure Provision limits.

The FEC agreed with the Democratic Party. It brought a complaint
against the Colorado Republican Party, charging a violation. The
Colorado Party defended in part by claiming that the Party
Expenditure Provision's expenditure limitations violated the First
Amendment--a charge that it repeated in a counterclaim that said the
Colorado Party intended to make other "expenditures directly in
connection with" senatorial elections, App. 68, Paragraph 48, and
attacked the constitutionality of the entire Party Expenditure
Provision. The Federal District Court interpreted the Provision's
words " `in connection with' the general election campaign of a
candidate" narrowly, as meaning only expenditures for advertising
using " `express words of advocacy of election or defeat.' " 839 F.
Supp. 1448, 1455 (Colo. 1993) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 46,
n. 52). See also Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U. S., at 249.
As so interpreted, the court held, the provision did not cover the
expenditures here. The court entered summary judgment for the
Colorado Party and dismissed its counterclaim as moot.

Both sides appealed. The Government, for the FEC, argued for a
somewhat broader interpretation of the statute--applying the limits to
advertisements containing an "electioneering message" about a
"clearly identified candidate," FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14, 2 CCH
Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide Paragraph 5819, p. 11,185 (May
30, 1985) (AO 1985-14)--which, it said, both covered the
expenditure and satisfied the Constitution. The Court of Appeals
agreed. It found the Party Expenditure Provision applicable, held it
constitutional, and ordered judgment in the FEC's favor. 59 F. 3d
1015, 1023-1024 (CA10 1995).

We granted certiorari primarily to consider the Colorado Party's
argument that the Party Expenditure Provision violates the First
Amendment "either facially or as applied."  Pet. for Cert. i. For
reasons we shall discuss in Part IV below, we consider only the latter
question--whether the Party Expenditure Provision as applied here
violates the First Amendment. We conclude that it does.


The summary judgment record indicates that the expenditure in
question is what this Court in Buckley called an "independent"
expenditure, not a "coordinated" expenditure that other provisions of
FECA treat as a kind of campaign "contribution."  See Buckley,
supra, at 36-37, 46-47, 78; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498. The record
describes how the expenditure was made. In a deposition, the
Colorado Party's Chairman, Howard Callaway, pointed out that, at
the time of the expenditure, the Party had not yet selected a senatorial
nominee from among the three individuals vying for the nomination.
App. 195-196. He added that he arranged for the development of the
script at his own initiative, id., at 200, that he, and no one else,
approved it, id., at 199, that the only other politically relevant
individuals who might have read it were the party's executive director
and political director, ibid., and that all relevant discussions took
place at meetings attended only by party staff, id., at 204.

Notwithstanding the above testimony, the Government argued in
District Court--and reiterates in passing in its brief to this Court,
Brief for Respondent 27, n. 20--that the deposition showed that the
Party had coordinated the advertisement with its candidates. It
pointed to Callaway's statement that it was the practice of the party to
"coordinat[e] with the candidate" "campaign strategy," App. 195,
and for Callaway to be "as involved as [he] could be" with the
individuals seeking the Republican nomination, ibid., by making
available to them "all of the assets of the party," id., at 195-196.
These latter statements, however, are general descriptions of party
practice. They do not refer to the advertising campaign at issue here
or to its preparation. Nor do they conflict with, or cast significant
doubt upon, the uncontroverted direct evidence that this advertising
campaign was developed by the Colorado Party independently and
not pursuant to any general or particular understanding with a
candidate. We can find no "genuine" issue of fact in this respect.
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e); Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 586-587 (1986). And we therefore
treat the expenditure, for constitutional purposes, as an
"independent" expenditure, not an indirect campaign contribution.

So treated, the expenditure falls within the scope of the Court's
precedents that extend First Amendment protection to independent
expenditures. Beginning with Buckley, the Court's cases have
found a "fundamental constitutional difference between money spent
to advertise one's views independently of the candidate's campaign
and money contributed to the candidate to be spent on his campaign."
NCPAC, supra, at 497. This difference has been grounded in the
observation that restrictions on contributions impose "only a marginal
restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free
communication," Buckley, supra, at 20-21, because the symbolic
communicative value of a contribution bears little relation to its size,
424 U. S., at 21, and because such limits leave "persons free to
engage in independent political expression, to associate actively
through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but
nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and
committees with financial resources."  Id., at 28. At the same time,
reasonable contribution limits directly and materially advance the
Government's interest in preventing exchanges of large financial
contributions for political favors. Id., at 26-27.

In contrast, the Court has said that restrictions on independent
expenditures significantly impair the ability of individuals and groups
to engage in direct political advocacy and "represent substantial . . .
restraints on the quantity and diversity of political speech."  Id., at
19. And at the same time, the Court has concluded that limitations on
independent expenditures are less directly related to preventing
corruption, since "[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination
of an expenditure with the candidate . . . not only undermines the
value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the
danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper
commitments from the candidate."  Id., at 47.


Given these established principles, we do not see how a provision
that limits a political party's independent expenditures can escape
their controlling effect. A political party's independent expression
not only reflects its members' views about the philosophical and
governmental matters that bind them together, it also seeks to
convince others to join those members in a practical democratic task,
the task of creating a government that voters can instruct and hold
responsible for subsequent success or failure. The independent
expression of a political party's views is "core" First Amendment
activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals,
candidates, or other political committees. See, e.g., Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214
(1989).

We are not aware of any special dangers of corruption associated
with political parties that tip the constitutional balance in a different
direction. When this Court considered, and held unconstitutional,
limits that FECA had set on certain independent expenditures by
political action committees, it reiterated Buckley's observation that
"the absence of prearrangement and coordination" does not eliminate,
but it does help to "alleviate," any "danger" that a candidate will
understand the expenditure as an effort to obtain a "quid pro quo."
See NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498. The same is true of independent
party expenditures.

We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute more
money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000) or to other
political committees ($5,000). 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(a). We also
recognize that FECA permits unregulated "soft money" contributions
to a party for certain activities, such as electing candidates for state
office, see Section 431(8)(A)(i), or for voter registration and "get out
the vote" drives, see Section 431(8)(B)(xii). But the opportunity for
corruption posed by these greater opportunities for contributions is,
at best, attenuated. Unregulated "soft money" contributions may not
be used to influence a federal campaign, except when used in the
limited, party-building activities specifically designated in the statute.
See Section 431(8)(B). Any contribution to a party that is earmarked
for a particular campaign, is considered a contribution to the
candidate and is subject to the contribution limitations. Section
441a(a)(8). A party may not simply channel unlimited amounts of
even undesignated contributions to a candidate, since such direct
transfers are also considered contributions and are subject to the
contribution limits on a "multicandidate political committee."  Section
441a(a)(2).      The greatest danger of corruption, therefore, appears
to be from the ability of donors to give sums up to $20,000 to a party
which may be used for independent party expenditures for the benefit
of a particular candidate. We could understand how Congress, were
it to conclude that the potential for evasion of the individual
contribution limits was a serious matter, might decide to change the
statute's limitations on contributions to political parties. Cf.
California Medical Assn., 453 U. S., at 197-199 (plurality opinion)
(danger of evasion of limits on contribution to candidates justified
prophylactic limitation on contributions to PAC's). But we do not
believe that the risk of corruption present here could justify the
"markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by" the statute's
limitations on expenditures. Buckley, supra, at 44. See also 424 U.
S., at 46-47, 51; NCPAC, supra, at 498. Contributors seeking to
avoid the effect of the $1,000 contribution limit indirectly by
donations to the national party could spend that same amount of
money (or more) themselves more directly by making their own
independent expenditures promoting the candidate. See Buckley,
supra, at 44-48 (risk of corruption by individuals' independent
expenditures is insufficient to justify limits on such spending). If
anything, an independent expenditure made possible by a $20,000
donation, but controlled and directed by a party rather than the donor,
would seem less likely to corrupt than the same (or a much larger)
independent expenditure made directly by that donor. In any case,
the constitutionally significant fact, present equally in both instances,
is the lack of coordination between the candidate and the source of
the expenditure. See Buckley, supra, at 45-46; NCPAC, supra, at
498. This fact prevents us from assuming, absent convincing
evidence to the contrary, that a limitation on political parties'
independent expenditures is necessary to combat a substantial danger
of corruption of the electoral system.

The Government does not point to record evidence or legislative
findings suggesting any special corruption problem in respect to
independent party expenditures. See Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. __, __ (1994) (slip. op., at 40-41) ("When
the Government defends a regulation on speech as a means to . . .
prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply posit the
existence of the disease sought to be cured") (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted); NCPAC, supra, at 498. To the contrary,
this Court's opinions suggest that Congress wrote the Party
Expenditure Provision not so much because of a special concern
about the potentially "corrupting" effect of party expenditures, but
rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what it
saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending. See Buckley,
supra, at 57. In fact, rather than indicating a special fear of the
corruptive influence of political parties, the legislative history
demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance what was seen as
an important and legitimate role for political parties in American
elections. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Comm., 454 U. S., at 41 (Party Expenditure Provision
was intended to "assure that political parties will continue to have an
important role in federal elections"); S. Rep. No. 93-689, p. 7
(1974) ("[A] vigorous party system is vital to American politics....
[P]ooling resources from many small contributors is a legitimate
function and an integral part of party politics"); id., at 7-8, 15.

We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law controls the
outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution that grants to
individuals, candidates, and ordinary political committees the right to
make unlimited independent expenditures could deny the same right
to political parties. Having concluded this, we need not consider the
Party's further claim that the statute's "in connection with" language,
and the FEC's interpretation of that language, are unconstitutionally
vague. Cf. Buckley, supra, at 40-44.


The Government does not deny the force of the precedent we have
discussed. Rather, it argued below, and the lower courts accepted,
that the expenditure in this case should be treated under those
precedents, not as an "independent expenditure," but rather as a
"coordinated expenditure," which those cases have treated as
"contributions," and which those cases have held Congress may
constitutionally regulate. See, e.g., Buckley, supra, at 23-38.

While the District Court found that the expenditure in this case was
"coordinated," 839 F. Supp., at 1453, it did not do so based on any
factual finding that the Party had consulted with any candidate in the
making or planing of the advertising campaign in question. Instead,
the District Court accepted the Government's argument that all party
expenditures should be treated as if they had been coordinated as a
matter of law, "[b]ased on Supreme Court precedent and the
Commission's interpretation of the statute," ibid. The Court of
Appeals agreed with this legal conclusion. 59 F. 3d, at 1024. Thus,
the lower courts' "finding" of coordination does not conflict with our
conclusion, infra, at 6-8, that the summary judgment record shows
no actual coordination as a matter of fact. The question, instead, is
whether the Court of Appeals erred as a legal matter in accepting the
Government's conclusive presumption that all party expenditures are
"coordinated."  We believe it did.

In support of its argument, the Government points to a set of legal
materials, based on FEC interpretations, that seem to say or imply
that all party expenditures are "coordinated."  These include: (1) an
FEC regulation that forbids political parties to make any "independent
expenditures . . . in connection with" a "general election campaign,"
11 CFR Section 110.7(b)(4) (1995); (2) Commission Advisory
Opinions that use the word "coordinated" to describe the Party
Expenditure Provisions' limitations, see, e.g., FEC Advisory Op.
1984-15, 1 CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide Paragraph 5766,
p. 11,069 (May 31, 1984) (AO 1984-15); FEC Advisory Op. 1988-
22, 2 CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide Paragraph 5932, p.
11,471 n. 4 (July 5, 1988) (AO 1988-22); (3) one Commission
Advisory Opinion that says explicitly in a footnote that "coordination
with candidates is presumed and `independence' precluded," ibid.;
and (4) a statement by this Court that "[p]arty committees are
considered incapable of making `independent' expenditures," FEC v.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., supra, at 28-29, n. 1.

The Government argues, on the basis of these materials, that the FEC
has made an "empirical judgment that party officials will as a matter
of course consult with the party's candidates before funding
communications intended to influence the outcome of a federal
election." Brief for Respondent 27. The FEC materials, however, do
not make this empirical judgment. For the most part those materials
use the word "coordinated" as a description that does not necessarily
deny the possibility that a party could also make independent
expenditures. See, e.g., AO 1984-15 Paragraph 5766, p. 11,069.
We concede that one Advisory Opinion says, in a footnote, that
"coordination with candidates is presumed."  AO 1988-22 Paragraph
5932, p. 11,471 n. 4. But this statement, like the others, appears
without any internal or external evidence that the FEC means it to
embody an empirical judgment (say, that parties, in fact, hardly ever
spend money independently) or to represent the outcome of an
empirical investigation. Indeed, the statute does not require any such
investigation, for it applies both to coordinated and to independent
expenditures alike. See Section 441a(d)(3) (a "political party . . .
may not make any expenditure" in excess of the limits) (emphasis
added). In any event, language in other FEC Advisory Opinions
suggests the opposite, namely that sometimes, in fact, parties do
make independent expenditures. See, e.g., AO 1984-15, Paragraph
5766, p. 11,069 ("Although consultation or coordination with the
candidate is permissible, it is not required"). In these circumstances,
we cannot take the cited materials as an empirical, or experience-
based, determination that, as an factual matter, all party expenditures
are coordinated with a candidate. That being so, we need not hold,
on the basis of these materials, that the expenditures here were
"coordinated."       The Government does not advance any other legal
reason that would require us to accept the Commission's
characterization. The Commission has not claimed, for example,
that, administratively speaking, it is more difficult to separate a
political party's "independent," from its "coordinated," expenditures
than, say, those of a PAC. Cf. 11 CFR Section 109.1 (1995)
(distinguishing between independent and coordinated expenditures
by other political groups). Nor can the Commission draw significant
legal support from the footnote in Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Comm., 454 U. S., at 28-29, n. 1, given that this statement was
dicta that purported to describe the regulatory regime as the FEC had
described it in a brief.

Nor does the fact that the Party Expenditure Provision fails to
distinguish between coordinated and independent expenditures
indicate a congressional judgment that such a distinction is
impossible or untenable in the context of political party spending.
Instead, the use of the unmodified term "expenditure" is explained by
Congress' desire to limit all party expenditures when it passed the
1974 amendments, just as it had limited all expenditures by
individuals, corporations, and other political groups. See 18 U. S.
C. Sections 608(e), 610 (1970 ed., Supp. IV); Buckley, 424 U. S.,
at 39.

Finally, we recognize that the FEC may have characterized the
expenditures as "coordinated" in light of this Court's constitutional
decisions prohibiting regulation of most independent expenditures.
But, if so, the characterization cannot help the Government prove its
case. An agency's simply calling an independent expenditure a
"coordinated expenditure" cannot (for constitutional purposes) make
it one. See, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963)
(the government "cannot foreclose the exercise of constitutional
rights by mere labels"); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U. S. 229,
235-238 (1963) (State may not avoid First Amendment's strictures
by applying the label "breach of the peace" to peaceful
demonstrations).

The Government also argues that the Colorado Party has conceded
that the expenditures are "coordinated."  But there is no such
concession in respect to the underlying facts. To the contrary, the
Party's "Questions Presented" in its petition for certiorari describes
the expenditure as one "the party has not coordinated with its
candidate." See Pet. for Cert. i. In the lower courts the Party did
accept the FEC's terminology, but it did so in the context of legal
arguments that did not focus upon the constitutional distinction that
we now consider. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 9-10, n. 8
(denying that the FEC's labels can control constitutional analysis).
The Government has not referred us to any place where the Party
conceded away or abandoned its legal claim that Congress may not
limit the uncoordinated expenditure at issue here. And, in any event,
we are not bound to decide a matter of constitutional law based on a
concession by the particular party before the Court as to the proper
legal characterization of the facts. Cf. United States Nat. Bank of
Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439,
447 (1993); Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611, 623-
628 (1948); Young v. United States, 315 U. S. 257, 259 (1942)
(recognizing that "our judgments are precedents" and that the proper
understanding of matters of law "cannot be left merely to the
stipulation of parties").

Finally, the Government and supporting amici argue that the
expenditure is "coordinated" because a party and its candidate are
identical, i.e., the party, in a sense, "is" its candidates. We cannot
assume, however, that this is so. See, e.g., W. Keefe, Parties,
Politics, and Public Policy in America 59-74 (5th ed. 1988)
(describing parties as "coalitions" of differing interests). Congress
chose to treat candidates and their parties quite differently under the
Act, for example, by regulating contributions from one to the other.
See Section 441a(a)(2)(B). See also 11 CFR Sections 110.2,
110.3(b) (1995). And we are not certain whether a metaphysical
identity would help the Government, for in that case one might argue
that the absolute identity of views and interests eliminates any
potential for corruption, as would seem to be the case in the
relationship between candidates and their campaign committees. Cf.
Buckley, 424 U. S., at 54-59 (Congress may not limit expenditures
by candidate/campaign committee); First Nat. Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (where there is no risk of
"corruption" of a candidate, the Government may not limit even
contributions).

The Colorado Party and supporting amici have argued a broader
question than we have decided, for they have claimed that, in the
special case of political parties, the First Amendment forbids
congressional efforts to limit coordinated expenditures as well as
independent expenditures. Because the expenditure before us is an
independent expenditure we have not reached this broader question in
deciding the Party's "as applied" challenge.

We recognize that the Party filed a counterclaim in which it sought to
raise a facial challenge to the Party Expenditure Provision as a whole.
But that counterclaim did not focus specifically upon coordinated
expenditures. See App. 68-69. Nor did its summary judgment
affidavits specifically allege that the Party intended to make
coordinated expenditures exceeding the statute's limits. See App.
159, Paragraph 4. While this lack of focus does not deprive this
Court of jurisdiction to consider a facial challenge to the Party
Expenditure Provision as overbroad or as unconstitutional in all
applications, it does provide a prudential reason for this Court not to
decide the broader question, especially since it may not be necessary
to resolve the entire current dispute. If, in fact, the Party wants to
make only independent expenditures  like those before us, its
counterclaim is mooted by our resolution of its "as applied"
challenge. Cf. Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 323-324 (1991)
(facial challenge should generally not be entertained when an "as-
applied" challenge could resolve the case); Brockett v. Spokane
Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 503-504 (1985).

More importantly, the opinions of the lower courts, and the parties'
briefs in this case, did not squarely isolate, and address, party
expenditures that in fact are coordinated, nor did they examine, in
that context, relevant similarities or differences with similar
expenditures made by individuals or other political groups. Indeed,
to our knowledge, this is the first case in the 20-year history of the
Party Expenditure Provision to suggest that in-fact coordinated
expenditures by political parties are protected from congressional
regulation by the First Amendment, even though this Court's prior
cases have permitted regulation of similarly coordinated expenditures
by individuals and other political groups. See Buckley, supra, at 46-
47. This issue is complex. As JUSTICE KENNEDY points out,
post, at 4-5, party coordinated expenditures do share some of the
constitutionally relevant features of independent expenditures. But
many such expenditures are also virtually indistinguishable from
simple contributions (compare, for example, a donation of money
with direct payment of a candidate's media bills, see Buckley, supra,
at 46). Moreover, political parties also share relevant features with
many PAC's, both having an interest in, and devoting resources to,
the goal of electing candidates who will "work to further" a particular
"political agenda," which activity would benefit from coordination
with those candidates. Post, at 4. See, e.g., NCPAC, 470 U. S., at
490 (describing the purpose and activities of the National
Conservative PAC); id., at 492 (coordinated expenditures by PAC's
are subject to FECA contribution limitations). Thus, a holding on in-
fact coordinated party expenditures necessarily implicates a broader
range of issues than may first appear, including the constitutionality
of party contribution limits.

But the focus of this litigation, and the lower court opinions, has not
been on such issues, but rather on whether the Government may
conclusively deem independent party expenditures to be coordinated.
This lack of focus may reflect, in part, the litigation strategy of the
parties. The Government has denied that any distinction can be made
between a party's independent and its coordinated expenditures. The
Colorado Party, for its part, did not challenge a different provision of
the statute--a provision that imposes a $5,000 limit on any
contribution by a "multicandidate political committee" (including a
coordinated expenditure) and which would apply to party coordinated
expenditures if the entire Party Expenditure Provision were struck
from the statute as unconstitutional. See Sections 441a(a)(2), (4),
(7)(B)(i). Rather than challenging the constitutionality of this
provision as well, thereby making clear that it was challenging
Congress' authority to regulate in-fact coordinated party
expenditures, the Party has made an obscure severability argument
that would leave party coordinated expenditures exempt from that
provision. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 9. While these
strategies do not deprive the parties of a right to adjudicate the
counterclaim, they do provide a reason for this Court to defer
consideration of the broader issues until the lower courts have
reconsidered the question in light of our current opinion.

Finally, we note that neither the parties nor the lower courts have
considered whether or not Congress would have wanted the Party
Expenditure Provisions limitations to stand were they to apply only
to coordinated, and not to independent, expenditures. See Buckley,
424 U. S., at 108; NCPAC, supra, at 498. This non-constitutional
ground for exempting party coordinated expenditures from FECA
limitations should be briefed and considered before addressing the
constitutionality of such regulation. See United States v. Locke, 471
U. S. 84, 92, and n. 9 (1985).

JUSTICE THOMAS disagrees and would reach the broader
constitutional question notwithstanding the above prudential
considerations. In fact, he would reach a great number of issues
neither addressed below, nor presented by the facts of this case, nor
raised by the parties, for he believes it appropriate here to overrule
sua sponte this Court's entire campaign finance jurisprudence,
developed in numerous cases over the last 20 years. See post, at 5-
15. Doing so seems inconsistent with this Court's view that it is
ordinarily "inappropriate for us to reexamine" prior precedent
"without the benefit of the parties' briefing," since the "principles that
animate our policy of stare decisis caution against overruling a
longstanding precedent on a theory not argued by the parties." United
States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. _, _
(1996) (slip. op., at 12, 13). In our view, given the important
competing interests involved in campaign finance issues, we should
proceed cautiously, consistent with this precedent, and remand for
further proceedings.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.


SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-489


COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE AND DOUGLAS JONES, TREASURER,
PETITIONERS

v.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE SCALIA join, concurring in the judgment and dissenting
in part.

In agreement with JUSTICE THOMAS, post, at 1-5, I would hold
that the Colorado Republican Party, in its pleadings in the District
Court and throughout this litigation, has preserved its claim that the
constraints imposed by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
(FECA), both on its face and as interpreted by the Federal Elections
Commission (FEC), violate the First Amendment.

In the plurality's view, the FEC's conclusive presumption that all
political party spending relating to identified candidates is
"coordinated" cannot be squared with the First Amendment. Ante, at
12-17. The plurality finds the presumption invalid, and I agree with
much of the reasoning behind that conclusion. The quarrel over the
FEC's presumption is beside the point, however, for under the
statute it is both burdensome and quite unrealistic for a political party
to attempt the expenditure of funds on a candidate's behalf (or against
other candidates) without running afoul of FECA's spending
limitations.

Indeed, the plurality's reasoning with respect to the presumption
illuminates the deficiencies in the statutory provision as a whole as it
constrains the speech and political activities of political parties. The
presumption is a logical, though invalid, implementation of the
statute, which restricts as a "contribution" a political party's spending
"in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or
suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or
their agents."  2 U. S. C. Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). While the
statutory provision applies to any "person," its obvious purpose and
effect when applied to political parties, as the FEC's presumption
reflects, is to restrict any party's spending in a specific campaign for
or against a candidate and so to burden a party in expending its own
money for its own speech.

The central holding in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per
curiam), is that spending money on one's own speech must be
permitted, id., at 44-58, and this is what political parties do when
they make the expenditures FECA restricts. FECA calls spending of
this nature a "contribution," Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i), and it is true
that contributions can be restricted consistent with Buckley, supra, at
23-38. As the plurality acknowledges, however, and as our cases
hold, we cannot allow the Government's suggested labels to control
our First Amendment analysis. Ante, at 15. See also, e. g.,
Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 843
(1978) ("Deference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial
inquiry when First Amendment rights are at stake"). In Buckley, we
concluded that contribution limitations imposed only "marginal
restriction[s]" on the contributor's First Amendment rights, 424 U.
S., at 20, because certain attributes of contributions make them less
like "speech" for First Amendment purposes:

"A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the
candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying
basis for the support. The quantity of communication by the
contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his
contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated,
symbolic act of contributing. At most, the size of the contribution
provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor's
support for the candidate. A limitation on the amount of money a
person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus
involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it
permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a
contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor's
freedom to discuss candidates and issues. While contributions may
result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association
to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions
into political debate involves speech by someone other than the
contributor." Id., at 21 (footnote omitted).

We had no occasion in Buckley to consider possible First
Amendment objections to limitations on spending by parties. Id., at
58, n. 66. While our cases uphold contribution limitations on
individuals and associations, see id., at 23-38; California Medical
Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182, 193-199 (1981)
(plurality opinion), political party spending "in cooperation,
consultation, or concert with" a candidate does not fit within our
description of "contributions" in Buckley. In my view, we should
not transplant the reasoning of cases upholding ordinary contribution
limitations to a case involving FECA's restrictions on political party
spending.

The First Amendment embodies a "profound national commitment to
the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,
robust, and wide-open."  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.
S. 254, 270 (1964). Political parties have a unique role in serving
this principle; they exist to advance their members' shared political
beliefs. See, e. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central
Comm., 489 U. S. 214 (1989); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.
S. 234, 250 (1957). Cf. Morse v. Republican Party of Va., 517 U.
S. ___, ___ (1996) (slip op., at 3-4) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).
A party performs this function, in part, by "identify[ing] the people
who constitute the association, and . . . limit[ing] the association to
those people only."  Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin
ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122 (1981). Having identified its
members, however, a party can give effect to their views only by
selecting and supporting candidates. A political party has its own
traditions and principles that transcend the interests of individual
candidates and campaigns; but in the context of particular elections,
candidates are necessary to make the party's message known and
effective, and vice versa.

It makes no sense, therefore, to ask, as FECA does, whether a
party's spending is made "in cooperation, consultation, or concert
with" its candidate. The answer in most cases will be yes, but that
provides more, not less, justification for holding unconstitutional the
statute's attempt to control this type of party spending, which bears
little resemblance to the contributions discussed in Buckley. Supra,
at 2-3. Party spending "in cooperation, consultation, or concert
with" its candidates of necessity "communicate[s] the underlying
basis for the support," 424 U. S., at 21, i. e., the hope that he or she
will be elected and will work to further the party's political agenda.

The problem is not just the absence of a basis in our First
Amendment cases for treating the party's spending as contributions.
The greater difficulty posed by the statute is its stifling effect on the
ability of the party to do what it exists to do. It is fanciful to suppose
that limiting party spending of the type at issue here "does not in any
way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and
issues," ibid., since it would be impractical and imprudent, to say the
least, for a party to support its own candidates without some form of
"cooperation" or "consultation."  The party's speech, legitimate on its
own behalf, cannot be separated from speech on the candidate's
behalf without constraining the party in advocating its most essential
positions and pursuing its most basic goals. The party's form of
organization and the fact that its fate in an election is inextricably
intertwined with that of its candidates cannot provide a basis for the
restrictions imposed here. See Federal Election Comm'n v. National
Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 494-495
(1985).

We have a constitutional tradition of political parties and their
candidates engaging in joint First Amendment activity; we also have a
practical identity of interests between the two entities during an
election. Party spending "in cooperation, consultation, or concert
with" a candidate therefore is indistinguishable in substance from
expenditures by the candidate or his campaign committee. We held
in Buckley that the First Amendment does not permit regulation of
the latter, see 424 U. S., at 54-59, and it should not permit this
regulation of the former. Congress may have authority, consistent
with the First Amendment, to restrict undifferentiated political party
contributions which satisfy the constitutional criteria we discussed in
Buckley, but that type of regulation is not at issue here.

I would resolve the Party's First Amendment claim in accord with
these principles rather than remit the Party to further protracted
proceedings. Because the plurality would do otherwise, I concur
only in the judgment.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-489


COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE AND DOUGLAS JONES, TREASURER,
PETITIONERS

v.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment and dissenting in
part, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE SCALIA
join in Parts I and III.

I agree that petitioners' rights under the First Amendment have been
violated, but I think we should reach the facial challenge in this case
in order to make clear the circumstances under which political parties
may engage in political speech without running afoul of 2 U. S. C.
Section 441a(d)(3). In resolving that challenge, I would reject the
framework established by Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per
curiam), for analyzing the constitutionality of campaign finance laws
and hold that Section 441a(d)(3)'s limits on independent and
coordinated expenditures fail strict scrutiny. But even under
Buckley, Section 441a(d)(3) cannot stand, because the anti-
corruption rationale that we have relied upon in sustaining other
campaign finance laws is inapplicable where political parties are the
subject of such regulation.


As an initial matter, I write to make clear that we should decide the
Party's facial challenge to Section 441a(d)(3) and thus address the
constitutionality of limits on coordinated expenditures by political
parties. JUSTICE BREYER's reasons for not reaching the facial
constitutionality of the statute are unpersuasive. In addition,
concerns for the chilling of First Amendment expression counsel in
favor of resolving that question.

After the Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought this action
against the Party, the Party counterclaimed that "the limits on its
expenditures in connection with the general election campaign for the
Office of United States Senator from the State of Colorado imposed
by 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(d) are unconstitutional, both facially and
as applied."  App. 68. Though JUSTICE BREYER faults the Party
for not "focus[ing] specifically upon coordinated expenditures," ante,
at 17, the term "expenditures" certainly includes both coordinated as
well as independent expenditures.1   See 2 U. S. C. Section
431(9)(A) ("The term `expenditure' includes . . . any purchase,
payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or
anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing
any election for Federal office") (emphasis added). Moreover, at the
time the Party filed its counterclaim, all party expenditures were
treated by law as coordinated, see Federal Election Comm'n v.
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1
(1981), so a reference to expenditures by a party was tantamount to a
reference to coordinated expenditures.

Given the liberal nature of the rules governing civil pleading, see
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8, the Party's straightforward allegation of the
unconstitutionality of Section 441a(d)(3)'s expenditure limits clearly
suffices to raise the claim that neither independent nor coordinated
expenditures may be regulated consistently with the First
Amendment. Indeed, that is precisely how the Court of Appeals
appears to have read the counterclaim. The court expressly said that
it was "analyzing the constitutionality of limits on coordinated
expenditures by political committees," 59 F. 3d 1015, 1024 (CA10
1995), under Section 441a(d)(3).

For the same reasons, the fact that the Party's summary judgment
affidavits did not "specifically allege," ante, at 17, that the Party
intended to make coordinated expenditures is also immaterial. The
affidavits made clear that, but for Section 441a(d)(3), the Party
would spend in excess of the limits imposed by that statute, see App.
159 ("[T]he State Party intends to pay for communications within the
spending limits of [Section 441]. . . . However, the State Party
would also like to pay for communications which costs [sic] exceed
the spending limits of [Section 441a(d)], but will not do so due to the
deterrent and chilling effect of the statute"), as did the Party's brief in
this Court, see Brief for Petitioners 23-24 ("The Colorado Party is
ready, willing and able to make expenditures expressly advocating
the election or defeat of candidates for federal office that would
exceed the limits imposed by Section 441a(d), but it has been
deterred from doing so by the obvious and credible threat of FEC
enforcement action").

Finally, though JUSTICE BREYER notes that this is the first Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) case to raise the
constitutional validity of limits on coordinated expenditures, see ante,
at 18, that is, at best, an argument against granting certiorari. It is
too late for arguments like that now. The case is here, and we
needlessly protract this litigation by remanding this important issue to
the Court of Appeals. Nor is the fact that the "issue is complex,"
ante, at 18, a good reason for avoiding it. We do not sit to decide
only easy cases. And while it may be true that no court has ever
asked whether expenditures that are "in fact" coordinated may be
regulated under the First Amendment, see ante, at 18, I do not see
how the existence of an "in fact" coordinated expenditure would
change our analysis of the facial constitutionality of Section
441a(d)(3), since courts in facial challenges under the First
Amendment routinely consider applications of the relevant statute
other than the application before the court. See Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973). Whether or not there are
facts in the record to support the finding that this particular
expenditure was actually coordinated with a candidate, we are not,
contrary to the suggestion of JUSTICE BREYER, incapable of
considering the Government's interest in regulating such
expenditures and testing the fit between that end and the means used
to achieve it.2

The validity of Section 441a(d)(3)'s controls on coordinated
expenditures is an open question that, if left unanswered, will inhibit
the exercise of legitimate First Amendment activity nationwide. All
JUSTICE BREYER resolves is that when a political party spends
money in support of a candidate (or against his opponent) and the
Government cannot thereafter prove any coordination between the
Party and the candidate, the Party cannot be punished by the
Government for that spending. This settles little, if anything. Parties
are left to wonder whether their speech is protected by the First
Amendment when the Government can show--presumably with
circumstantial evidence--a link between the Party and the candidate
with respect to the speech in question. And of course, one of the
main purposes of a political party is to support its candidates in
elections.

The constitutionality of limits on coordinated expenditures by
political parties is squarely before us. We should address this
important question now, instead of leaving political parties in a state
of uncertainty about the types of First Amendment expression in
which they are free to engage.


Critical to JUSTICE BREYER's reasoning is the distinction between
contributions3  and independent expenditures that we first drew in
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). Though we said
in Buckley that controls on spending and giving "operate in an area
of the most fundamental First Amendment activities," id., at 14, we
invalidated the expenditure limits of FECA and upheld the Act's
contribution limits. The justification we gave for the differing results
was this: "The expenditure limitations . . . represent substantial rather
than merely theoretical restraints on the quantity and diversity of
political speech," id., at 19, whereas "limitation[s] upon the amount
that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or
political committee entai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the
contributor's ability to engage in free communication," id., at 20-21.
This conclusion was supported mainly by two assertions about the
nature of contributions: first, though contributions may result in
speech, that speech is by the candidate and not by the contributor;
and second, contributions express only general support for the
candidate but do not communicate the reasons for that support. Id.,
at 21. Since Buckley, our campaign finance jurisprudence has been
based in large part on this distinction between contributions and
expenditures. See, e.g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts
Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U. S. 238, 259-260, 261-262
(1986); Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political
Action Comm. (NCPAC), 470 U. S. 480, 497 (1985); California
Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182, 196
(1981) (plurality opinion).

In my view, the distinction lacks constitutional significance, and I
would not adhere to it. As Chief Justice Burger put it:
"[C]ontributions and expenditures are two sides of the same First
Amendment coin."  Buckley v. Valeo, supra, 424 U. S., at 241
(concurring in part and dissenting in part).4   Contributions and
expenditures both involve core First Amendment expression because
they further the "[d]iscussion of public issues and debate on the
qualifications of candidates . . . integral to the operation of the
system of government established by our Constitution."  424 U. S.,
at 14. When an individual donates money to a candidate or to a
partisan organization, he enhances the donee's ability to communicate
a message and thereby adds to political debate, just as when that
individual communicates the message himself. Indeed, the individual
may add more to political discourse by giving rather than spending, if
the donee is able to put the funds to more productive use than can the
individual. The contribution of funds to a candidate or to a political
group thus fosters the "free discussion of governmental affairs,"
Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, 218 (1966), just as an expenditure
does.5        Giving and spending in the electoral process also involve
basic associational rights under the First Amendment. See BeVier,
Money and Politics: A Perspective on the First Amendment and
Campaign Finance Reform, 73 Calif. L. Rev. 1045, 1064 (1985)
(hereinafter BeVier). As we acknowledged in Buckley, "`[e]ffective
advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly
controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.'"
424 U. S., at 15 (quoting NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357
U. S. 449, 460 (1958)). Political associations allow citizens to pool
their resources and make their advocacy more effective, and such
efforts are fully protected by the First Amendment. Federal Election
Comm'n v. NCPAC, supra, at 494. If an individual is limited in the
amount of resources he can contribute to the pool, he is most
certainly limited in his ability to associate for purposes of effective
advocacy. See Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair
Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 296 (1981) ("To place a . . .
limit . . . on individuals wishing to band together to advance their
views . . . is clearly a restraint on the right of association"). And if
an individual cannot be subject to such limits, neither can political
associations be limited in their ability to give as a means of furthering
their members' viewpoints. As we have said, "[a]ny interference
with the freedom of a party is simultaneously an interference with the
freedom of its adherents."  Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S.
234, 250 (1957) (plurality opinion).6

Turning from similarities to differences, I can discern only one
potentially meaningful distinction between contributions and
expenditures. In the former case, the funds pass through an
intermediary--some individual or entity responsible for organizing
and facilitating the dissemination of the message--whereas in the
latter case they may not necessarily do so. But the practical judgment
by a citizen that another person or an organization can more
effectively deploy funds for the good of a common cause than he can
ought not deprive that citizen of his First Amendment rights.
Whether an individual donates money to a candidate or group who
will use it to promote the candidate or whether the individual spends
the money to promote the candidate himself, the individual seeks to
engage in political expression and to associate with likeminded
persons. A contribution is simply an indirect expenditure; though
contributions and expenditures may thus differ in form, they do not
differ in substance. As one commentator cautioned, "let us not lose
sight of the speech."  Powe, Mass Speech and the Newer First
Amendment, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 243, 258.

Echoing the suggestion in Buckley that contributions have less First
Amendment value than expenditures because they do not involve
speech by the donor, see 424 U. S., at 21, the Court has sometimes
rationalized limitations on contributions by referring to contributions
as "speech by proxy."  See, e.g., California Medical Assn. v.
Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S., at 196 (Marshall, J.) (plurality
opinion). The "speech by proxy" label is, however, an ineffective
tool for distinguishing contributions from expenditures. Even in the
case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that
facilitates the dissemination of the spender's message--for instance,
an advertising agency or a television station. See Powe, supra, at
258-259. To call a contribution "speech by proxy" thus does little to
differentiate it from an expenditure. See Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at
243- 244, and n. 7 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part). The only possible difference is that contributions involve an
extra step in the proxy chain. But again, that is a difference in form,
not substance.

Moreover, we have recently recognized that where the "proxy"
speech is endorsed by those who give, that speech is a fully-
protected exercise of the donors' associational rights. In Federal
Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, we explained that "the `proxy speech'
approach is not useful . . . [where] the contributors obviously like
the message they are hearing from [the] organizatio[n] and want to
add their voices to that message; otherwise they would not part with
their money. To say that their collective action in pooling their
resources to amplify their voices is not entitled to full First
Amendment protection would subordinate the voices of those of
modest means as opposed to those sufficiently wealthy to be able to
buy expensive media ads with their own resources."  470 U. S., at
495.

The other justification in Buckley for the proposition that contribution
caps only marginally restrict speech-- that is, that a contribution
signals only general support for the candidate but indicates nothing
about the reasons for that support--is similarly unsatisfying.
Assuming the assertion is descriptively accurate (which is certainly
questionable), it still cannot mean that giving is less important than
spending in terms of the First Amendment. A campaign poster that
reads simply "We support candidate Smith" does not seem to me any
less deserving of constitutional protection than one that reads "We
support candidate Smith because we like his position on agriculture
subsidies."  Both express a political opinion. Even a pure message
of support, unadorned with reasons, is valuable to the democratic
process.

In sum, unlike the Buckley Court, I believe that contribution limits
infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political
expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections
of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that
between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving
money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In
principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other
groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of
those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic,
and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect
governmental policy. I think that the Buckley framework for
analyzing the constitutionality of campaign finance laws is deeply
flawed. Accordingly, I would not employ it, as JUSTICE BREYER
and JUSTICE KENNEDY do.


Instead, I begin with the premise that there is no constitutionally
significant difference between campaign contributions and
expenditures: both forms of speech are central to the First
Amendment. Curbs on protected speech, we have repeatedly said,
must be strictly scrutinized. See Federal Election Comm'n v.
NCPAC, supra, at 501; Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for
Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S., at 294; First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 786 (1978).7   I am convinced
that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both
spending and giving in the political process, like Section 441a(d)(3),
are unconstitutional.

The formula for strict scrutiny is, of course, well-established. It
requires both a compelling governmental interest and legislative
means narrowly tailored to serve that interest. In the context of
campaign finance reform, the only governmental interest that we have
accepted as compelling is the prevention of corruption or the
appearance of corruption, see Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC,
470  U. S., at 496-497, and we have narrowly defined "corruption"
as a "financial quid pro quo: dollars for political favors," id., at
497.8   As for the means-ends fit under strict scrutiny, we have
specified that "[w]here at all possible, government must curtail
speech only to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at
hand, and must avoid infringing on speech that does not pose the
danger that has prompted regulation." Federal Election Comm'n v.
MCFL, 479 U. S., at 265.

In Buckley, we expressly stated that the means adopted must be
"closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment" of First
Amendment rights. 424 U. S., at 25. But the Buckley Court
summarily rejected the argument that, because less restrictive means
of preventing corruption existed--for instance, bribery laws and
disclosure requirements-FECA's contribution provisions were
invalid. Bribery laws, the Court said, "deal with only the most
blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence
governmental action," id., at 28, suggesting that those means were
inadequate to serve the governmental interest. With respect to
disclosure rules, the Court admitted that they serve "many salutary
purposes" but said that Congress was "entitled to conclude that
disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings
were a necessary legislative concomitant."  Ibid. Finally, the Court
noted that contribution caps leave people free to engage in
independent political speech, to volunteer their services, and to
contribute money to a "limited but nonetheless substantial extent."
Ibid.

In my opinion, FECA's monetary caps fail the narrow tailoring test.
Addressing the constitutionality of FECA's contribution caps, the
Buckley appellants argued: "If a small minority of political
contributions are given to secure appointments for the donors or
some other quid pro quo, that cannot serve to justify prohibiting all
large contributions, the vast majority of which are given not for any
such purpose but to further the expression of political views which
the candidate and donor share. Where First Amendment rights are
involved, a blunderbuss approach which prohibits mostly innocent
speech cannot be held a means narrowly and precisely directed to the
governmental interest in the small minority of contributions that are
not innocent."  Brief for Appellants in Buckley v. Valeo, O. T. 1975,
Nos. 75-436 and 75-437, pp. 117-118.

The Buckley appellants were, to my mind, correct. Broad
prophylactic bans on campaign expenditures and contributions are
not designed with the precision required by the First Amendment
because they sweep protected speech within their prohibitions.

Section 441a(d)(3), in particular, suffers from this infirmity. It flatly
bans all expenditures by all national and state party committees in
excess of certain dollar limits, see Section 441a(d)(3), without any
evidence that covered committees who exceed those limits are in fact
engaging, or likely to engage, in bribery or anything resembling it.
See Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 689
(1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (where statute "extends to speech
that has the mere potential for producing social harm" it should not be
held to satisfy the narrow tailoring requirement) (emphasis in
original). Thus, the statute indiscriminately covers the many
conceivable instances in which a party committee could exceed the
spending limits without any intent to extract an unlawful commitment
from a candidate. Cf. Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better
Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 637 (1980) (state may not, in effort to
stop fraud in charitable solicitations, "lump" truly charitable
organizations "with those that in fact are using the charitable label as
a cloak for profitmaking and refuse to employ more precise measures
to separate one kind from the other"). As one commentator has
observed, "it must not be forgotten that a large number of
contributions are made without any hope of specific gain: for the
promotion of a program, because of enthusiasm for a candidate, or to
promote what the giver vaguely conceives to be the national interest."
L. Overacker, Money in Elections 192 (1974).

In contrast, federal bribery laws are designed to punish and deter the
corrupt conduct the Government seeks to prevent under FECA, and
disclosure laws work to make donors and donees accountable to the
public for any questionable financial dealings in which they may
engage. Cf. Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment,
supra, at 637-638 (explaining that "less intrusive" means of
preventing fraud in charitable solicitation are "the penal laws [that can
be] used to punish such conduct directly" and "disclosure of the
finances of charitable organizations"). In light of these alternatives,
wholesale limitations that cover contributions having nothing to do
with bribery--but with speech central to the First Amendment--are not
narrowly tailored.

Buckley's rationale for the contrary conclusion, see supra, at 14, is
faulty. That bribery laws are not completely effective in stamping out
corruption is no justification for the conclusion that prophylactic
controls on funding activity are narrowly tailored. The First
Amendment limits Congress to legislative measures that do not
abridge the Amendment's guaranteed freedoms, thereby constraining
Congress' ability to accomplish certain goals. Similarly, that other
modes of expression remain open to regulated individuals or groups
does not mean that a statute is the least restrictive means of
addressing a particular social problem. A statute could, of course, be
more restrictive than necessary while still leaving open some avenues
for speech.9


Were I convinced that the Buckley framework rested on a principled
distinction between contributions and expenditures, which I am not, I
would nevertheless conclude that Section 441a(d)(3)'s limits on
political parties violate the First Amendment. Under Buckley and its
progeny, a substantial threat of corruption must exist before a law
purportedly aimed at the prevention of corruption will be sustained
against First Amendment attack.10   Just as some of the monetary
limits in the Buckley line of cases were held to be invalid because the
government interest in stemming corruption was inadequate under the
circumstances to justify the restrictions on speech, so too is Section
441a(d)(3) invalid.11

The Government asserts that the purpose of Section 441a(d)(3) is to
prevent the corruption of candidates and elected representatives by
party officials. The Government does not explain precisely what it
means by "corruption," however;12  the closest thing to an
explanation the Government offers is that "corruption" is "`the real or
imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on
candidates' positions and on their actions if elected to office.'" Brief
for Respondent 35 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 25).
We so defined corruption in Buckley for purposes of reviewing
ceilings on giving or spending by individuals, groups, political
committees (PACs), and candidates. See id., at 23, 35, 39. But we
did not in that case consider the First Amendment status of FECA's
provisions dealing with political parties. See id., at 58, n. 66, 59, n.
67.

As applied in the specific context of campaign funding by political
parties, the anti-corruption rationale loses its force. See Nahra,
Political Parties and the Campaign Finance Laws: Dilemmas,
Concerns and Opportunities, 56 Ford. L. Rev. 53, 105-106 (1987).
What could it mean for a party to "corrupt" its candidate or to
exercise "coercive" influence over him? The very aim of a political
party is to influence its candidate's stance on issues and, if the
candidate takes office or is reelected, his votes. When political parties
achieve that aim, that achievement does not, in my view, constitute "a
subversion of the political process."  Federal Election Comm'n v.
NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. For instance, if the Democratic Party
spends large sums of money in support of a candidate who wins,
takes office, and then implements the Party's platform, that is not
corruption; that is successful advocacy of ideas in the political
marketplace and representative government in a party system. To
borrow a phrase from Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, "[t]he
fact that candidates and elected officials may alter or reaffirm their
own positions on issues in response to political messages paid for by
[political groups] can hardly be called corruption, for one of the
essential features of democracy is the presentation to the electorate of
varying points of view."  Id., at 498. Cf. Federal Election Comm'n
v. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 263 (suggesting that "[v]oluntary political
associations do not . . . present the specter of corruption").

The structure of political parties is such that the theoretical danger of
those groups actually engaging in quid pro quos with candidates is
significantly less than the threat of individuals or other groups doing
so. See Nahra, supra, at 97-98 (citing F. Sorauf, Party Politics in
America 15-18 (5th ed. 1984)). American political parties, generally
speaking, have numerous members with a wide variety of interests,
Nahra, supra, at 98, features necessary for success in majoritarian
elections. Consequently, the influence of any one person or the
importance of any single issue within a political party is significantly
diffused. For this reason, as the Party's amici argue, see Brief for
Committee for Party Renewal et al. as Amicus Curiae 16, campaign
funds donated by parties are considered to be some of "the cleanest
money in politics." J. Bibby, Campaign Finance Reform, 6
Commonsense 1, 10 (Dec. 1983). And, as long as the Court
continues to permit Congress to subject individuals to limits on the
amount they can give to parties, and those limits are uniform as to all
donors, see 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(a)(1), there is little risk that an
individual donor could use a party as a conduit for bribing
candidates.

In any event, the Government, which bears the burden of
"demonstrat[ing] that the recited harms are real, not merely
conjectural," Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S.
___ (1994) (slip op., at 41), has identified no more proof of the
corrupting dangers of coordinated expenditures than it has of
independent expenditures. Cf. ante, at 11 ("The Government does
not point to record evidence or legislative findings suggesting any
special corruption problem in respect to independent party
expenditures"). And insofar as it appears that Congress did not
actually enact Section 441a(d)(3) in order to stop corruption by
political parties "but rather for the constitutionally insufficient
purpose of reducing what it saw as wasteful and excessive campaign
spending," ante, at 11 (citing Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 57), the
statute's ceilings on coordinated expenditures are as unwarranted as
the caps on independent expenditures.

In sum, there is only a minimal threat of "corruption," as we have
understood that term, when a political party spends to support its
candidate or to oppose his competitor, whether or not that
expenditure is made in concert with the candidate. Parties and
candidates have traditionally worked together to achieve their
common goals, and when they engage in that work, there is no risk
to the Republic. To the contrary, the danger to the Republic lies in
Government suppression of such activity. Under Buckley and our
subsequent cases, Section 441a(d)(3)'s heavy burden on First
Amendment rights is not justified by the threat of corruption at which
it is assertedly aimed.

To conclude, I would find Section 441a(d)(3) unconstitutional not
just as applied to petitioners, but also on its face. Accordingly, I
concur only in the Court's judgment.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-489


COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE AND DOUGLAS JONES, TREASURER,
PETITIONERS

v.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

[June 26, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
dissenting.

In my opinion, all money spent by a political party to secure the
election of its candidate for the office of United States Senator should
be considered a "contribution" to his or her campaign. I therefore
disagree with the conclusion reached in Part III of the Court's
opinion.

I am persuaded that three interests provide a constitutionally
sufficient predicate for federal limits on spending by political parties.
First, such limits serve the interest in avoiding both the appearance
and the reality of a corrupt political process. A party shares a unique
relationship with the candidate it sponsors because their political fates
are inextricably linked. That interdependency creates a special danger
that the party--or the persons who control the party--will abuse the
influence it has over the candidate by virtue of its power to spend.
The provisions at issue are appropriately aimed at reducing that
threat. The fact that the party in this case had not yet chosen its
nominee at the time it broadcast the challenged advertisements is
immaterial to the analysis. Although the Democratic and Republican
nominees for the 1996 Presidential race will not be selected until this
summer, current advertising expenditures by the two national parties
are no less contributions to the campaigns of the respective
frontrunners than those that will be made in the fall.

Second, these restrictions supplement other spending limitations
embodied in the Act, which are likewise designed to prevent
corruption. Individuals and certain organizations are permitted to
contribute up to $1,000 to a candidate. 2 U. S. C. Section
441a(a)(1)(A). Since the same donors can give up to $5,000 to party
committees, Section 441a(a)(1)(C), if there were no limits on party
spending, their contributions could be spent to benefit the candidate
and thereby circumvent the $1,000 cap. We have recognized the
legitimate interest in blocking similar attempts to undermine the
policies of the Act. See California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election
Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182, 197-199 (1981) (plurality opinion)
(approving ceiling on contributions to political action committees to
prevent circumvention of limitations on individual contributions to
candidates); id., at 203 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 38 (1976)
(per curiam) (approving limitation on total contributions by an
individual in connection with an election on same rationale).

Finally, I believe the Government has an important interest in
leveling the electoral playing field by constraining the cost of federal
campaigns. As Justice White pointed out in his opinion in Buckley,
"money is not always equivalent to or used for speech, even in the
context of political campaigns."  424 U. S., at 263 (opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is quite wrong to
assume that the net effect of limits on contributions and expenditures-
-which tend to protect equal access to the political arena, to free
candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fund-
raising, and to diminish the importance of repetitive 30-second
commercials--will be adverse to the interest in informed debate
protected by the First Amendment. See id., at 262-266.

Congress surely has both wisdom and experience in these matters
that is far superior to ours. I would therefore accord special
deference to its judgment on questions related to the extent and nature
of limits on campaign spending.*  Accordingly, I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals.

*One irony of the case is that both the Democratic National Party and
the Republican National Party have sided with petitioners in
challenging a law that Congress has the obvious power to change.
See Brief for Democratic National Committee as Amicus Curiae;
Brief for Republican National Committee as Amicus Curiae.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE THOMAS CONCURRING AND
DISSENTING IN PART

1 JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges as much when he asserts earlier
in his opinion that "the unmodified term `expenditure'" reflects a
Congressional intent "to limit all party expenditures."  Ante, at 15
(emphasis in original).

2 JUSTICE BREYER's remaining arguments for avoiding the facial
challenge are straw men. See ante, at 19 (if Section 441a(d)(3) were
invalidated in its entirety, other FECA provisions that the Party has
not challenged might apply to coordinated party expenditures); ante,
at 19 (if Section 441a(d)(3) were upheld as to coordinated
expenditures but invalidated as to independent expenditures, issues
of severability would be raised). That resolution of the primary
question in this case (the constitutionality of Section 441a(d)(3) with
respect to all expenditures) might generate issues not previously
considered (such as severability) is no reason for not deciding the
question itself. Without suggesting that remand is the only
appropriate way to deal with possible corollary matters in this case or
that these arguments have merit, I point out that we can, of course,
decide the central question without ruling on the issues that concern
JUSTICE BREYER.

3 Coordinated expenditures are by statute categorized as
contributions. See 2 U. S. C. Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(i)
("[E]xpenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or
concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his
authorized political committees, or their agents, shall be considered to
be a contribution to such candidate").

4 Three Members of the Buckley Court thought the distinction
untenable at the time, see 424 U. S., at 241 (Burger, C. J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 261 (White, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 290 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part), and another Member
disavowed it subsequently, see Federal Election Comm'n v. National
Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 518-521
(1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Cf. Austin v. Michigan Chamber
of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 678 (1990) (STEVENS, J.,
concurring) (stating that distinction "should have little, if any, weight
in reviewing corporate participation in candidate elections").

5 See H. Alexander, Money in Politics 234 (1972): "The
constitutional arguments against limiting campaign spending also
apply against limiting contributions; specifically, it is the right of an
individual to spend his money to support a congenial viewpoint . . . .
Some views are heard only if interested individuals are willing to
support financially the candidate or committee voicing the position.
To be widely heard, mass communications may be necessary, and
they are costly. By extension, then, the contribution of money is a
contribution to freedom of political debate."

6 To illustrate the point that giving and spending in the political
process implicate the same First Amendment values, I note that
virtually everything JUSTICE BREYER says about the importance
of free independent expenditures applies with equal force to
coordinated expenditures and contributions. For instance, JUSTICE
BREYER states that "[a] political party's independent expression not
only reflects its members' views about the philosophical and
governmental matters that bind them together, it also seeks to
convince others to join those members in a practical democratic task,
the task of creating a government that voters can instruct and hold
responsible for subsequent success or failure."  Ante, at 9.
"Coordinated" expression by political parties, of course, shares those
precise attributes. The fact that an expenditure is prearranged with
the candidate--presumably to make it more effective in the election--
does not take away from its fundamental democratic purposes.

7 In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), the Court purported to
scrutinize strictly the contribution provisions as well the expenditures
rules. See id., at 23 (FECA's contribution and expenditures limits
"both implicate fundamental First Amendment interests"); id., at 25
(contributions limits, like expenditure limits, are "`subject to the
closest scrutiny'") (citation omitted). It has not gone unnoticed,
however, that we seemed more forgiving in our review of the
contribution provisions than of the expenditure rules. See, e.g.,
California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S.
182, 196 (1981) (plurality opinion) (contributions are "not the sort of
political advocacy that this Court in Buckley found entitled to full
First Amendment protection"). But see id., at 201-202 (Blackmun,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (under Buckley,
there is no lesser standard of review for contributions as opposed to
expenditures).

8 As I explain in Part III, infra, the interest in preventing corruption
is inapplicable when the subject of the regulation is a political party.
My analysis here is more general, however, and applies to all
individuals and entities subject to campaign finance limits.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS submits that we should "accord special
deference to [Congress'] judgment on questions related to the extent
and nature of limits on campaign spending," post, at 3, a stance that
the Court of Appeals also adopted, see 59 F. 3d 1015, 1024 (CA10
1995). This position poses great risk to the First Amendment, in that
it amounts to letting the fox stand watch over the henhouse. There is
good reason to think that campaign reform is an especially
inappropriate area for judicial deference to legislative judgment. See
generally BeVier 1074-1081. What the argument for deference fails
to acknowledge is the potential for legislators to set the rules of the
electoral game so as to keep themselves in power and to keep
potential challengers out of it. See id., at 1075 ("`Courts must police
inhibitions on . . . political activity because we cannot trust elected
officials to do so'") (emphasis omitted) (quoting J. Ely, Democracy
and Distrust 106 (1980)). See also R. Winter, Political Financing
and the Constitution, 486 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 34,
40, 48 (1986). Indeed, history demonstrates that the most significant
effect of election reform has been not to purify public service, but to
protect incumbents and increase the influence of special interest
groups. See BeVier 1078-1080. When Congress seeks to ration
political expression in the electoral process, we ought not simply
acquiesce in its judgment.

10 See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 45-47 (striking down limits
on independent expenditures because the "advocacy restricted by the
provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or
apparent corruption"); Federal Election Comm'n v. MCFL, 479 U.
S. 238, 263 (1986) (invalidating caps on campaign expenditures by
incorporated political associations because spending by such groups
"does not pose . . . [any] threat" of corruption); Federal Election
Comm'n v. NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498 (striking down limits on
independent expenditures by political action committees because "a
quid pro quo for improper commitments" in that context was a
"hypothetical possibility"); Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition
for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 297 (1981) (stating
that "Buckley does not support limitations on contributions to
committees formed to favor or oppose ballot measures" because anti-
corruption rationale is inapplicable); First Nat. Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (concluding that limits on
referendum speech by corporations violate First Amendment because
"[t]he risk of corruption . . . simply is not present").

11 While JUSTICE BREYER chides me for taking the positition that
I would not adhere to Buckley, see ante, at 19-20, and suggests that
my approach to this case is thus insufficiently "cautious," ante, at 20,
he ignores this Part of my opinion, in which I explain why limits on
coordinated expenditures are unconstitutional even under the Buckley
line of precedent.

12 Nor, for that matter, does JUSTICE BREYER explain what sorts
of quid pro quos a party could extract from a candidate. Cf. ante, at
9.

GRAY

v.

NETHERLAND, WARDEN

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-6510.  Argued April 15, 1996-Decided June 20, 1996

At the start of petitioner's Virginia trial for the capital murder of
Richard McClelland, the prosecution acknowledged that, should the
trial reach the penalty phase, it would introduce petitioner's
admissions to other inmates that he had previously murdered Lisa
Sorrell and her daughter. The day that petitioner was convicted of the
McClelland murder, the prosecution disclosed that it would introduce
additional evidence at sentencing linking petitioner to the Sorrell
murders, including crime scene photographs and testimony from the
Sorrell investigating detective and medical examiner. Counsel moved
to exclude evidence pertaining to any felony for which petitioner had
not been charged. Although counsel also complained that he was not
prepared for the additional evidence, and that the defense was taken by
surprise, he did not request a continuance. The court denied the
motions to exclude, and, after a hearing, petitioner was sentenced to
death. After exhausting his state remedies, he sought federal habeas
relief, claiming, as relevant here, that inadequate notice prevented him
from defending against the evidence introduced at the penalty phase,
and that the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence
regarding the Sorrell murders. The District Court initially denied
relief, finding that petitioner had no constitutional right to notice of
individual testimony that the Commonwealth planned to introduce at
sentencing, and that the claim made under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.
S. 83, was procedurally barred under Virginia law. However, the
court later amended its judgment, concluding that petitioner was
denied due process when the Commonwealth failed to provide fair
notice of what Sorrell murder evidence would be introduced. In
reversing, the Fourth Circuit found that granting habeas relief would
give petitioner the benefit of a new rule of federal constitutional law,
in violation of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. The grant of certiorari
is limited to petitioner's notice-of-evidence and Brady claims.


Held:

1. Petitioner's Brady claim is procedurally defaulted. He never raised
that claim in state court, and, because he knew of its grounds when he
filed his first state petition, Virginia law precludes review of the
defaulted claim in any future state habeas proceeding. This provides
an independent and adequate state-law ground for the conviction and
sentence, and thus prevents federal habeas review of the defaulted
claim, unless petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the
default. Teague v. Lane, supra, at 298. Because he has made no
such demonstration, his claim is not cognizable in a federal suit for the
writ. Pp. 8-9.

2. The misrepresentation claim raised by petitioner in his brief here is
remanded for the Court of Appeals to determine whether he in fact
raised that issue below. Pp. 9-13.

(a) In his brief, petitioner relies on two separate due process
challenges to the manner in which the prosecution introduced evidence
about the Sorrell murders: a notice-of-evidence claim alleging that the
Commonwealth failed to give adequate notice of the evidence it would
use, and a misrepresentation claim alleging that the Commonwealth
mislead him about the evidence it intended to present. For purposes
of exhausting state remedies, a habeas claim must include reference to
a specific federal constitutional guarantee, as well as a statement of the
facts entitling a petitioner to relief. Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270.
A petitioner does not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by presenting
the state courts only with the facts necessary to state a claim for relief.
Nor is it enough to make a general appeal to a constitutional guarantee
as broad as due process to present the "substance" of such a claim to a
state court. Anderson v. Harless, 459 U. S. 4.  Gardner v. Florida,
430 U. S. 349--on which petitioner relies for his notice-of-evidence
claim--and In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S. 544, Raley v. Ohio, 360 U. S.
423, and Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103--on which he relies for
his misrepresentation claim--arise in widely differing contexts. The
two claims are separate. Pp. 9-12.

(b) If petitioner never raised the misrepresentation issue in state
proceedings, federal habeas review would be barred unless he could
demonstrate cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim in
state proceedings. However, if it was addressed in the federal
proceedings, the Commonwealth would have been obligated to raise
procedural default as a defense or lose the right to assert the defense
thereafter. If the Court of Appeals determines that the issue was
raised, it should consider whether the Commonwealth has preserved
any defenses and proceed to consider the claim and preserved
defenses as appropriate. Pp. 12-13.

3. Petitioner's notice-of-evidence claim would require the adoption of
a new constitutional rule. Pp. 13-17.

(a) Petitioner contends that he was deprived of adequate notice when
he received only one day's notice of the additional evidence, but,
rather than seeking a continuance, he sought to have all such evidence
excluded. For him to prevail, he must establish that due process
requires that he receive more than a day's notice of the
Commonwealth's evidence. He must also show that due process
required a continuance whether or not he sought one, or that, if he
chose not to seek a continuance, exclusion was the only appropriate
remedy. Only the adoption of a new constitutional rule could establish
these propositions. A defendant has the right to notice of the charges
against which he must defend. In re Ruffalo, supra. However, he
does not have a constitutional right to notice of the evidence which the
state plans to use to prove the charges, and Brady, which addressed
only exculpatory evidence, did not create one. Weatherford v.
Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559. Gardner v. Florida, supra,
distinguished. Even if notice were required, exclusion of evidence is
not the sole remedy for a violation of such a right, since a continuance
could minimize prejudice. Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 413.
Petitioner made no such request here, and in view of his insistence on
exclusion, the trial court might well have felt that it would have been
interfering with counsel's tactical decision to order a continuance on
its own motion. Pp. 15-17.

(b) The new rule petitioner proposes does not fall within Teague's
second exception, which is for watershed rules of criminal procedure
implicating a criminal proceeding's fundamental fairness and
accuracy. Whatever one may think of the importance of petitioner's
proposed rule, it has none of the primacy and centrality of the rule
adopted in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, or other rules
which may be thought to be within the exception. Saffle v. Parks,
494 U. S. 484, 495. P. 17.

58 F. 3d 59, vacated and remanded.

No. 95-6510


COLEMAN WAYNE GRAY, PETITIONER

v.

J. D. NETHERLAND, WARDEN

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 20, 1996]

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner, convicted of capital murder, complains that his right to due
process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because
he was not given adequate notice of some of the evidence the
Commonwealth intended to use against him at the penalty hearing of
his trial. We hold that this claim would necessitate a "new rule," and
that therefore it does not provide a basis on which he may seek federal
habeas relief.


Richard McClelland was the manager of a department store, Murphy's
Mart, in Portsmouth, Virginia. On May 2, 1985, at approximately
9:30 p.m., petitioner and Melvin Tucker, a friend, both under the
influence of cocaine, parked in the parking lot of the Murphy's Mart
and watched McClelland and a store security guard inside. Shortly
before midnight, McClelland and the guard came out of the store and
left in separate automobiles. With Tucker in the passenger seat,
petitioner followed McClelland, pulled in front of his car at a stop
sign, threatened him with a .32- caliber revolver, ordered him into
petitioner's car, and struck him. Petitioner and Tucker took
McClelland's wallet and threatened to harm his family if he did not
cooperate. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 313, 340-341, 356 S.
E. 2d 157, 172, cert. denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).

Petitioner drove the car back to the Murphy's Mart, where he forced
McClelland at gunpoint to reopen the store. They filled three gym bags
with money, totaling between $12,000 and $13,000. Petitioner drove
McClelland and Tucker to a service station, bought gasoline for his car
and for a gas can in the car's trunk, and proceeded to a remote side
road. He took McClelland 15 to 20 feet behind the car and ordered
him to lie down. While McClelland begged petitioner not to hurt or
shoot him, petitioner assured him he would not be harmed. Having
thus assured McClelland, petitioner fired 6 pistol shots into the back
of his head in rapid succession. Id., at 341-342, 356 S. E. 2d, at
172-173.

Leaving McClelland's dead body on the side road, petitioner and
Tucker returned to the intersection where they had seized him.
Petitioner, telling Tucker he wanted to destroy McClelland's car as
evidence, doused its interior with gasoline and lit it with a match. Id.,
at 341-342, 356 S. E. 2d, at 173.

Petitioner and Tucker were later arrested and indicted in the Circuit
Court of the City of Suffolk on several counts, including capital
murder. Having evidence that petitioner had announced before the
killing that "he was going to get" McClelland for having fired his wife
from her job as a saleswoman at the Murphy's Mart, and that
petitioner had told other witnesses after the killing that he had
performed it, the prosecutor entered into a plea bargain with Tucker.
In return for being tried for first-degree murder instead of capital
murder, Tucker would testify at petitioner's trial about events leading
up to the killing and would identify petitioner as the actual "trigger
man."  Id., at 331, 356 S. E. 2d, at 167.


On Monday, December 2, 1985, petitioner's trial began. Petitioner's
counsel moved that the trial court order the prosecution to disclose the
evidence it planned to introduce in the penalty phase. The prosecutor
acknowledged that "in the event [petitioner] is found guilty we do
intend to introduce evidence of statements he has made to other people
about other crimes he has committed of which he has not been
convicted."  14 Record 8. In particular, the prosecution intended to
show that petitioner had admitted to a notorious double-murder in
Chesapeake, a city adjacent to Suffolk. Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-
old daughter, Shanta, had been murdered five months before
McClelland was killed. The prosecutor told petitioner's counsel in
court that the only evidence he would introduce would be statements
by petitioner to Tucker or fellow inmates that he committed these
murders. Id., at 11.

On Thursday, December 5, 1985, the jury convicted petitioner on all
counts. That evening, the prosecution informed petitioner's counsel
that the Commonwealth would introduce evidence, beyond
petitioner's own admissions, linking petitioner to the Sorrell murders.
The additional evidence included photographs of the crime scene and
testimony by the police detective who investigated the murders and by
the state medical examiner who performed autopsies on the Sorrells'
bodies. The testimony was meant to show that the manner in which
Lisa and Shanta Sorrell had been killed resembled the manner in
which McClelland was killed. The next morning, petitioner's counsel
made two motions "to have excluded from evidence during [the]
penalty trial any evidence pertaining to any . . . felony for which the
defendant has not yet been charged."  18 id., at 776. Counsel argued
that the additional evidence exceeded the scope of unadjudicated-crime
evidence admissible for sentencing under Virginia law, because "[i]n
essence, what [the prosecutor is] doing is trying [the Sorrell] case in
the minds of the jurors."  Id., at 724 (citing Watkins v.
Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985), cert. denied,
475 U. S. 1099 (1986)). Although counsel also complained that he
was not "prepared for any of this [additional evidence], other than
[that petitioner] may have made some incriminating statements," 18
Record 725, and that the "[d]efense was taken by surprise," id., at
777, he never requested a continuance. The trial court denied the
motions to exclude.

During the sentencing phase, Tucker testified that, shortly after the
McClelland murder, Gray pointed to a picture of Lisa Sorrell in a
newspaper and told Tucker that he had "knocked off" Sorrell.
Petitioner's counsel did not cross-examine Tucker. Officer Michael
Slezak, who had investigated the Sorrell murders, testified that he
found Lisa's body in the front seat of a partially burned automobile
and Shanta's body in the trunk. Dr. Faruk Presswalla, the medical
examiner who had performed autopsies on the bodies, testified that
Lisa was killed by six bullets to the head, shot from a .32-caliber gun.
Gray, supra, at 345, 356 S. E. 2d, at 175. Petitioner's counsel did
not cross-examine Dr. Presswalla, and only cross-examined Officer
Slezak to suggest that McClelland's murder may have been a
"copycat" murder, committed by a different perpetrator. 18 Record
793, 802.1

The jury fixed petitioner's sentence for McClelland's murder at death.
The trial court entered judgment on the verdicts for all the charges
against petitioner and sentenced him to death. The Virginia Supreme
Court affirmed, 233 Va. 313, 356 S. E. 2d 157, and we denied
certiorari, Gray v. Virginia, 484 U. S. 873 (1987). The Suffolk
Circuit Court dismissed petitioner's state petition for a writ of habeas
corpus. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, and we
denied certiorari. Gray v. Thompson, 500 U. S. 949 (1991).


Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. With respect to the
Sorrell murders, he argued, inter alia, that he had "never been
convicted of any of these crimes nor was he awaiting trial for these
crimes," that the Commonwealth "did not disclose its intentions to use
the Sorrell murders as evidence against [him] until such a late date that
it was impossible for [his] defense counsel reasonably to prepare or
defend against such evidence at trial," and that Tucker "`sold' his
testimony to the Commonwealth for . . . less than a life sentence."  1
Joint Appendix in No. 94-4009 (CA4), pp. 32-33 (hereinafter J. A.).

The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition. To clarify its
arguments against petitioner's Sorrell murder claim, it characterized
petitioner's allegations as seven separate subclaims. The first
subclaim asserted that petitioner was given "inadequate notice of the
evidence which the Commonwealth intended to introduce to permit
him to defend against it," and the third, relying on Brady v. Maryland,
373 U. S. 83 (1963), asserted that "[t]he Commonwealth failed to
disclose evidence tending to prove that someone else had committed
the Sorrell murders."2 Respondent's Brief in Support of Motion to
Dismiss in No. 3:91CV693 (ED Va.), p. 2. According to the State,
the notice-of-evidence subclaim was meritless and could not be the
basis for relief in federal habeas corpus proceedings because it sought
the retroactive application of a new rule of constitutional law. Id., at
18-19, 19-20. The Commonwealth alleged that the Brady subclaim
had not been presented to the state courts on direct appeal or in state
habeas corpus proceedings, and was thus procedurally barred under
Virginia Code Section 8.01-654(B)(2). Respondent's Brief in
Support of Motion to Dismiss, supra, at 19.

Initially, the District Court dismissed the habeas petition. The court
adopted the Commonwealth's characterization of petitioner's Sorrell
claim. See 1 J. A. 193. The court held that petitioner was not entitled
to relief on the notice-of-evidence subclaim, because he "has no
constitutional right to notice of individual items of testimony which the
Commonwealth intends to introduce at the penalty phase."  Id., at
194. The court declined to review the Brady subclaim because it was
procedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.

Later, on petitioner's motion, the District Court amended its judgment
to find within petitioner's Sorrell claim a specific due process claim
about the admissibility of the Sorrell murder evidence. Id., at 252.
(In amending this judgment, the court announced that it remained
unchanged as to the remaining claims, which it had dismissed. Id., at
251.) After holding an evidentiary hearing on the Sorrell claim, the
District Court ordered that petitioner be granted a writ of habeas
corpus. The court characterized the claim as an allegation that
petitioner "was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth
Amendment of the United States Constitution because the
Commonwealth failed to provide fair notice that evidence concerning
the Sorrell murders would be introduced at his penalty phase."  App.
348. Citing Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-359 (1977), the
court determined that there was a constitutional defect in petitioner's
penalty phase hearing: "Petitioner was confronted and surprised by the
testimony of officer Slezak and Dr. Presswalla."  App. 349. This
defect "violated [petitioner's] right to fair notice and rendered the
hearing clearly unreliable," because petitioner's attorneys had less than
one day's notice of the additional evidence to be used against their
client. Id., at 349-350.

The Commonwealth appealed, arguing to the Fourth Circuit that to
grant petitioner habeas relief would give him the benefit of a new rule
of federal constitutional law, in violation of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.
S. 288 (1989). The Fourth Circuit reversed the judgment granting the
writ, rejected petitioner's cross-appeals from the dismissal of several
other claims, and remanded with directions that the habeas corpus
petition be dismissed. Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 67 (1995).
The court distinguished Gardner, on which the District Court had
relied, because petitioner, unlike Gardner, "was not sentenced on the
basis of any secret information."  58 F. 3d, at 64. The court thus
concluded that petitioner's notice-of-evidence claim "was not
compelled by existing precedent at the time his conviction became
final," and thus could not be considered in federal habeas proceedings
under Teague. 58 F. 3d, at 64.

The Commonwealth scheduled petitioner's execution for December
14, 1995. Petitioner applied for a stay of execution and petitioned for
a writ of certiorari from this Court. We granted his stay application on
December 13, 1995. 516 U. S. ___ (1995). On January 5, 1996, we
granted certiorari, limited to the questions whether petitioner's notice-
of-evidence claim stated a new rule and whether the Commonwealth
violated petitioner's due process rights under Brady by withholding
evidence exculpating him from responsibility for the Sorrell murders.
516 U. S. ___ (1995); see Pet. for Cert. i.


We first address petitioner's Brady claim. The District Court
determined that "[t]his claim was not presented to the Supreme Court
of Virginia on direct appeal nor in state habeas corpus proceedings,"
and that "the factual basis of this claim was available to [petitioner] at
the time he litigated his state habeas corpus petition," and dismissed
the claim on this basis. 1 J. A. 194. Petitioner does not contest these
determinations in this Court.

Petitioner's failure to raise his Brady claim in state court implicates the
requirements in habeas of exhaustion and procedural default. 28 U.
S. C. Section 2254(b) bars the granting of habeas corpus relief
"unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies
available in the courts of the State."  Because "[t]his requirement . . .
refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal
petition," Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126, n. 28 (1982), it is
satisfied "if it is clear that [the habeas petitioner's] claims are now
procedurally barred under [state] law," Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S.
346, 351 (1989). However, the procedural bar which gives rise to
exhaustion provides an independent and adequate state-law ground for
the conviction and sentence, and thus prevents federal habeas corpus
review of the defaulted claim, unless the petitioner can demonstrate
cause and prejudice for the default. Teague v. Lane, supra, at 298;
Isaac, supra, at 126, n. 28, 129; Wainright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72,
90-91 (1977).

In Virginia, "[n]o writ [of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum] shall be
granted on the basis of any allegation the facts of which petitioner had
knowledge at the time of filing any previous petition."  Va. Code Ann.
Section 8.01-654(B)(2) (1992). Because petitioner knew of the
grounds of his Brady claim when he filed his first petition, Section
8.01-654(B)(2) precludes review of petitioner's claim in any future
state habeas proceeding. Because petitioner makes no attempt to
demonstrate cause or prejudice for his default in state habeas
proceedings, his claim is not cognizable in a federal suit for the writ.


Petitioner makes a separate due process challenge to the manner in
which the prosecution introduced evidence about the Sorrell murders.
We perceive two separate claims in this challenge. As we will explain
in greater detail below, petitioner raises a "notice-of-evidence" claim,
which alleges that the Commonwealth deprived petitioner of due
process by failing to give him adequate notice of the evidence the
Commonwealth would introduce in the sentencing phase of his trial.
He raises a separate "misrepresentation" claim, which alleges that the
Commonwealth violated due process by misleading petitioner about
the evidence it intended to use at sentencing.

In Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 (1971), we held that, for
purposes of exhausting state remedies, a claim for relief in habeas
corpus must include reference to a specific federal constitutional
guarantee, as well as a statement of the facts which entitle the
petitioner to relief. We considered whether a habeas petitioner was
entitled to relief on the basis of a claim, which was not raised in the
state courts or in his federal habeas petition, that the indictment
procedure by which he was brought to trial violated equal protection.
Id., at 271. In announcing that "the substance of a federal habeas
corpus claim must first be presented to the state courts," id., at 278,
we rejected the contention that the petitioner satisfied the exhaustion
requirement of 28 U. S. C. Section 2254(b) by presenting the state
courts only with the facts necessary to state a claim for relief. "The
[state court] dealt with the arguments [the habeas petitioner] offered;
we cannot fault that court for failing also to consider sua sponte
whether the indictment procedure denied [the petitioner] equal
protection of the laws."  Id., at 277.

We have also indicated that it is not enough to make a general appeal
to a constitutional guarantee as broad as due process to present the
"substance" of such a claim to a state court. In Anderson v. Harless,
459 U. S. 4 (1982), the habeas petitioner was granted relief on the
ground that it violated due process for a jury instruction to obviate the
requirement that the prosecutor prove all the elements of the crime
beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 7 (citing Sandstrom v. Montana,
442 U. S. 510 (1979)). The only manner in which the habeas
petitioner had cited federal authority was by referring to a state-court
decision in which "the defendant . . . asserted a broad federal due
process right to jury instructions that properly explain state law."  459
U. S., at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of the
record satisfied us that the Sandstrom claim "was never presented to,
or considered by, the [state] courts," but we found it especially
significant that the "broad federal due process right" that the habeas
petition might have been read to incorporate did not include "the more
particular analysis developed in cases such as Sandstrom."  Ibid.

The due process challenge in petitioner's brief relies on  two
"particular analys[es]" of due process. Ibid. Relying on cases like
Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), and Skipper v. South
Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), petitioner argues that he should have
been given "`such notice of the issues involved in the [sentencing]
hearing as [would have] reasonably enable[d] him to prepare his
case,'" Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting Schwartz, Administrative Law
283 (2d ed. 1984)), that he was denied "a fair opportunity to be heard
on determinative sentencing issues," Brief for Petitioner 33. This
right stems from the defendant's "legitimate interest in the character of
the procedure which leads to the imposition of sentence" of death,
Gardner, supra, at 358, which justifies giving him an "opportunity to
deny" potentially determinative sentencing information, id., at 362.

"Yet another way in which the state may unconstitutionally . . .
deprive [a defendant] of a meaningful opportunity to address the
issues, is simply by misinforming him."  Brief for Petitioner 34.
Petitioner cites In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S. 544 (1968), Raley v. Ohio,
360 U. S. 423 (1959), and Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103
(1935), for this proposition. Ruffalo was a disbarment proceeding in
which this Court held that the disbarred attorney had not been given
notice of the charges against him by the Ohio committee which
administered bar discipline. 390 U. S., at 550. In Raley, the
chairman and members of a state investigating commission assured
witnesses that the privilege against self-incrimination was available to
them, but when the witnesses were convicted for contempt the
Supreme Court of Ohio held that a state immunity statute rendered the
Fifth Amendment privilege unavailable. 360 U. S., at 430-434. And
in Mooney v. Holohan, the defendant alleged that the prosecution
knowingly used perjured testimony at his trial. 294 U. S., at 110.

Gardner, Ruffalo, Raley, and Mooney arise in widely differing
contexts. Gardner forbids the use of secret testimony in the penalty
proceeding of a capital case which the defendant has had no
opportunity to consider or rebut. Ruffalo deals with a defendant's
right to notice of the charges against him. Whether or not Ruffalo
might have supported petitioner's notice-of-evidence claim, see infra,
at 16, it does not support the misrepresentation claim for which
petitioner cites it. Mooney forbade the prosecution from engaging in
"a deliberate deception of court and jury."  294 U. S., at 112. Raley,
though involving no deliberate deception, held that defendants who
detrimentally relied on the assurance of a committee chairman could
not be punished for having done so. Mooney, of course, would lend
support to petitioner's claim if it could be shown that the prosecutor
deliberately misled him, not just that he changed his mind over the
course of the trial. The two claims are separate.


The Commonwealth argues that the misrepresentation claim "was
never argued before in any court."  Brief for Respondent 39. If
petitioner never presented this claim on direct appeal or in state habeas
proceedings, federal habeas review of the claim would be barred
unless petitioner could demonstrate cause and prejudice for his failure
to raise the claim in state proceedings. Supra, at 8. If the claim was
not raised or addressed in federal proceedings, below, our usual
practice would be to decline to review it. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.
S. 519, 533 (1992).


There is some ambiguity as to whether the misrepresentation claim
was raised or addressed in the District Court or the Court of Appeals.
On the one hand, the District Court ordered relief primarily on the
basis of Gardner, i.e., lack of notice. Supra, at 6-7. On the other
hand, some of the District Court findings advert to a deliberate
decision by the prosecutor to mislead petitioner's counsel for tactical
advantage. See, e.g., App. 348, 350. The ambiguity in the federal
record complicates the state-court procedural default issue, because
procedural default is an affirmative defense for the Commonwealth. If
the misrepresentation claim was addressed at some stage of federal
proceedings, the Commonwealth would have been obligated to raise
procedural default as a defense, or lose the right to assert the defense
thereafter. See Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 234, n. 1
(1980); see also Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 227-228 (1994).

We remand for the Court of Appeals to determine whether petitioner in
fact raised what in his briefs on the merits to this Court he asserts has
been his "fundamental complaint throughout this litigation . . . : the
Commonwealth's affirmative misrepresentation regarding its
presentation of the Sorrell murders . . . deprived Petitioner of a fair
sentencing proceeding."  Reply Brief for Petitioner 4-5. If the
misrepresentation claim was raised, the Court of Appeals should
consider whether the Commonwealth has preserved any defenses to it
and proceed to consider the claim and preserved defenses as
appropriate.

We turn to the notice-of-evidence claim, and consider whether the
Court of Appeals correctly concluded that this claim sought the
retroactive application of a new rule of federal constitutional law. We
have concluded that the writ's purpose may be fulfilled with the least
intrusion necessary on States' interest of the finality of criminal
proceedings by applying constitutional standards contemporaneous
with the habeas petitioner's conviction to review his petition. See
Teague, 489 U. S., at 309-310 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). Thus,
habeas relief is appropriate only if "a state court considering [the
petitioner's] claim at the time his conviction became final would have
felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule [he]
seeks was required by the Constitution." Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S.
484, 488 (1990).

At the latest, petitioner knew at the start of trial that the prosecutor
intended to introduce evidence tending to show that he committed the
Sorrell murders. He knew then that the Commonwealth would call
Tucker to the stand to repeat his statement that petitioner had admitted
to committing the murders.3   See App. 340; 14 Record 8-9. He
nonetheless contends that he was deprived of adequate notice of the
other witnesses, the police officer and the medical examiner who had
investigated the Sorrell murders, whom he was advised that the
prosecutor would call only on the evening before the sentencing
hearing. App. 342; 18 Record 777. But petitioner did not attempt to
cure this inadequacy of notice by requesting more time to respond to
this evidence. He instead moved "to have excluded from evidence
during this penalty trial any evidence pertaining to any other--any
felony for which the defendant has not yet been charged."4   Id., at
776.

On these facts, for petitioner to prevail on his notice-of-evidence
claim, he must establish that due process requires that he receive more
than a day's notice of the Commonwealth's evidence. He must also
establish that due process required a continuance whether or not he
sought one, or that, if he chose not to seek a continuance, exclusion
was the only appropriate remedy for the inadequate notice. We
conclude that only the adoption of a new constitutional rule could
establish these propositions.

A defendant's right to notice of the charges against which he must
defend is well established. In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S. 544 (1968); Cole
v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196 (1948). But a defendant's claim that he
has a right to notice of the evidence which the state plans to use to
prove the charges stands on quite a different footing. We have said
that "the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of
discovery which the parties must be afforded."  Wardius v. Oregon,
412 U. S. 470, 474, (1973). In Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S.
545 (1977), we considered the Due Process claim of a defendant who
had been convicted with the aid of surprise testimony of an accomplice
who was an undercover agent. Although the prosecutor had not
intended to introduce the agent's testimony, he changed his mind the
day of trial. Id., at 549. To keep his cover, the agent had told the
defendant and his counsel that he would not testify against the
defendant. Id., at 560. We rejected the defendant's claim, explaining
that "[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal
case, and Brady," which addressed only exculpatory evidence, "did
not create one," id., at 559. To put it mildly, these cases do not
compel a court to order the prosecutor to disclose his evidence; their
import, in fact, is strongly against the validity of petitioner's claim.

Petitioner relies principally on Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349
(1977), for the proposition that a defendant may not be sentenced to
death "on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to
deny or explain."  Id., at 362 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). In
Gardner, the trial court sentenced the defendant to death relying in part
on evidence assembled in a presentence investigation by the state
parole commission; the "investigation report contained a confidential
portion which was not disclosed to defense counsel."  Id., at 353.
Gardner literally had no opportunity to even see the confidential
information, let alone contest it. Petitioner in the present case, on the
other hand, had the opportunity to hear the testimony of Officer Slezak
and Dr. Presswalla in open court, and to cross-examine them. His
claim to notice is much more akin to the one rejected in Weatherford,
supra, than to the one upheld in Gardner.

Even were our cases otherwise on the notice issue, we have
acknowledged that exclusion of evidence is not the sole remedy for a
violation of a conceded right to notice of an alibi witness. In Taylor v.
Illinois, 484 U. S. 400 (1988), we said that in this situation "a less
drastic sanction is always available. Prejudice . . . could be
minimized by granting a continuance."  Id., at 413. Here, counsel did
not request a continuance; he argued only for exclusion. Counsel
argued that the evidence should be excluded not only because he was
not prepared to contest the evidence, but also because it exceeded the
standard in Virginia, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331
S. E. 2d 422 (1985), for relevance of unsolved-crime evidence to
sentencing. See 18 Record 723. In view of petitioner's insistence on
exclusion of the evidence, the trial court might well have felt that it
would have been interfering with a tactical decision of counsel to order
a continuance on its own motion.

The dissent argues that petitioner seeks the benefit of a well-
established rule, that "a capital defendant must be afforded a
meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the evidence introduced
against him at sentencing."  Post, at 11. Because we disagree with the
dissent's assertion that petitioner moved for a continuance, we
disagree with its characterization of the constitutional rule underlying
his claim for relief. Compare supra, at 14, and n. 4, with post, 15, n.
11. The dissent glosses over the similarities between this case and
Weatherford, which "`dictate[s],'" post, at 10, the disposition of
petitioner's claim--adversely to petitioner--more clearly than any
precedent cited by the dissent. But even without Weatherford and
petitioner's failure to move for a continuance, we would still think the
new-rule doctrine "would be meaningless if applied at this level of
generality."  Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 236 (1990). We
therefore hold that petitioner's notice-of-evidence claim would require
the adoption of a new constitutional rule.


Petitioner argues that relief should be granted nonetheless, because the
new rule he proposes falls within one of Teague's two exceptions.
"The first exception permits the retroactive application of a new rule if
the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the State
to proscribe."  Parks, 494 U. S., at 494 (citing Teague, 489 U. S., at
311). This exception is not at issue here. "The second exception is
for `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the
fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."
Parks, supra, at 495 (citing Teague, supra, at 311; Butler v.
McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 416 (1990)). Petitioner argues that his
notice-of-evidence new rule is "mandated by long-recognized
principles of fundamental fairness critical to accuracy in capital
sentencing determinations."  Brief for Petitioner 47.

We observed in Saffle v. Parks that the paradigmatic example of a
watershed rule of criminal procedure is the requirement that counsel be
provided in all criminal trials for serious offenses. 494 U. S., at 495
(citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)). "Whatever
one may think of the importance of [petitioner's] proposed rule, it has
none of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon or
other rules which may be thought to be within the exception."  Parks,
supra, at 495. The rule in Teague therefore applies, and petitioner
may not obtain habeas relief on his notice-of-evidence claim.


We hold that petitioner's Brady claim is procedurally defaulted and
that his notice-of-evidence claim seeks retroactive application of a new
rule. Neither claim states a ground upon which relief may be granted
in federal habeas corpus proceedings. However, we vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for
consideration of petitioner's misrepresentation claim in proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.



SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

COLEMAN WAYNE GRAY, PETITIONER

v.

J. D. NETHERLAND, WARDEN

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 20, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

JUSTICE GINSBURG has cogently explained why well-settled law
requires the reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I join
her opinion with this additional observation. The evidence tending to
support the proposition that petitioner committed the Sorrell murders
was not even sufficient to support the filing of charges against him.
Whatever limits due process places upon the introduction of evidence
of unadjudicated conduct in capital cases, they surely were exceeded
here. Given the "vital importance" that "any decision to impose the
death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than
caprice or emotion", the sentencing proceeding would have been
fundamentally unfair even if the prosecutors had given defense
counsel fair notice of their intent to offer this evidence. See Gardner
v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-358 (1977) (Opinion of STEVENS,
J.).



SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-6510


COLEMAN WAYNE GRAY, PETITIONER

v.

J. D. NETHERLAND, WARDEN

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

[June 20, 1996]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
SOUTER, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.

Basic to due process in criminal proceedings is the right to a full, fair,
potentially effective opportunity to defend against the State's charges.
Petitioner Gray was not accorded that fundamental right at the penalty
phase of his trial for capital murder. I therefore conclude that no "new
rule" is implicated in his petition for habeas corpus, and dissent from
the Court's decision, which denies Gray the resentencing proceeding
he seeks.


Petitioner Coleman Gray's murder trial began on Monday, December
2, 1985, in the city of Suffolk, Virginia. He was charged with killing
Richard McClelland during the commission of a robbery, a capital
offense. Va. Code Ann. Section 18.2-31(4) (Supp. 1995). Under
Virginia law, the trial would proceed in two stages: during the guilt
phase, the jury would determine whether Gray was guilty of capital
murder; and during the penalty phase, the jury would decide whether
Gray should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. See Va.
Code Ann. Section 19.2-264.4(A) (1995).

At an in-chambers conference before the guilt phase began, Gray's
lawyers requested a court order directing the prosecutor to disclose the
evidence he would introduce during the penalty phase if Gray were
convicted.1   Defense counsel wanted to know, in particular, whether
the prosecutor planned to introduce evidence relating to the murders of
Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter, Shanta. Defense counsel
informed the trial court of the basis for the request:

". . . Your Honor, this is my concern. We will probably at the very
best stop in the middle of the day or late in the afternoon and start the
penalty trial the next day. . . . [W]e have good reason to believe that
[the prosecutor] is going to call people to introduce a statement that
our client supposedly made to another inmate that he murdered [the
Sorrells] which were very violent and well-known crimes throughout
this entire area.

"If that comes in we are going to want to know it in advance so we
can be prepared on our argument. . . . It's absolute dynamite."  3
Joint Appendix in No. 94-4009 (CA4), pp. 1328-1329 (hereinafter J.
A.).

The Sorrell murders "were one of the most highly publicized crimes in
the history of the Tidewater, Virginia area."  App. 341. In December
1984, five days after they were reported missing, Lisa and Shanta
Sorrell were found dead in a partially burned car in Chesapeake,
Virginia, a city that shares borders with Suffolk. Lisa's body was
slumped in the front passenger seat of the car; she had been shot in the
head six times. Shanta had been removed from her car seat and
locked in the trunk, where she died after inhaling smoke produced by
the fire in the car's passenger compartment. Neither Gray nor anyone
else has ever been charged with commission of the Sorrell murders.2


In response to defense counsel's disclosure request, the prosecutor
told Gray's lawyers and the court that he would introduce
"statements" Gray had made to other inmates in which Gray allegedly
admitted killing the Sorrells. The following exchange then took place
between defense counsel Moore and prosecutor Ferguson:

"MR. MOORE: Is it going to be evidence or just his statement?

"MR. FERGUSON: Statements that your client made.

"MR. MOORE: Nothing other than statements?

"MR. FERGUSON: To other people, that's correct. Statements made
by your client that he did these things." 3 J. A. 1331 (emphasis
added).

After the in-chambers conference ended, the guilt phase of the trial
began. Three days later, at 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon,
December 5, the jury returned a verdict finding Gray guilty of the
capital murder of McClelland. Proceedings were adjourned for the
day, with the penalty phase to begin at 9:30 the next morning.

That evening, the prosecutor informed defense counsel that, in
addition to Gray's statements, he planned to introduce further
evidence relating to the Sorrell murders. That further evidence
included: (1) the testimony of Detective Slezak, the police officer who
investigated the Sorrell murders, regarding his observations at the
crime scene shortly after the bodies of Lisa and Shanta were
discovered; (2) graphic photographs of the crime scene, depicting the
interior of the partially burned car, Lisa's body in the front seat, and
Shanta's body in the trunk; (3) the testimony of Doctor Presswalla,
the state medical examiner who conducted the autopsies of the victims,
regarding the causes of their deaths; (4) graphic photographs of the
victims at the time of the autopsies, including a photograph depicting
the back of Lisa's head, shaved to reveal six gunshot wounds; and (5)
Doctor Presswalla's autopsy reports. See App. 29-37, 40-47.

This additional evidence, advanced by the prosecutor on the eve of the
penalty phase, suggested that the Sorrell murders were carried out in a
manner "strikingly similar" to the murder of McClelland. Gray v.
Commonwealth, 233 Va. 313, 347, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 176 (1987).
Like Lisa Sorrell, McClelland had been shot six times in the head; his
car, too, had been partially burned. As defense counsel later
explained, "the similarities between the McClelland murder and the
Sorrell murder would be obvious to anyone sitting in a jury box."
App. 141.

On Friday morning, December 6, before trial proceedings resumed,
defense counsel informed the court of Thursday evening's
developments. Gray's lawyers told the court they had learned for the
first time the previous evening that the prosecutor planned to introduce
evidence relating to the Sorrell murders other than Gray's alleged
statements. Counsel stated that while they were prepared to rebut the
statements, they were "not prepared to rebut [the additional evidence] .
. . because of the shortness of notice."  4 J. A. 2065. "We are not
prepared to try the Sorrell murder today," counsel told the court. "We
have not been given sufficient notice."  Ibid.

Gray's lawyers argued that the case relied on by the prosecutor,
Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985),
was distinguishable. There, counsel explained, separate murder
charges were outstanding against the defendant, and "[t]he lawyers
who were representing [Watkins] in the first murder trial were already
representing him with respect to the second murders. They were
aware of all the charges, were aware of the evidence that was available
to the Commonwealth in the second murder charge and were in a
position to confront the evidence . . . that would come in [during] the
penalty trial."  4 J. A. 2065-2066. In contrast to the situation in
Watkins, counsel pointed out, "[w]e are not prepared for any of this,
other than [Gray] may have made some incriminating statements."  4
J. A. 2067. The trial court nonetheless ruled that the Sorrell murders
evidence was "admissible at this stage of the trial."  Id., at 2068.

The penalty phase of the trial then commenced. The prosecutor, in
keeping with his representations before the guilt phase began, called
Melvin Tucker to the stand. Tucker was Gray's accomplice in the
McClelland murder; he, along with Gray, had initially been charged
with capital murder. After plea negotiations, however, the prosecutor
agreed to reduce the charge against Tucker to first-degree murder, a
noncapital offense, in exchange for Tucker's testimony against Gray.
App. 339, and n. 3. Tucker testified during the guilt phase that Gray
had been the "triggerman" in McClelland's murder.

Tucker testified at the penalty phase that, shortly after the McClelland
robbery, he and Gray "were searching through the newspaper for
some information" on the crime. Id., at 22. According to Tucker,
Gray stated that he had "knocked off" Lisa Sorrell, and pointed to a
picture of Lisa Sorrell in the newspaper. Id., at 22-23.3   Gray's
lawyers declined to cross-examine Tucker after his penalty phase
testimony; in their view, Tucker's motive to lie had already been
adequately exposed during the guilt phase. See id., at 157 (testimony
of defense counsel Moore) ("Melvin Tucker had been . . . extensively
. . . cross-examined during the guilt phase . . . . The same jurors who
were sitting there during the guilt trial were there during the penalty
phase and they had been told and drawn a pretty accurate picture as to
why Melvin Tucker would strike a deal and tell anybody anything they
wanted to hear. To save his life. That didn't need to be brought up
again.").

The prosecutor then called Detective Slezak. Defense counsel
renewed their objection, outside the presence of the jury, to admission
of any evidence relating to the Sorrell murders other than Gray's
statements. Counsel reiterated that they had "had no notice of this,"
and had been "taken by surprise."  Id., at 25. What the prosecutor "is
going to do today," they emphasized, "is not what he said he was
going to do at the beginning of trial."  Id., at 27. The court adhered to
its earlier ruling that the evidence was admissible.

With nothing more than Tucker's testimony linking Gray to the Sorrell
murders, the trial court then allowed the prosecutor to introduce the
testimony of Detective Slezak and Doctor Presswalla, as well as crime
scene and autopsy photographs and the victims' autopsy reports. See
supra, at 4. During the defense case, Gray took the stand, admitted
complicity in the McClelland murder but denied being the
"triggerman," and denied any involvement in the Sorrell murders.
App. 346-347. After closing arguments, in which the prosecutor
highlighted the similarities between the Sorrell and McClelland
murders, and urged that Gray's commission of the Sorrell murders
demonstrated his "future dangerous[ness]," see id., at 51-53, the jury
fixed Gray's punishment at death.

Gray unsuccessfully argued on direct appeal to the Virginia Supreme
Court and in state habeas proceedings that admission of the additional
Sorrell murders evidence violated his right to a fair trial under the
Fourteenth Amendment. Gray then filed a federal habeas petition in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
Gray argued, among other things, that admission of the Sorrell
murders evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights. 1 J. A.
35. Specifically, he asserted:

"The Commonwealth did not disclose its intentions to use the Sorrell
murders as evidence against Gray until such a late date that it was
impossible for Gray's defense counsel reasonably to prepare or
defend against such evidence at trial. Because of the late notice, . . .
Gray could not adequately prepare to defend his innocence regarding
the Sorrell murders."  Id., at 33.

The District Court concluded that other claims pressed by Gray in his
federal habeas petition were either procedurally barred or meritless.
The court found, however, that the Sorrell evidence claim "was
consistently raised in the State courts and is not procedurally
defaulted."  Id., at 253.

After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted
Gray a writ of habeas corpus. Relying primarily on Gardner v.
Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the court held that Gray's due process
rights were violated "because the Commonwealth failed to provide fair
notice that evidence concerning the Sorrell murders would be
introduced at his penalty phase," App. 348; consequently, Gray
became vulnerable to a death sentence on the basis of information he
had scant opportunity to deny or explain, see id., at 349-351.
Recalling the prosecutor's Monday morning affirmations that he
would introduce only Gray's "statements," the District Court noted
that Gray's lawyers were "clearly and justifiably . . . shocked" when
the prosecutor reported, Thursday evening, his intention to introduce,
the next day, further evidence on the Sorrell murders. Id., at 350.
"The only Sorrell murder evidence which [Gray's lawyers] were
prepared to challenge," the District Court recounted, "was the
evidence [the prosecutor] indicated he would introduce at the outset of
the trial: Melvin Tucker's statement that Gray allegedly had confessed
to the murders."  Id., at 346. The prosecutor's surprise move had
disarmed Gray's counsel, the District Court recognized, leaving them
without capacity to cross-examine Detective Slezak and Doctor
Presswalla effectively, with the result that the Sorrell murders
evidence "carrie[d] no assurance of reliability."  Id., at 351.

"The consequences of this surprise," the District Court found, "could
not have been more devastating."  Id., at 350. Most critically, the
prosecutor's "statements only" assurance led defense counsel to forgo
investigation of the details of the Sorrell murders, including a review
of the evidence collected by the Chesapeake police department during
its investigation of the crimes. See ibid. Had Gray's lawyers
conducted such a review, they could have shown that none of the
forensic evidence collected by the Chesapeake police directly linked
Gray to the Sorrell murders.4   Moreover, the evidence the
Chesapeake police did obtain "strongly suggested that Timothy
Sorrell"--Lisa's husband and Shanta's father--"actually committed the
notorious murders."  Id., at 350-351.

Indeed, for a substantial period of time following the Sorrell murders,
Timothy Sorrell was the prime suspect in the case.5   Police suspicion
focused on Mr. Sorrell the night Lisa and Shanta were found dead.
When Detective Slezak and another officer informed Mr. Sorrell of the
grim discovery, his statements and demeanor made the officers
"highly suspicious."  Id., at 186.6

Police subsequently learned that Timothy Sorrell had an apparent
motive for the murders. Two weeks before Lisa and Shanta were
killed, the Sorrells obtained a life insurance policy, which designated
Timothy and Shanta as beneficiaries in the event of Lisa's death. Id.,
at 344.7 Lisa's parents later filed a lawsuit to stop Mr. Sorrell from
obtaining the proceeds of the insurance policy, alleging that he was
responsible for Lisa's death. Ibid. In addition, police uncovered
evidence suggesting that Mr. Sorrell was involved in a stolen
merchandise ring at his place of employment, the Naval Supply
Center, and that Lisa "was very angry and unhappy about her
husband's apparent criminal activities."  Id., at 345.8   Based on this
information, Detective Slezak asked the local Commonwealth's
Attorney "to determine whether it was appropriate to prosecute
Timothy Sorrell."  Ibid.9

Assessing the prejudicial potency of the Sorrell murders evidence
admitted at the penalty phase of Gray's trial, the District Court
concluded that the due process violation was not harmless. Id., at
353. The District Court therefore vacated Gray's death sentence, and
remanded the case to the state trial court for resentencing.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. Gray v.
Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59 (1995). It held that federal habeas relief was
barred because Gray's due process claim depended on a "new rule" of
constitutional law which, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288
(1989), could not be applied on collateral review. The Court of
Appeals accordingly remanded the case, directing the District Court to
dismiss Gray's habeas petition.


A case announces a "new rule" under Teague "if the result was not
dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction
became final."  Id., at 301 (plurality opinion). Gray's conviction
became final in 1987, when we denied certiorari to review the Virginia
Supreme Court's decision on direct appeal. See Gray v. Virginia, 484
U. S. 873 (1987). As explained below, precedent decided well before
1987 "dictates" the conclusion that Gray was not accorded due
process at the penalty phase of his trial.

Gray's claim is encompassing, but it is fundamental. Under the Due
Process Clause, he contends, a capital defendant must be afforded a
meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the evidence introduced
against him at sentencing. See Brief for Petitioner 45; Reply Brief for
Petitioner 5. The District Court concluded that Gray was stripped of
any meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the Sorrell murders
evidence, for his lawyers were unfairly "ambushed"--clearly surprised
and devastatingly disarmed by the prosecutor's decision, announced
on the eve of the penalty trial, to introduce extensive evidence other
than Gray's statements. App. 349-351. Gray's counsel reasonably
relied on the prosecutor's unequivocal "statements only" pledge, see
id., at 342, made at the outset of trial; based on the prosecutor's
assurances, defense counsel spent no resources tracking down
information in police records on the Sorrell murders. The
prosecutor's switch, altogether unanticipated by defense counsel, left
them with no chance to uncover, through their own investigation,
information that could have defused the prosecutor's case, in short,
without time to prepare an effective defense. Id., at 351.

The Fourth Circuit recast Gray's claim, transforming it into an
assertion of a broad constitutional right to discovery in capital cases.
See 58 F. 3d, at 64-65. This Court also restates and reshapes Gray's
claim. The Court first slices Gray's whole claim into pieces; it then
deals discretely with each segment it "perceive[s]," ante, at 9: a
"misrepresentation" claim, ante, at 12-13; and a supposed "notice-of-
evidence" claim, ante, at 13-17. Gray, himself, however, has "never
claimed a constitutional right to advance discovery of the
Commonwealth's evidence."  Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 37, and
accompanying text. His own claim is more basic and should not
succumb to artificial endeavors to divide and conquer it.

There is nothing "new" in a rule that capital defendants must be
afforded a meaningful opportunity to defend against the State's
penalty phase evidence. As this Court affirmed more than a century
ago: "Common justice requires that no man shall be condemned in his
person or property without . . . an opportunity to make his defence."
Baldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864). See also Windsor v.
McVeigh, 93 U. S. 274, 277 (1876). A pro forma opportunity will
not do.10   Due process demands an opportunity to be heard "at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner."  Armstrong v. Manzo,
380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965); see In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 275
(1948) (defendant must be afforded "a reasonable opportunity to meet
[the charges against him] by way of defense or explanation"); Morgan
v. United States, 304 U. S. 1, 18 (1938) ("The right to a hearing
embraces not only the right to present evidence but also a reasonable
opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet
them."). Absent a full, fair, potentially effective opportunity to defend
against the State's charges, the right to a hearing would be "but a
barren one."  Ibid.; see Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust
Co., 339 U. S. 306, 315 (1950) ("process which is a mere gesture is
not due process").

In Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the principal decision
relied on by the District Court, we confirmed that the sentencing phase
of a capital trial "must satisfy the requirements of the Due Process
Clause." Id., at 358 (plurality opinion). Gardner presented the
question whether a defendant was denied due process when the trial
judge sentenced him to death relying in part on a presentence report,
including a confidential portion not disclosed to defense counsel.
Counsel's deprivation of an "opportunity . . . to challenge the
accuracy or materiality" of the undisclosed information, id., at 356,
the Gardner plurality reasoned, left a manifest risk that "some of the
information accepted in confidence may [have been] erroneous, or . . .
misinterpreted," id., at 359. As a basis for a death sentence, Gardner
teaches, information unexposed to adversary testing does not qualify
as reliable. See ibid. The Gardner Court vacated the defendant's
sentence, concluding that he "was denied due process of law when the
death [penalty] was imposed, at least in part, on the basis of
information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain."  Id., at
362.

Urging that Gardner fails to "dictate" a decision for Gray here, the
Commonwealth relies on the Fourth Circuit's reasoning to this effect:
Gardner was a case about "secrecy"; Gray's case is about "surprise."
See 58 F. 3d, at 65. Therefore, Gray seeks an extension, not an
application, of Gardner, see Brief for Respondent 30, in Teague
parlance, a "new rule," Brief for Respondent 31. It would be an
impermissible "leap," the Fourth Circuit maintained, to equate to a
failure to disclose, a disclosure in fact made, "but allegedly so late as
to be unfair."  58 F. 3d, at 65.

Teague is not the straightjacket the Commonwealth misunderstands it
to be. Teague requires federal courts to decide a habeas petitioner's
constitutional claims according to the "law prevailing at the time [his]
conviction became final."  Teague, 489 U. S., at 306 (plurality
opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). But Teague does not bar
federal habeas courts from applying, in "a myriad of factual contexts,"
law that is settled--here, the right to a meaningful chance to defend
against or explain charges pressed by the State. See Wright v. West,
505 U. S. 277, 309 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)
("Where the beginning point is a rule of this general application, a rule
designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual
contexts, it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that
it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent.").

The District Court did not "forg[e] a new rule," ibid., by holding, on
the facts of this case, that Gray was denied a meaningful opportunity
to challenge the Sorrell murders evidence. Ordinarily, it is incumbent
upon defense counsel, after receiving adequate notice of the triable
issues, to pursue whatever investigation is needed to rebut relevant
evidence the State may introduce. Here, however, in keeping with the
practice approved by Virginia's highest court, see supra, at 1-2, and
n. 1, the prosecutor expressly delineated the scope and character of the
evidence he would introduce with respect to the Sorrell murders:
nothing other than statements Gray himself allegedly made, see supra,
at 3. Gray's lawyers reasonably relied on the prosecutor's
"statements only" assurance by forgoing inquiry into the details of the
Sorrell crimes. Resource-consuming investigation, they responsibly
determined, was unnecessary to cast doubt on the veracity of inmate
"snitch" testimony, the only evidence the prosecutor initially said he
would offer.

Gray's lawyers were undeniably caught short by the prosecutor's
startling announcement, the night before the penalty phase was to
begin, that he would in effect put on a "mini-trial" of the Sorrell
murders. At that point, Gray's lawyers could not possibly conduct
the investigation and preparation necessary to counter the prosecutor's
newly announced evidence. Thus, at the penalty trial, defense counsel
were reduced nearly to the role of spectators. Lacking proof, later
uncovered, that "strongly suggested" Timothy Sorrell, not Gray, was
the actual killer, App. 350-351, Gray's lawyers could mount only a
feeble cross-examination of Detective Slezak; counsel simply inquired
of the detective whether highly-publicized crimes could prompt
"copycat" crimes, see id., at 37-40. Gray's lawyers had no questions
at all for Doctor Presswalla, the medical examiner who testified about
the Sorrell autopsies. Id., at 47.11

In sum, the record shows, beyond genuine debate, that Gray was not
afforded a "meaningful" opportunity to defend against the additional
Sorrell murders evidence. The fatal infection present in Gardner
infects this case as well: defense counsel were effectively deprived of
an opportunity to challenge the "accuracy or materiality" of
information relied on in imposing the death sentence. Gardner, 430
U. S., at 356. Unexposed to adversary testing, the Sorrell murders
evidence "carrie[d] no assurance of reliability." App. 351. The
"debate between adversaries," valued in our system of justice for its
contribution "to the truth-seeking function of trials," Gardner, 430 U.
S., at 360, was precluded here by the prosecutor's eve-of-sentencing
shift, and the trial court's tolerance of it. To hold otherwise "would
simply be to ignore actualities."  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45,
58 (1932).12

*    *    *

For the reasons stated, I conclude that the District Court's decision
vacating Gray's death sentence did not rest on a "new rule" of
constitutional law. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals, and respectfully dissent from this Court's decision.


ENDNOTES FOR OPINION

1 The prosecutor introduced this testimony as evidence of petitioner's
future dangerousness. The prosecutor also introduced into evidence
petitioner's criminal record, which included 13 felony convictions, at
least 9 of which were for crimes of violence, including armed robbery
and malicious wounding. Petitioner's record revealed that he had
locked a restaurant's  employees in a food freezer while robbing the
restaurant, and threatened the lives of two persons other than
McClelland. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 313, 353, 356 S. E.
2d 157, 179, cert. denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).

2 The other five subclaims are not relevant to our review.

3 When petitioner did object later, at the start of the penalty phase, to
the admission of all the Sorrell murder evidence, counsel conceded
that he would have been prepared to refute such evidence if it had
consisted only of testimony by Tucker or petitioner's fellow inmates
that petitioner had admitted to killing the Sorrells. See 18 Record 722,
780.

4 The District Court described petitioners' counsel as having made a
"plea for additional time to prepare."  App. 343. The Court of
Appeals found this plea insufficient to have legal effect in court: "If the
defense felt unprepared to undertake effective cross-examination, one
would think a formal motion for continuance would have been
forthcoming, but none was ever made; counsel moved only that the
evidence be excluded."  Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA4
1995). We agree with the Court of Appeals.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE GINSBURG DISSENT

1 This request was made pursuant to Peterson v. Commonwealth, 225
Va. 289, 302 S. E. 2d 520 (1983), which instructed that, under
Virginia law, the "preferred practice" in capital trials "is to make
known to [the defendant] before trial the evidence that is to be adduced
at the penalty stage if he is found guilty."  Id., at 298, 302 S. E. 2d, at
526.

2 That Gray had not been convicted of killing the Sorrells would not,
under Virginia law, bar admission of evidence relating to those crimes
during the penalty phase of his trial. One of Virginia's two
aggravating circumstances requires the jury to determine whether
"there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of
violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society."
Va. Code Ann. Section 19.2-264.2 (1995). The Virginia Supreme
Court has held that "evidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct .
. . may be used in the penalty phase to prove the defendant's
propensity to commit criminal acts of violence in the future."  Watkins
v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 488, 331 S. E. 2d 422, 436 (1985).

3 As the District Court suggested, in one respect this version of events
is implausible. The McClelland murder occurred in May 1985, some
six months after the Sorrells had been killed. No newspaper from
May 1985 containing a photograph of Lisa Sorrell was ever
introduced into evidence. See App. 343.

4 The District Court noted, in this regard, that an investigator engaged
by Gray's federal habeas counsel had run a driving test indicating that
"Coleman Gray could not have performed the Sorrell murders on his
wife's dinner hour, as the prosecutor speculated."  Id., at 345, n. 5.

5 Police designated Mr. Sorrell as the sole suspect on evidence they
sent to crime labs for analysis. Id., at 344.

6 Asked to describe what about Mr. Sorrell's demeanor made him
suspicious, Slezak testified: "I don't know how to describe it other
than to say that it was not what you would expect to find in a situation
like that. He just seemed defensive."  Id., at 186.

7 By contrast, police never established Gray's supposed motive for
killing the Sorrells. Lisa was found with her jewelry (a necklace and
gold earrings) undisturbed, as well as cash and a postal money order
for $280.00, id., at 316, suggesting that robbery was not the
perpetrator's motive, id., at 317.

8 Despite defense counsel's pretrial request for all exculpatory
evidence pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), the
prosecutor never disclosed the evidence incriminating Timothy
Sorrell. Gray presented a Brady claim in his federal habeas petition,
but the District Court noted that the claim had not been raised in state
court, and therefore held it procedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.

9 After Gray's trial, the local prosecutor reportedly stated in an
affidavit that Mr. Sorrell was no longer a suspect. See 2 id., at 927
(news report in The Virginian-Pilot, Jan. 7, 1986, p. D1).

10 Cf. In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 33 (1967) (notice to parents the night
before a juvenile delinquency hearing was constitutionally inadequate;
due process requires that notice "be given sufficiently in advance of
scheduled court proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare
will be afforded"); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 58 (1932)
(defense counsel appointed the morning of trial could not satisfy the
constitutional requirement because counsel lacked opportunity to
investigate the case; Court observed that "[t]o decide otherwise, would
simply be to ignore actualities").

11 The Court attaches weight to the failure of Gray's lawyers to ask
explicitly for deferral of the penalty phase. See ante, at 14, 16. It is
uncontested that defense counsel made no formal motion for a
continuance. But as the District Court described the morning-of-trial
episode, counsel "plea[ded] for additional time to prepare."  App.
343. And as earlier noted, see supra, at 4-5, counsel was explicit
about the dilemma confronting the defense: "We are not prepared to
try the Sorrell murder today."  4 J. A. 2065. The Court's suggestion
that "this plea [was] insufficient to have legal effect in court," ante, at
14, n. 4, is puzzling. Neither the Court, the Fourth Circuit, nor the
Commonwealth has cited any Virginia authority for this proposition.
Cf. Smith v. Estelle, 602 F. 2d 694, 701, n. 8 (CA5 1979) ("the state
points us to no rule of Texas law saying that moving for a continuance
is the only way to object to surprise"), aff'd on other grounds, 451 U.
S. 454 (1981). Given the potency of the evidence in question, it is
difficult to comprehend the Court's speculation that defense counsel,
for "tactical" reasons, may have wanted only exclusion and not more
time. Compare ante, at 16, with Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (Counsel for
Petitioner urged that if a trial judge is asked, "please stop this from
happening . . . , it violates my [client's] right to a fair trial," the
existence of that right should not turn on whether counsel next says,
"please exclude this evidence, as opposed to please give me more
time").

12 Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545 (1977), featured by the
Court, see ante, at 15, 16-17, hardly controls this case. There, the
State's witness, and not the prosecutor, misled defense counsel. 429
U. S., at 560. Furthermore, Weatherford did not involve the penalty
phase of a capital trial, a stage at which reliability concerns are most
vital. Finally, the defendant in Weatherford did not object at trial to
the surprise witness, and did not later show how he was prejudiced by
the surprise. Id., at 561.

<P>The Supreme Court's June 24, 1996, decision upholding the authority of federal judges to reduce large jury awards in certain types of civil trials. The justices held that the Seventh Amendment does not prevent federal judges from reviewing the appropriateness of a jury's award.

GASPERINI

v.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 95-719.  Argued April 16, 1996-Decided June 24, 1996

Under the law of New York, appellate courts are empowered to review the size of
jury verdicts and to order new trials when the jury's award "deviates materially
from what would be reasonable compensation."  N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules
(CPLR) Section 5501(c). Under the Seventh Amendment, which governs
proceedings in federal court, but not in state court, "the right of trial by jury shall
be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any
Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."  The
compatibility of these provisions, in an action based on New York law but tried
in federal court by reason of the parties' diverse citizenship, is the issue the Court
confronts in this case.

Petitioner Gasperini, a journalist and occasional photographer, loaned 300
original slide transparencies to respondent Center for Humanities, Inc. When the
Center lost the transparencies, Gasperini commenced suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, invoking the court's
diversity jurisdiction. The Center conceded liability. After a trial on damages, a
jury awarded Gasperini $1,500 per transparency, the asserted ``industry standard''
of compensation for a lost transparency. Contending, inter alia, that the verdict
was excessive, the Center moved for a new trial. The District Court, without
comment, denied the motion.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, observing that New York law
governed the controversy, endeavored to apply CPLR Section 5501(c) to evaluate
the Center's contention that the verdict was excessive. Guided by New York
Appellate Division decisions reviewing damage awards for lost transparencies, the
Second Circuit held that the $450,000 verdict "materially deviates from what is
reasonable compensation."  The court vacated the judgment entered on the jury
verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.


Held:  New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness or
inadequacy can be given effect, without detriment to the Seventh Amendment, if
the review standard set out in CPLR Section 5501(c) is applied by the federal trial
court judge, with appellate control of the trial court's ruling confined to "abuse of
discretion."  Pp. 5-23.

(a) To heighten the judicial check on the size of jury awards, New York codified
the ``deviates materially'' standard of review, replacing the judge-made ``shock the
conscience'' formulation previously used in New York courts. In design and
operation, Section 5501(c) influences outcomes by tightening the range of
tolerable awards. Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate
appellate courts, Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard, as construed by
New York's courts, instructs state trial judges as well. Pp. 5-9.

(b) In cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governs the claims for
relief, the Court must determine whether New York law also supplies the test for
federal-court review of the size of the verdict. Federal diversity jurisdiction
provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it
does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. Under the doctrine of
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, federal courts sitting in diversity apply
state substantive law and federal procedural law. Classification of a law as
"substantive" or "procedural" for Erie purposes is sometimes a challenging
endeavor. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, an early interpretation of
Erie, propounded an "outcome-determination" test: "[D]oes it significantly affect
the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would
be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State
court?"  Id., at 109. A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust,
explained that the "outcome-determination" test must not be applied mechanically
to sweep in all manner of variations; instead, its application must be guided by
"the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance
of inequitable administration of the laws."  Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460,
468.

Informed by these decisions, the Court concludes that, although Section 5501(c)
contains a procedural instruction assigning decisionmaking authority to the New
York Appellate Division, the State's objective is manifestly substantive. More
rigorous comparative evaluations attend application of Section 5501(c)'s "deviates
materially" standard than the common law "shock the conscience" test. If federal
courts ignore the change in the New York standard and persist in applying the
"shock the conscience" test to damage awards on claims governed by New York
law, "`substantial' variations between state and federal [money judgments]" may
be expected. See id., at 467-468. The Court therefore agrees with the Second
Circuit that New York's check on excessive damages warrants application in
federal court, for Erie's doctrine precludes a recovery in federal court significantly
larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court. Pp. 9-14.

(c) Nonetheless, when the Second Circuit used Section 5501(c) as the standard for
federal appellate review, it did not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the
federal court] system."  Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.
S. 525, 537. The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal
court, but not in state court, bears not only on the allocation of trial functions
between judge and jury, the issue in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of
authority to review verdicts, the issue of concern here. In keeping with the
historic understanding, the Seventh Amendment's re-examination clause does not
inhibit the authority of trial judges to grant new trials "for any of the reasons for
which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of
the United States."  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). In contrast, appellate review of a
federal trial court's denial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a
relatively late, and less secure, development. Such review, once deemed
inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment's re-examination clause, has not been
expressly approved by this Court before today. See, e.g., Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25.
Circuit decisions unanimously recognize, however, that appellate review, confined
to abuse of discretion, is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control
necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice. The Court now
approves this line of decisions. Pp. 14-20.

(d) In this case, the principal state and federal interests can be accommodated.
New York's dominant interest in having its substantive law guide the allowable
damages arising out of a state-law claim for relief can be respected, without
disrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that the federal district court is
capable of applying the State's "deviates materially" standard. The Court recalls,
in this regard, that the "deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be
applied in trial as well as appellate courts in New York. Within the federal
system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge
in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for
application of Section 5501(c)'s check. District court applications of the
"deviates materially" standard would be subject to appellate review under the
standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on
appeal: abuse of discretion. Pp. 21-23.

(e) It does not appear that the District Court checked the jury's verdict against the
relevant New York decisions. Accordingly, the Court vacates the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and instructs that court to remand the case to the District Court
so that the trial judge, revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test the
jury's verdict against CLPR Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. P.
23. 66 F. 3d 427, vacated and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-719


WILLIAM GASPERINI, PETITIONER

v.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

Under the law of New York, appellate courts are empowered to review the size of
jury verdicts and to order new trials when the jury's award "deviates materially
from what would be reasonable compensation."  N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules
(CPLR) Section 5501(c) (McKinney 1995). Under the Seventh Amendment,
which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in state court, "the right of
trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-
examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law."  U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. The compatibility of these provisions,
in an action based on New York law but tried in federal court by reason of the
parties' diverse citizenship, is the issue we confront in this case. We hold that
New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness or inadequacy
can be given effect, without detriment to the Seventh Amendment, if the review
standard set out in CPLR Section 5501(c) is applied by the federal trial court
judge, with appellate control of the trial court's ruling limited to review for
"abuse of discretion."


Petitioner William Gasperini, a journalist for CBS News and the Christian
Science Monitor, began reporting on events in Central America in 1984. He
earned his living primarily in radio and print media and only occasionally sold his
photographic work. During the course of his seven-year stint in Central America,
Gasperini took over 5,000 slide transparencies, depicting active war zones,
political leaders, and scenes from daily life. In 1990, Gasperini agreed to supply
his original color transparencies to The Center for Humanities, Inc. (Center) for
use in an educational videotape, Conflict in Central America. Gasperini selected
300 of his slides for the Center; its videotape included 110 of them. The Center
agreed to return the original transparencies, but upon the completion of the
project, it could not find them.

Gasperini commenced suit in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28
U. S. C. Section 1332.1   He alleged several state-law claims for relief, including
breach of contract, conversion, and negligence. See App. 5-6. The Center
conceded liability for the lost transparencies and the issue of damages was tried
before a jury.

At trial, Gasperini's expert witness testified that the "industry standard" within the
photographic publishing community valued a lost transparency at $1,500. See
id., at 227. This industry standard, the expert explained, represented the average
license fee a commercial photograph could earn over the full course of the
photographer's copyright, i.e., in Gasperini's case, his lifetime plus 50 years.
See id., at 228; see also 17 U. S. C. Section 302(a). Gasperini estimated that his
earnings from photography totaled just over $10,000 for the period from 1984
through 1993. He also testified that he intended to produce a book containing his
best photographs from Central America. See App. 175.

After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Gasperini $450,000 in compensatory
damages. This sum, the jury foreperson announced, "is [$]1500 each, for 300
slides." Id., at 313. Moving for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
59, the Center attacked the verdict on various grounds, including excessiveness.
Without comment, the District Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 12a.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the judgment entered on the
jury's verdict. 66 F. 3d 427 (1995). Mindful that New York law governed the
controversy, the Court of Appeals endeavored to apply CPLR Section 5501(c),
which instructs that, when a jury returns an itemized verdict, as the jury did in
this case, the New York Appellate Division "shall determine that an award is
excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable
compensation."  The Second Circuit's application of Section 5501(c) as a check
on the size of the jury's verdict followed Circuit precedent elaborated two weeks
earlier in Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, superseded,
72 F. 3d 1003 (1995). Surveying Appellate Division decisions that reviewed
damage awards for lost transparencies, the Second Circuit concluded that
testimony on industry standard alone was insufficient to justify a verdict; prime
among other factors warranting consideration were the uniqueness of the slides'
subject matter and the photographer's earning level.2

Guided by Appellate Division rulings, the Second Circuit held that the $450,000
verdict "materially deviates from what is reasonable compensation."  66 F. 3d, at
431. Some of Gasperini's transparencies, the Second Circuit recognized, were
unique, notably those capturing combat situations in which Gasperini was the
only photographer present. Id., at 429. But others "depicted either generic scenes
or events at which other professional photojournalists were present."  Id., at 431.
No more than 50 slides merited a $1,500 award, the court concluded, after
"[g]iving Gasperini every benefit of the doubt." Ibid. Absent evidence showing
significant earnings from photographic endeavors or concrete plans to publish a
book, the court further determined, any damage award above $100 each for the
remaining slides would be excessive. Remittiturs "presen[t] difficult problems for
appellate courts," the Second Circuit acknowledged, for court of appeals judges
review the evidence from "a cold paper record."  Ibid. Nevertheless, the Second
Circuit set aside the $450,000 verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini
agreed to an award of $100,000.

This case presents an important question regarding the standard a federal court uses
to measure the alleged excessiveness of a jury's verdict in an action for damages
based on state law. We therefore granted certiorari. 516 U. S. __ (1996).


Before 1986, state and federal courts in New York generally invoked the same
judge-made formulation in responding to excessiveness attacks on jury verdicts:
courts would not disturb an award unless the amount was so exorbitant that it
"shocked the conscience of the court." See Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1012-1013
(collecting cases). As described by the Second Circuit:

"The standard for determining excessiveness and the appropriateness of remittitur
in New York is somewhat ambiguous. Prior to 1986, New York law employed
the same standard as the federal courts, see Matthews v. CTI Container Transport
Int'l Inc., 871 F. 2d 270, 278 (2d Cir. 1989), which authorized remittitur only if
the jury's verdict was so excessive that it `shocked the conscience of the court.'"
Id., at 1012.

See also D. Siegel, Practice Commentaries C5501:10, reprinted in 7B
McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 25 (1995) ("conventional
standard for altering the verdict was that its sum was so great or so small that it
`shocked the conscience' of the court").

In both state and federal courts, trial judges made the excessiveness assessment in
the first instance, and appellate judges ordinarily deferred to the trial court's
judgment. See, e.g., McAllister v. Adam Packing Corp., 66 App. Div. 2d 975,
976, 412 N. Y. S. 2d 50, 52 (3d Dept. 1978) ("The trial court's determination as
to the adequacy of the jury verdict will only be disturbed by an appellate court
where it can be said that the trial court's exercise of discretion was not reasonably
grounded."); Martell v. Boardwalk Enterprises, Inc., 748 F. 2d 740, 750 (CA2
1984) ("The trial court's refusal to set aside or reduce a jury award will be
overturned only for abuse of discretion.").

In 1986, as part of a series of tort reform measures,3 New York codified a standard
for judicial review of the size of jury awards. Placed in CPLR Section 5501(c),
the prescription reads:

"In reviewing a money judgment . . . in which it is contended that the award is
excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted unless a
stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall determine
that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from what would
be reasonable compensation."4

As stated in Legislative Findings and Declarations accompanying New York's
adoption of the "deviates materially" formulation, the lawmakers found the "shock
the conscience" test an insufficient check on damage awards; the legislature
therefore installed a standard "invit[ing] more careful appellate scrutiny."  Ch.
266, 1986 N. Y. Laws 470 (McKinney). At the same time, the legislature
instructed the Appellate Division, in amended Section 5522, to state the reasons
for the court's rulings on the size of verdicts, and the factors the court considered
in complying with Section 5501(c).5   In his signing statement, then-Governor
Mario Cuomo emphasized that the CPLR amendments were meant to rachet up
the review standard: "This will assure greater scrutiny of the amount of verdicts
and promote greater stability in the tort system and greater fairness for similarly
situated defendants throughout the State."  Memorandum on Approving L. 1986,
Ch. 682, 1986 N. Y. Laws, at 3184; see also Newman & Ahmuty, Appellate
Review of Punitive Damage Awards, in Insurance, Excess, and Reinsurance
Coverage Disputes 1990, p. 409 (B. Ostrager & T. Newman eds. 1990) (review
standard prescribed in Section 5501(c) "was intended to . . . encourage Appellate
Division modification of excessive awards").

New York state-court opinions confirm that Section 5501(c)'s "deviates
materially" standard calls for closer surveillance than "shock the conscience"
oversight. See, e.g., O'Connor v. Graziosi, 131 App. Div. 2d 553, 554, 516 N.
Y. S. 2d 276, 277 (2d Dept. 1987) ("apparent intent" of 1986 legislation was "to
facilitate appellate changes in verdicts"); Harvey v. Mazal American Partners, 79
N. Y. 2d 218, 225, 590 N. E. 2d 224, 228 (1992) (instructing Appellate Division
to use, in setting remittitur, only the "deviates materially" standard, and not the
"shock the conscience" test); see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1013 ("Material
deviation from reasonableness is less than that deviation required to find an award
so excessive as to `shock the conscience.'"); 7 J. Weinstein, H. Korn, & A.
Miller, New York Civil Practice, Paragraph 5501.21, p. 55-64 (1995) ("Under
[Section 5501(c)'s] new standard, the reviewing court is given greater power to
review the size of a jury award than had heretofore been afforded . . . .").

Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts,
Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard, as construed by New York's
courts, instructs state trial judges as well. See, e.g., Inya v. Ide Hyundai, Inc.,
209 App. Div. 2d 1015, 1015, 619 N. Y. S. 2d 440, 440 (4th Dept. 1994) (error
for trial court to apply "shock the conscience" test to motion to set aside
damages; proper standard is whether award "materially deviates from what would
be reasonable compensation"); Cochetti v. Gralow, 192 App. Div. 2d 974, 975,
597 N. Y. S. 2d 234, 235 (3d Dept. 1993) ("settled law" that trial courts conduct
"materially deviates" inquiry); Shurgan v. Tedesco, 179 App. Div. 2d 805, 806,
578 N. Y. S. 2d 658, 659 (2d Dept. 1992) (approving trial court's application of
"materially deviates" standard); see also Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 901 F.
Supp. 166, 169 (SDNY 1995) (CPLR 5501(c)'s "materially deviates" standard "is
pretty well established as applicable to [state] trial and appellate courts.").
Application of Section 5501(c) at the trial level is key to this case.

To determine whether an award "deviates materially from what would be
reasonable compensation," New York state courts look to awards approved in
similar cases. See, e.g., Leon v. J & M Peppe Realty Corp., 190 App. Div. 2d
400, 416, 596 N. Y. S. 2d 380, 389 (1st Dept. 1993) ("These awards . . . are not
out of line with recent awards sustained by appellate courts."); Johnston v. Joyce,
192 App. Div. 2d 1124, 1125, 596 N. Y. S. 2d 625, 626 (4th Dept. 1993)
(reducing award to maximum amount previously allowed for similar type of
harm). Under New York's former "shock the conscience" test, courts also referred
to analogous cases. See, e.g., Senko v. Fonda, 53 App. Div. 2d 638, 639, 384
N. Y. S. 2d 849, 851 (2d Dept. 1976). The "deviates materially" standard,
however, in design and operation, influences outcomes by tightening the range of
tolerable awards. See, e.g., Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1013, and n. 10, 1014-1015,
and n. 14.


In cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governs the claims for relief,
does New York law also supply the test for federal court review of the size of the
verdict? The Center answers yes. The "deviates materially" standard, it argues, is
a substantive standard that must be applied by federal appellate courts in diversity
cases. The Second Circuit agreed. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F.
3d, at 1011 ("[CPLR Section 5501(c)] is the substantive rule provided by New
York law."). Gasperini, emphasizing that Section 5501(c) trains on the New
York Appellate Division, characterizes the provision as procedural, an allocation
of decisionmaking authority regarding damages, not a hard cap on the amount
recoverable. Correctly comprehended, Gasperini urges, Section 5501(c)'s direction
to the Appellate Division cannot be given effect by federal appellate courts
without violating the Seventh Amendment's re-examination clause.

As the parties' arguments suggest, CPLR Section 5501(c), appraised under Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), and decisions in Erie's path, is both
"substantive" and "procedural": "substantive" in that Section 5501(c)'s "deviates
materially" standard controls how much a plaintiff can be awarded; "procedural" in
that Section 5501(c) assigns decisionmaking authority to New York's Appellate
Division. Parallel application of Section 5501(c) at the federal appellate level
would be out of sync with the federal system's division of trial and appellate court
functions, an allocation weighted by the Seventh Amendment. The dispositive
question, therefore, is whether federal courts can give effect to the substantive
thrust of Section 5501(c) without untoward alteration of the federal scheme for the
trial and decision of civil cases.


Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of
state-created rights, but it does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive
law. As Erie read the Rules of Decision Act:6  "Except in matters governed by
the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any
case is the law of the State."  304 U. S., at 78. Under the Erie doctrine, federal
courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.

Classification of a law as "substantive" or "procedural" for Erie purposes is
sometimes a challenging endeavor.7   Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99
(1945), an early interpretation of Erie, propounded an "outcome-determination"
test: "[D]oes it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to
disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same
claim by the same parties in a State court?"  326 U. S., at 109. Ordering
application of a state statute of limitations to an equity proceeding in federal
court, the Court said in Guaranty Trust: "[W]here a federal court is exercising
jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the
outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so
far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a
State court."  Ibid; see also Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337
U. S. 530, 533 (1949) (when local law that creates the cause of action qualifies it,
"federal court must follow suit," for "a different measure of the cause of action in
one court than in the other [would transgress] the principle of Erie"). A later
pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that the "outcome-
determination" test must not be applied mechanically to sweep in all manner of
variations; instead, its application must be guided by "the twin aims of the Erie
rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable
administration of the laws."  Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 468 (1965).

Informed by these decisions, we address the question whether New York's
"deviates materially" standard, codified in CPLR Section 5501(c), is outcome-
affective in this sense: Would "application of the [standard] . . . have so important
an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure to [apply] it
would [unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or] be likely to
cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court"? Id., at 468, n. 9.8

We start from a point the parties do not debate. Gasperini acknowledges that a
statutory cap on damages would supply substantive law for Erie purposes. See
Reply Brief for Petitioner 2 ("[T]he state as a matter of its substantive law may,
among other things, eliminate the availability of damages for a particular claim
entirely, limit the factors a jury may consider in determining damages, or place an
absolute cap on the amount of damages available, and such substantive law would
be applicable in a federal court sitting in diversity."); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-
5, 25; Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1011.9   Although CPLR Section 5501(c) is less
readily classified, it was designed to provide an analogous control.

New York's Legislature codified in Section 5501(c) a new standard, one that
requires closer court review than the common law "shock the conscience" test.
See supra, at 6-7. More rigorous comparative evaluations attend application of
Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. See supra, at 7-9. To foster
predictability, the legislature required the reviewing court, when overturning a
verdict under Section 5501(c), to state its reasons, including the factors it
considered relevant. See CPLR Section 5522(b); supra, at 7. We think it a fair
conclusion that CPLR Section 5501(c) differs from a statutory cap principally "in
that the maximum amount recoverable is not set by statute, but rather is
determined by case law."  Brief for City of New York as Amicus Curiae 11. In
sum, Section 5501(c) contains a procedural instruction, see supra, at 9, but the
State's objective is manifestly substantive. Cf. S. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee
Metropolitan Sewerage Dist., 60 F. 3d 305, 310 (CA7 1995).

It thus appears that if federal courts ignore the change in the New York standard
and persist in applying the "shock the conscience" test to damage awards on
claims governed by New York law,10  "`substantial' variations between state and
federal [money judgments]" may be expected. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at 467-
468.11   We therefore agree with the Second Circuit that New York's check on
excessive damages implicates what we have called Erie's "twin aims."  See supra,
at 11.12   Just as the Erie principle precludes a federal court from giving a state-
created claim "longer life . . . than [the claim] would have had in the state court,"
Ragan, 337 U. S., at 533-534, so Erie precludes a recovery in federal court
significantly larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court.


CPLR Section 5501(c), as earlier noted, see supra, at 8, 9, is phrased as a
direction to the New York Appellate Division. Acting essentially as a surrogate
for a New York appellate forum, the Court of Appeals reviewed Gasperini's award
to determine if it "deviate[d] materially" from damage awards the Appellate
Division permitted in similar circumstances. The Court of Appeals performed
this task without benefit of an opinion from the District Court, which had denied
"without comment" the Center's Rule 59 motion. 66 F. 3d, at 428.
Concentrating on the authority Section 5501(c) gives to the Appellate Division,
Gasperini urges that the provision shifts fact-finding responsibility from the jury
and the trial judge to the appellate court. Assigning such responsibility to an
appellate court, he maintains, is incompatible with the Seventh Amendment's re-
examination clause, and therefore, Gasperini concludes, Section 5501(c) cannot be
given effect in federal court. Brief for Petitioner 19-20. Although we reach a
different conclusion than Gasperini, we agree that the Second Circuit did not
attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federal-court] system," Byrd v. Blue
Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), when it used
Section 5501(c) as "the standard for [federal] appellate review," Consorti, 72 F.
3d, at 1013; see also 66 F. 3d, at 430.

That "essential characteristic" was described in Byrd, a diversity suit for
negligence in which a pivotal issue of fact would have been tried by a judge were
the case in state court. The Byrd Court held that, despite the state practice,13  the
plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial in federal court. In so ruling, the Court said
that the Guaranty Trust "outcome-determination" test was an insufficient guide in
cases presenting countervailing federal interests. See Byrd, 356 U. S., at 537.
The Court described the countervailing federal interests present in Byrd this way:

"The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants
who properly invoke its jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that system is
the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions
between judge and jury and, under the influence--if not the command--of the
Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the
jury." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in
state court,14  bears not only on the allocation of trial functions between judge
and jury, the issue in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to review
verdicts, the issue of concern here. The Amendment reads:

"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury,
shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according
to the rules of the common law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.

Byrd involved the first clause of the Amendment, the "trial by jury" clause. This
case involves the second, the "re-examination" clause. In keeping with the
historic understanding,15  the re-examination clause does not inhibit the authority
of trial judges to grant new trials "for any of the reasons for which new trials have
heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States."  Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). That authority is large. See 6A Moore's Federal Practice
Paragraph 59.05[2], pp. 59-44 to 59-46 (2d ed. 1996) ("The power of the English
common law trial courts to grant a new trial for a variety of reasons with a view
to the attainment of justice was well established prior to the establishment of our
Government."); see also Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Yeatts, 122 F. 2d 350,
353 (CA4 1941) ("The exercise of [the trial court's power to set aside the jury's
verdict and grant a new trial] is not in derogation of the right of trial by jury but
is one of the historic safeguards of that right."); Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760,
761-762 (Case No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822) (Story, J.) ("[I]f it should clearly
appear that the jury have committed a gross error, or have acted from improper
motives, or have given damages excessive in relation to the person or the injury,
it is as much the duty of the court to interfere, to prevent the wrong, as in any
other case."). "The trial judge in the federal system," we have reaffirmed, "has . .
. discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict appears to [the judge] to be against
the weight of the evidence."  Byrd, 356 U. S., at 540. This discretion includes
overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial without
qualification, or conditioned on the verdict winner's refusal to agree to a reduction
(remittitur). See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486-487 (1935) (recognizing
that remittitur withstands Seventh Amendment attack, but rejecting additur as
unconstitutional).16

In contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to set
aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure, development.
Such review was once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment's re-
examination clause. See, e.g., Lincoln v. Power, 151 U. S. 436, 437-438
(1894); Williamson v. Osenton, 220 F. 653, 655 (CA4 1915); see also 6A
Moore's Federal Practice Paragraph 59.08[6], at 59-167 (collecting cases). We
subsequently recognized that, even in cases in which the Erie doctrine was not in
play--cases arising wholly under federal law--the question was not settled; we
twice granted certiorari to decide the unsettled issue, but ultimately resolved the
cases on other grounds. See Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., 393 U. S. 156,
158 (1968); Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S. 77, 77 (1955).17

Before today, we have not "expressly [held] that the Seventh Amendment allows
appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to set aside an award as
excessive."  Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492
U. S. 257, 279, n. 25 (1989). But in successive reminders that the question was
worthy of this Court's attention, we noted, without disapproval, that courts of
appeals engage in review of district court excessiveness determinations, applying
"abuse of discretion" as their standard. See Grunenthal, 393 U. S., at 159. We
noted the Circuit decisions in point, id., at 157, n. 3, and, in Browning-Ferris, we
again referred to appellate court abuse-of-discretion review:

"[T]he role of the district court is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within
the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards
developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered. The
court of appeals should then review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard." 492 U. S., at 279.18

As the Second Circuit explained, appellate review for abuse of discretion is
reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the
fair administration of justice: "We must give the benefit of every doubt to the
judgment of the trial judge; but surely there must be an upper limit, and whether
that has been surpassed is not a question of fact with respect to which reasonable
men may differ, but a question of law." Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289 F.
2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961) (quoted in Grunenthal, 393 U. S., at 159). All other
Circuits agree. See, e.g., Holmes v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., 18 F. 3d
1393, 1396 (CA7 1994); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice
and Procedure Section 2820, p. 209 (2d ed. 1995) ("[E]very circuit has said that
there are circumstances in which it can reverse the denial of a new trial if the size
of the verdict seems to be too far out of line."); 6A Moore's Federal Practice
Paragraph 59.08[6], at 59-177 to 59-185 (same).19 We now approve this line of
decisions, and thus make explicit what Justice Stewart thought implicit in our
Grunenthal disposition: "[N]othing in the Seventh Amendment... precludes
appellate review of the trial judge's denial of a motion to set aside [a jury verdict]
as excessive."  393 U. S., at 164 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (internal quotation
marks and footnote omitted).20


In Byrd, the Court faced a one-or-the-other choice: trial by judge as in state court,
or trial by jury according to the federal practice.21   In the case before us, a choice
of that order is not required, for the principal state and federal interests can be
accommodated. The Second Circuit correctly recognized that when New York
substantive law governs a claim for relief, New York law and decisions guide the
allowable damages. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1011.
But that court did not take into account the characteristic of the federal-court
system that caused us to reaffirm: "The proper role of the trial and appellate courts
in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is... a matter of federal
law."  Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S. 648, 649 (1977) (per curiam);
see also Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 279 ("[T]he role of the district court is to
determine whether the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law . . . .
The court of appeals should then review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard.").

New York's dominant interest can be respected, without disrupting the federal
system, once it is recognized that the federal district court is capable of
performing the checking function, i.e., that court can apply the State's "deviates
materially" standard in line with New York case law evolving under CPLR
Section 5501(c).22   We recall, in this regard, that the "deviates materially"
standard serves as the guide to be applied in trial as well as appellate courts in
New York. See supra, at 8.

Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment
constraints to lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary
responsibility for application of Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" check.
Trial judges have the "unique opportunity to consider the evidence in the living
courtroom context," Taylor v. Washington Terminal Co., 409 F. 2d 145, 148
(CADC 1969), while appellate judges see only the "cold paper record," 66 F. 3d,
at 431.

District court applications of the "deviates materially" standard would be subject
to appellate review under the standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy
or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. See 11 Wright &
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Section 2820, at 212-214, and n. 24
(collecting cases); see 6A Moore's Federal Practice Paragraph 59.08[6], at 59-177
to 59-185 (same). In light of Erie's doctrine, the federal appeals court must be
guided by the damage-control standard state law supplies,23  but as the Second
Circuit itself has said: "If we reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion.
. . . The very nature of the problem counsels restraint. . . . We must give the
benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge."  Dagnello, 289 F. 2d,
at 806.


It does not appear that the District Court checked the jury's verdict against the
relevant New York decisions demanding more than "industry standard" testimony
to support an award of the size the jury returned in this case. As the Court of
Appeals recognized, see 66 F. 3d, at 429, the uniqueness of the photographs and
the plaintiff's earnings as photographer--past and reasonably projected--are factors
relevant to appraisal of the award. See, e.g., Blackman v. Michael Friedman
Publishing Group, Inc., 201 App. Div. 2d 328, 328, 607 N. Y. S. 2d 43, 44 (1st
Dept. 1994); Nierenberg v. Wursteria, Inc., 189 App. Div. 2d 571, 571-572, 592
N. Y. S. 2d 27, 27-28 (1st Dept. 1993). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and instruct that court to remand the case to the District
Court so that the trial judge, revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may
test the jury's verdict against CLPR Section 5501(c)'s "deviates materially"
standard.

It is so ordered.


SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-719


WILLIAM GASPERINI, PETITIONER

v.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

While I agree with most of the reasoning in the Court's opinion, I disagree with
its disposition of the case. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
I would also reject the suggestion that the Seventh Amendment limits the power
of a federal appellate court sitting in diversity to decide whether a jury's award of
damages exceeds a limit established by state law.


The Court correctly explains why the 1986 enactment of Section 5501(c) of the
New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (McKinney 1995) changed the
substantive law of the State. A state-law ceiling on allowable damages, whether
fixed by a dollar limit or by a standard that forbids any award that "deviates
materially from what would be reasonable compensation," ibid., is a substantive
rule of decision that federal courts must apply in diversity cases governed by New
York law.

I recognize that state rules of appellate procedure do not necessarily bind federal
appellate courts. The majority persuasively shows, however, that New York has
not merely adopted a new procedure for allocating the decisionmaking function
between trial and appellate courts.

Ante, at 5-9. Instead, New York courts have held that all jury awards, not only
those reviewed on appeal, must conform to the requirement that they not
"deviat[e] materially" from amounts awarded in like cases. Ante, at 8-9. That
New York has chosen to tie its damages ceiling to awards traditionally recovered
in similar cases, rather than to a legislatively determined but inflexible monetary
sum, is none of our concern.

Given the nature of the state-law command, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit correctly concluded in Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 64
F. 3d 781, superseded by 72 F. 3d 1003 (1995), that New York's excessiveness
standard applies in federal court in diversity cases controlled by New York law.
Consorti erred in basing that conclusion in part on the fact that a New York
statute requires that State's appellate division to apply the standard, but it was
nevertheless faithful to the Rules of Decisions Act, as construed in Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), in holding that a state-law limitation on the size
of a judgment could not be ignored.1 Similarly, the Court of Appeals correctly
followed Consorti in this case and considered whether the damages awarded
materially deviated from damages awarded in similar cases. 66 F. 3d 420, 431
(CA2 1995). I endorse both opinions in these respects.

Although the majority agrees with the Court of Appeals that New York law
establishes the size of the damages that may be awarded, it chooses to vacate and
remand. The majority holds that a federal court of appeals should review for
abuse of discretion a district court's decision to deny a motion for new trial based
on a jury's excessive award. As a result, it concludes that the District Court
should be given the opportunity to apply in the first instance the "deviates
materially" standard that New York law imposes. Ante, at 23.

The District Court had its opportunity to consider the propriety of the jury's
award, and it erred. The Court of Appeals has now corrected that error after
"drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of" petitioner. 66 F. 3d, at 431. As
there is no reason to suppose that the Court of Appeals has reached a conclusion
with which the District Court could permissibly disagree on remand, I would not
require the District Court to repeat a task that has already been well-performed by
the reviewing court. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.


Although I have addressed the question presented as if our decision in Erie alone
controlled its outcome, petitioner argues that the second clause of the Seventh
Amendment, which states that "no fact tried by jury, shall be otherwise re-
examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law," U. S. Const., Amdt. VII, bars the procedure followed by the
Court of Appeals. There is no merit to that position.

Early cases do state that the Reexamination Clause prohibits appellate review of
excessive jury awards, but they do not foreclose the practice altogether. See, e.g.,
Southern Railway-Carolina Div. v. Bennett, 233 U. S. 80, 87 (1914) ("It may be
admitted that if it were true that the excess appeared as [a] matter of law; that if,
for instance, the statute fixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it, a question
might arise for this court"); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure Section 2820, pp. 207-209 (2d ed. 1995). Indeed, for the
last 30 years, we have consistently reserved the question whether the constitution
permits such review, ante, at 18-19, and, in the meantime, every Court of
Appeals has agreed that the Seventh Amendment establishes no bar. 11 Wright
& Miller, Section 2820, at 209.

Taking the question to be an open one, I start with certain basic principles. It is
well settled that jury verdicts are not binding on either trial judges or appellate
courts if they are unauthorized by law. A verdict may be insupportable as a
matter of law either because of deficiencies in the evidence or because an award of
damages is larger than permitted by law. If an award is excessive as a matter of
law--in a diversity case if it is larger than applicable state law permits--a trial
judge has a duty to set it aside. A failure to do so is an error of law that the court
of appeals has a duty to correct on appeal.

These principles are sufficiently well established that no Seventh Amendment
issue would arise if an appellate court ordered a new trial because a jury award
exceeded a monetary cap on allowable damages. That New York has chosen to
define its legal limit in less mathematical terms does not require a different
constitutional conclusion.

New York's limitation requires a legal inquiry which cannot be wholly divorced
from the facts, but that quality does not necessarily make the question one for the
factfinder rather than the reviewing court. Three times this Term we have
assigned appellate courts the task of independently reviewing similarly mixed
questions of law and fact. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. ___ (1996)
(slip op., 6-7); Markman v. Westview Instruments, 517 U. S. ___ (1996) (slip
op., at 18-20); Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. ___ (1995) (slip op., at 12-16).
Such appellate review is proper because mixed questions require courts to construe
all record inferences in favor of the factfinder's decision and then to determine
whether, on the facts as found below, the legal standard has been met. See
Ornelas, 517 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Pullman-Standard v. Swint,
456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19 (1982). In following that procedure here, the Court of
Appeals did not reexamine any fact determined by a jury. 66 F. 3d, at 431. It
merely identified that portion of the judgment which constitutes "unlawful
excess."  See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486 (1935).2

Even if review by the Court of Appeals implicates the Reexamination Clause, it
was "according to the rules of the common law."  U. S. Const., Amdt. VII. At
common law, the trial judge sitting nisi prius recommended whether a judicial
panel sitting en banc at Westminster should accept the jury's award. The en banc
court then ruled on the motion for new trial and entered judgment. 11 Wright &
Miller, Section 2819, at 203

Petitioner correctly points out that under this procedure motions for new trial
based on excessiveness were not technically subject to appellate review. Riddell,
New Trial at the Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49, 57 (1916) ("It seems clear that
in criminal as in civil cases, the trial Judge had not the power to grant a new trial,
but that recourse must be had to `the Court above'"), id., at 60. However, because
the nisi prius judge often did not serve on the en banc court, the "court above"
was in essentially the same position as a modern court of appeals. It considered
the legality of the jury's award in light of the trial judge's opinion, but without
any firsthand knowledge of what had transpired below. See Blume, Review of
Facts in Jury Cases--The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 130, 131
(1936).3

Petitioner also contends that at common law the en banc court could only grant a
new trial if the trial judge so recommended. That contention is undermined by
numerous cases in which the "court above" granted new trials without making
any reference to the trial judge's view of the damages. See, e.g., Honda Motor
Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 5-7) (citing cases).4
Moreover, early English cases repeatedly state that the power to order a new trial
when the jury returned an excessive award rested with "the Court," rather than the
judge below,5  and Blackstone identifies excessive damages as an independent
basis on which the "court above" may grant a new trial but makes no mention of
a requirement that the trial judge must so recommend. 3 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *387.

Even when read most favorably to petitioner, therefore, no meaningful distinction
exists between the common-law practice by which the "court above" considered a
new trial motion in the first instance, and the practice challenged here, by which
an appellate court reviews a district court's ruling on a new trial motion. See
Riddell, 26 Yale L. J., at 57. As Justice Stone explained, in a dissenting opinion
joined by Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Cardozo:

"[The Seventh Amendment], intended to endure for unnumbered generations, is
concerned with substance and not with form. There is nothing in its history or
language to suggest that the Amendment had any purpose but to preserve the
essentials of the jury trial as it was known to the common law before the
adoption of the Constitution. For that reason this Court has often refused to
construe it as intended to perpetuate in changeless form the minutiae of trial
practice as it existed in the English courts in 1791. From the beginning, its
language has been regarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the
Amendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury trial in actions at law, serving
to distinguish them from suits in equity and admiralty, see Parsons v. Bedford, 3
Pet. 433, 446, and to safeguard the jury's function from any encroachment which
the common law did not permit.

"Thus interpreted, the Seventh Amendment guarantees that suitors in actions at
law shall have the benefits of trial of issues of fact by a jury, but it does not
prescribe any particular procedure by which these benefits shall be obtained, or
forbid any which does not curtail the function of the jury to decide questions of
fact as it did before the adoption of the Amendment. It does not restrict the
court's control of the jury's verdict, as it had previously been exercised, and it does
not confine the trial judge, in determining what issues are for the jury and what
for the court, to the particular forms of trial practice in vogue in 1791."  Dimick
v. Schiedt, 293 U. S., at 490-491.

Because the Framers of the Seventh Amendment evinced no interest in
subscribing to every procedural nicety of the notoriously complicated English
system, see Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv. L.
Rev. 289, 290 (1966), the common-law practice certainly does not demonstrate
that the Reexamination Clause prohibits federal appellate courts from ensuring
compliance with state-law limits on jury awards.

Nor does early and intricate English history justify the more limited assertion that
federal appellate courts must be limited to a particular, highly deferential standard
of excessiveness review. Common-law courts were hesitant to disturb jury
awards, but less so in cases in which "a reasonably certain measure of damages is
afforded."  1 D. Graham, Law of New Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 452 (2d
ed. 1855); G. Washington, Damages in Contract at Common Law, 47 L. Q. Rev.
345, 363-364 (1931).

Here, New York has prescribed an objective, legal limitation on damages. If an
appellate court may reverse a jury's damages award when its own conscience has
been shocked, 66 F. 3d, at 430, or its sense of justice outraged, Dagnello v. Long
Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 802 (CA2 1961); cf. Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,
512 U. S., at ___ (1994) (citing English cases), it may surely follow a
sovereign's command that it do so when a jury has materially deviated from
awards granted by other juries. If anything, the New York standard, though less
deferential, is more certain.6


For the reasons set forth above, I agree with the majority that the Reexamination
Clause does not bar federal appellate courts from reviewing jury awards for
excessiveness. I confess to some surprise, however, at its conclusion that "`the
influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amendment,'" ante, at 16 (quoting
Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958),
requires federal courts of appeals to review district court applications of state law
excessiveness standards for an "abuse of discretion."  Ante, at 22.

The majority's persuasive demonstration that New York law sets forth a
substantive limitation on the size of jury awards seems to refute the contention
that New York has merely asked appellate courts to reexamine facts. The
majority's analysis would thus seem to undermine the conclusion that the
Reexamination Clause is relevant to this case.

Certainly, our decision in Byrd does not make the Clause relevant. There, we
considered only whether the Seventh Amendment's first clause should influence
our decision to give effect to a state-law rule denying the right to a jury
altogether. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S., at 537.
That holding in no way requires us to consult the Amendment's second clause to
determine the standard of review for a district court's application of state
substantive law.

My disagreement is tempered, however, because the majority carefully avoids
defining too strictly the abuse of discretion standard it announces. To the extent
that the majority relies only on "practical reasons" for its conclusion that the
Court of Appeals should give some weight to the District Court's assessment in
determining whether state substantive law has been properly applied, ante, at 22, I
do not disagree with its analysis.

As a matter of federal court administration, we have recognized in other contexts
the need for according some deference to the lower court's resolution of legal, yet
fact-intensive, questions. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 9-10); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558, n. 1 (1988). Indeed, it
is a familiar, if somewhat circular, maxim that deems an error of law an abuse of
discretion.

In the end, therefore, my disagreement with the label that the majority attaches to
the standard of appellate review should not obscure the far more fundamental point
on which we agree. Whatever influence the Seventh Amendment may be said to
exert, Erie requires federal appellate courts sitting in diversity to apply "the
damage control standard state law supplies."  Ante, at 22.


Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and because I do
not agree that the Seventh Amendment in any respect influences the proper
analysis of the question presented, I respectfully dissent.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-719


WILLIAM GASPERINI, PETITIONER

v.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS
join, dissenting.

Today the Court overrules a longstanding and well-reasoned line of precedent that
has for years prohibited federal appellate courts from reviewing refusals by district
courts to set aside civil jury awards as contrary to the weight of the evidence.
One reason is given for overruling these cases: that the courts of appeals have, for
some time now, decided to ignore them. Such unreasoned capitulation to the
nullification of what was long regarded as a core component of the Bill of Rights-
-the Seventh Amendment's prohibition on appellate reexamination of civil jury
awards--is wrong. It is not for us, much less for the courts of appeals, to decide
that the Seventh Amendment's restriction on federal-court review of jury findings
has outlived its usefulness.

The Court also holds today that a state practice that relates to the division of
duties between state judges and juries must be followed by federal courts in
diversity cases. On this issue, too, our prior cases are directly to the contrary.

As I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.


Because the Court and I disagree as to the character of the review that is before us,
I recount briefly the nature of the New York practice rule at issue. Section
5501(c) of the N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) (McKinney 1995) directs
New York intermediate appellate courts faced with a claim "that the award is
excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted" to determine
whether the jury's award "deviates materially from what would be reasonable
compensation."  In granting respondent a new trial under this standard, the Court
of Appeals necessarily engaged in a two-step process. As it has explained the
application of Section 5501(c), that provision "requires the reviewing court to
determine the range it regards as reasonable, and to determine whether the
particular jury award deviates materially from that range."  Consorti v. Armstrong
World Industries, Inc., 72 F. 3d 1003, 1013 (1995) (amended). The first of these
two steps--the determination as to "reasonable" damages--plainly requires the
reviewing court to reexamine a factual matter tried by the jury: the appropriate
measure of damages, on the evidence presented, under New York law. The second
step--the determination as to the degree of difference between "reasonable"
damages and the damages found by the jury (whether the latter "deviates
materially" from the former)--establishes the degree of judicial tolerance for awards
found not to be reasonable, whether at the trial-level or by the appellate court.
No part of this exercise is appropriate for a federal court of appeals, whether or
not it is sitting in a diversity case.


Granting appellate courts authority to decide whether an award is "excessive or
inadequate" in the manner of CPLR Section 5501(c) may reflect a sound
understanding of the capacities of modern juries and trial judges. That is to say,
the people of the State of New York may well be correct that such a rule
contributes to a more just legal system. But the practice of federal appellate
reexamination of facts found by a jury is precisely what the People of the several
States considered not to be good legal policy in 1791. Indeed, so fearful were
they of such a practice that they constitutionally prohibited it by means of the
Seventh Amendment.

That Amendment was Congress's response to one of the principal objections to
the proposed Constitution raised by the Anti-Federalists during the ratification
debates: its failure to ensure the right to trial by jury in civil actions in federal
court. The desire for an explicit constitutional guarantee against reexamination of
jury findings was explained by Justice Story, sitting as Circuit Justice in 1812,
as having been specifically prompted by Article III's conferral of "appellate
Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact" upon the Supreme Court. "[O]ne of the
most powerful objections urged against [the Constitution]," he recounted, was
that this authority "would enable that court, with or without a new jury, to re-
examine the whole facts, which had been settled by a previous jury."  United
States v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas. 745, 750 (No. 16,750) (CC Mass).1

The second clause of the Amendment responded to that concern by providing that
"[i]n [s]uits at common law... no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-
examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law."  U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. The Reexamination Clause put to rest
"apprehensions" of "new trials by the appellate courts," Wonson, 28 F. Cas., at
750, by adopting, in broad fashion, "the rules of the common law" to govern
federal-court interference with jury determinations.2   The content of that law was
familiar and fixed. See, e.g., ibid. ("[T]he common law here alluded to is not the
common law of any individual state, (for it probably differs in all), but it is the
common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our jurisprudence"); Dimick v.
Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 487 (1935) (Seventh Amendment "in effect adopted the
rules of the common law, in respect of trial by jury, as these rules existed in
1791"). It quite plainly barred reviewing courts from entertaining claims that the
jury's verdict was contrary to the evidence.

At common law, review of judgments was had only on writ of error, limited to
questions of law. See, e.g., Wonson, supra, at 748; 3 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 405 (1768) ("The writ of error only lies
upon matter of law arising upon the face of the proceedings; so that no evidence
is required to substantiate or support it"); 1 W. Holdsworth, History of English
Law 213-214 (7th ed. 1956); cf. Ross v. Rittenhouse, 2 Dall. 160, 163 (Pa.
1792) (McKean, C. J.). That principle was expressly acknowledged by this Court
as governing federal practice in Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433 (1830) (Story, J.).
There, the Court held that no error could be assigned to a district court's refusal to
allow transcription of witness testimony "to serve as a statement of facts in case
of appeal," notwithstanding the right to such transcription under state practices
made applicable to federal courts by Congress. This was so, the Court explained,
because "[t]he whole object" of the transcription was "to present the evidence here
in order to establish the error of the verdict in matters of fact," id., at 445--a mode
of review simply unavailable on writ of error, see id., at 446, 448. The Court
concluded that Congress had not directed federal courts to follow state practices
that would change "the effect or conclusiveness of the verdict of the jury upon the
facts litigated at the trial," id., at 449, because it had "the most serious doubts
whether [that] would not be unconstitutional" under the Seventh Amendment, id.,
at 448.

"This is a prohibition to the courts of the United States to re-examine any facts
tried by a jury in any other manner. The only modes known to the common law
to re-examine such facts, are the granting of a new trial by the court where the
issue was tried, or to which the record was properly returnable; or the award of a
venire facias de novo, by an appellate court, for some error of law which
intervened in the proceedings.

"[I]f the evidence were now before us, it would not be competent for this court to
reverse the judgment for any error in the verdict of the jury at the trial . . . ." Id.,
at 447-449.

Nor was the common law proscription on reexamination limited to review of the
correctness of the jury's determination of liability on the facts. No less than the
existence of liability, the proper measure of damages "involves only a question of
fact," St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648, 661 (1915), as does
a "motio[n] for a new trial based on the ground that the damages . . . are
excessive," Metropolitan R. Co. v. Moore, 121 U. S. 558, 574 (1887). As
appeals from denial of such motions necessarily pose a factual question, courts of
the United States are constitutionally forbidden to entertain them.

"No error of law appearing upon the record, this court cannot reverse the judgment
because, upon examination of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that the
jury should have returned a verdict for a less amount. If the jury acted upon a
gross mistake of facts, or were governed by some improper influence or bias, the
remedy therefore rested with the court below, under its general power to set aside
the verdict. . . . Whether [the refusal to exercise that power] was erroneous or not,
our power is restricted by the Constitution to the determination of the questions
of law arising upon the record. Our authority does not extend to a re-examination
of facts which have been tried to the jury under instructions correctly defining the
legal rights of parties. Parsons v. Bedford, [supra] . . . ." Railroad Co. v. Fraloff,
100 U. S. 24, 31-32 (1879).

This view was for long years not only unquestioned in our cases, but repeatedly
affirmed.3


Respondent's principal response to these cases, which is endorsed by JUSTICE
STEVENS, see ante, at 5-7, is that our forebears were simply wrong about the
English common law. The rules of the common-law practice incorporated in the
Seventh Amendment, it is claimed, did not prevent judges sitting in an appellate
capacity from granting a new trial on the ground that an award was contrary to the
weight of the evidence. This claim simply does not withstand examination of the
actual practices of the courts at common law. The weight of the historical record
strongly supports the view of the common law taken in our early cases.

At common law, all major civil actions were initiated before panels of judges
sitting at the courts of Westminster. Trial was not always held at the bar of the
court, however. The inconvenience of having jurors and witnesses travel to
Westminster had given rise to the practice of allowing trials to be held in the
countryside, before a single itinerant judge. This nisi prius trial, as it was called,
was limited to the jury's deciding a matter of fact in dispute; once that was
accomplished, the verdict was entered on the record which--along with any
exceptions to the instructions or rulings of the nisi prius judge--was then returned
to the en banc court at Westminster. See generally 1 Holdsworth, History of
English Law, at 223-224, 278-282; G. Radcliffe & G. Cross, The English Legal
System 90-91, 183-186 (3d ed. 1954). Requests for new trials were made not to
the nisi prius judge, but to the en banc court, prior to further proceedings and
entry of judgment. See 1 Holdsworth, supra, at 282; Riddell, New Trial at the
Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49, 53, 57 (1916). Such motions were altogether
separate from appeal on writ of error, which followed the entry of judgment. 1
Holdsworth, supra, at 213-214; Radcliffe & Cross, supra, at 210-212.4

Nonetheless, respondent argues, the role of the en banc court at Westminster was
essentially that of an appellate body, reviewing the proceedings below; and those
appellate judges were capable of examining the evidence, and of granting a new
trial when, in their view, the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence.
See Blume, Review of Facts in Jury Cases--The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am.
Jud. Soc. 130, 131 (1936); Riddell, supra, at 55-57, 60. There are two
difficulties with this argument. The first is the characterization of the court at
Westminster as an appellate body. The court's role with respect to the initiation
of the action, the entertaining of motions for new trial, and the entry of judgment
was the same in all cases--whether the cause was tried at the bar or at nisi prius.
To regard its actions in deciding a motion for a new trial as "appellate" in the
latter instance supposes a functional distinction where none existed. The second
difficulty is that when the trial had been held at nisi prius, the judges of the en
banc court apparently would order a new trial only if the nisi prius judge certified
that he was dissatisfied with the verdict. To be sure, there are many cases where
no mention is made of the judge's certificate, but there are many indications that
it was a required predicate to setting aside a verdict rendered at nisi prius, and
respondent has been unable to identify a single case where a new trial was granted
in the absence of such certification. In short, it would seem that a new trial could
not be had except upon the approval of the judge who presided over the trial and
heard the evidence.5

I am persuaded that our prior cases were correct that, at common law,
"reexamination" of the facts found by a jury could be undertaken only by the trial
court, and that appellate review was restricted to writ of error which could
challenge the judgment only upon matters of law. Even if there were some doubt
on the point, we should be hesitant to advance our view of the common law over
that of our forbears, who were far better acquainted with the subject than we are.
But in any event, the question of how to apply the "rules of the common law" to
federal appellate consideration of motions for new trials is one that has already
been clearly and categorically answered, by our precedents. As we said in Dimick
v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474 (1935), in discussing the status of remittitur under "the
rules of the common law," a doctrine that "has been accepted as the law for more
than a hundred years and uniformly applied in the federal courts during that time"
and "finds some support in the practice of the English courts prior to the adoption
of the Constitution" will not lightly "be reconsidered or disturbed," id., at 484-
485. The time to question whether orders on motions for a new trial were in fact
reviewable at common law has long since passed. Cases of this Court reaching
back into the early 19th century establish that the Constitution forbids federal
appellate courts to "reexamine" a fact found by the jury at trial; and that this
prohibition encompasses review of a district court's refusal to set aside a verdict as
contrary to the weight of the evidence.


The Court, as is its wont of late, all but ignores the relevant history. It
acknowledges that federal appellate review of district-court refusals to set aside
jury awards as against the weight of the evidence was "once deemed inconsonant
with the Seventh Amendment's re-examination clause," ante, at 18, but gives no
indication of why ever we held that view; and its citation of only one of our cases
subscribing to that proposition fails to convey how long and how clearly it was a
fixture of federal practice, see ibid. (citing only Lincoln v. Power, 151 U. S. 436
(1894)). That our earlier cases are so poorly recounted is not surprising, however,
given the scant analysis devoted to the conclusion that "appellate review for abuse
of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment," ante, at 19.

No precedent of this Court affirmatively supports that proposition. The cases
upon which the Court relies neither affirmed nor rejected the practice of appellate
weight-of-the-evidence review that has been adopted by the courts of appeals--a
development that, in light of our past cases, amounts to studied waywardness by
the intermediate appellate bench. Our unaccountable reluctance, in Grunenthal v.
Long Island R. Co., 393 U. S. 156, 158 (1968), and Neese v. Southern R. Co.,
350 U. S. 77 (1955), to stand by our precedents, and the undeniable illogic of our
disposition of those two cases--approving ourselves a district court denial of a
new trial motion, so as not to have to confront the lawfulness of reversal by the
court of appeals--is authority of only the weakest and most negative sort. Nor
can any weight be assigned to our statement in Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,
Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279 (1989), seemingly approving
appellate abuse-of-discretion review of denials of new trials where punitive
damages are claimed to be excessive. Browning-Ferris, like Grunenthal and Neese,
explicitly avoided the question that is before us today, see 492 U. S., at 279, n.
25. Even more significantly, Browning-Ferris involved review of a jury's
punitive damages award. Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which
presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, e.g., Craft, 237 U. S., at
661, the level of punitive damages is not really a "fact" "tried" by the jury. In
none of our cases holding that the Reexamination Clause prevents federal
appellate review of claims of excessive damages does it appear that the damages
had a truly "punitive" component.

In any event, it is not this Court's statements that the Court puts forward as the
basis for dispensing with our prior cases. Rather, it is the Circuit Courts of
Appeals' unanimous "agree[ment]" that they may review trial-court refusals to set
aside jury awards claimed to be against the weight of the evidence. Ante, at 19.
This current unanimity is deemed controlling, notwithstanding the "relatively
late" origin of the practice, ante, at 18, and without any inquiry into the reasoning
set forth in those Court of Appeals decisions.6   The Court contents itself with
citations of two federal appellate cases and the assurances of two leading treatises
that the view (however meager its intellectual provenance might be) is universally
held. See ante, at 19-20. To its credit, one of those treatises describes the
"dramatic change in doctrine" represented by appellate abuse-of-discretion review
of denials of new trial orders generally as having been "accomplished by a blizzard
of dicta" that, through repetition alone, has "given legitimacy to a doctrine of
doubtful constitutionality."  11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure Section 2819, pp. 200, 204 (2d ed. 1995).7

The Court's only suggestion as to what rationale might underlie approval of
abuse-of-discretion review is to be found in a quotation from Dagnello v. Long
Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d 797 (CA2 1961), to the effect that review of denial of a
new trial motion, if conducted under a sufficiently deferential standard, poses only
"`a question of law.'"  Ante, at 19 (quoting Dagnello, supra, at 806). But that is
not the test that the Seventh Amendment sets forth. Whether or not it is possible
to characterize an appeal of a denial of new trial as raising a "legal question," it is
not possible to review such a claim without engaging in a "reexamin[ation]" of
the "facts tried by the jury" in a manner "otherwise" than allowed at common law.
Determining whether a particular award is excessive requires that one first
determine the nature and extent of the harm--which undeniably requires reviewing
the facts of the case. That the court's review also entails application of a legal
standard (whether "shocks the conscience," "deviates materially," or some other)
makes no difference, for what is necessarily also required is reexamination of facts
found by the jury.

In the last analysis, the Court frankly abandons any pretense at faithfulness to the
common law, suggesting that "the meaning" of the Reexamination Clause was
not "fixed at 1791," ante, at 20, n. 20, contrary to the view that all our prior
discussions of the Reexamination Clause have adopted, see supra, at 4-7. The
Court believes we can ignore the very explicit command that "no fact tried by a
jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than
according to the rules of the common law" because, after all, we have not insisted
that juries be all male, or consist of 12 jurors, as they were at common law.
Ante, at 20, n. 20. This is a desperate analogy, since there is of course no
comparison between the specificity of the command of the Reexamination Clause
and the specificity of the command that there be a "jury."  The footnote
abandonment of our traditional view of the Reexamination Clause is a major step
indeed.8


The Court's holding that federal courts of appeals may review district court denials
of motions for new trials for error of fact is not the only novel aspect of today's
decision. The Court also directs that the case be remanded to the District Court,
so that it may "test the jury's verdict against CPLR Section 5501(c)'s `deviates
materially' standard," ante, at 23. This disposition contradicts the principle that
"[t]he proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in
reviewing the size of jury verdicts is . . . a matter of federal law."  Donovan v.
Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S. 648, 649 (1977) (per curiam).

The Court acknowledges that state procedural rules cannot, as a general matter, be
permitted to interfere with the allocation of functions in the federal court system,
see ante, at 21. Indeed, it is at least partly for this reason that the Court rejects
direct application of Section 5501(c) at the appellate level as inconsistent with an
"`essential characteristic'" of the federal court system-- by which the Court
presumably means abuse-of-discretion review of denials of motions for new trials.
See ante, at 15, 21-22. But the scope of the Court's concern is oddly
circumscribed. The "essential characteristic" of the federal jury, and, more
specifically, the role of the federal trial court in reviewing jury judgments,
apparently counts for little. The Court approves the "accommodat[ion]" achieved
by having district courts review jury verdicts under the "deviates materially"
standard, because it regards that as a means of giving effect to the State's purposes
"without disrupting the federal system," ante, at 21. But changing the standard by
which trial judges review jury verdicts does disrupt the federal system, and is
plainly inconsistent with "the strong federal policy against allowing state rules to
disrupt the judge-jury relationship in federal court."  Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural
Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 538 (1958).9   The Court's opinion does
not even acknowledge, let alone address, this dislocation.

We discussed precisely the point at issue here in Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), and gave an answer
altogether contrary to the one provided today. Browning-Ferris rejected a request
to fashion a federal common-law rule limiting the size of punitive-damages
awards in federal courts, reaffirming the principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,
304 U. S. 64 (1938), that "[i]n a diversity action, or in any other lawsuit where
state law provides the basis of decision, the propriety of an award of punitive
damages . . . and the factors the jury may consider in determining their amount,
are questions of state law."  492 U. S., at 278. But the opinion expressly stated
that "[f]ederal law . . . will control on those issues involving the proper review of
the jury award by a federal district court and court of appeals."  Id., at 278-279.
"In reviewing an award of punitive damages," it said, "the role of the district court
is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the confines of state law, and
to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a
new trial or remittitur should be ordered."  Id., at 279. The same distinction
necessarily applies where the judgment under review is for compensatory
damages: State substantive law controls what injuries are compensable and in
what amount; but federal standards determine whether the award exceeds what is
lawful to such degree that it may be set aside by order for new trial or
remittitur.10

The Court does not disavow those statements in Browning-Ferris (indeed, it does
not even discuss them), but it presumably overrules them, at least where the state
rule that governs "whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered" is
characterized as "substantive" in nature. That, at any rate, is the reason the Court
asserts for giving Section 5501(c) dispositive effect. The objective of that
provision, the Court states, "is manifestly substantive," ante, at 13, since it
operates to "contro[l] how much a plaintiff can be awarded" by "tightening the
range of tolerable awards," ante, at 9. Although "less readily classified" as
substantive than "a statutory cap on damages," it nonetheless "was designed to
provide an analogous control," ante, at 12, by making a new trial mandatory
when the award "deviat[es] materially" from what is reasonable, see ante, at 12-
13.

I do not see how this can be so. It seems to me quite wrong to regard this
provision as a "substantive" rule for Erie purposes. The "analog[y]" to "a
statutory cap on damages," ante, at 12, fails utterly. There is an absolutely
fundamental distinction between a rule of law such as that, which would
ordinarily be imposed upon the jury in the trial court's instructions, and a rule of
review, which simply determines how closely the jury verdict will be scrutinized
for compliance with the instructions. A tighter standard for reviewing jury
determinations can no more plausibly be called a "substantive" disposition than
can a tighter appellate standard for reviewing trial-court determinations. The one,
like the other, provides additional assurance that the law has been complied with;
but the other, like the one, leaves the law unchanged.

The Court commits the classic Erie mistake of regarding whatever changes the
outcome as substantive, see ante, at 12-14. That is not the only factor to be
considered. See Byrd, 356 U. S., at 537 ("[W]ere `outcome' the only
consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal court should
follow the state practice. But there are affirmative countervailing considerations
at work here"). Outcome-determination "was never intended to serve as a
talisman," Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 466-467 (1965), and does not have
the power to convert the most classic elements of the process of assuring that the
law is observed into the substantive law itself. The right to have a jury make the
findings of fact, for example, is generally thought to favor plaintiffs, and that
advantage is often thought significant enough to be the basis for forum selection.
But no one would argue that Erie confers a right to a jury in federal court
wherever state courts would provide it; or that, were it not for the Seventh
Amendment, Erie would require federal courts to dispense with the jury whenever
state courts do so.

In any event, the Court exaggerates the difference that the state standard will
make. It concludes that different outcomes are likely to ensue depending on
whether the law being applied is the state "deviates materially" standard of Section
5501(c) or the "shocks the conscience" standard. See ante, at 12-14. Of course it
is not the federal appellate standard but the federal district-court standard for
granting new trials that must be compared with the New York standard to
determine whether substantially different results will obtain--and it is far from
clear that the district-court standard ought to be "shocks the conscience."11
Indeed, it is not even clear (as the Court asserts) that "shocks the conscience" is
the standard (erroneous or not) actually applied by the district courts of the Second
Circuit. The Second Circuit's test for reversing a grant of a new trial for an
excessive verdict is whether the award was "clearly within the maximum limit of
a reasonable range," Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183, 186 (CA2 1990) (internal
quotation marks omitted), so any district court that uses that standard will be
affirmed. And while many district-court decisions express the "shocks the
conscience" criterion, see, e.g., Koerner v. Club Mediterranee, S. A., 833 F.
Supp. 327, 333 (SDNY 1993), some have used a standard of "indisputably
egregious," Banff v. Express, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (SDNY 1995), or
have adopted the inverse of the Second Circuit's test for reversing a grant of new
trial, namely, "clearly outside the maximum limit of a reasonable range," Paper
Corp. v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc., 807 F. Supp. 337, 350-351 (SDNY
1992). Moreover, some decisions that say "shocks the conscience" in fact apply a
rule much less stringent. One case, for example, says that any award that would
not be sustained under the New York "deviates materially" rule "shocks the
conscience."  See In re Joint Eastern & S. Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 798 F.
Supp. 925, 937 (E&SDNY 1992), rev'd on other grounds, 995 F. 2d 343, 346
(CA2 1993). In sum, it is at least highly questionable whether the consistent
outcome differential claimed by the Court even exists. What seems to me far
more likely to produce forum-shopping is the consistent difference between the
state and federal appellate standards, which the Court leaves untouched. Under the
Court's disposition, the Second Circuit reviews only for abuse of discretion,
whereas New York's appellate courts engage in a de novo review for material
deviation, giving the defendant a double shot at getting the damages award set
aside. The only result that would produce the conformity the Court erroneously
believes Erie requires is the one adopted by the Second Circuit and rejected by the
Court: de novo federal appellate review under the Section 5501(c) standard.

To say that application of Section 5501(c) in place of the federal standard will not
consistently produce disparate results is not to suggest that the decision the Court
has made today is not a momentous one. The principle that the state standard
governs is of great importance, since it bears the potential to destroy the
uniformity of federal practice and the integrity of the federal court system. Under
the Court's view, a state rule that directed courts "to determine that an award is
excessive or inadequate if it deviates in any degree from the proper measure of
compensation" would have to be applied in federal courts, effectively requiring
federal judges to determine the amount of damages de novo, and effectively taking
the matter away from the jury entirely. Cf. Byrd, 356 U. S., at 537-538. Or
consider a state rule that allowed the defendant a second trial on damages, with
judgment ultimately in the amount of the lesser of two jury awards. Cf. United
States v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas., at 747-748 (describing Massachusetts practice by
which a second jury trial could be had on appeal). Under the reasoning of the
Court's opinion, even such a rule as that would have to be applied in the federal
courts.

The foregoing describes why I think the Court's Erie analysis is flawed. But in
my view, one does not even reach the Erie question in this case. The standard to
be applied by a district court in ruling on a motion for a new trial is set forth in
Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that "[a] new
trial may be granted . . . for any of the reasons for which new trials have
heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States"
(emphasis added). That is undeniably a federal standard.12   Federal district courts
in the Second Circuit have interpreted that standard to permit the granting of new
trials where "`it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous
result'" and letting the verdict stand would result in a "`miscarriage of justice.'"
Koerner v. Club Mediterranee, S. A., 833 F. Supp. 327 (SDNY 1993) (quoting
Bevevino v. Saydjari, 574 F. 2d 676, 684 (CA2 1978)). Assuming (as we have
no reason to question) that this is a correct interpretation of what Rule 59
requires, it is undeniable that the federal rule is "`sufficiently broad' to cause a
`direct collision' with the state law or, implicitly, to `control the issue' before the
court, thereby leaving no room for the operation of that law."  Burlington
Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). It is simply not possible to
give controlling effect both to the federal standard and the state standard in
reviewing the jury's award. That being so, the court has no choice but to apply
the Federal Rule, which is an exercise of what we have called Congress's "power
to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between
substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either," Hanna,
380 U. S., at 472.

There is no small irony in the Court's declaration today that appellate review of
refusals to grant new trials for error of fact is "a control necessary and proper to
the fair administration of justice," ante, at 19. It is objection to precisely that
sort of "control" by federal appellate judges that gave birth to the Reexamination
Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Alas, those who drew the Amendment, and
the citizens who approved it, did not envision an age in which the Constitution
means whatever this Court thinks it ought to mean--or indeed, whatever the
courts of appeals have recently thought it ought to mean.

When there is added to the revision of the Seventh Amendment the Court's
precedent-setting disregard of Congress's instructions in Rule 59, one must
conclude that this is a bad day for the Constitution's distinctive Article III courts
in general, and for the role of the jury in those courts in particular. I respectfully
dissent.

4 In full, N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) Section 5501(c) (McKinney
1995) provides:

"The appellate division shall review questions of law and questions of fact on an
appeal from a judgment or order of a court of original instance and on an appeal
from an order of the supreme court, a county court or an appellate term
determining an appeal. In reviewing a money judgment in an action in which an
itemized verdict is required by rule forty-one hundred eleven of this chapter in
which it is contended that the award is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial
should have been granted unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the
appellate division shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it
deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation."

5 CPLR Section 5522(b) provides:

"In an appeal from a money judgment in an action... in which it is contended that
the award is excessive or inadequate, the appellate division shall set forth in its
decision the reasons therefor, including the factors it considered in complying
with subdivision (c) of section fifty-five hundred one of this chapter."

6 Originally Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Rules of Decision Act,
now contained in 28 U. S. C. Section 1652, reads: "The laws of the several
states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of
Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in
civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply."

7 Concerning matters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
characterization question is usually unproblematic: It is settled that if the Rule in
point is consonant with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. Section 2072, and
the Constitution, the Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law. See
Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469-474 (1965); Burlington Northern R. Co.
v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). Federal courts have interpreted the Federal
Rules, however, with sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory
policies. See, e.g., Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 750-752
(1980) (reaffirming decision in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co.,
337 U. S. 530 (1949), that state law rather than Rule 3 determines when a
diversity action commences for the purposes of tolling the state statute of
limitations; Rule 3 makes no reference to the tolling of state limitations, the
Court observed, and accordingly found no "direct conflict"); S. A. Healy Co. v.
Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Dist., 60 F. 3d 305, 310-312 (CA7 1995)
(state provision for offers of settlement by plaintiffs is compatible with Federal
Rule 68, which is limited to offers by defendants).

8 Hanna keyed the question to Erie's "twin aims"; in full, Hanna instructed federal
courts to ask "whether application of the [state's] rule would make so important a
difference to the character or result of the litigation that failure to enforce it would
unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or whether application of
the rule would have so important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the
litigants that failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the
federal court."  380 U. S., at 468, n. 9.

9 While we have not specifically addressed the issue, courts of appeals have held
that district court application of state statutory caps in diversity cases, post
verdict, does not violate the Seventh Amendment. See Davis v. Omitowoju, 883
F. 2d 1155, 1161-1165 (CA3 1989) (re-examination clause of Seventh
Amendment does not impede federal court's post-verdict application of statutory
cap); Boyd v. Bulala, 877 F. 2d 1191, 1196 (CA4 1989) (post-verdict application
of statutory cap does not violate Seventh Amendment right of trial by jury).

10 JUSTICE SCALIA questions whether federal district courts in New York
"actually appl[y]" or "ought" to apply the "shock the conscience" test in assessing
a jury's award for excessiveness. Post, at 19-20 (collecting various formulations
of review standard). If there is a federal district court standard, it must come from
the Court of Appeals, not from the over 40 district court judges in the Southern
District of New York, each of whom sits alone and renders decisions not binding
on the others. Indeed, in Ismail v. Cohen, the authority upon which JUSTICE
SCALIA relies, the Second Circuit stated that district courts test damage awards
for excessiveness under the "shock the conscience" standard. See 899 F. 2d 183,
186 (1990) ("A remittitur, in effect, is a statement by the court that it is shocked
by the jury's award of damages."); see also Scala v. Moore McCormack Lines,
Inc., 985 F. 2d 680, 683 (CA2 1993) ("[I]n the federal courts, a judgment cannot
stand where the damages awarded are so excessive as to shock the judicial
conscience.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

11 JUSTICE SCALIA questions whether application of CPLR Section 5501(c),
in lieu of the standard generally used by federal courts within the Second Circuit,
see supra, at 5, will in fact yield consistent outcome differentials, see post, at 19,
20. The numbers, as the Second Circuit believed, are revealing. See 66 F. 3d
427, 430 (1995). Is the difference between an award of $450,000 and $100,000,
see supra, at 4, or between $1,500 per transparency and $500, see supra, at 3-4, n.
2, fairly described as insubstantial? We do not see how that can be so.

12 For rights that are state-created, state law governs the amount properly awarded
as punitive damages, subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for
exorbitancy. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. __, __ (1996)
(slip op., at 7); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.,
492 U. S. 257, 278-279 (1989). An evenhanded approach would require federal
court deference to endeavors like New York's to control compensatory damages for
excessiveness. See infra, at 19, n. 18.

13 The defendant argued in Byrd that although the personal injury plaintiff was
employed by an independent contractor, the work plaintiff was engaged to perform
was the same as work done by defendant's own employees. Therefore, defendant
maintained, the plaintiff ranked as a "statutory employee" whose sole remedy was
under the State's workers' compensation law. The sameness of the work plaintiff
and defendant's own employees performed presented a fact question, but in state
court, a jury trial would not have been available to resolve it.

14 See Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90, 92 (1876).

15 See 6A Moore's Federal Practice Paragraph 59.05[1], pp. 59-38 to 59-40 (2d
ed. 1996) (common law origin of trial court power to grant or deny a new trial).

16 Inviting rethinking of the additur question on a later day, Justice Stone, joined
by Chief Justice Hughes, and Justices Brandeis and Cardozo, found nothing in the
history or language of the Seventh Amendment forcing the "incongruous
position" that "a federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the
plaintiff consents to decrease the judgment to a proper amount," but may not
condition denial of the motion on "the defendant's consent to a comparable
increase in the recovery."  Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S., at 495.

17 Dissenting from the Court's professed refusal to answer the question presented
in Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., Justices Harlan and Stewart observed that in
Grunenthal itself, this Court indeed had reviewed the refusal of the district court to
set aside a jury verdict for excessiveness. 393 U. S., at 163 (Harlan, J.,
dissenting); id., at 164-165 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan commented:
"Like my Brother STEWART, I am at an utter loss to understand how the Court
manages to review the District Court's decision and find it proper while at the
same time proclaiming that it has avoided decision of the issue whether appellate
courts ever may review such actions."  Id., at 163.

18 Browning-Ferris concerned punitive damages. We agree with the Second
Circuit, however, that "[f]or purposes of deciding whether state or federal law is
applicable, the question whether an award of compensatory damages exceeds what
is permitted by law is not materially different from the question whether an award
of punitive damages exceeds what is permitted by law."  Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at
1012.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA disagrees. Ready to "destroy the uniformity of federal
practice" in this regard, cf. post, at 20, he would render a judgment described as
"astonishing" by the very authority upon which he relies. Compare post, at 13,
with 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure
Section 2820, p. 212 (2d ed. 1995) ("it would be astonishing if the Court, which
has passed up three opportunities to do so, should ultimately reject" the
unanimously-held view of the courts of appeals).

20 If the meaning of the Seventh Amendment were fixed at 1791, our civil juries
would remain, as they unquestionably were at common law, "twelve good men
and true," 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *349; see Capital Traction Co. v.
Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13 (1899) ("`Trial by jury,' in the primary and usual sense of
the term at the common law and in the American constitutions . . . is a trial by a
jury of twelve men[.]"). But see Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 160 (1973)
(six-member jury for civil trials satisfies Seventh Amendment's guarantee).
Procedures we have regarded as compatible with the Seventh Amendment,
although not in conformity with practice at common law when the Amendment
was adopted, include new trials restricted to the determination of damages,
Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931), and
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b)'s motion for judgment as a matter of law,
see 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Section 2522, pp.
244-246 (2d ed. 1995). See also Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322,
335-337 (1979) (issue preclusion absent mutuality of parties does not violate
Seventh Amendment, although common law as it existed in 1791 permitted issue
preclusion only when there was mutuality).

21 The two-trial rule posited by JUSTICE SCALIA, post, at 21, surely would be
incompatible with the existence of "[t]he federal system [as] an independent
system for administering justice," Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,
Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958). We discern no disagreement on such examples
among the many federal judges who have considered this case.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA finds in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 a "federal
standard" for new trial motions in "`direct collision'" with, and "`leaving no room
for the operation of,'" a state law like CPLR Section 5501(c). Post, at 21-22
(quoting Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 4-5). The relevant
prescription, Rule 59(a), has remained unchanged since the adoption of the Federal
Rules by this Court in 1937. 302 U. S. 783. Rule 59(a) is as encompassing as
it is uncontroversial. It is indeed "Hornbook" law that a most usual ground for a
Rule 59 motion is that "the damages are excessive."  See C. Wright, Law of
Federal Courts 676-677 (5th ed. 1994). Whether damages are excessive for the
claim-in-suit must be governed by some law. And there is no candidate for that
governance other than the law that gives rise to the claim for relief--here, the law
of New York. See 28 U. S. C. Section 2072(a) and (b) ("Supreme Court shall
have the power to prescribe general rules of . . . procedure"; "[s]uch rules shall
not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right"); Browning-Ferris, 492 U.
S., at 279 ("standard of excessiveness" is a "matte[r] of state, and not federal,
common law"); see also R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 729-730 (4th ed. 1996)
(observing that Court "has continued since [Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460
(1965)] to interpret the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state
regulatory policies," citing Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980)).

23 If liability and damage-control rules are split apart here, as JUSTICE SCALIA
says they must be to save the Seventh Amendment, then Gasperini's claim and
others like it would be governed by a most curious "law."  The sphinx-like,
damage-determining law he would apply to this controversy has a state forepart,
but a federal hindquarter. The beast may not be brutish, but there is little
judgment in its creation.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE STEVENS DISSENT

1 Because there is no conceivable conflict between Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59 and the application of the New York damages limit, this case is
controlled by Erie and the Rules of Decisions Act, rather than by the Rules
Enabling Act's limitation on federal procedural rules that conflict with state
substantive rights. See Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev.
693, 698 (1974); see also Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1 (1941). The
Rule does state that new trials may be granted "for any of the reasons for which
new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the
United States," but that hardly constitutes a command that federal courts must
always substitute federal limits on the size of judgments for those set by the
several States in cases founded upon state law causes of action. Even at the time
of the Rule's adoption, federal courts were bound to apply state statutory law in
such cases.

2 I thus disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA's view that there is a separate federal
standard to "determine whether the award exceeds what is lawful to such degree
that it may be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur."  Post, at 17. In my
view, if an award "exceeds what is lawful," ibid., legal error has occurred and may
be corrected. Certainly Dimick does not premise a court's power to overturn an
award that exceeds lawful limits on the degree of the excess.

3 For that reason, JUSTICE SCALIA is wrong to contend that the court at
Westminster acted in no more of an appellate fashion when it entertained motions
for new trials in causes tried at bar than when it entertained them in causes tried at
nisi prius. Post, at 9. In the former cases, the en banc court would entertain a
motion for new trial after having heard the evidence itself. In the latter, it would
sometimes entertain the motion only after having heard the report on the evidence
of the nisi prius judge.

4 Although Honda itself involved review of punitive damages awards, we
expressly noted that there was no basis for suggesting "that different standards of
judicial review were applied for punitive and compensatory damages before the
twentieth century," 512 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at 6, n. 2). Indeed, many of
the decisions we relied upon in Honda involved compensatory damages, and there
is some authority to suggest that judicial review of the former has a more secure
historical pedigree than does judicial review of the latter.

5 See, e.g., Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365, 368 (K. B. 1757)
(Denison, J., concurring) ("[T]he granting a new trial, or refusing it, must depend
upon the legal discretion of the Court; guided by the nature and circumstances of
the particular case, and directed with a view to the attainment of justice"); Wood
v. Gunston, Sty. 466 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655) ("It is in the discretion of
the Court in some cases to grant a new tryal, but this must be a judicial and not
an arbitrary discretion, and it is frequent in our books for the Court to take notice
of miscarriages of juries, and to grant new tryals upon them...").

6 Our per curiam decision in Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S. 648
(1977), provides no support for the proposition that federal appellate courts are
confined to a federal standard of excessiveness. That case held only that a plaintiff
who had consented to a remittitur could not challenge its adequacy on appeal. Id.,
at 649. Although we stated in dicta that "[t]he proper role of the trial and appellate
courts in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is, however, a
matter of federal law," ibid., that broad statement was supported by citation to
two cases, Hana v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460 (1965), and Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural
Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525 (1958), which did not involve the review
of jury awards.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE SCALIA DISSENT

1 This objection was repeatedly made following the Constitutional Convention,
see, e.g., Martin, Genuine Information, in 3 Records of the Federal Convention
of 1787, pp. 172, 221-222 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); Gerry, Reply to a Landholder,
id., at 298, 299, and at the ratifying conventions in the States, see, e.g., 3 J.
Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 525, 540-541, 544-546 (1863)
(Virginia Convention, statements of Mr. Mason and Mr. Henry); 4 id., at 151,
154 (North Carolina Convention, statements of Mr. Bloodworth and Mr.
Spencer).

Prior to adoption of the Amendment, these concerns were addressed by Congress
in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, which expressly directed, in providing
for "reexamin[ation]" of civil judgments "upon a writ of error," that "there shall
be no reversal in either [the Circuit or Supreme Court] . . . for any error of fact."
Section 22, 1 Stat. 84-85. That restriction remained in place until the 1948
revisions of the Judicial Code. See 62 Stat. 963, 28 U. S. C. Section 2105
(1994).

2 The Amendment was relied upon at least twice to prevent actual new trials. In
Wonson itself, Justice Story rejected the United States' claim of right to retry, on
appeal, a matter unsuccessfully put before a jury in the District Court--
notwithstanding acceptance of such a practice under local law. The court based its
ruling on statutory grounds, but its interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction was
dictated by its view that a contrary interpretation would contravene the Seventh
Amendment. 28 F. Cas., at 750. And in The Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall. 274,
281 (1870), this Court relied on Wonson in invalidating under the Seventh
Amendment a federal habeas statute that provided for removal of certain judgments
from state courts for purposes of retrial in federal court.

3 See, e.g., Wabash R. Co. v. McDaniels, 107 U. S. 454, 456 (1883) ("That we
are without authority to disturb the judgment upon the ground that the damages
are excessive cannot be doubted. Whether the order overruling the motion for a
new trial based upon that ground was erroneous or not, our power is restricted to
the determination of questions of law arising upon the record. Railroad Company
v. Fraloff, 100 U. S. 24 [(1879)]"); Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann,
130 U. S. 69, 75 (1889) ("[H]owever it was ascertained by the court that the
verdict was too large . . . , the granting or refusing a new trial in a Circuit Court
of the United States is not subject to review by this court") (citing Parsons v.
Bedford, 3. Pet. 433 (1830); Railroad Co. v. Fraloff, 100 U. S. 24 (1879));
Lincoln v. Power, 151 U. S. 436, 437-438 (1894) ("[I]t is not permitted for this
court, sitting as a court of errors, in a case wherein damages have been fixed by
the verdict of a jury, to take notice of [a claim of excessive damages] where the
complaint is only of the action of the jury.... [W]here there is no reason to
complain of the instructions, an error of the jury in allowing an unreasonable
amount is to be redressed by a motion for a new trial") (citing Parsons, supra;
Fraloff, supra); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 242-246
(1897); Southern Railway-Carolina Div. v. Bennett, 233 U. S. 80, 87 (1914)
("[A] case of mere excess upon the evidence is a matter to be dealt with by the
trial court. It does not present a question for reexamination here upon a writ of
error") (citing Lincoln, supra); Fairmount Glass Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co.,
287 U. S. 474, 481-482 (1933) ("The rule that this Court will not review the
action of a federal trial court in granting or denying a motion for a new trial for
error of fact has been settled by a long and unbroken line of decisions; and has
been frequently applied where the ground of the motion was that the damages
awarded by the jury were excessive or were inadequate") (footnotes omitted).

4 The grounds for granting a new trial were "want of notice of trial; or any
flagrant misbehavior of the party prevailing toward the jury, which may have
influenced their verdict; or of any gross misbehavior of the jury among
themselves: also if it appears by the judge's report, certified to the court, that the
jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is
reasonably dissatisfied therewith; or if they have given exorbitant damages; or if
the judge himself has misdirected the jury, so that they found an unjustifiable
verdict."  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 387 (1768)
(footnotes omitted; emphases omitted).

5 See ibid. (new trial would be granted "if it appears by the judge's report,
certified to the court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to
evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith"). See, e.g., Berks v.
Mason, Say. 264, 265, 96 Eng. Rep. 874, 874-875 (K. B. 1756); Bright v.
Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365 (K. B. 1757); see also Note,
Limitations on Trial by Jury in Illinois, 19 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 91, 92 (1940)
("An exhaustive examination of the early English cases has revealed not a single
case where an English court at common law ever granted a new trial, as being
against the evidence, unless the judge or judges who sat with the jury stated in
open court, or certified, that the verdict was against the evidence and he was
dissatisfied with the verdict").

JUSTICE STEVENS understands Blackstone to say that new trials were granted
for excessiveness even where the nisi prius judge was not dissatisfied with the
damages awarded, see ante, at 6-7. Blackstone's phrasing certainly allows for this
reading, see n. 4, supra, but what indications we have suggest that the
dissatisfaction of the presiding judge played the same role where the motion for
new trial was based on a claim of excessive damages as where based on a claim of
an erroneous verdict. See, e.g., Boulsworth v. Pilkington, Jones, T. 200, 84
Eng. Rep. 1216 (K. B. 1685); Anonymous, 1 Wils. K. B. 22, 95 Eng. Rep. 470
(K. B. 1743); Redshaw v. Brook, 2 Wils. K. B. 405, 95 Eng. Rep. 887 (C. P.
1769); Sharpe v. Brice, 2 Black. W. 942, 96 Eng. Rep. 557 (C. P. 1774). The
cases cited by JUSTICE STEVENS, ante, at 7, n. 5, are not at all to the contrary:
In one, the case was tried at the bar of the court, so that there was no nisi prius
judge, see Wood v. Gunston, Sty. 466, 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655); in the
other, the judge who had presided at trial was on the panel that ruled on the new
trial motion, and recommended a new trial, see Bright v. Eynon, supra, at 390-
391, 396-397, Eng. Rep., at 365, 368.

6 The Second Circuit, notwithstanding its practice with respect to excessiveness
claims, will not review a district court's determination that the jury's liability
ruling was supported by the weight of the evidence, see Stonewall Ins. Co. v.
Asbestos Claims Management, 73 F. 3d 1178, 1199 (1995) (such a decision is
"one of those few rulings that is simply unavailable for appellate review"), and
the Eighth Circuit has questioned whether the Seventh Amendment permits
appellate review of such determinations, see Thongvanh v. Thalacker, 17 F. 3d
256, 259-260 (1994); see also White v. Pence, 961 F. 2d 776, 782 (1992).

7 I am at a loss to understand the Court's charge that keeping faith with our
precedents--and requiring that the courts of appeals do likewise--would "`destroy
the uniformity of federal practice,'" ante, at 20, n. 19. I had thought our decisions
established uniformity. And as for commentators' observations that it would be
"`astonishing'" for us actually to heed our precedents, see ibid., quoting 11 C.
Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Section 2820, p.
212 (2d ed. 1995), they are no more than a prediction of inconstancy--which the
Court today fulfills.

8 Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931), is
the only case cited in the Court's footnote that arguably involved the slightest
departure from common-law practices regarding review of jury findings. It held,
to be sure, that new trial could be ordered on damages alone, even though at
common law there was no practice of setting a verdict aside in part. But it did so
only after satisfying itself that the change was one of "form" rather than
"substance," quoting Lord Mansfield to the effect that "`for form's sake, we must
set aside the whole verdict.'"  Id., at 498 (quoting Edie v. East India Co., 1 Black
W. 295, 298, 96 Eng. Rep. 166 (K. B. 1761)). It can hardly be maintained that
whether or not a jury's damages award may be set aside on appeal is a matter of
form. The footnote also cites 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure Section 2522 (2d ed. 1995) for its discussion of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 50(b), which permits post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.
The Court neglects to mention that that discussion states: "The Supreme Court
held that reservation of the decision in this fashion had been recognized at
common law . . . ."  Id., Section 2522, at 245.

9 Since I reject application of the New York standard on other grounds, I need not
consider whether it constitutes "reexamination" of a jury's verdict in a manner
"otherwise... than according to the rules of the common law."

10 JUSTICE STEVENS thinks that if an award "exceeds what is lawful," the
result is "legal error" that "may be corrected" by the appellate court. Ante, at 5,
n. 2. But the sort of "legal error" involved here is the imposition of legal
consequences (in this case, damages) in light of facts that, under the law, may not
warrant them. To suggest that every fact may be reviewed, because what may
ensue from an erroneous factual determination is a "legal error," is to destroy the
notion that there is a factfinding function reserved to the jury.

11 That the "shocks the conscience" standard was not the traditional one would
seem clear from the opinion of Justice Story, quoted approvingly by the Court,
ante, at 17, to the effect that remittitur should be granted "if it should clearly
appear that the jury . . . have given damages excessive in relation to the person or
the injury." Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760, 761-762 (CC Mass. 1822).

12 I agree with the Court's entire progression of reasoning in its footnote 22,
ante, at 21-22, leading to the conclusion that state law must determine "[w]hether
damages are excessive."  But the question of whether damages are excessive is
quite separate from the question of when a jury award may be set aside for
excessiveness. See supra, at 17. It is the latter that is governed by Rule 59; as
Browning-Ferris said, district courts are "to determine, by reference to federal
standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be
ordered," 492 U. S., at 279 (emphasis added).

v.

URSERY

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-345.  Argued April 17, 1996-Decided June 24, 1996*

In No. 95-345, the Government instituted civil forfeiture proceedings
under 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7) against respondent Ursery's
house, alleging that it had been used to facilitate illegal drug
transactions. Shortly before Ursery settled that claim, he was
indicted, and was later convicted, of manufacturing marijuana in
violation of Section 841(a)(1). In No. 95-346, the Government filed
a civil in rem complaint against various property seized from, or titled
to, respondents Arlt and Wren or Arlt's corporation, alleging that
each item was subject to forfeiture under 18 U. S. C. Section
981(a)(1)(A) because it was involved in money laundering violative
of Section 1956, and to forfeiture under 21 U. S. C. Section
881(a)(6) as the proceeds of a felonious drug transaction. Litigation
of the forfeiture action was deferred while Arlt and Wren were
prosecuted on drug and money-laundering charges under Section 846
and 18 U. S. C. Sections 371 and 1956. After their convictions, the
District Court granted the Government's motion for summary
judgment in the forfeiture proceeding. The Courts of Appeals
reversed Ursery's conviction and the forfeiture judgment against Arlt
and Wren, holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the
Government from both punishing a defendant for a criminal offense
and forfeiting his property for that same offense in a separate civil
proceeding. The courts reasoned in part that Halper v. United States,
490 U. S. 435, and Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, meant
that, as a categorical matter, civil forfeitures always constitute
"punishment" for double jeopardy purposes. This Court
consolidated the cases.


Held:  In rem civil forfeitures are neither "punishment" nor criminal
for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Pp. 3-23.

(a) Congress long has authorized the Government to bring parallel
criminal actions and in rem civil forfeiture proceedings based upon
the same underlying events, see, e.g., The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1,
14-15, and this Court consistently has concluded that the Double
Jeopardy Clause does not apply to such forfeitures because they do
not impose punishment, see, e.g., Various Items of Personal
Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577, 581; One Lot Emerald Cut
Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 235-236 (per curiam). In
its most recent case, United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, the Court held that a forfeiture was not
barred by a prior criminal proceeding after applying a two-part test
asking, first, whether Congress intended the particular forfeiture to
be a remedial civil sanction or a criminal penalty, and, second,
whether the forfeiture proceedings are so punitive in fact as to
establish that they may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature,
despite any congressional intent to establish a civil remedial
mechanism. Pp. 5-9.

(b) Though the 89 Firearms test was more refined, perhaps, than the
Court's Various Items analysis, the conclusion was the same in each
case: in rem civil forfeiture is a remedial civil sanction, distinct from
potentially punitive in personam civil penalties such as fines, and
does not constitute a punishment for double jeopardy purposes. See
Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392. The Courts of Appeals
misread Halper, Austin, and Montana Dept. of Revenue v. Kurth
Ranch, 511 U. S. ___, as having abandoned this oft-affirmed rule.
None of those decisions purported to overrule Various Items,
Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms or to replace the Court's
traditional understanding. It would have been remarkable for the
Court both to have held unconstitutional a well-established practice,
and to have overruled a long line of precedent, without having even
suggested that it was doing so. Moreover, the cases in question did
not deal with the subject of this case: in rem civil forfeitures for
double jeopardy purposes. Halper involved in personam civil
penalties under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Kurth Ranch
considered a punitive state tax imposed on marijuana under that
Clause. And Austin dealt with civil forfeitures under the Eighth
Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. Pp. 10-19.

(c) The forfeitures at issue are civil proceedings under the two-part
89 Firearms test. First, there is little doubt that Congress intended
proceedings under Sections 881 and 981 to be civil, since those
statutes' procedural enforcement mechanisms are themselves
distinctly civil in nature. See, e.g., 89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 363.
Second, there is little evidence, much less the "clearest proof" that the
Court requires, see e.g., id., at 365, suggesting that forfeiture
proceedings under those sections are so punitive in form and effect as
to render them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary.
These statutes are, in most significant respects, indistinguishable
from those reviewed, and held not to be punitive, in Various Items,
Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms. That these are civil
proceedings is also supported by other factors that the Court has
found persuasive, including the considerations that (1) in rem civil
forfeiture has not historically been regarded as punishment; (2) there
is no requirement in the statutes at issue that the Government
demonstrate scienter in order to establish that the property is subject
to forfeiture; (3) though both statutes may serve a deterrent purpose,
this purpose may serve civil as well as criminal goals; and (4) the fact
that both are tied to criminal activity is insufficient in itself to render
them punitive. See, e.g., United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242,
247-248, n. 7, 249. Pp. 19-23.

No. 95-345, 59 F. 3d 568, and No. 95-346, 33 F. 3d 1210 and 56
F. 3d 41, reversed.

GUY JEROME URSERY

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

UNITED STATES, PETITIONER
95-346

v.

$405,089.23 IN UNITED STATES CURRENCY ET AL.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

In separate cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Government from
both punishing a defendant for a criminal offense and forfeiting his
property for that same offense in a separate civil proceeding. We
consolidated those cases for our review, and now reverse. These
civil forfeitures (and civil forfeitures generally), we hold, do not
constitute "punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.


No. 95-345: Michigan Police found marijuana growing adjacent to
respondent Guy Ursery's house, and discovered marijuana seeds,
stems, stalks, and a growlight within the house. The United States
instituted civil forfeiture proceedings against the house, alleging that
the property was subject to forfeiture under 84 Stat. 1276, as
amended, 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7) because it had been used for
several years to facilitate the unlawful processing and distribution of
a controlled substance. Ursery ultimately paid the United States
$13,250 to settle the forfeiture claim in full. Shortly before the
settlement was consummated, Ursery was indicted for manufacturing
marijuana, in violation of Section 841(a)(1). A jury found him
guilty, and he was sentenced to 63 months in prison.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by a divided vote reversed
Ursery's criminal conviction, holding that the conviction violated the
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States
Constitution. 59 F. 3d 568 (1995). The court based its conclusion
in part upon its belief that our decisions in United States v. Halper,
490 U. S. 435 (1989), and Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602
(1993), meant that any civil forfeiture under Section 881(a)(7)
constitutes punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Ursery, in the court's view, had therefore been "punished" in the
forfeiture proceeding against his property, and could not be
subsequently criminally tried for violation of 21 U. S. C. Section
841(a)(1).

No. 95-346: Following a jury trial, Charles Wesley Arlt and James
Wren were convicted of: conspiracy to aid and abet the manufacture
of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. Section 846;
conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U. S.
C. Section 371; and numerous counts of money laundering, in
violation of Section 1956. The District Court sentenced Arlt to life in
prison and a 10-year term of supervised release, and imposed a fine
of $250,000. Wren was sentenced to life imprisonment and a 5-year
term of supervised release.

Before the criminal trial had started, the United States had filed a civil
in rem complaint against various property seized from, or titled to,
Arlt and Wren, or Payback Mines, a corporation controlled by Arlt.
The complaint alleged that each piece of property was subject to
forfeiture both under 18 U. S. C. Section 981(a)(1)(A), which
provides that "[a]ny property . . . involved in a transaction or
attempted transaction in violation of" Section 1956 (the money-
laundering statute) "is subject to forfeiture to the United States"; and
under 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(6), which provides for the
forfeiture of (i) "[a]ll . . . things of value furnished or intended to be
furnished by any person in exchange for" illegal drugs, (ii) "all
proceeds traceable to such an exchange," and (iii) "all moneys,
negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to be used to
facilitate" a federal drug felony. The parties agreed to defer litigation
of the forfeiture action during the criminal prosecution. More than a
year after the conclusion of the criminal trial, the District Court
granted the Government's motion for summary judgment in the civil
forfeiture proceeding.

Arlt and Wren appealed the decision in the forfeiture action, and the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the
forfeiture violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. 33 F. 3d 1210
(1994). The court's decision was based in part upon the same view
as that expressed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in
Ursery's case--that our decisions in Halper, supra, and Austin,
supra, meant that, as a categorical matter, forfeitures under Section
981(a)(1)(A) and Section 881(a)(6) always constitute "punishment."

We granted the Government's petition for certiorari in each of the
two cases, and we now reverse. 516 U. S. ___ (1996).


The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall any person be
subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or
limb."  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The Clause serves the function of
preventing both "successive punishments and . . . successive
prosecutions."  United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993),
citing North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969). The
protection against multiple punishments prohibits the Government
from " `punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish
criminally for the same offense.' "  Witte v. United States, 515 U. S.
___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 6) (emphasis omitted), quoting
Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938).

In the decisions that we review, the Courts of Appeals held that the
civil forfeitures constituted "punishment," making them subject to the
prohibitions of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government
challenges that characterization of the forfeitures, arguing that the
courts were wrong to conclude that civil forfeitures are punitive for
double jeopardy purposes.1


Since the earliest years of this Nation, Congress has authorized the
Government to seek parallel in rem civil forfeiture actions and
criminal prosecutions based upon the same underlying events. See,
e.g., Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, Section 12, 1 Stat. 39 (goods
unloaded at night or without a permit subject to forfeiture and
persons unloading subject to criminal prosecution); Section 25, id.,
at 43 (persons convicted of buying or concealing illegally imported
goods subject to both monetary fine and in rem forfeiture of the
goods); Section 34, id., at 46 (imposing criminal penalty and in rem
forfeiture where person convicted of relanding goods entitled to
drawback); see also The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15 (1827)
("Many cases exist, where there is both a forfeiture in rem and a
personal penalty"); cf. Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co.,
416 U. S. 663, 683 (1974) (discussing adoption of forfeiture statutes
by early Congresses). And, in a long line of cases, this Court has
considered the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause to civil
forfeitures, consistently concluding that the Clause does not apply to
such actions because they do not impose punishment.

One of the first cases to consider the relationship between the Double
Jeopardy Clause and civil forfeiture was Various Items of Personal
Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577 (1931). In Various Items,
the Waterloo Distilling Corporation had been ordered to forfeit a
distillery, warehouse, and denaturing plant, on the ground that the
corporation had conducted its distilling business in violation of
federal law. The Government conceded that the corporation had been
convicted of criminal violations prior to the initiation of the forfeiture
proceeding, and admitted that the criminal conviction had been based
upon "the transactions set forth . . . as a basis for the forfeiture."
Id., at 579. Considering the corporation's argument that the
forfeiture action violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, this Court
unanimously held that the Clause was inapplicable to civil forfeiture
actions:

"[This] forfeiture proceeding . . . is in rem. It is the property which
is proceeded against, and, by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and
condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and
insentient. In a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person
who is proceeded against, convicted, and punished. The forfeiture is
no part of the punishment for the criminal offense. The provision of
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution in respect of double
jeopardy does not apply."  Id., at 581 (citations omitted; emphasis
added).

In reaching its conclusion, the Court drew a sharp distinction
between in rem civil forfeitures and in personam civil penalties such
as fines: Though the latter could, in some circumstances, be punitive,
the former could not. Ibid. Referring to a case that was decided the
same day as Various Items, the Court made its point absolutely clear:

"In United States v. La Franca, [282 U. S.] 568, we hold that, under
Section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act, a civil action to recover taxes,
which in fact are penalties, is punitive in character and barred by a
prior conviction of the defendant for a criminal offense involving the
same transactions. This, however, is not that case, but a proceeding
in rem to forfeit property used in committing an offense."  Id., at
580.

Had the Court in Various Items found that a civil forfeiture could
constitute a "punishment" under the Fifth Amendment, its holding
would have been quite remarkable. As that Court recognized, "[a]t
common law, in many cases, the right of forfeiture did not attach
until the offending person had been convicted and the record of
conviction produced."  Ibid. In other words, at common law, not
only was it the case that a criminal conviction did not bar a civil
forfeiture, but, in fact, the civil forfeiture could not be instituted
unless a criminal conviction had already been obtained. Though this
Court had held that common-law rule inapplicable where the right of
forfeiture was "created by statute, in rem, cognizable on the revenue
side of the exchequer," The Palmyra, supra, at 14, it never had
suggested that the Constitution prohibited for statutory civil forfeiture
what was required for common-law civil forfeiture. For the Various
Items Court to have held that the forfeiture was prohibited by the
prior criminal proceeding would have been directly contrary to the
common-law rule, and would have called into question the
constitutionality of forfeiture statutes thought constitutional for over a
century. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.
S. 304, 327-328 (1936) (Evidence of a longstanding legislative
practice "goes a long way in the direction of proving the presence of
unassailable grounds for the constitutionality of the practice").

Following its decision in Various Items, the Court did not consider
another double jeopardy case involving a civil forfeiture for 40 years.
Then, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.
232 (1972) (per curiam), the Court's brief opinion reaffirmed the rule
of Various Items. In Emerald Cut Stones, after having been
acquitted of smuggling jewels into the United States, the owner of
the jewels intervened in a proceeding to forfeit them as contraband.
We rejected the owner's double jeopardy challenge to the forfeiture,
holding that "[i]f for no other reason the forfeiture is not barred by
the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it
involves neither two criminal trials nor two criminal punishments."
409 U. S., at 235. Noting that the forfeiture provisions had been
codified separately from parallel criminal provisions, the Court
determined that the forfeiture clearly was "a civil sanction."  Id., at
236. The forfeitures were not criminal punishments because they did
not impose a second in personam penalty for the criminal defendant's
wrongdoing.

In our most recent decision considering whether a civil forfeiture
constitutes punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, we again
affirmed the rule of Various Items. In United States v. One
Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), the owner of the
defendant weapons was acquitted of charges of dealing firearms
without a license. The Government then brought a forfeiture action
against the firearms under 18 U. S. C. Section 924(d), alleging that
they were used or were intended to be used in violation of federal
law.

In another unanimous decision, we held that the forfeiture was not
barred by the prior criminal proceeding. We began our analysis by
stating the rule for our decision:

"Unless the forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that
the proceeding is essentially criminal in character, the Double
Jeopardy Clause is not applicable. The question, then, is whether a
Section 924(d) forfeiture proceeding is intended to be, or by its
nature necessarily is, criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial."
89 Firearms, supra, at 362 (citations omitted).

Our inquiry proceeded in two stages. In the first stage, we looked to
Congress' intent, and concluded that "Congress designed forfeiture
under Section 924(d) as a remedial civil sanction."  465 U. S., at
363. This conclusion was based upon several findings. First,
noting that the forfeiture proceeding was in rem, we found it
significant that "actions in rem have traditionally been viewed as civil
proceedings, with jurisdiction dependent upon the seizure of a
physical object."  89 Firearms, id., at 363, citing, Calero-Toledo v.
Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S., at 684. Second, we found
that the forfeiture provision, because it reached both weapons used in
violation of federal law and those "intended to be used" in such a
manner, reached a broader range of conduct than its criminal
analogue. Third, we concluded that the civil forfeiture "further[ed]
broad remedial aims," including both "discouraging unregulated
commerce in firearms," and "removing from circulation firearms that
have been used or intended for use outside regulated channels of
commerce." 89 Firearms, supra, at 364.

In the second stage of our analysis, we looked to "`whether the
statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to
negate' Congress' intention to establish a civil remedial mechanism,"
465 U. S., at 365, quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242,
248-249 (1980). Considering several factors that we had used
previously in order to determine whether a civil proceeding was so
punitive as to require application of the full panoply of constitutional
protections required in a criminal trial, see id., at 248, we found only
one of those factors to be present in the Section 924(d) forfeiture.
By itself, however, the fact that the behavior proscribed by the
forfeiture was already a crime proved insufficient to turn the
forfeiture into a punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Hence, we found that the petitioner had "failed to establish by the
`clearest proof' that Congress has provided a sanction so punitive as
to `transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a
criminal penalty.'"  89 Firearms, supra, at 366, quoting Rex Trailer
Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956). We concluded
our decision by restating that civil forfeiture is "not an additional
penalty for the commission of a criminal act, but rather is a separate
civil sanction, remedial in nature."  89 Firearms, supra, at 366.


Our cases reviewing civil forfeitures under the Double Jeopardy
Clause adhere to a remarkably consistent theme. Though the two-part
analytical construct employed in 89 Firearms was more refined,
perhaps, than that we had used over 50 years earlier in Various
Items, the conclusion was the same in each case: in rem civil
forfeiture is a remedial civil sanction, distinct from potentially
punitive in personam civil penalties such as fines, and does not
constitute a punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Gore
v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392 (1958) ("In applying a
provision like that of double jeopardy, which is rooted in history and
is not an evolving concept . . . a long course of adjudication in this
Court carries impressive authority").

In the case that we currently review, the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit recognized as much, concluding that after 89 Firearms,
"the law was clear that civil forfeitures did not constitute
`punishment' for double jeopardy purposes."  33 F. 3d, at 1218.
Nevertheless, that court read three of our decisions to have
"abandoned" 89 Firearms and the oft-affirmed rule of Various Items.
According to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, through our
decisions in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), Austin
v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), and Department of Revenue
of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. ___ (1994), we "changed [our]
collective mind," and "adopted a new test for determining whether a
nominally civil sanction constitutes `punishment' for double jeopardy
purposes."  33 F. 3d, at 1218-1219. The Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit shared the view of the Ninth Circuit, though it did not
directly rely upon Kurth Ranch. We turn now to consider whether
Halper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch accomplished the radical
jurisprudential shift perceived by the Courts of Appeals.

In Halper, we considered "whether and under what circumstances a
civil penalty may constitute `punishment' for the purposes of double
jeopardy analysis."  Halper, supra, at 436. Based upon his
submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims, each of which
overcharged the Government by $9, Halper was criminally convicted
of 65 counts of violating the false-claims statute, 18 U. S. C. Section
287 (1982 ed.), as well as of 16 counts of mail fraud, and was
sentenced to two years in prison and fined $5,000. Following that
criminal conviction, the Government successfully brought a civil
action against Halper under 31 U. S. C. Section 3729 (1982 ed. and
Supp. II). The District Court hearing the civil action determined that
Halper was liable to the Government for over $130,000 under
Section 3729, which then provided for liability in the amount of
$2,000 per violation, double the Government's actual damages, and
court costs. The court concluded that imposing the full civil penalty
would constitute a second punishment for Halper's already-punished
criminal offense, however, and therefore reduced Halper's liability to
double the actual damages suffered by the Government and the costs
of the civil action. The Government directly appealed that decision to
this Court.

This Court agreed with the District Court's analysis. We determined
that our precedent had established no absolute and irrebuttable rule
that a civil fine cannot be "punishment" under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Though it was well established that "a civil remedy does not
rise to the level of `punishment' merely because Congress provided
for civil recovery in excess of the Government's actual damages," we
found that our case law did "not foreclose the possibility that in a
particular case a civil penalty... may be so extreme and so divorced
from the Government's damages and expenses as to constitute
punishment."  490 U. S., at 442. Emphasizing the case-specific
nature of our inquiry, id., at 448, we compared the size of the fine
imposed on Halper, $130,000, to the damages actually suffered by
the Government as a result of Halper's actions, estimated by the
District Court at $585. Noting that the fine was more than 220 times
greater than the Government's damages, we agreed with the District
Court that "Halper's $130,000 liability is sufficiently
disproportionate that the sanction constitutes a second punishment in
violation of double jeopardy."  Id., at 452. We remanded to the
District Court so that it could hear evidence regarding the
Government's actual damages, and could then reduce Halper's
liability to a nonpunitive level. Ibid.

In Austin, we considered whether a civil forfeiture could violate the
Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution, which provides that "[e]xcessive bail shall not be
required, nor excessive fines imposed . . . ."  U. S. Const., Amdt.
8. Aware that Austin had sold two grams of cocaine the previous
day, police searched his mobile home and body shop. Their search
revealed small amounts of marijuana and cocaine, a handgun, drug
paraphernalia, and almost $5,000 in cash. Austin was charged with
one count of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, to which he
pleaded guilty. The Government then initiated a civil forfeiture
proceeding against Austin's mobile home and auto shop, contending
that they had been "used" or were "intended for use" in the
commission of a drug offense. See 21 U. S. C. Sections 881(a)(4)
and (a)(7). Austin contested the forfeiture on the ground of the
Excessive Fines Clause, but the District Court and the Court of
Appeals held the forfeiture constitutional.

We limited our review to the question "whether the Excessive Fines
Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to forfeitures of property
under 21 U. S. C. Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)."  Austin, supra, at
604. We began our analysis by rejecting the argument that the
Excessive Fines Clause was limited solely to criminal proceedings:
The relevant question was not whether a particular proceeding was
criminal or civil, we determined, but rather was whether forfeiture
under Sections 881 (a)(4) and (a)(7) constituted "punishment" for the
purposes of the Eighth Amendment. Austin, supra, at 610. In an
effort to answer that question, we briefly reviewed the history of civil
forfeiture both in this country and in England, see id., at 611-618,
taking a categorical approach that contrasted sharply with Halper's
case-specific approach to determining whether a civil penalty
constitutes punishment. Ultimately, we concluded that "forfeiture
under [Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)] constitutes `payment to a
sovereign as punishment for some offense,' and, as such, is subject
to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines
Clause."  Id., at 622.

In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. ___
(1994), we considered whether a state tax imposed on marijuana was
invalid under the Double Jeopardy Clause when the taxpayer had
already been criminally convicted of owning the marijuana which
was taxed. We first established that the fact that Montana had labeled
the civil sanction a "tax" did not end our analysis. We then turned to
consider whether the tax was so punitive as to constitute a
punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Several
differences between the marijuana tax imposed by Montana and the
typical revenue-raising tax were readily apparent. The Montana tax
was unique in that it was conditioned on the commission of a crime
and was imposed only after the taxpayer had been arrested: thus,
only a person charged with a criminal offense was subject to the tax.
We also noted that the taxpayer did not own or possess the taxed
marijuana at the time that the tax was imposed. From these
differences, we determined that the tax was motivated by a " `penal
and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of revenue.' "  Id., at
___ (slip op., at 16). Concluding that the Montana tax proceeding
"was the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution,"
we affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment barring the tax. Id., at
___ (slip op., at 17).

We think that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit misread Halper, Austin, and Kurth
Ranch. None of those decisions purported to overrule the well-
established teaching of Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89
Firearms. Halper involved not a civil forfeiture, but a civil penalty.
That its rule was limited to the latter context is clear from the decision
itself, from the historical distinction that we have drawn between civil
forfeiture and civil penalties, and from the practical difficulty of
applying Halper to a civil forfeiture.

In Halper, we emphasized that our decision was limited to the context
of civil penalties:

"What we announce now is a rule for the rare case, the case such as
the one before us, where a fixed-penalty provision subjects a prolific
but small-gauge offender to a sanction overwhelmingly
disproportionate to the damages he has caused. The rule is one of
reason: Where a defendant previously has sustained a criminal
penalty and the civil penalty sought in the subsequent proceeding
bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government
for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as `punishment' in the plain
meaning of the word, then the defendant is entitled to an accounting
of the Government's damages and costs to determine if the penalty
sought in fact constitutes a second punishment."  490 U. S., at 449-
450 (emphasis added).

The narrow focus of Halper followed from the distinction that we
have drawn historically between civil forfeiture and civil penalties.
Since at least Various Items, we have distinguished civil penalties
such as fines from civil forfeiture proceedings that are in rem. While
a "civil action to recover . . . penalties, is punitive in character," and
much like a criminal prosecution in that "it is the wrongdoer in
person who is proceeded against... and punished," in an in rem
forfeiture proceeding, "it is the property which is proceeded against,
and by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned."  Various
Items, 282 U. S., at 580-581. Thus, though for Double Jeopardy
purposes we have never balanced the value of property forfeited in a
particular case against the harm suffered by the Government in that
case, we have balanced the size of a particular civil penalty against
the Government's harm. See, e.g., Rex Trailer Co. v. United
States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956) (fines not "so unreasonable or
excessive" as to transform a civil remedy into a criminal penalty);
United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943) (fine of
$315,000 not so disproportionate to Government's harm of
$101,500 as to transform the fine into punishment). Indeed, the rule
set forth in Halper developed from the teaching of Rex Trailer and
Hess. See Halper, supra, at 445-447.

It is difficult to see how the rule of Halper could be applied to a civil
forfeiture. Civil penalties are designed as a rough form of "liquidated
damages" for the harms suffered by the Government as a result of a
defendant's conduct. See Rex Trailer, supra, at 153-154. The civil
penalty involved in Halper, for example, provided for a fixed
monetary penalty for each false claim count on which the defendant
was convicted in the criminal proceeding. Whether a "fixed-penalty
provision" that seeks to compensate the Government for harm it has
suffered is "so extreme" and "so divorced" from the penalty's
nonpunitive purpose of compensating the Government as to be a
punishment may be determined

by balancing the Government's harm against the size of the penalty.
Civil forfeitures, in contrast to civil penalties, are designed to do
more than simply compensate the Government. Forfeitures serve a
variety of purposes, but are designed primarily to confiscate property
used in violation of the law, and to require disgorgement of the fruits
of illegal conduct. Though it may be possible to quantify the value of
the property forfeited, it is virtually impossible to quantify, even
approximately, the nonpunitive purposes served by a particular civil
forfeiture. Hence, it is practically difficult to determine whether a
particular forfeiture bears no rational relationship to the nonpunitive
purposes of that forfeiture. Quite simply, the case-by-case balancing
test set forth in Halper, in which a court must compare the harm
suffered by the Government against the size of the penalty imposed,
is inapplicable to civil forfeiture.2

We recognized as much in Kurth Ranch. In that case, the Court
expressly disclaimed reliance upon Halper, finding that its case-
specific approach was impossible to apply outside the context of a
fixed civil-penalty provision. Reviewing the Montana marijuana tax,
we held that because "tax statutes serve a purpose quite different
from civil penalties, . . . Halper's method of determining whether the
exaction was remedial or punitive simply does not work in the case
of a tax statute."  Kurth Ranch, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17)
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at 2-
3) (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting) (Halper inapplicable outside of
" `fixed-penalty provision[s]' " that are meant "to recover the costs
incurred by the Government for bringing someone to book for some
violation of law"). This is not to say that there is no occasion for
analysis of the Government's harm. 89 Firearms makes clear the
relevance of an evaluation of the harms alleged. The point is simply
that Halper's case-specific approach is inapplicable to civil
forfeitures.

In the cases that we review, the Courts of Appeals did not find
Halper difficult to apply to civil forfeiture because they concluded
that its case-by-case balancing approach had been supplanted in
Austin by a categorical approach that found a civil sanction to be
punitive if it could not "fairly be said solely to serve a remedial
purpose."  See Austin, 509 U. S., at 610; see also Halper, supra, at
448. But Austin, it must be remembered, did not involve the Double
Jeopardy Clause at all. Austin was decided solely under the
Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, a constitutional
provision which we never have understood as parallel to, or even
related to, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The
only discussion of the Double Jeopardy Clause contained in Austin
appears in a footnote that acknowledges our decisions holding that
"[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil
forfeiture proceedings... where the forfeiture could properly be
characterized as remedial."  Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4. And in
Austin we expressly recognized and approved our decisions in One
Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972), and
United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354
(1984). See Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4.

We acknowledged in Austin that our categorical approach under the
Excessive Fines Clause was wholly distinct from the case-by-case
approach of Halper, and we explained that the difference in approach
was based in a significant difference between the purposes of our
analysis under each constitutional provision. See Austin, supra, at
622, n. 14. It is unnecessary in a case under the Excessive Fines
Clause to inquire at a preliminary stage whether the civil sanction
imposed in that particular case is totally inconsistent with any
remedial goal. Because the second stage of inquiry under the
Excessive Fines Clause asks whether the particular sanction in
question is so large as to be "excessive," see Austin, 509 U. S., at
622-623 (declining to establish criteria for excessiveness), a
preliminary-stage inquiry that focused on the disproportionality of a
particular sanction would be duplicative of the excessiveness analysis
that would follow. See id., at 622, n. 14 ("[I]t appears to make little
practical difference whether the Excessive Fines Clause applies to all
forfeitures . . . or only to those that cannot be characterized as purely
remedial," because the Excessive Fines Clause "prohibits only the
imposition of `excessive' fines, and a fine that serves purely remedial
purposes cannot be considered `excessive' in any event").
Forfeitures effected under 21 U. S. C. Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)
are subject to review for excessiveness under the Eighth Amendment
after Austin; this does not mean, however, that those forfeitures are
so punitive as to constitute punishment for the purposes of double
jeopardy. The holding of Austin was limited to the Excessive Fines
Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and we decline to import the
analysis of Austin into our double jeopardy jurisprudence.

In sum, nothing in Halper, Kurth Ranch, or Austin, purported to
replace our traditional understanding that civil forfeiture does not
constitute punishment for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Congress long has authorized the Government to bring
parallel criminal proceedings and civil forfeiture proceedings, and
this Court consistently has found civil forfeitures not to constitute
punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. It would have been
quite remarkable for this Court both to have held unconstitutional a
well-established practice, and to have overruled a long line of
precedent, without having even suggested that it was doing so.
Halper dealt with in personam civil penalties under the Double
Jeopardy Clause; Kurth Ranch with a tax proceeding under the
Double Jeopardy Clause; and Austin with civil forfeitures under the
Excessive Fines Clause. None of those cases dealt with the subject
of this case: in rem civil forfeitures for purposes of the Double
Jeopardy Clause.


We turn now to consider the forfeitures in these cases under the
teaching of Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms.
Because it provides a useful analytical tool, we conduct our inquiry
within the framework of the two-part test used in 89 Firearms. First,
we ask whether Congress intended proceedings under 21 U. S. C.
Section 881, and 18 U. S. C. Section 981, to be criminal or civil.
Second, we turn to consider whether the proceedings are so punitive
in fact as to "persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding[s] may not
legitimately be viewed as civil in nature," despite Congress' intent.
89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 366.

There is little doubt that Congress intended these forfeitures to be
civil proceedings. As was the case in 89 Firearms, "Congress' intent
in this regard is most clearly demonstrated by the procedural
mechanisms it established for enforcing forfeitures under the
statute[s]."  465 U. S., at 363. Both 21 U. S. C. Section 881 and
18 U. S. C. Section 981, which is entitled "Civil forfeiture," provide
that the laws "relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture,
and condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws . . .
shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred" under Section 881
and Section 981. See 21 U. S. C. Section 881(d); 18 U. S. C.
Section 981(d). Because forfeiture proceedings under the customs
laws are in rem, see 19 U. S. C. Section 1602 et seq., it is clear that
Congress intended that a forfeiture under Section 881 or Section 981,
like the forfeiture reviewed in 89 Firearms, would be a proceeding in
rem. Congress specifically structured these forfeitures to be
impersonal by targeting the property itself. "In contrast to the in
personam nature of criminal actions, actions in rem have traditionally
been viewed as civil proceedings, with jurisdiction dependent upon
seizure of a physical object." 89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 363, citing
Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 684.

Other procedural mechanisms governing forfeitures under Section
981 and Section 881 also indicate that Congress intended such
proceedings to be civil. Forfeitures under either statute are governed
by 19 U. S. C. Section 1607, which provides that actual notice of the
impending forfeiture is unnecessary when the Government cannot
identify any party with an interest in the seized article, and by Section
1609, which provides that seized property is subject to forfeiture
through a summary administrative procedure if no party files a claim
to the property. And 19 U. S. C. Section 1615, which governs the
burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings under Section 881 and
Section 981, provides that once the Government has shown probable
cause that the property is subject to forfeiture, then "the burden of
proof shall lie upon [the] claimant."  In sum, "[b]y creating such
distinctly civil procedures for forfeitures under [Section 881 and
Section 981], Congress has `indicate[d] clearly that it intended a
civil, not a criminal sanction.'" 89 Firearms, supra, at 363, quoting
Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S., at 402.3

Moving to the second stage of our analysis, we find that there is little
evidence, much less the " `clearest proof' " that we require, see 89
Firearms, supra, at 365, quoting Ward, 448 U. S., at 249,
suggesting that forfeiture proceedings under 21 U. S. C. Sections
881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and 19 U. S. C. Section 981(a)(1)(A), are so
punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite
Congress' intent to the contrary. The statutes involved in this case
are, in most significant respects, indistinguishable from those
reviewed, and held not to be punitive, in Various Items, Emerald Cut
Stones, and 89 Firearms.

Most significant is that Section 981(a)(1)(A), and Sections 881(a)(6)
and (a)(7), while perhaps having certain punitive aspects, serve
important nonpunitive goals. Title 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7),
under which Ursery's property was forfeited, provides for the
forfeiture of "all real property . . . which is used or intended to be
used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the
commission of" a federal drug felony. Requiring the forfeiture of
property used to commit federal narcotics violations encourages
property owners to take care in managing their property and ensures
that they will not permit that property to be used for illegal purposes.
See Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. ___, ___  (1996) (slip op., at
10) ("Forfeiture of property prevents illegal uses... by imposing an
economic penalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable");
89 Firearms, supra, at 364 (forfeiture "discourages unregulated
commerce in firearms"); Calero-Toledo, supra, at 687-688. In many
circumstances, the forfeiture may abate a nuisance. See, e.g., United
States v. 141st Street Corp., 911 F. 2d 870 (CA2 1990) (forfeiting
apartment building used to sell crack cocaine); see also Bennis,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (affirming application of Michigan
statute abating car as a nuisance; forfeiture "prevent[s] further illicit
use of" property); cf. 89 Firearms, supra, at 364 (forfeiture
"remov[ed] from circulation firearms that have been used or intended
for use" illegally); Emerald Cut Stones, 409 U. S., at 237 (forfeiture
"prevented forbidden merchandise from circulating in the United
States").

The forfeiture of the property claimed by Arlt and Wren took place
pursuant to 18 U. S. C. Section 981(a)(1)(A), and 21 U. S. C.
Section 881(a)(6). Section 981(a)(1)(A) provides for the forfeiture
of "any property" involved in illegal money-laundering transactions.
Section 881(a)(6) provides for the forfeiture of "[a]ll . . . things of
value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in
exchange for" illegal drugs; "all proceeds traceable to such an
exchange"; and "all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities
used or intended to be used to facilitate" a federal drug felony. The
same remedial purposes served by Section 881(a)(7) are served by
Section 881(a)(6) and Section 981(a)(1)(A). Only one point merits
separate discussion. To the extent that Section 881(a)(6) applies to
"proceeds" of illegal drug activity, it serves the additional
nonpunitive goal of ensuring that persons do not profit from their
illegal acts.

Other considerations that we have found relevant to the question
whether a proceeding is criminal also tend to support a conclusion
that Section 981(a)(1)(A) and Sections 881 (a)(6) and (a)(7) are civil
proceedings. See Ward, supra, at 247-248, n. 7, 249 (listing
relevant factors and noting that they are neither exhaustive nor
dispositive). First, in light of our decisions in Various Items,
Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms, and the long tradition of
federal statutes providing for a forfeiture proceeding following a
criminal prosecution, it is absolutely clear that in rem civil forfeiture
has not historically been regarded as punishment, as we have
understood that term under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,
there is no requirement in the statutes that we currently review that
the Government demonstrate scienter in order to establish that the
property is subject to forfeiture; indeed, the property may be subject
to forfeiture even if no party files a claim to it and the Government
never shows any connection between the property and a particular
person. See 19 U. S. C. Section 1609. Though both Section 881(a)
and Section 981(a) contain an "innocent owner" exception, we do not
think that such a provision, without more indication of an intent to
punish, is relevant to the question whether a statute is punitive under
the Double Jeopardy Clause. Third, though both statutes may fairly
be said to serve the purpose of deterrence, we long have held that this
purpose may serve civil as well as criminal goals. See, e.g., 89
Firearms, supra, at 364; Calero-Toledo, supra, at 677-678. We
recently reaffirmed this conclusion in Bennis v. Michigan, supra, at
___ (slip. op., at 10), where we held that "forfeiture . . . serves a
deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose." Finally,
though both statutes are tied to criminal activity, as was the case in 89
Firearms, this fact is insufficient to render the statutes punitive. See
89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 365-366. It is well settled that "Congress
may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same
act or omission," Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399. By itself, the fact
that a forfeiture statute has some connection to a criminal violation is
far from the "clearest proof" necessary to show that a proceeding is
criminal.

We hold that these in rem civil forfeitures are neither "punishment"
nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The
judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in No. 95-
345, and of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in No. 95-
346, are accordingly reversed.

It is so ordered.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion and add these further observations.

In Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 619-622 (1993), we
described the civil in rem forfeiture provision of 21 U. S. C. Section
881(a)(7) at issue here as punitive. In Libretti v. United States, 516
U. S. ___ (1995), we reviewed 21 U. S. C. Section 853, which in
almost identical terms provides for criminal forfeiture of property
involved in or derived from drug crimes. We held that the
"fundamental nature of criminal forfeiture" is punishment. 516 U.
S., at ___ (slip op. at 11). Today the Court holds that the civil in
rem forfeitures here are not punishment implicating the protections of
the Double Jeopardy Clause. Ante, at 24-25. I write to explain why,
in my view, our holding is consistent with both Austin and Libretti.

The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall "be subject for
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."  U. S.
Const., Amdt. 5. We have interpreted the Double Jeopardy Clause
to "protec[t] against a second prosecution for the same offense after
acquittal, against a second prosecution for the same offense after
conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense."
Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294, 306-
307 (1984); Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 380-381 (1989).

Although there is language in our cases to the contrary, see One 1958
Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693, 700 (1965); Boyd
v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 634 (1886), civil in rem forfeiture
is not punishment of the wrongdoer for his criminal offense. We
made this clear in Various Items of Personal Property v. United
States, 282 U. S. 577 (1931), which the Court is right to deem the
seminal case in this area, ante, at 5.

"[This] forfeiture proceeding . . . is in rem. It is the property which
is proceeded against, and, by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and
condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and
insentient. In a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person
who is proceeded against, convicted and punished. The forfeiture is
no part of the punishment for the criminal offense. The provision of
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution in respect of double
jeopardy does not apply."  282 U. S., at 581 (citations omitted).

Embracing the rule of Various Items, that the Double Jeopardy
Clause applies only to in personam punishments of the wrongdoer
and not in rem forfeitures, does not imply that forfeiture inflicts no
punishment. Though I have expressed my doubts about the view
expressed in Austin, 509 U. S., at 611-618, that throughout history
forfeitures have been intended to punish blameworthy owners, id., at
629 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Bennis
v. Michigan, 516 U. S. ___, ___ (1996) (dissenting opinion) (slip
op. at 1-2), I did not there question the punitive nature of Section
881(a)(7), nor do I now. Under this statute, providing for the
forfeiture of real property used to facilitate a drug offense, only the
culpable stand to lose their property; no interest of any owner is
forfeited if he can show he did not know of or consent to the crime.
Ibid.

The key distinction is that the
instrumentality-forfeiture statutes are not directed at those who carry
out the crimes, but at owners who are culpable for the criminal
misuse of the property. See Austin, supra, at 619 (statutory
"exemptions serve to focus the provisions on the culpability of the
owner"). The theory is that the property, whether or not illegal or
dangerous in nature, is hazardous in the hands of this owner because
either he uses it to commit crimes, or allows others do so. The
owner can be held accountable for the misuse of the property. Cf.
One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, supra, at 699 ("There is nothing even
remotely criminal in possessing an automobile. It is only the alleged
use to which this particular automobile was put that subjects [the
owner] to its possible loss.") The same rationale is at work in the
statutory provisions enabling forfeiture of currency "used or intended
to be used" to facilitate a criminal offense, Section 881(a)(6). See
also 18 U. S. C. Section 981(a)(1)(A) (property involved in money-
laundering transactions or attempts in violation of 18 U. S. C.
Section 1956). Since the punishment befalls any propertyholder who
cannot claim statutory innocence, whether or not he committed any
criminal acts, it is not a punishment for a person's criminal
wrongdoing.

Forfeiture, then, punishes an owner by taking property involved in a
crime, and it may happen that the owner is also the wrongdoer
charged with a criminal offense. But the forfeiture is not a second in
personam punishment for the offense, which is all the Double
Jeopardy Clause prohibits. See ante, at 8 ("The forfeitures were not
criminal punishments because they did not impose a second in
personam penalty for the criminal defendant's wrongdoing."); One
Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 235 (1972)
(per curiam) ("the forfeiture is not barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it involves neither two
criminal trials nor two criminal punishments").

Civil in rem forfeiture has long been understood as independent of
criminal punishments. In The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 (1827), we
rejected a claim that a libel in rem required a conviction for the
criminal offense charged in the libel. Distinguishing forfeitures of a
felon's goods and chattels, which required proof of a conviction, we
noted that the statutory in rem "offence is attached primarily to the
thing," and that often in rem forfeiture was imposed in the absence of
any in personam penalty. Id., at 14. Examining American and
English statutes, we concluded, "the practice has been, and so this
Court understand[s] the law to be, that the proceeding in rem stands
independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding in
personam."  Id., at 15.

Distinguishing between in rem and in personam punishments does
not depend upon, or revive, the fiction alive in Various Items, supra,
at 581, but condemned in Austin, supra, at 615, n. 9, that the
property is punished as if it were a sentient being capable of moral
choice. It is the owner who feels the pain and receives the stigma of
the forfeiture, not the property. See United States v. United States
Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715, 718 (1971). The distinction
simply recognizes that Congress, in order to quiet title to forfeitable
property in one proceeding, has structured the forfeiture action as a
proceeding against the property, not against a particular defendant.
Indeed, the Government will often file a forfeiture complaint without
any knowledge of who the owner is. See ante, at 24. True, the
forfeiture statutes require proof of a violation of a drug trafficking or
other offense, but the purpose of this predicate showing is just to
establish that the property was used in a crime. In contrast to
criminal forfeiture, see 21 U. S. C. Section 853(a), civil in rem
forfeiture actions do not require a showing that the owner who stands
to lose his property interest has committed a criminal offense. See 21
U. S. C. Section 881(a)(6) ("any violation of this subchapter");
Section 881(a)(7) ("a violation of this subchapter"); 18 U. S. C.
Section 981(a)(1)(A) ("a transaction or attempted transaction in
violation of" 18 U. S. C. Section 1956). The offenses committed by
Ursery, Arlt, and Wren were proffered as evidence that the property
was used in a crime, but this does not make forfeiture a punishment
for those offenses. See United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 366 (1984) (civil forfeiture is "not an
additional penalty for the commission of a criminal act").

For this reason, JUSTICE STEVENS' attempt, post, at 22-23, to
rely on the same-elements test of Blockburger v. United States, 284
U. S. 299, 304 (1932), is unavailing. Blockburger is a misfit in this
context; it compares the elements of two offenses charged against a
defendant. The forfeiture cause of action is not charging a second
offense of the person; it is a proceeding against the property in which
proof of a criminal violation by any person will suffice, provided that
some knowledge of or consent to the crime on the part of the
property owner is also established.

In Part II-C of its opinion, the Court conducts the two-part inquiry
established in 89 Firearms, supra, at 362-366, as to whether, first,
Congress intended the proceedings to be civil, and, second, the
forfeitures are so punitive as to be criminal in nature and therefore
subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Ante, at 20. The test was
imported by the 89 Firearms Court from cases involving civil in
personam penalties. See 465 U. S., at 362 (citing Helvering v.
Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 398-399 (1938), and United States v.
Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980)). In the context of this case and
the precedents bearing upon it, I am not sure the test adds much to
the clear rule of Various Items that civil in rem forfeiture of property
involved in a crime is not punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy
Clause. As to the first prong of the test, any in rem proceeding is
civil. As to the second prong, so long as forfeiture hinges on the
property's use in a crime, there will always be the remedial purpose
the Court identifies of preventing property owners from allowing
their goods to be used for illegal purposes, ante, at 22. I
acknowledge 89 Firearms to be precedent, however, and, because
the Court's application of the test is consistent with Various Items, I
join its opinion in full.

$405,089.23 IN UNITED STATES CURRENCY ET AL.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 24, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.

The question the Court poses is whether civil forfeitures constitute
"punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because
the numerous federal statutes authorizing forfeitures cover such a
wide variety of situations, it is quite wrong to assume that there is
only one answer to that question. For purposes of analysis it is
useful to identify three different categories of property that are subject
to seizure: proceeds, contraband, and property that has played a part
in the commission of a crime. The facts of these two cases illustrate
the point.

In No. 95-346 the Government has forfeited $405,089.23 in
currency. Those funds are the proceeds of unlawful activity. They
are not property that respondents have any right to retain. The
forfeiture of such proceeds, like the confiscation of money stolen
from a bank, does not punish respondents because it exacts no price
in liberty or lawfully derived property from them. I agree that the
forfeiture of such proceeds is not punitive and therefore I concur in
the Court's disposition of No. 95-346.

None of the property seized in No. 95-345 constituted proceeds of
illegal activity. Indeed, the facts of that case reveal a dramatically
different situation. Respondent Ursery cultivated marijuana in a
heavily wooded area not far from his home in Shiawassee County,
Michigan. The illegal substance was consumed by members of his
family, but there is no evidence, and no contention by the
Government, that he sold any of it to third parties. Acting on the
basis of the incorrect assumption that the marijuana plants were on
respondent's property, Michigan police officers executed a warrant to
search the premises. In his house they found marijuana seeds, stems,
stalks, and a growlight. I presume those items were seized, and I
have no difficulty concluding that such a seizure does not constitute
punishment because respondent had no right to possess contraband.
Accordingly, I agree with the Court's opinion insofar as it explains
why the forfeiture of contraband does not constitute punishment for
double jeopardy purposes.

The critical question presented in No. 95-345 arose, not out of the
seizure of contraband by the Michigan police, but rather out of the
decision by the United States Attorney to take respondent's home.
There is no evidence that the house had been purchased with the
proceeds of unlawful activity and the house itself was surely not
contraband. Nonetheless, 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7) authorized
the Government to seek forfeiture of respondent's residence because
it had been used to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of
marijuana.1 Respondent was then himself prosecuted for and
convicted of manufacturing marijuana. In my opinion none of the
reasons supporting the forfeiture of proceeds or contraband provides
a sufficient basis for concluding that the confiscation of respondent's
home was not punitive.

The Government has advanced four arguments in support of its
position that the forfeiture of respondent's home under Section
881(a)(7) followed by his prosecution under Section 841(a)(1) did
not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause: (1) the forfeiture was not
punitive; (2) even if punitive, it was not a "jeopardy"; (3) even if both
the forfeiture and the prosecution were jeopardies, they were not
based on the same offense under the rule of Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932); and (4) in all events, the two cases
should be deemed to constitute a single proceeding for double
jeopardy purposes. Because the Court addresses only the first of
these arguments, I shall begin by explaining why both reason and
precedent support the conclusion that the taking of respondent's
home was unmistakably punitive in character. I shall then comment
on the other three arguments.


In recent years, both Congress and the state legislatures have armed
their law enforcement authorities with new powers to forfeit property
that vastly exceed their traditional tools.2   In response, this Court
has reaf-firmed the fundamental proposition that all forfeitures must
be accomplished within the constraints set by the Constitution. See,
e.g., Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993); United States
v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43 (1993). This
Term the Court has begun dismantling the protections it so recently
erected. In Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. ___ (1996), the Court
held that officials may confiscate an innocent person's automobile.
And today, for the first time it upholds the forfeiture of a person's
home. On the way to its surprising conclusion that the owner is not
punished by the loss of his residence, the Court repeatedly professes
its adherence to tradition and time-honored practice. As I discuss
below, however, the decision shows a stunning disregard not only
for modern precedents but for our older ones as well.

In the Court's view, the seminal case is Various Items of Personal
Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577 (1931), which approved
the forfeiture of an illegal distillery by resort to the "legal fiction" that
the distillery rather than its owner was being punished "as though it
were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient."  Id., at 581.
Starting from that fanciful premise, the Court was able to conclude
that confiscating the property after the owner was prosecuted for the
underlying violations of the revenue laws did not offend the Double
Jeopardy Clause.

According to the Court, Various Items established a categorical rule
that the Double Jeopardy Clause was "inapplicable to civil forfeiture
actions."  Ante, at 6. The Court asserts that this rule has received
"remarkably consistent" application and was "reaffirmed" by a pair of
cases in 1972 and 1984. Ante, at 10, 7. In reality, however, shortly
after its announcement, Various Items simply disappeared from our
jurisprudence. We cited that case in only two decisions over the next
seven years, and never again in nearly six decades. Neither of the
two cases that supposedly "affirmed" Various Items--One Lot
Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per
curiam), and United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465
U. S. 354 (1984)--even mentioned it.

More important, neither of those cases endorsed the asserted
categorical rule that civil forfeitures never give rise to double
jeopardy rights. Instead, each carefully considered the nature of the
particular forfeiture at issue, classifying it as either "punitive" or
"remedial," before deciding whether it implicated double jeopardy.
Emerald Cut Stones concerned a customs statute that authorized
confiscation of certain merchandise, in that case jewelry, that had
been smuggled into the United States. The Court explained that the
purpose of the statute was to remove such items from circulation, and
that the penalty amounted to a reasonable liquidated damages award
to reimburse the Government for the costs of enforcement and
investigation. In those respects, therefore, it constituted a "remedial
rather than punitive sanctio[n]."  409 U. S., at 237. In 89 Firearms,
the Court explored in even greater detail the character of a federal
statute that forfeited unregistered firearms. It reasoned that the
sanction "further[ed] broad remedial aims" in preventing commerce
in such weapons, and also covered a broader range of conduct than
simply criminal behavior. 465 U. S., at 364. For those reasons, it
was not properly characterized as a punitive sanction.

The majority, surprisingly, claims that Austin v. United States, 509
U. S. 602 (1993), "expressly recognized and approved" those
decisions. Ante, at 18. But the Court creates the appearance that we
endorsed its interpretation of 89 Firearms and Emerald Cut Stones by
quoting selectively from Austin. We actually stated the following:

"The Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil
forfeiture proceedings, but only in cases where the forfeiture could
properly be characterized as remedial. See United States v. One
Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984); One Lot
Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972);
see generally United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 446-449
(1989) (Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits second sanction that may
not be fairly characterized as remedial)."  509 U. S., at 608, n. 4
(emphasis added).

In reality, both cases rejected the monolithic view that all in rem civil
forfeitures should be treated the same, and recognized the possibility
that other types of forfeitures that could not "properly be
characterized as remedial" might constitute "an additional penalty for
the commission of a criminal act."  465 U. S., at 366.

That possibility was not merely speculative. The Court had already
decided that other constitutional protections applied to forfeitures that
had a punitive element. In Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616
(1886), the Court held that compulsory production of an individual's
private papers for use in a proceeding to forfeit his property for
alleged fraud against the revenue laws violated both the Fourth
Amendment and the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause.
As the Court stated, "proceedings instituted for the purpose of
declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by reason of offences
committed by him, though they may be civil in form, are in their
nature criminal" and thus give rise to these constitutional safeguards.
Id., at 634.

We reaffirmed Boyd twice during the span of time between our
decisions in Various Items and 89 Firearms. In One 1958 Plymouth
Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693 (1965), the Court
unanimously repeated Boyd's conclusion that "a forfeiture
proceeding is quasi-criminal in character" and "[i]ts object, like a
criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense
against the law."  The Court therefore held that the Fourth
Amendment applied to a proceeding to forfeit an automobile used to
transport illegally manufactured liquor. Id., at 700.

Even more significant is United States v. United States Coin &
Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), in which the Court again held that
the Fifth Amendment applied to forfeiture proceedings. Coin &
Currency involved the confiscation of gambling money under a
statute, quite similar to 21 U. S. C. Section 881, providing that "[i]t
shall be unlawful to have or possess any property intended for use in
violating the provisions of the internal revenue laws . . . and no
property right shall exist in any such property."  Id., at 716 (citing 26
U. S. C. Section 7302). The Court held that the Fifth Amendment
barred the Government's attempt to introduce evidence of the
defendant's failure to file required tax forms against him in the
forfeiture proceeding. Following Boyd, the Court explained that the
form of the proceeding as civil or criminal could not have any bearing
on the rights that attached when the sanction was a penalty. "From
the relevant constitutional standpoint, there is no difference between a
man who `forfeits' $8,674 because he has used the money in illegal
gambling activities and a man who pays a `criminal fine' of $8,674
as a result of the same course of conduct."  401 U. S., at 718. In
each case, the Court reasoned, the liability derives from the same
offense of the owner; hence, "the Fifth Amendment applies with
equal force."  Ibid.

Emerald Cut Stones expressly recognized the continuing validity of
Coin & Currency and One 1958 Plymouth Sedan. It distinguished
the customs statute in that case because the forfeiture did not depend
on the fact of a criminal offense or conviction. See 409 U. S., at
236, n. 6. See also United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 254
(1980) (discussing Boyd). That recognition is critical. For whatever
its connection to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth
Amendment, the Double Jeopardy Clause is part of the same
Amendment as the Self-Incrimination Clause, and ought to be
interpreted in pari materia.3   By confining its holding to civil
forfeitures fairly characterized as remedial, and by distinguishing
cases that had applied the Fifth Amendment to other types of
forfeitures, Emerald Cut Stones and 89 Firearms recognized the
possibility that the Double Jeopardy Clause might apply to certain
punitive civil forfeiture proceedings. One of the mysteries of the
Court's opinion is that although it claims that civil in rem forfeiture
cannot be understood as punishment, it devotes Part II-C to
examining the actual purposes of the forfeiture in this case and
"proving" that they are not punitive. If the Court truly adhered to the
logic of its position, that entire section would be unnecessary.

Read properly, therefore, 89 Firearms and Emerald Cut Stones are
not inconsistent with, but set the stage for the modern understanding
of how the Double Jeopardy Clause applies in nominally civil
proceedings. That understanding has been developed in a trio of
recent decisions: United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989),
Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), and Department of
Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. ___ (1994). The
court of appeals found that the combined effect of two of those
decisions--Halper and Austin--established the proposition that
forfeitures under 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7) implicated double
jeopardy. This Court rejects that conclusion, asserting that none of
these cases changed the "oft-affirmed rule" of Various Items. Ante,
at 10.

It is the majority, however, that has "misread" Halper, Austin, and
Kurth Ranch by artificially cabining each to a separate sphere, see
ante, at 20, and treating the three as if they concerned unrelated
subjects. In fact, all three were devoted to the common enterprise of
giving meaning to the idea of "punishment," a concept that plays a
central role in the jurisprudence of both the Excessive Fines Clause
and the Double Jeopardy Clause. Halper laid down a general rule for
applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to civil proceedings:

"[A] civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial
purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either
retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to
understand the term.... We therefore hold that under the Double
Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a
criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil
sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be
characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution."  490
U. S., at 448-449.

In the past seven years, we have applied that same rule to three types
of sanctions: civil penalties, civil forfeitures, and taxes.

The first was the subject of Halper itself. The defendant had been
convicted for submitting 65 false claims for reimbursement (seeking
$12 for each, when the actual services rendered entitled him to only
$3) to a Medicare provider, and sentenced to imprisonment for 2
years and a $5,000 fine. The Government then brought a civil action
against him for the same offenses. The penalty for violating the civil
false-claims statute consisted of double the Government's damages
plus court costs and a fixed fine of $2,000 per false claim. See id.,
at 438. Accordingly, the Government sought a penalty of $130,000,
although the defendant's fraud had caused an actual loss of only
$585. Applying the definition of "punishment" given above, the
Court first held that the fixed $2,000 fine served a remedial purpose
because it was designed to compensate the Government "roughly"
for the costs of law enforcement and investigation. Id., at 445.
Despite finding that the fine was not by nature punitive, the Court
went on to consider whether the sanction "as applied in the individual
case," id., at 448, amounted to punishment. It answered that
question in the affirmative, for the applied sanction created a
"tremendous disparity" with the amount of harm the defendant
actually caused. Id., at 452. The Court explained that, as a rule, a
fixed penalty that would otherwise serve remedial ends could still
punish the defendant if the imposed amount was out of all proportion
to the damage done.4

The second category of sanctions--civil
forfeitures--was the subject of Austin. In that case, the Government
sought to forfeit the petitioner's mobile home and auto body shop as
instrumentalities of the drug trade under 21 U. S. C. Sections
881(a)(4) and (a)(7) because he had sold cocaine there. Applying
Halper's definition of punishment, see 509 U. S., at 610, 621, we
held that Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) must be considered to qualify
as such, partly because forfeitures have historically been understood
as punishment and more importantly because no remedial purpose
underlay the sanction the statute created. Merely compensating the
Government for its costs, as in Halper, could not justify the
forfeiture scheme because "[t]he value of the conveyances and real
property forfeitable under Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) . . . can vary
so dramatically that any relationship between the Government's
actual costs and the amount of the sanction is merely coincidental."
509 U. S., at 622, n. 14. Accordingly, we held that any forfeiture
was subject to the constraints of the Excessive Fines Clause of the
Eighth Amendment.

The Court expends a great deal of effort attempting to distinguish
Austin away as purely an excessive fines case. The Court states, for
example, that it is "difficult to see" how one would apply the "rule of
Halper" to a civil forfeiture such as was present in Austin. Ante, at
15. But the Court conflates the two different rules that Halper
announced. As discussed above, Austin expressly quoted Halper
and followed its general rule that a sanction should be characterized
as "punishment" if it serves any punitive end. See 509 U. S., at
610, 621. It relegated to a footnote Halper's narrower rule--the one
for the "rare case," which requires an accounting of the
Government's damages and costs--because it had already decided
that the statute was of a punitive character. 509 U. S., at 622, n. 14.
That approach was perfectly appropriate. There is no need to
determine whether a statute that is punitive by design has a punitive
effect when applied in the individual case. Halper is entirely
consistent with Austin, because it determined first that the sanction
there generally did not have a punitive character before it considered
whether some applications might be punitive nonetheless.5

The majority implies that Austin's "categorical approach" is
somehow suspect as an application of double jeopardy jurisprudence,
ante, at 18, but Kurth Ranch definitively refutes that suggestion. The
sanction there was a tax imposed on marijuana and applied to a
taxpayer who had already been prosecuted for ownership of the
drugs sought to be taxed. Again applying Halper's definition of
punishment, see 511 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9-10), we considered
the nature of the tax, focusing on several unusual features that
distinguished it from ordinary revenue-raising provisions, and
concluded that it was motivated by a "penal and prohibitory intent."
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).6   On that basis, we held that imposition
of the tax after criminal prosecution of the taxpayer violated double
jeopardy. The approach taken was thus identical to that followed in
Austin. By considering and rejecting each of the asserted "remedial"
interests served by the sanction, we reasoned that the tax had an
"unmistakable punitive character" that rendered it punishment in all of
its applications. 511 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).

The claim that Halper's "case-by-case" method is "impossible to
apply" to forfeitures or taxes, ante, at 17, thus misses the point. It is
true that since fixed penalties can serve only one remedial end
(compensation), it is easy to determine whether a particular fine is
punitive in application. Forfeitures and taxes, generally speaking,
may have a number of remedial rationales. But to decide if a sanction
is punitive, one need only examine each claimed remedial interest and
determine whether the sanction actually promotes it. Many of our
cases have followed just such an approach, regardless of whether
any nonpunitive purpose can be "quantif[ied]," ante, at 16. See, e.g.,
Austin; One 1958 Plymouth Sedan. The majority itself embarks on
such an inquiry in Part II-C of its opinion. Furthermore, even in the
context of forfeitures and taxes, nothing prevents a court from
deciding that although a sanction is designed to be remedial, its
application in a particular case is so extreme as to constitute
punishment. Austin, 509 U. S., at 608, n. 4.7

In reaching the conclusion that the civil forfeiture at issue yielded
punishment, the Austin Court surveyed the history of civil forfeitures
at some length. That history is replete with expressions of the idea
that forfeitures constitute punishment.8   But it was not necessary in
Austin, strictly speaking, to decide that all in rem forfeitures are
punitive. As JUSTICE SCALIA emphasized in his separate opinion,
it was only necessary to characterize the specific "in rem forfeiture in
this case."  509 U. S., at 626 (concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). The punitive nature of Sections 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) was
accepted by every Member of the Austin Court. The majority offered
several reasons for its holding. The applicable provisions expressly
provided an "innocent owner" defense, indicating that culpability was
a requirement for forfeiture. Further, the provisions tied forfeiture
directly to the commission of narcotics offenses. Id., at 620.
Finally, the legislative history indicated that the provisions were
necessary because traditional criminal sanctions were "`inadequate to
deter or punish.'"  Ibid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 191
(1983)). In sum, it was unanimously agreed that "[s]tatutory
forfeitures under Section 881(a) are certainly payment (in kind), to a
sovereign as punishment for an offense."  509 U. S., at 626-627
(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(emphasis in original).9

Remarkably, the Court today stands Austin on its head--a decision
rendered only three years ago, with unanimity on the pertinent
points--and concludes that Section 881(a)(7) is remedial rather than
punitive in character. Every reason Austin gave for treating Section
881(a)(7) as punitive--the Court rejects or ignores. Every reason the
Court provides for treating Section 881(a)(7) as remedial--Austin
rebuffed. The Court claims that its conclusion is consistent with
decisions reviewing statutes "indistinguishable" "in most significant
respects" from Section 881(a)(7), ante, at 20, but ignores the fact that
Austin reached the opposite conclusion as to the identical statute
under review here.

First, the Court supposes that forfeiture of respondent's house is
remedial in nature because it was an instrumentality of a drug crime.
It is perfectly conceivable that certain kinds of instruments used in the
commission of crimes could be forfeited for remedial purposes.
Items whose principal use is illegal--for example, the distillery in
Various Items--might be thus forfeitable. But it is difficult to
understand how a house in which marijuana was found helped to
substantially "facilitate" a narcotics offense, or how forfeiture of that
house will meaningfully thwart the drug trade. In Austin, we
rejected the argument that a mobile home and body shop were
"instruments" of drug trafficking simply because marijuana was sold
out of them. I see no basis for a distinction here.10

Second, the Court claims that the statute serves the purpose of
deterrence, which helps to show that it is remedial rather than
punitive in character. Ante, at 24. That statement cannot be squared
with our precedents. Halper expressly held, and Austin and Kurth
Ranch reaffirmed, that "a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said
solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained
as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is
punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 490 U.
S., at 448. "`Retribution and deterrence are not legitimate
nonpunitive governmental objectives.'"  Ibid. (emphasis added)
(quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979)). To
say otherwise is to renounce Halper's central holding. If deterrence
is a legitimate remedial rationale "distinct from" any punitive
purpose, ante, at 23, then the $130,000 fine in Halper could not be
condemned as excessive because it plainly served a powerful
deterrent function. It was a premise of the Court's analysis in that
case that deterrence could not justify a penal sanction. As in Bennis
v. Michigan, where the Court first announced this new view of
deterrence, it simply ignores Halper without explanation or comment.
See 516 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

For good measure, the Court also rejects two considerations that
persuaded the majority in Austin to find 21 U. S. C. Section
881(a)(7) a punitive statute. The Court first asserts that the statute
contains no scienter requirement and property may be forfeited
summarily if no one files claim to it. Ante, at 24 (citing 19 U. S. C.
Section 1609). Property that is not claimed, however, is considered
abandoned; it proves nothing that the Government is able to forfeit
property that no one owns. Any time the Government seeks to
forfeit claimed property, it must prove that the claimant is culpable,
for the statute contains an express "innocent owner" exception.
Today the Court finds the structure of the statute irrelevant, but
Austin said that the exemption for innocent owners "makes [the
statute] look more like punishment."  509 U. S., at 619. In United
States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), the
Court found a forfeiture statute punitive on the basis of discretionary
authority granted to the Secretary of the Treasury to remit property to
innocent owners that was provided by a different statute.

Finally, the Court announces that the fact that the statute is "tied to
criminal activity" is insufficient to render it punitive. Ante, at 24.
Austin expressly relied on Congress' decision to "tie forfeiture
directly to the commission of drug offenses" as evidence that it was
intended to be punitive. 509 U. S., at 620.11

The recurrent theme of the Court's opinion is that there is some
mystical difference between in rem and in personam proceedings,
such that only the latter can give rise to double jeopardy concerns.
The Court claims that "[s]ince at least Various Items," we have
drawn this distinction for purposes of applying relevant constitutional
provisions. Ante, at 14-15. That statement, however, is incorrect.
We have repeatedly rejected the idea that the nature of the court's
jurisdiction has any bearing on the constitutional protections that
apply at a proceeding before it. "From the relevant constitutional
standpoint, there is no difference between a man who `forfeits'
$8,674 because he has used the money in illegal gambling activities
and a man who pays a `criminal fine' of $8,674 as a result of the
same course of conduct."  Coin & Currency, 401 U. S., at 718. See
also One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, 380 U. S., at 701, n. 11; Boyd,
116 U. S., at 638.12   Most recently, in our application of Halper's
definition of punishment, we stated that "[w]e do not understand the
Government to rely separately on the technical distinction between
proceedings in rem and proceedings in personam, but we note that
any such reliance would be misplaced."  Austin, 509 U. S., at 615,
n. 9.13

The notion that the label attached to the proceeding is dispositive runs
contrary to the trend of our recent cases. In Halper we stated that
"the labels `criminal' and `civil' are not of paramount importance" in
determining whether a proceeding punishes an individual. 490 U.
S., at 447. In Kurth Ranch we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause
applies to punitive proceedings even if they are labeled a tax. Indeed,
in reaching that conclusion, we followed a 1931 decision that noted
that a tax statute might be considered punitive for double jeopardy
purposes.14   It is thus far too late in the day to contend that the label
placed on a punitive proceeding determines whether it is covered by
the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The pedantic distinction between in rem and in personam actions is
ultimately only a cover for the real basis for the Court's decision: the
idea that the property, not the owner, is being "punished" for
offenses of which it is "guilty."  Although the Court prefers not to
rely on this notorious fiction too blatantly, its repeated citations to
Various Items make clear that the Court believes respondent's home
was "guilty" of the drug offenses with which he was charged. See
ante, at 15. On that rationale, of course, the case is easy. The owner
of the property is not being punished when the Government
confiscates it, just the property. The same sleight-of-hand would
have worked in Austin, too: The owner of the property is not being
excessively fined, just the property itself. Despite the Government's
heavy reliance on that fiction in Austin, we did not allow it to stand in
the way of our holding that the seizure of property may punish the
owner.15

Even if the point had not been settled by prior decisions, common
sense would dictate the result in this case. There is simply no
rational basis for characterizing the seizure of this respondent's home
as anything other than punishment for his crime. The house was
neither proceeds nor contraband and its value had no relation to the
Government's authority to seize it. Under the controlling statute an
essential predicate for the forfeiture was proof that respondent had
used the property in connection with the commission of a crime. The
forfeiture of this property was unquestionably "a penalty that had
absolutely no correlation to any damages sustained by society or to
the cost of enforcing the law."  United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at
254. As we unanimously recognized in Halper, formalistic
distinctions that obscure the obvious practical consequences of
governmental action disserve the "`humane interests'" protected by
the Double Jeopardy Clause. 490 U. S., at 447, quoting United
States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 554 (1943)
(Frankfurter, J., concurring). Fidelity to both reason and precedent
dictates the conclusion that this forfeiture was "punishment" for
purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.16


The Government also argues that the word "jeopardy" refers only to
a criminal proceeding, and that our cases precluding two
punishments for the same offense apply only to situations in which
the first punishment was imposed after conviction of a crime. In this
case the civil forfeiture proceeding antedated the filing of the criminal
charge. Since the civil case was not a "jeopardy," the argument runs,
the criminal case was the first, rather than the second, jeopardy. This
argument is foreclosed by our decisions in Halper and Kurth Ranch.

Although the point was not expressly mentioned in either case, both
holdings necessarily rested on the assumption that the civil
proceeding in which the second punishment was imposed was a
"jeopardy" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Otherwise
there would have been no basis for concluding that the defendants
had been "twice put in jeopardy" as the text of the Clause forbids.
The prohibition against two such proceedings cannot depend on the
order in which they are filed. Cf. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 7) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("if there is a constitutional
prohibition on multiple punishments, the order of punishment cannot
possibly make any difference").


The Government's third argument is that the civil forfeiture and the
criminal proceeding did not involve the same offense. The
Government relies principally on Blockburger v. United States, 284
U. S. 299 (1932), in which we held that for double jeopardy
purposes two statutes define different offenses if "each provision
requires proof of a fact which the other does not."  Id., at 304. The
application of that test would avoid any double jeopardy objection to
a forfeiture followed by a prosecution--or a prosecution followed by
a forfeiture--whenever the seizure could be supported without proof
that the defendant committed a crime and the conviction did not
require proof that the forfeited property had been used illegally.

Thus, if instead of forfeiting Ursery's home the Government had
decided to forfeit his neighbor's property where the marijuana was
grown, the Blockburger rule would avoid any double jeopardy
objection to either the forfeiture or respondent's prosecution. In that
scenario, the forfeiture could be supported without proof that Ursery
violated the law and Ursery could be convicted without proof that he
harvested the marijuana on property owned by someone else.

The rule does, however, bar this conviction because the elements that
the Government was required to allege and prove to sustain the
forfeiture of Ursery's home under Section 881(a)(7) included each of
the elements of the offense for which he was later convicted. As in
Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), and Harris v. Oklahoma,
433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam), the fact that the "greater" offense
(here, the forfeiture) could have been proved by means of a different
"lesser" offense does not negate the fact that in this instance it was
proved by resort to the same elements as the criminal offense. This
conclusion also accords with our oft-repeated understanding of the
relationship between a civil forfeiture and the underlying offense.
See, e.g., One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, 380 U. S., at 701 ("the
forfeiture is clearly a penalty for the criminal offense"); Boyd, 116
U. S., at 634 (describing sanction as "proceedings instituted for the
purpose of declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by reason of
offences committed by him"). Accordingly, under the analysis we
unanimously applied most recently in Rutledge v. United States, 517
U. S. ___ (1996), the criminal charge was a lesser-included offense
of the forfeiture and therefore constituted a second jeopardy.

JUSTICE KENNEDY joins the Court's opinion and therefore ought
to agree with the majority that civil forfeitures do not constitute
punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In fact,
however, he recognizes that "[f]orfeiture . . . punishes an owner by
taking property involved in a crime."  Ante, at 3. His real objection
is that a forfeiture does not punish for the same offense as the
underlying criminal conviction.

JUSTICE KENNEDY theorizes that civil forfeiture punishes for the
misuse of property. Ibid. It might be true that some forfeiture
statutes are best described as creating a sanction for misuse, as
opposed to (but perhaps in addition to) a sanction for the substantive
criminal offense. But, again, this statute is not structured that way.
Section 881(a)(7) incorporates the criminal offense itself as the
predicate for the forfeiture. See 21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7)
(subjecting to forfeiture "[a]ll real property . . . which is used . . . to
commit . . . a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than
one year's imprisonment"). Furthermore, the innocent owner
exemption in the same subsection provides that "no property shall be
forfeited under this paragraph . . . by reason of any act or omission
established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without
the knowledge or consent of that owner."  Ibid. (emphasis added).
In Austin, we held that the exemption revealed a "congressional
intent to punish only those involved in drug trafficking" because
"`the traditional criminal sanctions . . . are inadequate to deter or
punish the enormously profitable trade in dangerous drugs.'"  509
U. S., at 619, 620 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 191 (1983)).
See also 509 U. S., at 628 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (suggesting that proportionality of a
forfeiture be measured by the relationship of the property to the
underlying offense). Again, these statements accord with common
sense: forfeiting respondent's house punished him for the same
narcotics violations as his criminal conviction.


The final argument advanced by the Government is that the forfeiture
and the criminal conviction should be treated as having occurred in
the same proceeding because both were commenced before a final
judgment was entered in either. Emphasizing the fact that the Double
Jeopardy Clause, and particularly the prohibition against multiple
punishments for the same offense, protects the defendant's legitimate
expectation of finality in the original sentence, the Government
maintains that such an expectation could not arise until after one
proceeding was completed. Moreover, it argues, the civil and
criminal sanctions "cannot be (and never have been) joined together
in a single trial under our system of justice."  Brief for United States
55.

This argument is unpersuasive because it is simply inaccurate to
describe two separate proceedings as one.17 I also cannot agree with
the Government's view that there is any procedural obstacle to
including a punitive forfeiture in the final judgment entered in a
criminal case. The sentencing proceeding does not commence until
after the defendant has been found guilty, and I do not see why that
proceeding should not encompass all of the punitive sanctions that
are warranted by the conviction. Indeed, a draft of a proposed
amendment to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure envisions
precisely that procedure. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(d)(2) (eff.
Dec. 1, 1996).18   If, as we have already determined, the "civil"
forfeitures pursuant to Section 881(a)(7) are in fact punitive, a single
judgment encompassing the entire punishment for the defendant's
offense is precisely what the Double Jeopardy Clause requires.
Congress' decision to create novel and additional penalties should not
be permitted to eviscerate the protection against governmental
overreaching embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause. That
protection has far deeper roots than the relatively recent enactments
that have so dramatically expanded the sovereign's power to forfeit
private property.

One final example may illustrate the depth of my concern that the
Court's treatment of our cases has cut deeply into a guarantee deemed
fundamental by the Founders. The Court relies heavily on a few early
decisions that involved the forfeiture of vessels whose entire mission
was unlawful and on the Prohibition-era precedent sustaining the
forfeiture of a distillery--a property that served no purpose other than
the manufacture of illegal spirits. Notably none of those early cases
involved the forfeiture of a home as a form of punishment for
misconduct that occurred therein. Consider how drastic the remedy
would have been if Congress in 1931 had authorized the forfeiture of
every home in which alcoholic beverages were consumed. Under the
Court's reasoning, I fear that the label "civil," or perhaps "in rem,"
would have been sufficient to avoid characterizing such forfeitures as
"punitive" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Our recent
decisions in Halper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch, dictate a far different
conclusion. I remain persuaded that those cases were correctly
decided and should be followed today. Accordingly, I respectfully
dissent from the judgment in No. 95-345.


ENDNOTES FOR CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST

1 The Government raises three other challenges to the decisions that
we review. First, focusing on the decision of the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit in No. 95-345, the Government contends that
the Double Jeopardy Clause applies only to prohibit a punishment
imposed following a "jeopardy," and that a civil forfeiture, regardless
whether it is a "punishment," is not a "jeopardy."  Thus, because
Ursery had not been placed in "jeopardy" in the civil forfeiture
proceeding against his house, the Double Jeopardy Clause was
inapplicable to his criminal prosecution. Second, the Government
argues that the civil forfeiture of property is not the same offense as a
criminal prosecution, and therefore that the double jeopardy
protection against multiple punishments for the same offense is not at
issue here. Finally, the Government argues that a civil forfeiture
action that is parallel and contemporaneous with a criminal
prosecution should be deemed to constitute a single proceeding
within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Because we conclude that the civil forfeitures involved in these cases
do not constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, see
infra, at ___, we do not address those three arguments in this
decision.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent is grounded in the different
interpretation that he gives Halper. He finds that Halper announced
"two different rules": a general rule, applicable to all civil sanctions,
useful for determining whether a sanction is "of a punitive character";
and a "narrower rule," similar to our understanding of the case, that
requires "an accounting of the Government's damages and costs."
Post at 12. JUSTICE STEVENS faults us in this case for failing to
apply the "general rule" of Halper.

The problem with JUSTICE STEVENS' interpretation of Halper, of
course, and therefore with his entire argument, is that Halper did not
announce two rules. Nowhere in Halper does the Court set forth two
distinct rules or purport to apply a two-step analysis. JUSTICE
STEVENS finds his "general rule" in a dictum from Halper: " `[a]
civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial
purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either
retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment.' "  Post, at 10,
quoting United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989). But
the discussion immediately following that dictum makes clear that it
states not a new and separate test for whether a sanction is a
punishment, but rather only a rephrasing of JUSTICE STEVENS'
"narrower" rule, i.e., the rule requiring an "accounting of the
Government's damages and costs."  Id., at 449.

"We therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a
defendant who already has been punished . . . may not be subjected
to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction
may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or
retribution.

"We acknowledge that this inquiry will not be an exact pursuit. In
our decided cases we have noted that the precise amount of the
Government's damages and costs may prove to be difficult, if not
impossible, to ascertain.... [I]t would be difficult if not impossible in
many cases for a court to determine the precise dollar figure at which
a civil sanction has accomplished its remedial purpose of making the
Government whole, but beyond which the sanction takes on the
quality of punishment."  Id., at 448-449 (emphasis added); see also
id., at 449-451.

The "general rule" discovered by JUSTICE STEVENS in Halper
would supplant, not mimic, see post at 14, the rule of 89 Firearms,
and Emerald Cut Stones. Whether a particular sanction "cannot fairly
be said solely to serve a remedial purpose" is an inquiry radically
different from that we have traditionally employed in order to
determine whether, as a categorical matter, a civil sanction is subject
to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Yet nowhere in Halper does the
Court purport to make such a sweeping change in the law, instead
emphasizing repeatedly the narrow scope of its decision. Halper,
supra, at 449 (announcing rule for "the rare case"). If the "general
rule" of JUSTICE STEVENS were applied literally, then virtually
every sanction would be declared to be a punishment: it is hard to
imagine a sanction that has no punitive aspect whatsoever. JUSTICE
STEVENS' interpretation of Halper is both contrary to the decision
itself and would create an unworkable rule inconsistent with well-
established precedent.

3  JUSTICE STEVENS mischaracterizes our holding. We do not
hold that in rem civil forfeiture is per se exempt from the scope of the
Double Jeopardy Clause. See post at 5-9. Similarly, we do not rest
our conclusion in this case upon the long-recognized fiction that a
forfeiture in rem punishes only malfeasant property rather than a
particular person. See post, at 18-21. That a forfeiture is designated
as civil by Congress and proceeds in rem establishes a presumption
that it is not subject to double jeopardy. See, e.g., United States v.
One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 363 (1984).
Nevertheless, where the "clearest proof" indicates that an in rem civil
forfeiture is "so punitive either in purpose or effect" as to be
equivalent to a criminal proceeding, that forfeiture may be subject to
the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 365.


ENDNOTES FOR JUSTICE STEVENS CONCURRING

1 The contraband found on the premises was evidence that the
building had been used to facilitate the commission of a violation of
Title 21 punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. To
justify that forfeiture, the Government assumed the burden of
proving (a) that respondent had committed such an offense, and (b)
that the property had played some part in it. The statute provides as
follows:

"Section 881. Forfeitures

"(a) Subject property

"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and
no property right shall exist in them:

"(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest
(including any leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of
land and any appurtenances or improvements, which is used, or
intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate
the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more
than one year's imprisonment, except that no property shall be
forfeited under this paragraph, to the extent of an interest of an
owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to
have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of
that owner."  Section 881(a)(7).

2 JUSTICE THOMAS has expressed his concern about both the
unusual scope and the novelty of the very statute used to carry out the
forfeiture in this case:

"I am disturbed by the breadth of new civil forfeiture statutes such as
21 U. S. C. Section 881(a)(7), which subjects to forfeiture all real
property that is used, or intended to be used, in the commission, or
even the facilitation, of a federal drug offense. As JUSTICE
O'CONNOR points out . . . since the Civil War we have upheld
statutes allowing for the civil forfeiture of real property. A strong
argument can be made, however, that Section 881(a)(7) is so broad
that it differs not only in degree, but in kind, from its historical
antecedents.... Indeed, it is unclear whether the central theory behind
in rem forfeiture, the fiction `that the thing is primarily considered the
offender,' J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.
S. 505, 511 (1921), can fully justify the immense scope of Section
881(a)(7). Under this provision, `large tracts of land [and any
improvements thereon] which have no connection with crime other
than being the location where a drug transaction occurred,' Brief for
Respondents 20, are subject to forfeiture. It is difficult to see how
such real property is necessarily in any sense `guilty' of an offense,
as could reasonably be argued of, for example, the distillery in
Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395 (1878), or the
pirate vessel in Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210 (1844).
Given that current practice under Section 881(a)(7) appears to be far
removed from the legal fiction upon which the civil forfeiture
doctrine is based, it may be necessary--in an appropriate case--to
reevaluate our generally deferential approach to legislative judgments
in this area of civil forfeiture."  United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 81-82 (1993) (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (footnotes omitted).

3 If anything, the Double Jeopardy Clause ought to apply to a
broader set of proceedings than the Self-Incrimination Clause. While
the latter applies only in a "criminal case," the former concerns any
type of "jeopardy," presumably a larger class of situations. See U.
S. Const., Amdt. 5.

4 The Court stated the full rule as follows: "Where a defendant
previously has sustained a criminal penalty and the civil penalty
sought in the subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the
goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears
to qualify as `punishment' in the plain meaning of the word, then the
defendant is entitled to an accounting of the Government's damages
and costs to determine if the penalty sought in fact constitutes a
second punishment."  United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 449-
450 (1989).

5 Even if Austin had not followed Halper's rule for defining
punishment, it would make little sense to say that forfeiture might be
punishment "for the purposes of" the Excessive Fines Clause but not
the Double Jeopardy Clause. It is difficult to imagine why the
Framers of the two amendments would have required a particular
sanction not to be excessive, but would have allowed it to be
imposed multiple times for the same offense.

6 Specifically, the tax was conditioned on the commission of a crime,
511 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13), and it was levied on goods that
the taxpayer did not own or possess at the time of imposition, id., at
___ (slip op., at 15-16).

7 It is true, as the Court asserts, that a fine will only be considered
"excessive" if it is disproportionate to any remedial goal. But Austin
established that a forfeiture can also be excessive, although it could
serve multiple remedial goals. Hence, I do not understand why the
Court maintains that Austin did not prove that forfeitures are
punitive. In order to count as a "fine" in the first place, a forfeiture
must be capable of being punitive. A penalty that is not a "fine"
cannot violate the Excessive Fines Clause, no matter how
"excessive."  See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco
Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989).

8 See, e.g., Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch 347, 364 (1808) (Marshall,
C. J.) ("[T]he act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of the
goods"); J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.
S. 505, 510-511 (1921) (the owner of an automobile confiscated for
its use in transporting liquor during Prohibition is "`properly
punished by such forfeiture'") (quoting 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *301).

9 Just this Term, we have reiterated this conclusion. See Libretti v.
United States, 516 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 9-10) ("[T]he
in rem civil forfeiture authorized by 21 U. S. C. Sections 881(a)(4)
and (a)(7) is punitive in nature").

10 The Court also speculates that nuisance abatement may provide a
remedial interest. Ante, at 23. The abatement theory was
questionable enough in Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. ___ (1996),
where under the State's theory the same acts might or might not turn
an ordinary automobile into a nuisance, depending on the
neighborhood in which the car happened to be parked. See id., at
___, n. 9 (slip op., at 7, n. 9) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Here,
there is no argument that Ursery's home constituted some kind of a
nuisance.

11 Apparently recognizing the difficulty of reconciling its analysis of
Section 881(a)(7) with Austin's, the Court admits that the statute
"perhaps ha[s] certain punitive aspects," but finds them outweighed
by its "important nonpunitive goals."  Ante, at 22. Again, that
approach simply repudiates Halper, which defined as punishment for
purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause any sanction that "cannot
fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose." 490 U. S., at 448
(emphasis added).

12 "[A]lthough the owner of goods, sought to be forfeited by a
proceeding in rem, is not the nominal party, he is, nevertheless, the
substantial party to the suit; he certainly is so, after making claim and
defence; and, in a case like the present, he is entitled to all the
privileges which appertain to a person who is prosecuted for a
forfeiture of his property by reason of committing a criminal
offence."  Boyd, 116 U. S., at 638.

13 The Court suggests that the decision in Emerald Cut Stones rested
on the fact that the second penalty was "in personam," ante, at 8, but
the opinion of the Court did not even mention that term. In 89
Firearms, the Court discussed the fact that the forfeiture was in rem,
but only for the rather obvious point that Congress intended the
proceeding to be "civil."

14 "That case, United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568 (1931),
observed that the words `tax' and `penalty' `are not interchangeable,
one for the other' and that `if an exaction be clearly a penalty it cannot
be converted into a tax by the simple expedient of calling it such.'
Id., at 572. See also Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557, 561 (1922)
(`The mere use of the word "tax" in an act primarily designed to
define and suppress crime is not enough to show that within the true
intendment of the term a tax was laid')."  Department of Revenue of
Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. ___,  ___, n. 15 (slip op., at ___,
n. 15) (1994).

15 Long ago the Court cast doubt on this fiction:

"But where the owner of the property has been admitted as a
claimant, we cannot see the force of this distinction; nor can we
assent to the proposition that the proceeding is not, in effect, a
proceeding against the owner of the property, as well as against the
goods; for it is his breach of the laws which has to be proved to
establish the forfeiture, and it is his property which is sought to be
forfeited . . . . In the words of a great judge, `Goods, as goods,
cannot offend, forfeit, unlade, pay duties, or the like, but men whose
goods they are.'*

"*Vaughan, C. J., in Sheppard v. Gosnold, Vaugh. 159, 172,
approved by Ch. Baron Parker in Mitchell qui tam v. Torup, Parker,
227, 236."  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 637, and n.
(1886).

16 As I have emphasized, the determination that 21 U. S. C. Section
881(a)(7) is a punitive statute is perfectly consistent with a
conclusion that other types of sanctions are remedial. For example, I
would expect that many types of administrative licensing sanctions
are remedial in the relevant sense of our cases. See Comment,
Administrative Driver's License Suspension: A Remedial Tool That
is Not in Jeopardy, 45 Am. U. L. Rev. 1151 (1996) (arguing that
suspension of a driver's license after conviction for drunk driving is
a remedial sanction under the logic of Halper, Austin, and Kurth
Ranch).

17 In Kurth Ranch we explicitly noted that the tax assessment and the
prosecution were "separate legal proceedings."  511 U. S., at ___,
(slip op., at 4).

18 According to the Rule, once there is a finding that property is
subject to a criminal forfeiture, the court may enter a preliminary
forfeiture order. The order also authorizes the Attorney General to
seize the property, conduct any necessary discovery, and begin
proceedings to protect the rights of third parties. The order of
forfeiture becomes a part of the sentence and is included in the
judgment.

SHAW ET AL.

v.

HUNT, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN
DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA

No. 94-923. Argued December 5, 1995-Decided June 13, 1996*

Earlier in this case, in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. ___, this Court held
that appellants, whose complaint alleged that North Carolina had
deliberately segregated voters by race when it created two bizarre-
looking majority-black congressional districts, Districts 1 and 12,
had stated a claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Court remanded for further
consideration by the District Court, which held that, although the
North Carolina redistricting plan did classify voters by race, the
classification survived strict scrutiny, and therefore was
constitutional, because it was narrowly tailored to further the State's
compelling interests in complying with Sections 2 and 5 of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. Held:

1. Only the two appellants who live in District 12 have standing to
continue this lawsuit, and only with respect to that district. The
remaining appellants, who do not reside in either of the challenged
districts and have not provided specific evidence that they personally
were assigned to their voting districts on the basis of race, lack
standing. See United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. ___. Pp. 3-4.

2. The North Carolina plan violates the Equal Protection Clause
because the State's reapportionment scheme is not narrowly tailored
to serve a compelling state interest. Pp. 4-19.

(a) Strict scrutiny applies when race is the "predominant"
consideration in drawing district lines such that "the legislature
subordinates race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial
considerations."  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. ___, ___. The
District Court's finding that the North Carolina General Assembly
"deliberately drew" District 12 so that it would have an effective
voting majority of black citizens, when read in the light of the
evidence as to the district's shape and demographics and the
legislature's objective, comports with the Miller standard. In order to
justify its redistricting plan, therefore, the State must show not only
that the plan was in pursuit of a compelling state interest, but also that
it was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Id., at ___. Pp. 4-
8.


(b) None of the three separate ``compelling interests'' to which
appellees point suffices to sustain District 12. First, the District
Court found that the State's claimed interest in eradicating the effects
of past discrimination did not actually precipitate the use of race in the
redistricting plan, and the record does not establish that that finding
was clearly erroneous. Second, the asserted interest in complying
with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act did not justify redistricting
here, since creating an additional majority-black district, as urged by
the Justice Department before it granted preclearance, was not
required under a correct reading of Section 5. See Miller, 515 U. S.,
at ___ - ___. This Court again rejects the Department's expansive
reading of Section 5 and of its own authority thereunder as requiring
States to maximize the number of majority-minority districts
wherever possible. See, e.g., id., at ___. Third, District 12, as
drawn, is not a remedy narrowly tailored to the State's professed
interest in avoiding liability under Section 2 of the Act, which, inter
alia, prohibits dilution of the voting strength of members of a
minority group. District 12 could not remedy any potential Section 2
violation, since the minority group must be shown to be
"geographically compact" to establish Section 2 liability, see, e.g.,
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50, and it cannot reasonably be
suggested that District 12 contains a "geographically compact"
population of any race. Appellees are singularly unpersuasive when
they argue that a majority-minority district may be drawn anywhere if
there is a strong basis in evidence for concluding that a Section 2
violation exists somewhere in the State. A district so drawn could
not avoid Section 2 liability, which targets vote-dilution injury to
individuals in a particular area, not to the minority as a group. Just
as in Miller, this Court does not here reach the question whether
compliance with the Act, on its own, can be a compelling state
interest under the proper circumstances. Pp. 8-19. 861 F. Supp.
408, reversed.

ON APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA

[June 13, 1996]


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case is here for a second time. In Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.
___ (1993) (Shaw I), we held that plaintiffs whose complaint alleged
that the deliberate segregation of voters into separate and bizarre-
looking districts on the basis of race stated a claim for relief under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We
remanded the case for further consideration by the District Court.
That court held that the North Carolina redistricting plan did classify
voters by race, but that the classification survived strict scrutiny and
therefore did not offend the Constitution. We now hold that the
North Carolina plan does violate the Equal Protection Clause because
the State's reapportionment scheme is not narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling state interest.


The facts are set out in detail in our prior opinion, and we shall only
summarize them here. After the 1990 census, North Carolina's
congressional delegation increased from 11 to 12 members. The
State General Assembly adopted a reapportionment plan, Chapter
601, that included one majority-black district, District 1, located in
the northeastern region of the State. 1991 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch.
601. The legislature then submitted the plan to the Attorney General
of the United States for preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C. Section
1973c (1988 ed.). The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,
acting on the Attorney General's behalf, objected to the proposed
plan because it failed "to give effect to black and Native American
voting strength" in "the south-central to southeastern part of the state"
and opined that the State's reasons for not creating a second majority-
minority district appeared "to be pretextual."  App. 151-153. Duly
chastened, the legislature revised its districting scheme to include a
second majority-black district. 1991 N. C. Extra Sess. Laws, ch. 7.
The new plan, Chapter 7, located the minority district, District 12, in
the north-central or Piedmont region, not in the south-central or
south-eastern region identified in the Justice Department's objection
letter. The Attorney General nonetheless precleared the revised plan.

By anyone's measure, the boundary lines of Districts 1 and 12 are
unconventional. A map portrays the districts' deviance far better than
words, see the Appendix to the opinion of the Court in Shaw I,
supra, but our prior opinion describes them as follows:

"The first of the two majority-black districts . . . is somewhat hook
shaped. Centered in the northeast portion of the State, it moves
southward until it tapers to a narrow band; then, with finger-like
extensions, it reaches far into the southern-most part of the State near
the South Carolina border. . . .

"The second majority-black district, District 12, is even more
unusually shaped. It is approximately 160 miles long and, for much
of its length, no wider than the [Interstate]-85 corridor. It winds in
snake-like fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and
manufacturing areas `until it gobbles in enough enclaves of black
neighborhoods.'"  Shaw I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3) (citation
omitted).

Five North Carolinians commenced the present action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against
various state officials.1 Following our reversal of the District Court's
dismissal of their complaint in Shaw I, the District Court allowed a
number of individuals to intervene, 11 on behalf of the plaintiffs and
22 for the defendants. After a 6-day trial, the District Court
unanimously found "that the Plan's lines were deliberately drawn to
produce one or more districts of a certain racial composition."  861
F. Supp. 408, 417, 473-474 (1994). A majority of the court held
that the plan was constitutional, nonetheless, because it was narrowly
tailored to further the State's compelling interests in complying with
Sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. Sections
1973, 1973c. 861 F. Supp., at 474. The dissenting judge disagreed
with that portion of the judgment. We noted probable jurisdiction.
515 U. S. ___ (1995).

As a preliminary matter, appellees challenge appellants' standing to
continue this lawsuit. In United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. ___
(1995), we recognized that a plaintiff who resides in a district which
is the subject of a racial-gerrymander claim has standing to challenge
the legislation which created that district, but that a plaintiff from
outside that district lacks standing absent specific evidence that he
personally has been subjected to a racial classification. Two
appellants, Ruth Shaw and Melvin Shimm, live in District 12 and
thus have standing to challenge that part of Chapter 7 which defines
District 12. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip
op., at 7). The remaining appellants do not reside in District 1,
however, and they have not provided specific evidence that they
personally were assigned to their voting districts on the basis of race.
Therefore, we conclude that only Shaw and Shimm have standing
and only with respect to District 12.2

We explained in Miller v. Johnson that a racially gerrymandered
districting scheme, like all laws that classify citizens on the basis of
race, is constitutionally suspect. Id., at ____ (slip op., at 2-3); see
also Shaw I, 509 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U. S. ___ (1995). This is true
whether or not the reason for the racial classification is benign or the
purpose remedial. Shaw I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11, 22);
Adarand, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 24-25). Applying traditional
equal protection principles in the voting-rights context is "a most
delicate task," Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3), however,
because a legislature may be conscious of the voters' races without
using race as a basis for assigning voters to districts. Shaw I, supra,
at ____ (slip op., at 14-15); Miller, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
14). The constitutional wrong occurs when race becomes the
"dominant and controlling" consideration. Id., at ___ (slip op., at
11, 14-15).

The plaintiff bears the burden of proving the race-based motive and
may do so either through "circumstantial evidence of a district's
shape and demographics" or through "more direct evidence going to
legislative purpose."  Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). After a
detailed account of the process that led to enactment of the challenged
plan, the District Court found that the General Assembly of North
Carolina "deliberately drew" District 12 so that it would have an
effective voting majority of black citizens. 861 F. Supp., at 473.

Appellees urge upon us their view that this finding is not phrased in
the same language that we used in our opinion in Miller v. Johnson,
supra, where we said that a plaintiff must show "that race was the
predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a
significant number of voters within or without a particular district."
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).

The District Court, of course, did not have the benefit of our opinion
in Miller at the time it wrote its opinion. While it would have been
preferable for the court to have analyzed the case in terms of the
standard laid down in Miller, that was not possible. This
circumstance has no consequence here because we think that the
District Court's findings, read in the light of the evidence that it had
before it, comport with the Miller standard.

First, the District Court had evidence of the district's shape and
demographics. The court observed "the obvious fact" that the
district's shape is "highly irregular and geographically non-compact
by any objective standard that can be conceived."  861 F. Supp., at
469. In fact, the serpentine district has been dubbed the least
geographically compact district in the Nation. App. 332.

The District Court also had direct evidence of the legislature's
objective. The State's submission for preclearance expressly
acknowledged that the Chapter 7's "overriding purpose was to
comply with the dictates of the Attorney General's December 18,
1991 letter and to create two congressional districts with effective
black voting majorities."  App. 162 (emphasis added). This
admission was confirmed by Gerry Cohen, the plan's principal
draftsman, who testified that creating two majority-black districts
was the "principal reason" for Districts 1 and 12. Id., at 675; Tr.
514. Indeed, appellees in their first appearance before the District
Court "formally concede[d] that the state legislature deliberately
created the two districts in a way to assure black-vote majorities,"
Shaw v. Barr, 808 F. Supp. 461, 470 (EDNC 1992), and that
concession again was credited by the District Court on remand, 861
F. Supp., at 473-474. See also Shaw I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9)
(White, J., dissenting) ("The State has made no mystery of its intent,
which was to respond to the Attorney General's objections by
improving the minority group's prospects of electing a candidate of
its choice" (citation omitted)). Here, as in Miller, "we fail to see how
the District Court could have reached any conclusion other than that
race was the predominant factor in drawing [the challenged district]."
Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17).

In his dissent, JUSTICE STEVENS argues that strict scrutiny does
not apply where a State "respects" or "compl[ies] with traditional
districting principles." Post, at 15 ("race-based districting which
respects traditional districting principles does not give rise to
constitutional suspicion"), 16 ("Miller demonstrates that although
States may avoid strict scrutiny by complying with traditional
districting principles . . . "). That, however, is not the standard
announced and applied in Miller,3  where we held that strict scrutiny
applies when race is the "predominant" consideration in drawing the
district lines such that "the legislature subordinate[s] race-neutral
districting principles . . . to racial considerations."  Miller, supra, at
___ (slip op., at 15). (JUSTICE STEVENS articulates the correct
standard in his dissent, post, at 14, but he fails to properly apply it.)
The Miller standard is quite different from the one that JUSTICE
STEVENS advances, as an examination of the dissent's reasoning
demonstrates. The dissent explains that "two race-neutral, traditional
districting criteria" were at work in determining the shape and
placement of District 12, and from this suggests that strict scrutiny
should not apply. Post, at 20-24. We do not quarrel with the
dissent's claims that, in shaping District 12, the State effectuated its
interest in creating one rural and one urban district, and that partisan
politicking was actively at work in the districting process. That the
legislature addressed these interests does not in any way refute the
fact that race was the legislature's predominant consideration. Race
was the criterion that, in the State's view, could not be compromised;
respecting communities of interest and protecting Democratic
incumbents came into play only after the race-based decision had
been made.

Racial classifications are antithetical to the Fourteenth Amendment,
whose "central purpose" was "to eliminate racial discrimination
emanating from official sources in the States."  McLaughlin v.
Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192 (1964); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,
488 U. S. 469, 491 (1989) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.) ("[T]he
Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . desired to place clear
limits on the States' use of race as a criterion for legislative action,
and to have the federal courts enforce those limitations"). While
appreciating that a racial classification causes "fundamental injury" to
the "individual rights of a person," Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co.,
482 U. S. 656, 661 (1987), we have recognized that, under certain
circumstances, drawing racial distinctions is permissible where a
governmental body is pursuing a "compelling state interest."  A
State, however, is constrained in how it may pursue that end: "[T]he
means chosen to accomplish the State's asserted purpose must be
specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose."
Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280 (1986) (opinion
of Powell, J.). North Carolina, therefore, must show not only that
its redistricting plan was in pursuit of a compelling state interest, but
also that "its districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve
[that] compelling interest."  Miller, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
19).

Appellees point to three separate compelling interests to sustain
District 12: to eradicate the effects of past and present discrimination;
to comply with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act; and to comply
with Section 2 of that Act. We address each in turn.4

A State's interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial
discrimination may in the proper case justify a government's use of
racial distinctions. Croson, 488 U. S., at 498-506. For that interest
to rise to the level of a compelling state interest, it must satisfy two
conditions. First, the discrimination must be "`identified
discrimination.'"  Id., at 499, 500, 505, 507, 509. "While the States
and their subdivisions may take remedial action when they possess
evidence" of past or present discrimination, "they must identify that
discrimination, public or private, with some specificity before they
may use race-conscious relief." Id., at 504. A generalized assertion
of past discrimination in a particular industry or region is not
adequate because it "provides no guidance for a legislative body to
determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy." Id., at
498 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). Accordingly, an effort to alleviate
the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest.
Wygant, supra, at 274-275, 276, 288.5   Second, the institution that
makes the racial distinction must have had a "strong basis in
evidence" to conclude that remedial action was necessary, "before it
embarks on an affirmative-action program," 476 U. S., at 277
(plurality opinion) (emphasis added).

In this case, the District Court found that an interest in ameliorating
past discrimination did not actually precipitate the use of race in the
redistricting plan. While some legislators invoked the State's history
of discrimination as an argument for creating a second majority-black
district, the court found that these members did not have enough
voting power to have caused the creation of the second district on that
basis alone. 861 F. Supp., at 471.

Appellees, to support their claim that the plan was drawn to remedy
past discrimination, rely on passages from two reports prepared for
this litigation by an historian and a social scientist. Brief for
Appellees Gingles et al. 40-44, citing H. Watson, Race and Politics
in North Carolina, 1865-1994, App. 610-624 (excerpts) and J.
Kousser, After 120 Years: Redistricting and Racial Discrimination in
North Carolina, id., at 602-609 (excerpts). Obviously these reports,
both dated March 1994, were not before the General Assembly when
it enacted Chapter 7. And there is little to suggest that the legislature
considered the historical events and social-science data that the
reports recount, beyond what individual members may have recalled
from personal experience. We certainly cannot say on the basis of
these reports that the District Court's findings on this point were
clearly erroneous.

Appellees devote most of their efforts to arguing that the race-based
redistricting was constitutionally justified by the State's duty to
comply with the Voting Rights Act. The District Court agreed and
held that compliance with Sections 2 and 5 of the Act could be, and
in this case was, a compelling state interest. 861 F. Supp., at 437.
In Miller, we expressly left open the question whether under the
proper circumstances compliance with the Voting Rights Act, on its
own, could be a compelling interest. Miller, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 20) ("Whether or not in some cases compliance with the
Voting Rights Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling interest
independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination . . . ").
Here once again we do not reach that question because we find that
creating an additional majority-black district was not required under a
correct reading of Section 5 and that District 12, as drawn, is not a
remedy narrowly tailored to the State's professed interest in avoiding
Section 2 liability.

With respect to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, we believe our
decision in Miller forecloses the argument, adopted by the District
Court, that failure to engage in the race-based districting would have
violated that section. In Miller, we considered an equal protection
challenge to Georgia's Eleventh Congressional District. As appellees
do here, Georgia contended that its redistricting plan was necessary
to meet the Justice Department's preclearance demands. The Justice
Department had interposed an objection to a prior plan that created
only two majority-minority districts. We held that the challenged
congressional plan was not required by a correct reading of Section 5
and therefore compliance with that law could not justify race-based
districting. Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20) ("[C]ompliance
with federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based
districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary
under a constitutional reading and application of those laws").

We believe the same conclusion must be drawn here. North
Carolina's first plan, Chapter 601, indisputably was ameliorative,
having created the first majority-black district in recent history.
Thus, that plan, "`even if [it] fall[s] short of what might be
accomplished in terms of increasing minority representation,'"
"`cannot violate Section 5 unless the new apportionment itself so
discriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the
Constitution.'"  Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 23, 22), quoting
Days, Section 5 and the Role of the Justice Department, in B.
Grofman & C. Davidson, Controversies in Minority Voting 56
(1992), and Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976).

As in Miller, the United States relies on the purpose prong of Section
5 to explain the Department's preclearance objections, alleging that
North Carolina, for pretextual reasons, did not create a second
majority-minority district. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
24. We again find the Government's position "insupportable."
Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 23). The General Assembly, in its
submission filed with Chapter 601, explained why it did not create a
second minority district; among its goals were "to keep precincts
whole, to avoid dividing counties into more than two districts, and to
give black voters a fair amount of influence by creating at least one
district that was majority black in voter registration and by creating a
substantial number of other districts in which black voters would
exercise a significant influence over the choice of congressmen."
App. 142. The submission also explained in detail the disadvantages
of other proposed plans. See, e.g. id., at 139, 140, 143 (Balmer
Congress 6.2 Plan's "[s]econd `minority' district did not have
effective minority voting majority" because it "depended on the
cohesion of black and Native American voters, and no such pattern
was evident" and "this plan dramatically decreased black influence"
in four other districts). A memorandum, sent to the Department of
Justice on behalf of the legislators in charge of the redistricting
process, provided still further reasons for the State's decision not to
draw two minority districts as urged by various interested parties.
App. 94-138; 861 F. Supp., at 480-481, n. 9 (Voorhees, C. J.,
dissenting). We have recognized that a "State's policy of adhering to
other districting principles instead of creating as many majority-
minority districts as possible does not support an inference that the
plan `so discriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the
Constitution,' and thus cannot provide any basis under Section 5 for
the Justice Department's objection."  Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 23) (citations omitted).

It appears that the Justice Department was pursuing in North Carolina
the same policy of maximizing the number of majority-black districts
that it pursued in Georgia. See Miller, supra, at ___, and n. (slip
op., at 23-24, and n.). The two States underwent the preclearance
processes during the same time period and the objection letters they
received from the Civil Rights Division were substantially alike.
App. in Miller v. Johnson, O. T. 1994, No. 94-631, pp. 99-107. A
North Carolina legislator recalled being told by the Assistant Attorney
General that "you have twenty-two percent black people in this State,
you must have as close to twenty-two percent black Congressmen, or
black Congressional Districts in this State."  App. 201. See also
Deposition of Senator Dennis Winner, id., at 698. We explained in
Miller that this maximization policy is not properly grounded in
Section 5 and the Department's authority thereunder. Miller, 515 U.
S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) ("In utilizing Section 5 to require States to
create majority-minority districts wherever possible, the Department
of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond what
Congress intended and we have upheld"). We again reject the
Department's expansive interpretation of Section 5. Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 24). Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. ___ (1994) (slip
op., at 20) ("Failure to maximize cannot be the measure of Section
2").6

With respect to Section 2, appellees contend, and the District Court
found, that failure to enact a plan with a second majority-black
district would have left the State vulner-able to a lawsuit under this
section. Our precedent establishes that a plaintiff may allege a
Section 2 violation in a single-member district if the manipulation of
districting lines fragments politically cohesive minority voters among
several districts or packs them into one district or a small number of
districts, and thereby dilutes the voting strength of members of the
minority population. De Grandy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9). To
prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must prove that the minority group
"is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a
majority in a single-member district"; that the minority group "is
politically cohesive"; and that "the white majority votes sufficiently as
a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred
candidate."  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51 (1986);
Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993) (recognizing that the three
Gingles preconditions would apply to a Section 2 challenge to a
single-member district). A court must also consider all other relevant
circumstances and must ultimately find based on the totality of those
circumstances that members of a protected class "have less
opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the
political process and to elect representatives of their choice."  42  U.
S. C. Section 1973(b). See De Grandy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
15-17).

We assume, arguendo, for the purpose of resolving this case, that
compliance with Section 2 could be a compelling interest, and we
likewise assume, arguendo, that the General Assembly believed a
second majority-minority district was needed in order not to violate
Section 2, and that the legislature at the time it acted had a strong
basis in evidence to support that conclusion. We hold that even with
the benefit of these assumptions, the North Carolina plan does not
survive strict scrutiny because the remedy--the creation of District 12-
-is not narrowly tailored to the asserted end.

Although we have not always provided precise guidance on how
closely the means (the racial classification) must serve the end (the
justification or compelling interest), we have always expected that the
legislative action would substantially address, if not achieve, the
avowed purpose. See Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21) ("[T]he
judiciary retains an independent obligation . . . to ensure that the
State's actions are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling
interest"); Wygant, 476 U. S., at 280 (opinion of Powell, J.) ("[T]he
means chosen to accomplish the State's asserted purpose must be
specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose") id., at
278, n. 5 (opinion of Powell, J.) (race-based state action must be
remedial); Shaw I, 509 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 23) ("A
reapportionment plan would not be narrowly tailored to the goal of
avoiding retrogression if the State went beyond what was reasonably
necessary to avoid retrogression"). Cf. Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.
S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 16) (With regard to the remedial
authority of a federal court: "the remedy must . . . be related to `the
condition alleged to offend the Constitution . . . .'" and must be
"remedial in nature, that is, it must be designed as nearly as possible
`to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they
would have occupied in the absence of such conduct'"). Where, as
here, we assume avoidance of Section 2 liability to be a compelling
state interest, we think that the racial classification would have to
realize that goal; the legislative action must, at a minimum, remedy
the anticipated violation or achieve compliance to be narrowly
tailored.7

District 12 could not remedy any potential Section 2 violation. As
discussed above, a plaintiff must show that the minority group is
"geographically compact" to establish Section 2 liability. No one
looking at District 12 could reasonably suggest that the district
contains a "geographically compact" population of any race. See 861
F. Supp., at 469. Therefore where that district sits, "there neither
has been a wrong nor can be a remedy." Growe, supra, at 41.8

Appellees do not defend District 12 by arguing that the district is
geographically compact, however. Rather they contend, and a
majority of the District Court agreed, 861 F. Supp., at 454-454, n.
50, that once a legislature has a strong basis in evidence for
concluding that a Section 2 violation exists in the State, it may draw a
majority-minority district anywhere, even if the district is in no way
coincident with the compact Gingles district, as long as racially
polarized voting exists where the district is ultimately drawn. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 50-51, 54-56.

We find this position singularly unpersuasive. We do not see how a
district so drawn would avoid Section 2 liability. If a Section 2
violation is proven for a particular area, it flows from the fact that
individuals in this area "have less opportunity than other members of
the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect
representatives of their choice."  42 U. S. C. Section 1973(b). The
vote dilution injuries suffered by these persons are not remedied by
creating a safe majority-black district somewhere else in the State.
For example, if a geographically compact, cohesive minority
population lives in south-central to southeastern North Carolina, as
the Justice Department's objection letter suggested, District 12 which
spans the Piedmont Crescent would not address that Section 2
violation. The black voters of the south-central to southeastern
region would still be suffering precisely the same injury that they
suffered before District 12 was drawn. District 12 would not address
the professed interest of relieving the vote dilution, much less be
narrowly tailored to accomplish the goal.

Arguing, as appellees do and the District Court did, that the State
may draw the district anywhere derives from a misconception of the
vote-dilution claim. To accept that the district may be placed
anywhere implies that the claim, and hence the coordinate right to an
undiluted vote (to cast a ballot equal among voters), belongs to the
minority as a group and not to its individual members. It does not.
See 42 U. S. C. Section 1973 ("the right of any citizen").9


The United States submits that District 12 does, in fact, incorporate a
"substantial portio[n]" of the concentration of minority voters that
would have given rise to a Section 2 claim. Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 27. Specifically, the Government claims that
"District 12 . . . contains the heavy concentration of African
Americans in Mecklenburg County, the same urban component
included in the second minority opportunity district in some of the
alternative plans."  Ibid. The portion of District 12 that lies in
Mecklenburg County covers not more than 20% of the district. See
Exhibit 301 of Plaintiff-Intervenors, Map A, Map 9B. We do not
think that this degree of incorporation could mean that District 12
substantially addresses the Section 2 violation. We hold, therefore,
that District 12 is not narrowly tailored to the State's asserted interest
in complying with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is

Reversed.

ON APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA

[June 13, 1996]


JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE BREYER join as to Parts II-V, dissenting.

As I have explained on prior occasions, I am convinced that the
Court's aggressive supervision of state action designed to
accommodate the political concerns of historically disadvantaged
minority groups is seriously misguided. A majority's attempt to
enable the minority to participate more effectively in the process of
democratic government should not be viewed with the same hostility
that is appropriate for oppressive and exclusionary abuses of political
power. See, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U. S.
___, ___-___ (1995) (slip op., at 2-9) (STEVENS, J., dissenting);
Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. ___, ___-___ (1995) (slip op., at 4-6)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting); Shaw v. Reno 509 U. S. 630, 634-635
(1993) (Shaw I) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Wygant v. Jackson
Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 316-317 (1986) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 852
(CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting). But even if we accept the
Court's refusal to recognize any distinction between two vastly
different kinds of situations, we should affirm the judgment of the
District Court in this case.

As the Court analyzes the case, it raises three distinct questions: (1)
Should North Carolina's decision to create two congressional
districts in which a majority of the voters are African-American be
subject to strict constitutional scrutiny?; (2) If so, did North Carolina
have a compelling interest in creating such districts?; and (3) If so,
was the creation of those districts "narrowly tailored" to further the
asserted compelling interest? The Court inadequately explains its
answer to the first question, and it avoids answering the second
because it concludes that its answer to the third disposes of the case.
In my estimation, the Court's disposition of all three questions is
most unsatisfactory.

After commenting on the majority's treatment of the threshold
jurisdictional issue, I shall discuss separately the three questions
outlined above. In doing so, I do not mean to imply that I endorse
the majority's effort to apply in rigid fashion the strict scrutiny
analysis developed for cases of a far different type. I mean only to
show that, even on its own terms, the majority's analysis fails to
convince.


I have explained previously why I believe that the Court has failed to
supply a coherent theory of standing to justify its emerging and
misguided race-based districting jurisprudence. See Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 2-4) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting); United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. ___, ___-___ (1995)
(slip op., at 1-3) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). The
Court's analysis of the standing question in this case is similarly
unsatisfactory, and, in my view, reflects the fact that the so-called
Shaw claim seeks to employ the federal courts to impose a particular
form of electoral process, rather than to redress any racially
discriminatory treatment that the electoral process has imposed. In
this instance, therefore, I shall consider the standing question in light
of the majority's assertions about the nature of the underlying
constitutional challenge.

I begin by noting that this case reveals the Shaw claim to be useful
less as a tool for protecting against racial discrimination than as a
means by which state residents may second-guess legislative
districting in federal court for partisan ends. The plaintiff-intervenors
in this case are Republicans. It is apparent from the record that their
real grievance is that they are represented in Congress by Democrats
when they would prefer to be represented by members of their own
party. They do not suggest that the racial identity of their
representatives is a matter of concern, but it is obvious that their
political identity is critical. See Pope v. Blue, 809 F. Supp. 392
(WDNC 1992).

Significantly, from the outset of the legislative deliberations, the
Republican Party did not oppose the creation of more than one
majority-minority district. Indeed, several plans proposed by the
Republicans in the state legislature provided two such districts. 861
F. Supp. 408, 460 (EDNC 1994). However, now that the State has
created a district that is designed to preserve Democratic incumbents,
and now that the plaintiff-intervenors' partisan gerrymandering suit
has been dismissed for failure to state a claim, these intervenors have
joined this racial gerrymandering challenge.

It is plain that these intervenors are using their allegations of
impermissibly race-based districting to achieve the same substantive
result that their previous, less emotionally charged partisan
gerrymandering challenge failed to secure. In light of the amorphous
nature of the race discrimination claim recognized in Shaw I, it is
inevitable that allegations of racial gerrymandering will become a
standard means by which unsuccessful majority-race candidates, and
their parties, will seek to obtain judicially what they could not obtain
electorally.

Even if the other plaintiffs to this litigation do object to the use of race
in the districting process for reasons other than partisan political
advantage, the majority fails to explain adequately the nature of their
constitutional challenge, or why it should be cognizable under the
Equal Protection Clause. Not surprisingly, therefore, the majority's
explanation of why these plaintiffs have standing to bring this
challenge is unconvincing.

It is important to point out what these plaintiffs do not claim.
Counsel for appellees put the matter succinctly when he stated that
this case is not Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960).1
There, the plaintiffs had been prohibited from voting in municipal
elections; here, all voters remain free to select representatives to
Congress. Thus, while the plaintiffs purport to be challenging an
unconstitutional racial gerrymander, they do not claim that they have
been shut out of the electoral process on account of race, or that their
voting power has been diluted as a consequence of race-based
districting. Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 641.

What then is the wrong that these plaintiffs have suffered that entitles
them to call upon a federal court for redress? In Shaw I, the majority
construed the plaintiffs' claim to be that the Equal Protection Clause
forbids race-based districting designed solely to "separate" voters by
race, and that North Carolina's districting process violated the
prohibition. Ibid. Even if that were the claim before us, these
plaintiffs should not have standing to bring it. The record shows that
North Carolina's districting plan served to require these plaintiffs to
share a district with voters of a different race. Thus, the injury that
these plaintiffs have suffered, to the extent that there has been injury
at all, stems from the integrative rather than the segregative effects of
the State's redistricting plan.

Perhaps cognizant of this incongruity, counsel for plaintiffs asserted
a rather more abstract objection to race-based districting at oral
argument. He suggested that the plaintiffs objected to the use of race
in the districting process not because of any adverse consequence that
these plaintiffs, on account of their race, had suffered more than
other persons, but rather because the State's failure to obey a
constitutional command to legislate in a color-blind manner conveyed
a message to voters across the State that "there are two black districts
and ten white districts."2

Such a challenge calls to mind Justice Frankfurter's memorable
characterization of the suit brought in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S.
549, 552 (1946). "This is not an action to recover for damage
because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights
enjoyed by other citizens," he explained. "The basis for the suit is
not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity."
Ibid. Suits of this type necessarily press the boundaries of federal-
court jurisdiction, if they do not surpass it. When a federal court is
called upon, as it is here, to parse among varying legislative choices
about the political structure of a State, and when the litigant's claim
ultimately rests on "a difference of opinion as to the function of
representative government" rather than a claim of discriminatory
exclusion, Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 333 (1962) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting), there is reason for pause. Cf. Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573-574 (1992).3

Even if an objection to a State's decision to forego color-blind
districting is cognizable under some constitutional provision, I do not
understand why that provision should be the Equal Protection
Clause. In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 561 (1964), we were
careful to point out that "[a] predominant consideration in
determining whether a State's legislative apportionment scheme
constitutes an invidious discrimination violative of rights asserted
under the Equal Protection Clause is that the rights allegedly impaired
are individual and personal in nature."  In addition, in Palmer v.
Thompson, 403 U. S. 217, 225 (1971), we explained that racially-
motivated legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause only when
the challenged legislation "affect[s] blacks differently from whites."

To be sure, as some commentators have noted, we have permitted
generalized claims of harm resulting from State-sponsored messages
to secure standing under the Establishment Clause. Pildes & Niemi,
Expressive Harms, "Bizarre Districts," and Voting Rights:
Evaluating Election-District Appearances After Shaw v. Reno, 92
Mich. L. Rev. 483, 499-524 (1993). It would be quite strange,
however, to confer similarly broad standing under the Equal
Protection Clause because that Clause protects against wrongs which
by definition burden some persons but not others.

Here, of course, it appears that no individual has been burdened
more than any other. The supposedly insidious messages that Shaw
I contends will follow from extremely irregular race-based districting
will presumably be received in equal measure by all State residents.
For that reason, the claimed violation of a shared right to a color-
blind districting process would not seem to implicate the Equal
Protection Clause at all precisely because it rests neither on a
challenge to the State's decision to distribute burdens and benefits
unequally, nor on a claim that the State's formally equal treatment of
its citizens in fact stamps persons of one race with a badge of
inferiority. See Bush v. Vera, post, at 9-11 (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting). Indeed, to the extent that any person has been burdened
more than any other by the State's districting plan, geography rather
than race would seem to be to blame. The State has not chosen to
subject only persons of a particular race to race-based districting.
Rather, the State has selected certain geographical regions in which
all voters--both white and black--have been assigned to race-based
districts. Thus, what distinguishes those residents who have
received a "color-blind" districting process from those who have not
is geography rather than racial identity. Not surprisingly, therefore,
Shaw I emphasizes that the race of the members of the plaintiff class
is irrelevant. Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 641. Given the absence of any
showing, or, indeed, any allegation, that any person has been
harmed more than any other on account of race, the Court's decision
to entertain the claim of these plaintiffs would seem to emanate less
from the Equal Protection Clause's bar against racial discrimination
than from the Court's unarticulated recognition of a new substantive
due process right to "color-blind" districting itself. See Shaw I, 509
U. S., at 641-642.4   Revealed for what it is, the constitutional claim
before us ultimately depends for its success on little more than
speculative judicial suppositions about the societal message that is to
be gleaned from race-based districting. I know of no workable
constitutional principle, however, that can discern whether the
message conveyed is a distressing endorsement of racial separatism,
or an inspiring call to integrate the political process. As a result, I
know of no basis for recognizing the right to color-blind districting
that has been asserted here.

Even if there were some merit to the constitutional claim, it is at least
clear that it requires the recognition of a new constitutional right. For
that very reason, the Court's suggestion that pre-Shaw, race
discrimination precedent somehow compels the application of strict
scrutiny is disingenuous. The fact that our Equal Protection
jurisprudence requires strict scrutiny of a claim that the State has used
race as a criterion for imposing burdens on some persons but not
others does not mean that the Constitution demands that a similar
level of review obtain for a claim that the State has used race to
impose equal burdens on the polity as a whole, or upon some
nonracially defined portion thereof. As to the latter claim, the State
may well deserve more deference when it determines that racial
considerations are legitimate in a context that results in no race-based,
unequal treatment.

To take but one example, I do not believe that it would make sense to
apply strict scrutiny to the Federal Government's decision to require
citizens to identify their race on census forms, even though that
requirement would force citizens to classify themselves racially, and
even though such a requirement would arguably convey an insidious
message about the Government's continuing belief that race remains
relevant to the formulation of public policy. Of course, if the Federal
Government required only those persons residing in the Midwest to
identify their race on the census form, I do not doubt that only
persons living in States in that region who filled out the forms would
have standing to bring the constitutional challenge. I do doubt,
however, whether our Equal Protection jurisprudence would require
a federal court to evaluate the claim itself under strict scrutiny. In
such a case, the only unequal treatment would have resulted from the
State's decision to discriminate on the basis of geography, a race-
neutral selection criterion that has not generally been thought to
necessitate close judicial review.

The majority ignores these concerns and simply applies the standing
test set forth in United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. ___ (1995), on the
apparent assumption that this test adequately identifies those who
have been personally denied "equal treatment" on account of race.
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). In Hays, the Court held that a plaintiff
has standing to challenge a State's use of race in districting for Shaw
claims if he (1) lives in a district that allegedly constitutes a racial
gerrymander or (2) shows that, although he resides outside such a
district, he has been personally subject to a racial classification.
Ante, at 3-4. On this basis, the Court concludes that none of the
plaintiffs in this action has standing to challenge District 1, but that
two of them have standing to challenge District 12. Ante, at 4.

As I understand it, the distinction drawn in Hays between those who
live within a district, and those who do not, is thought to be relevant
because voters who live in the "gerrymandered" district will have
suffered the "personal" injuries inflicted by race-based districting
more than other state residents.5   Those injuries are said to be
"representational" harms in the sense that race-based districting may
cause officeholders to represent only those of the majority race in
their district, or "stigmatic" harms, in the sense that the race-based
line-drawing may promote racial hostility. United States v. Hays,
515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7-9); Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 646-649.

Even if I were to accept the flawed assumption that the Hays test
serves to identify any voter who has been burdened more than any
other as a consequence of his race, I would still find it a most
puzzling inquiry. What the Court fails to explain, as it failed to
explain in Hays, is why evidence showing either that one lives in an
allegedly racially gerrymandered district or that one's district
assignment directly resulted from a racial classification should suffice
to distinguish those who have suffered the representational and
stigmatic harms that supposedly follow from race-based districting
from those who have not.

If representational injuries are what one must show to secure
standing under Hays, then a demonstration that a voter's race led to
his assignment to a particular district would perhaps be relevant to the
jurisdictional inquiry, but surely not sufficient to satisfy it. There is
no necessary correlation between race-based districting assignments
and inadequate representation. See Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S.
109, 132 (1986) (opinion of White, J.). Indeed, any assumption that
such a correlation exists could only be based on a stereotypical
assumption about the kind of representation that politicians elected by
minority voters are capable of providing. See Miller v. Johnson, 515
U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 2-3) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

To prove the representational harms that Hays holds are needed to
establish standing to assert a Shaw claim, one would think that
plaintiffs should be required to put forth evidence that demonstrates
that their political representatives are actually unlikely to provide
effective representation to those voters whose interests are not
aligned with those of the majority race in their district. Here, as the
record reveals, no plaintiff has made such a showing. See 861 F.
Supp., at 424-425, 471, n. 59. Given our general reluctance to hear
claims founded on speculative assertions of injury, I do not
understand why the majority concludes that the speculative
possibility that race-based districting "may" cause these plaintiffs to
receive less than complete representation suffices to create a
cognizable case or controversy. United States v. Hays, 515 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 8).

If under Hays the so-called "stigmatic" harms which result from
extreme race-based districting suffice to secure standing, then I fail to
see why it matters whether the litigants live within the
"gerrymandered" district or were placed in a district as a result of
their race. As I have pointed out, all voters in North Carolina would
seem to be equally affected by the messages of "balkanization" or
"racial apartheid" that racially gerrymandered maps supposedly
convey, cf. Davis, 478 U. S., at 153 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring
in judgment).

Even if race-based districting could be said to impose more personal
harms than the so-called "stigmatic" harms that Hays itself identified,
I do not understand why any voter's reputation or dignity should be
presumed to have been harmed simply because he resides in a highly
integrated, majority-minority voting district that the legislature has
deliberately created. Certainly the background social facts are not
such that we should presume that the "stigmatic harm" described in
Hays and Shaw I amounts to that found cognizable under the Equal
Protection Clause in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483,
495 (1954), where state-sponsored school segregation caused some
students, but not others, to be stamped with a badge of inferiority on
account of their race. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 682, n. 4
(SOUTER, J., dissenting).

In sum, even if it could be assumed that the plaintiffs in this case
asserted the personalized injuries recognized in Hays at the time of
Shaw I by virtue of their bare allegations of racial gerrymandering,
they have surely failed to prove the existence of such injuries to the
degree that we normally require at this stage of the litigation. See
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992). Thus, so
long as the Court insists on treating this type of suit as a traditional
Equal Protection claim, it must either mean to take a broader view of
the power of federal courts to entertain challenges to race-based
governmental action than it has heretofore adopted, see Allen v.
Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984); cf. Palmer, 403 U. S., at 224-225,
or to create a special exception to general jurisdictional limitations for
plaintiffs such as those before us here. Suffice it to say, I charitably
assume the former to be the case, and proceed to consider the merits
on the assumption that Shaw I was correctly decided.



The District Court concluded that Shaw I required the application of
strict scrutiny in any case containing proof that "racial considerations
played a `substantial' or `motivating' role in the line-drawing
process, even if they were not the only factor that influenced that
process." 861 F. Supp., at 431. The court acknowledged that under
this standard any deliberate effort to draw majority-minority districts
in conformity with the Voting Rights Act would attract the strictest
constitutional review, regardless of whether race-neutral districting
criteria were also considered. Id., at 429. As a consequence, it
applied strict scrutiny in this case solely on the basis of North
Carolina's concession that it sought to draw two majority-minority
districts in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and without
performing any inquiry into whether North Carolina had considered
race-neutral districting criteria in drawing District 12's boundaries.

As the majority concludes, the District Court's test for triggering
strict scrutiny set too low a threshold for subjecting a State's
districting effort to rigorous, if not fatal, constitutional review. Ante,
at 5. In my view, therefore, the Court should at the very least
remand the case to allow the District Court, which possesses an
obvious familiarity with the record and a superior understanding of
local dynamics,6  to make the fact-intensive inquiry into legislative
purpose that the proper test for triggering strict scrutiny requires.
Although I do not share the majority's willingness to divine on my
own the degree to which race determined the precise contours of
District 12, if forced to decide the matter on this record, I would
reject the majority's conclusion that a fair application of precedent
dictates that North Carolina's redistricting effort should be subject to
strict scrutiny.

Subsequent to the District Court's decision, we handed down Miller
v. Johnson, 515 U. S. ___ (1995), and issued our summary
affirmance in DeWitt v. Wilson, 515 U. S. ___ (1995). As I
understand the Miller test, and as it was applied in DeWitt, state
legislatures may take racial and ethnic characteristics of voters into
account when they are drawing district boundaries without triggering
strict scrutiny so long as race is not the "predominant" consideration
guiding their deliberations. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 15). To show that race has been "predominant," a
plaintiff must show that "the legislature subordinated traditional race-
neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations" in drawing
that district. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15); see also id., at ___ (slip
op., at 1) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) ("To invoke strict scrutiny,
a plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in substantial
disregard of customary and traditional districting practices"); DeWitt
v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409, 1412 (ED Cal. 1994), aff'd in part,
dism'd in part, 515 U. S. ___ (1995) (declining to apply strict
scrutiny because State complied with traditional districting
principles).

Indeed, the principal opinion in Bush v. Vera, post, p. ___, issued
this same day, makes clear that the deliberate consideration of race in
drawing district lines does not in and of itself invite constitutional
suspicion. As the opinion there explains, our precedents do not
require the application of strict scrutiny "to all cases of intentional
creation of majority-minority districts." Bush, post, at 3. Rather,
strict scrutiny should apply only upon a demonstration that "`race for
its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the
legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district
lines.'"  Ibid. (quoting Miller, 515 U. S. at ___ (slip op., at 11)).

Because "the legitimate consideration of race in a districting decision
is usually inevitable under the Voting Rights Act when communities
are racially mixed," Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 683 (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting), our decisions in Miller, DeWitt, and Bush have quite
properly declined to deem all race-based districting subject to strict
scrutiny. Unlike many situations in which the consideration of race
itself necessarily gives rise to constitutional suspicion, see, e.g.,
Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pea, 515 U. S. ___ (1995), our precedents have sensibly
recognized that in the context of redistricting a plaintiff must
demonstrate that race had been used in a particularly determinative
manner before strict constitutional scrutiny should obtain. Cf.
Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). This
higher threshold for triggering strict scrutiny comports with the fact
that the shared representational and stigmatic harms that Shaw
purports to guard against are likely to occur only when the State
subordinates race-neutral districting principles to a racial goal. See
Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 646-649; 861 F. Supp., at 476-478
(Voorhees, C. J., dissenting); Pildes & Niemi 92 Mich. L. Rev., at
499-524.

Shaw I is entirely consistent with our holdings that race-based
districting which respects traditional districting principles does not
give rise to constitutional suspicion. As the District Court noted,
Shaw I expressly reserved the question whether "`the intentional
creation of majority-minority districts, without more,' always gives
rise to an equal protection claim."  861 F. Supp., at 429 (quoting
Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 649). Shaw I held only that an equal
protection claim could lie as a result of allegations suggesting that the
State's districting was "so extremely irregular on its face that it
rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for
purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting
principles[.]"  Id., at 642 (emphasis added).

Moreover, Miller belies the conclusion that strict scrutiny must apply
to all deliberate attempts to draw majority-minority districts if the
Equal Protection Clause is to provide any practical limitation on a
State's power to engage in race-based districting. Although Georgia
argued that it had complied with traditional districting principles, the
Miller majority had little difficulty concluding that the State's race-
neutral explanations were implausible. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.
___ (1995).7 Thus, Miller demonstrates that although States may
avoid strict scrutiny by complying with traditional districting
principles, they may not do so by proffering pretextual, race-neutral
explanations for their maps.

The notion that conscientious federal judges will be able to
distinguish race-neutral explanations from pretextual ones is hardly
foreign to our race discrimination jurisprudence. In a variety of
contexts, from employment to juror selection, we have required
plaintiffs to demonstrate not only that a defendant's action could be
understood as impermissibly race-based, but also that the defendant's
assertedly race-neutral explanation for that action was in fact a pretext
for racial discrimination. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. ___, ___
(1995) (slip op., at 3-4); St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.
S. 502, 518-519 (1993). Similarly, I understand Shaw I, Miller,
DeWitt, and Bush to require plaintiffs to prove that the State did not
respect traditional districting principles in drawing majority-minority
districts. See Bush, post, at 3.

In holding that the present record shows race to have been the
"predominant" consideration in the creation of District 12, the Court
relies on two pieces of evidence: the State's admission that its
"overriding" purpose was to "`create two congressional districts with
effective black voting majorities,'" ante, at 5-6; and the
"`geographically non-compact'" shape of District 12, ante, at 6. In
my view, this evidence does not suffice to trigger strict scrutiny
under the "demanding" test that Miller establishes. Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring).8

North Carolina's admission reveals that it intended to create a second
majority-minority district.9   That says nothing about whether it
subordinated traditional districting principles in drawing District 12.
States which conclude that federal law requires majority-minority
districts have little choice but to give "overriding" weight to that
concern. Indeed, in Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159
(1993), we explained that evidence which showed that Ohio's chief
mapmaker preferred "federal over state law when he believed the two
in conflict does not raise an inference of intentional discrimination; it
demonstrates obedience to the Supremacy Clause of the United States
Constitution."  For that reason, we have not previously held that
concessions such as North Carolina's suffice to trigger strict
scrutiny. Cf. Bush, post, at 3, 7-8.10   Thus, the State's concession
is of little significance.

District 12's noncompact appearance also fails to show that North
Carolina engaged in suspect race-based districting. There is no
federal statutory or constitutional requirement that state electoral
boundaries conform to any particular ideal of geographic
compactness. In addition, although the North Carolina Constitution
requires electoral districts for state elective office to be contiguous, it
does not require them to be geographically compact.11   N. C.
Const., Art. II, Sections 2, 5 (1984). Given that numerous States
have written geographical compactness requirements into their state
constitutions, North Carolina's omission on this score is noteworthy.
See Grofman, Criteria for Districting: A Social Science Perspective,
33 UCLA L. Rev. 77, 84 (1985). It reveals that North Carolina's
creation of a geographically noncompact district does not itself mark
a deviation from any prevailing state districting principle.12   Thus,
while the serpentine character of District 12 may give rise to an
inference that traditional districting principles were subordinated to
race in determining its boundaries, it cannot fairly be said to prove
that conclusion in light of the clear evidence demonstrating race-
neutral explanations for the district's tortured shape. See infra.

There is a more fundamental flaw in the majority's conclusion that
racial concerns predominantly explain the creation of District 12. The
evidence of shape and intent relied on by the majority cannot
overcome the basic fact that North Carolina did not have to draw
Districts 1 and 12 in order to comply with the Justice Department's
finding that federal law required the creation of two majority-minority
districts. That goal could have been more straightforwardly
accomplished by simply adopting the Attorney General's
recommendation to draw a geographically compact district in the
southeastern portion of the State in addition to the majority-minority
district that had already been drawn in the northeastern and Piedmont
regions. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 634-635; 861 F. Supp., at 460,
461-462, 464.

That the legislature chose to draw Districts 1 and 12 instead surely
suggests that something more than the desire to create a majority-
minority district took precedence. For that reason, this case would
seem to present a version of the very hypothetical that the principal
opinion in Bush suggests should pose no constitutional problem--"an
otherwise compact majority-minority district that is misshapen by
nonracial, political manipulation."  Bush, post, at 27.

Here, no evidence suggests that race played any role in the
legislature's decision to choose the winding contours of District 12
over the more cartographically pleasant boundaries proposed by the
Attorney General.13 Rather, the record reveals that two race-neutral,
traditional districting criteria determined District 12's shape: the
interest in ensuring that incumbents would remain residents of the
districts they have previously represented; and the interest in placing
predominantly rural voters in one district and predominantly urban
voters in another. 861 F. Supp., at 466-472; see also Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S. ___ (1995) (considering whether communities
of interest were preserved); White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 793-
797 (1973) (establishing incumbency protection as a legitimate
districting principle).

Unlike most States, North Carolina has not given its chief executive
any power to veto enactments of its legislature. Thus, even though
the voters had elected a Republican Governor, the Democratic
majority in the legislature was in control of the districting process. It
was the Democrats who first decided to adopt the 11-white-district
plan that arguably would have violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights
Act and gave rise to the Attorney General's objection under Section
5. It was also the Democrats who rejected Republican Party maps
which contained two majority-minority districts because they created
too many districts in which a majority of the residents were registered
Republicans. 861 F. Supp., at 460.

If race rather than incumbency protection had been the dominant
consideration, it seems highly unlikely that the Democrats would
have drawn this bizarre district rather than accepting more compact
options that were clearly available. If race, rather than politics, had
been the "predominant" consideration for the Democrats, they could
have accepted the Republican Plan, thereby satisfying the Attorney
General and avoiding any significant risk of liability as well as the
attack mounted by the plaintiffs in this case. Instead, as the detailed
findings of the District Court demonstrate, the legislature deliberately
crafted a districting plan that would accommodate the needs of
Democratic incumbents. Id., at 466-467.14

If the Democrats remain in control of the districting process after the
remand in this case, it will be interesting to see whether they will be
willing to sacrifice one or more Democratic-majority districts in order
to create at least two districts with effective minority voting
majorities. My review of the history revealed in the findings of the
District Court persuades me that political considerations will probably
take priority over racial considerations in the immediate future, just as
they surely did during the process of rejecting the Republican plan
and ultimately adopting the plan challenged in this case.15

A deliberate effort to consolidate urban voters in one district and rural
voters in another also explains District 12's highly irregular shape.
Before District 12 had been drawn, members of the public as well as
legislators had urged that "the observance of distinctive urban and
rural communities of interest should be a prime consideration in the
general redistricting process."  Id., at 466. As a result, the
legislature was naturally attracted to a plan that, although less than
aesthetically pleasing, included both District 12, which links the
State's major urban centers, and District 1, which has a population
that predominantly lives in cities with populations of less than
20,000. Id., at 467.

Moreover, the record reveals that District 12's lines were drawn in
order to unite an African-American community whose political
tradition was quite distinct from the one that defines African-
American voters in the Coastal Plain, which District 1 surrounds.
Ibid. Indeed, two other majority-minority-district plans with less
torturous boundaries were thought unsatisfactory precisely because
they did not unite communities of interest. 861 F. Supp., at 465-
466; Tr. 481. Significantly, the irregular contours of District 12
track the State's main interstate highway and are located entirely
within the culturally distinct Piedmont Crescent region. 861 F.
Supp., at 466. Clearly, then, District 12 was drawn around a
community "defined by actual shared interests" rather than racial
demography. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15);
see also Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647-648; DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F.
Supp., at 1412, 1413-1414 (recognizing that districts were
"functionally" compact because they surrounded "communit[ies] of
interest").

In light of the majority's decision not to remand for proper
application of the Miller test, I do not understand how it can condemn
the drawing of District 12 given these two race-neutral justifications
for its shape. To be sure, in choosing a district that snakes rather
than sits, North Carolina did not put a premium on geographical
compactness. But I do not understand why that should matter in light
of the evidence which shows that other race-neutral districting
considerations were determinative.16


As the foregoing discussion illustrates, legislative decisions are often
the product of compromise and mixed motives. For that reason, I
have always been skeptical about the value of motivational analysis
as a basis for constitutional adjudication. See, e.g., Washington v.
Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 253-254 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring).
I am particularly skeptical of such an inquiry in a case of this type, as
mixed motivations would seem to be endemic to the endeavor of
political districting. See, e.g, Bush, post, at 4 ("The present case is a
mixed-motive case").

The majority's analysis of the "compelling interest" issue nicely
demonstrates the problem with parsing legislative motive in this
context. The majority posits that the legislature's compelling interest
in drawing District 12 was its desire to avoid liability under Section 2
of the Voting Rights Act. Yet it addresses the question whether
North Carolina had a compelling interest only because it first
concludes that a racial purpose dominated the State's districting
effort.

It seems to me that if the State's true purpose were to serve its
compelling interest in staving off costly litigation by complying with
federal law, then it cannot be correct to say that a racially
discriminatory purpose controlled its line-drawing. A more accurate
conclusion would be that the State took race into account only to the
extent necessary to meet the requirements of a carefully thought out
federal statute. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at 159. The
majority's implicit equation of the intentional consideration of race in
order to comply with the Voting Rights Act with intentional racial
discrimination reveals the inadequacy of the framework it adopts for
considering the constitutionality of race-based districting.

However, even if I were to assume that strict scrutiny applies, and
thus that it makes sense to consider the question, I would not share
the majority's hesitancy in concluding that North Carolina had a
"compelling interest" in drawing District 12. In my view, the record
identifies not merely one, but at least three acceptable reasons that
may have motivated legislators to favor the creation of two such
districts. Those three reasons easily satisfy the judicially created
requirement that the state legislature's decision be supported by a
"compelling state interest," particularly in a case in which the alleged
injury to the disadvantaged class--i.e., the majority of voters who are
white--is so tenuous.

First, some legislators felt that the sorry history of race relations in
North Carolina in past decades was a sufficient reason for making it
easier for more black leaders to participate in the legislative process
and to represent the State in the Congress of the United States. 861
F. Supp., at 462-463. Even if that history does not provide the kind
of precise guidance that will justify certain specific affirmative action
programs in particular industries, see ante, at 9-10, it surely provides
an adequate basis for a decision to facilitate the election of
representatives of the previously disadvantaged minority.

As a class, state legislators are far more likely to be familiar with the
role that race plays in electoral politics than they are with the role that
it plays in hiring decisions within discrete industries. Moreover,
given the North Carolina Legislature's own recent experience with
voting rights litigation, see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30
(1986), as well as the fact that 40 of the State's districts are so-called
covered jurisdictions which the Attorney General directly monitors as
a result of prior discriminatory practices, see 42 U. S. C. Section
1973c (1988 ed.), there is less reason to assume that the state
legislative judgments under review here are based on unwarranted
generalizations than may be true in other contexts. Thus, even if a
desire to correct past discrimination did not itself drive the legislative
decision to draw two majority-minority districts, it plainly constituted
a legitimate and significant additional factor supporting the decision
to do so. 861 F. Supp., at 472-473.

Second, regardless of whether Section 5 of the Act was actually
violated, I believe the State's interest in avoiding the litigation that
would have been necessary to overcome the Attorney General's
objection to the original plan provides an acceptable reason for
creating a second majority-minority district. It is entirely proper for a
State whose past practices have subjected it to the pre-clearance
obligation set forth in Section 5 to presume that the Attorney
General's construction of the Act is correct, and to take corrective
action rather than challenging him17  in Court.

Moreover, even if the State's interest in avoiding a court challenge
that might have succeeded does not constitute a sufficient justification
for its decision to draw a majority-minority district, the State plainly
had an interest in complying with a finding by the Attorney General
that it reasonably believed could not have been successfully
challenged in court. The majority disagrees, relying on our analysis
in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 20-26).
That reliance is misplaced.

In Miller, the Court concluded that Georgia had simply acceded to the
Attorney General's unreasonable construction of Section 5 without
performing any independent assessment of its validity. Ibid. By
contrast, the District Court here found as a factual matter that the
legislature's independent assessment of the reasons for the Attorney
General's denial of preclearance led it to the reasonable conclusion
that its 11-white district plan would violate the purpose prong of
Section 5. 861 F. Supp., at 474. As a result, I do not accept the
Court's conclusion that it was unreasonable for the State to believe
that its decision to draw 1 majority-minority district out of 12 would
have been subject to a successful attack under the purpose prong of
Section 5. Ante, at 11-14.

I acknowledge that when North Carolina sought preclearance it
asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for deciding not to draw a second
majority-minority district. See 861 F. Supp., at 480, n. 9 (Vorhees,
C. J., dissenting). On careful reflection, however, the legislature
concluded that those reasons would not likely suffice in a federal
action to challenge the Attorney General's ruling. The District Court
found that conclusion to be reasonable. Id., at 474. I am mystified
as to why this finding does not deserve our acceptance. Nor do I
understand the Court's willingness to credit the State's declarations
of nondiscriminatory purpose in this context, ante, at 12-13, in light
of its unwillingness to accept any of North Carolina's race-neutral
explanations for its decision to draw District 12, ante, at 5-6.

Third, regardless of the possible outcome of litigation alleging that
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act would be violated by a plan that
ensured the election of white legislators in 11 of the State's 12
congressional districts, the interest in avoiding the expense and
unpleasantness of such litigation was certainly legitimate and
substantial. That the legislature reasonably feared the possibility of a
successful Section 2 challenge cannot be credibly denied.18

In the course of the redistricting debate, numerous maps had been
presented showing that blacks could constitute more than 50 percent
of the population in two districts. 861 F. Supp., at 460-461, 474.
The District Court found that these plans had demonstrated that "the
state's African-American population was sufficiently large and
geographically compact to constitute a majority in two congressional
districts."  Id., at 464.

Moreover, the Attorney General denied preclearance on the ground
that North Carolina could have created a second majority-minority
district that was, under any reasonable standard, geographically
compact. Id., at 461-462; Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 635. Maps
prepared by the plaintiff-intervenors for this litigation conclusively
demonstrate that two compact, majority-minority districts could
indeed have been drawn. 866 F. Supp., at 464-465; Plaintiff-
Intervenors' Exh. 301, A2-A3.

Even if many of the maps proposing two
majority-African-American districts were not particularly compact,
the legislature reasonably concluded that a federal court might have
determined that some of them could have provided the basis for a
viable vote dilution suit pursuant to Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.
S., at 50-51. 861 F. Supp., at 474. That conclusion is particularly
reasonable in light of the fact that Gingles was a case fresh in the
minds of many of North Carolina's state legislators, id., at 463.
There, the State challenged the plaintiffs' Section 2 claim by pointing
to the oddly configured lines that defined their proposed majority-
minority districts. See Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F. Supp. 345, 373
(EDNC 1984). As we know, North Carolina's defense to Section 2
liability proved unsuccessful in that instance, even though the district
court acknowledged that the "single-member district specifically
suggested by the plaintiffs as a viable one is obviously not a model of
aesthetic tidiness."  Id., at 374.19

Finally, even if the record shows that
African-American voters would not have comprised more than 50
percent of the population in any plan containing two compact,
majority-minority districts, the record reveals that it would have been
possible to have drawn a map containing one compact district in
which African-Americans would have comprised more than 50
percent of the population and another compact district in which
African-Americans, by reason of the large presence of Native
Americans, would have by far constituted the largest racial group.
Plaintiff-Intervenors' Exh. 301, A2-A3. Given our recent emphasis
on considering the totality of the circumstances in Section 2 cases,
we are in no position to rebuke a State for concluding that a 40-plus
percent African-American district could provide a defense to a viable
Gingles challenge as surely as could one with a 50.1 percent African-
American population. See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. ___,
___ (1994) (slip op., at 15-18); Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146
(1993); Rural West Tennessee African-American Affairs Council,
Inc. v. McWherter, 877 F. Supp 1096 (WD Tenn. 1995), aff'd, 516
U. S. ___ (1995).20



Although the Court assumes that North Carolina had a compelling
interest in "avoiding liability" under Section 2, ante, at 15, it avoids
conclusively resolving that question because it holds that District 12
was not a "narrowly tailored" means of achieving that end. The
majority reaches this conclusion by determining that District 12 did
not "remedy" any potential violation of Section 2 that may have
occurred. Ante, at 16-17.

In my judgment, if a State's new plan successfully avoids the
potential litigation entirely, there is no reason why it must also take
the form of a "remedy" for an unproven violation. Thus, the fact that
no Section 2 violation has been proven in the territory that comprises
District 12 does not show that the district fails to serve a compelling
state interest. It shows only that a federal court, which is constrained
by Article III, would not have had the power to require North
Carolina to draw that district. It is axiomatic that a State should have
more authority to institute a districting plan than would a federal
court. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at 156-157.

That District 12 will protect North Carolina from liability seems clear.
The record gives no indication that any of the potential Section 2
claimants is interested in challenging the plan that contains District
12. Moreover, as a legal matter, North Carolina is in a stronger
position to defend against a Section 2 lawsuit with District 12 than
without it.

Johnson v. De Grandy expressly states that, at least in the context of
single-member districting plans, a plaintiff cannot make out a prima
facie case of vote dilution under Section 2 unless he can demonstrate
that his proposed map contains more majority-minority districts than
the State's. 512 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). By creating a plan
with two majority-minority districts here, the State would seem to
have precluded potential litigants from satisfying that precondition.21

In addition, satisfaction of the so-called Gingles preconditions does
not entitle an individual minority voter to inclusion in a majority-
minority district. A court may conclude that a State must create such
a district only after it considers the totality of the circumstances. A
court would be remiss if it failed to take into account that the State
had drawn majority-minority districts proportional to its minority
population which include portions of the very minority community in
which an individual minority plaintiff resides. Indeed, our recent
decisions compel courts to perform just such a calculus. See Johnson
v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15-18); Voinovich v.
Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 (1993); see also African American Voting
Rights Legal Defense Fund, Inc., v. Villa, 54 F. 3d 1345, 1355-
1357 (CA8 1995).

Finally, North Carolina's chosen means of avoiding liability will
impose none of the burdens on third parties that have made the Court
wary of voluntary, race-based state action in the past. No white
employees or applicants stand to lose jobs on account of their race as
a result of North Carolina's actions. In fact, no white voters risk
having their votes unlawfully diluted. At most, North Carolina's
chosen means will require that some people of both races will be
placed in districts other than those to which they would have
otherwise been assigned. Even assuming that "burden" is more
onerous when it results from racial considerations, it does not rise to
a level of injury that justifies a federal court intruding on the State's
discretion to formulate a plan that complies with the Voting Rights
Act.

In fact, to the extent that plaintiffs in these cases premise their
standing on the "representational" harms that they suffer, see supra,
at 10-11, a State's decision to locate a majority-minority district
outside the area that suffers from acute, racial bloc voting would
seem to diminish the likelihood that representatives in majority-
minority districts will serve only the interests of minority voters.
After all, a representative of a majority-minority district that does not
suffer from racial bloc voting cannot safely ignore the interests of
voters of either race. In this respect, the majority's narrow tailoring
requirement, by forcing States to remedy perceived Section 2
violations only by drawing the district around the area in which the
Gingles preconditions have been satisfied, has the perverse
consequence of requiring States to inflict the very harm that
supposedly renders racial gerrymandering challenges constitutionally
cognizable.22

Although I do not believe a judicial inquiry into "narrow tailoring" is
either necessary or appropriate in this case, the foregoing discussion
reveals that the "narrow tailoring" requirement that the Court has
fashioned is a pure judicial invention that unfairly deprives the
legislature of a sovereign state of its traditional discretion in
determining the boundaries of its electoral districts.23   The Court's
analysis gives rise to the unfortunate suggestion that a State which
fears a Section 2 lawsuit must draw the precise district that it believes
a federal court would have the power to impose. Such a proposition
confounds basic principles of federalism, and forces States to
imagine the legally "correct" outcome of a lawsuit that has not even
been filed.

The proposition is also at odds with the course of the litigation that
led to Gingles itself. In that case, the plaintiffs proposed a number of
oddly configured majority-minority districts to prove their vote
dilution claim. In implementing a remedy for the Section 2 violation,
the federal court wisely permitted North Carolina to propose its own
remedial districts, many of which were highly irregular in dimension.
Indeed, so peculiar were some of the shapes concocted by the State
that the Gingles plaintiffs challenged them on the grounds that they
constituted racial gerrymanders which failed to remedy the very
violations that had given rise to the need for their creation, and that
they reflected only grudging responses designed to protect incumbent
officeholders. Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F. Supp., at 381.

Although the District Court in Gingles acknowledged that the State's
plan was not the one that it would have implemented, it nonetheless
concluded that the plan constituted a reasonable exercise of state
legislative judgment. "[A] state legislature's primary jurisdiction for
legislative apportionment and redistricting must include the right, free
of judicial rejection, to implement state policies that may fail to
remedy to the fullest extent possible the voting rights violations
originally found."  Id., at 382.

In dramatic contrast, the Court today rejects North Carolina's plan
because it does not provide the precise remedy that might have been
ordered by a federal court, even though it satisfies potential plaintiffs,
furthers such race-neutral legislative ends as incumbency protection
and the preservation of distinct communities of interest, and
essentially serves to insulate the State from a successful statutory
challenge. There is no small irony in the fact that the Court's
decision to intrude into the State's districting process comes in
response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of white voters who have
suffered no history of exclusion from North Carolina's political
process, and whose only claims of harm are at best rooted in
speculative and stereotypical assumptions about the kind of
representation they are likely to receive from the candidates that their
neighbors have chosen.


It is, of course, irrelevant whether we, as judges, deem it wise policy
to create majority-minority districts as a means of assuring fair and
effective representation to minority voters. We have a duty to respect
Congress' considered judgment that such a policy may serve to
effectuate the ends of the constitutional Amendment that it is charged
with enforcing. We should also respect North Carolina's
conscientious effort to conform to that congressional determination.
Absent some demonstration that voters are being denied fair and
effective representation as a result of their race, I find no basis for
this Court's intervention into a process by which federal and state
actors, both black and white, are jointly attempting to resolve difficult
questions of politics and race that have long plagued North Carolina.
Nor do I see how our constitutional tradition can countenance the
suggestion that a State may draw unsightly lines to favor farmers or
city dwellers, but not to create districts that benefit the very group
whose history inspired the Amendment that the Voting Rights Act
was designed to implement.

Because I have no hesitation in concluding that North Carolina's
decision to adopt a plan in which white voters were in the majority in
only 10 of the State's 12 districts did not violate the Equal Protection
Clause, I respectfully dissent.

ON APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA

[June 13, 1996]


JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.

My views on this case are substantially expressed in my dissent to
Bush v. Vera, post, p. ___.


ENDNOTES for Chief Justice Rehnquist opinion

1 The complaint also named the Attorney General of the United
States and the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights
Division as defendants. The District Court granted the federal
officials' motion to dismiss, Shaw v. Barr, 808 F. Supp. 461
(EDNC 1992), and that judgment was not appealed.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS would dismiss the complaint for a lack of
standing. Post, at 4-6. Here, as in other places in his dissent,
JUSTICE STEVENS' disagreement is more with the Court's prior
decisions in Shaw I, supra, United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. ___
(1995), and Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. ___ (1995), than with this
decision. JUSTICE STEVENS challenged the Court's standing
analysis and its finding of cognizable injury in both Hays, supra, at
___ (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) and Miller, supra, at
___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and both Justice White and
JUSTICE SOUTER advanced many of the same arguments in Shaw
I. See Shaw I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2-17) (White, J.,
dissenting); id. at ___ (slip op., at 3-9, and n. 9) (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting). Their position has been repeatedly rejected by the Court.
See Shaw I, supra, at ___, Miller, supra, at ___, and Hays, supra, at
___.

3 The dissent incorrectly reads Miller as demonstrating that "although
States may avoid strict scrutiny by complying with traditional
districting principles, they may not do so by proffering pretextual,
race-neutral explanations."  Post, at 16. Miller plainly states that
although "compliance with `traditional districting principles such as
compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions' may
well suffice to refute a claim of racial gerrymandering," a State
cannot make such a refutation where "those factors were
subordinated to racial objectives."  Miller, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 17-18) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).

4 JUSTICE STEVENS discerns three reasons which he believes
"may have motivated" the legislators to favor the creation of the two
minority districts and which he believes together amount to a
compelling state interest. Post, at 25. As we explain below, a racial
classification cannot withstand strict scrutiny based upon speculation
about what "may have motivated" the legislature. To be a compelling
interest, the State must show that the alleged objective was the
legislature's "actual purpose" for the discriminatory classification,
see Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 730
and n. 16 (1982), and the legislature must have had a strong basis in
evidence to support that justification before it implements the
classification. See infra, at 10. Even if the proper factual basis
existed, we believe that the three reasons JUSTICE STEVENS
proffers, separately or combined, would not amount to a compelling
interest. First, the dissent seems to acknowledge that its initial
reason--the "sorry history of race relations in North Carolina," post,
at 25--did not itself drive the decision to create the minority districts,
presumably for the reasons we discuss infra, at 10. The dissent
contends next that an "acceptable reason for creating a second
majority-minority district" was the "State's interest in avoiding the
litigation that would have been necessary to overcome the Attorney
General's objection" under Section 5. Post, at 26. If this were true,
however, Miller v. Johnson would have been wrongly decided
because there the Court rejected the contention that complying with
the Justice Department's preclearance objection could be a compelling
interest. Miller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20-21). It necessarily
follows that avoiding the litigation required to overcome the
Department's objection could not be a compelling interest. The
dissent's final reason--"the interest in avoiding the expense and
unpleasantness of [Section 2] litigation" "regardless of the possible
outcome of [that] litigation, post, at 28--sweeps too broadly. We
assume, arguendo, that a State may have a compelling interest in
complying with the properly interpreted Voting Rights Act. Infra, at
15. But a State must also have a "strong basis in evidence," see
Shaw I, supra, at ___ (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488
U. S. 469, 500 (1989)), for believing that it is violating the Act. It
has no such interest in avoiding meritless lawsuits.

5 For examples of this limitation in application see Wygant, 476 U.
S., at 274-276 (where a plurality of the Court concluded that
remedying societal discrimination and promoting role models for
students was not a compelling interest); Richmond v. J. A. Croson
Co., 488 U. S. 469, 498-506 (1989).

6 The United States attempts to distinguish this case from Miller by
relying on the District Court's finding that North Carolina conducted
"its own independent reassessment" of Chapter 601 and found "the
Department's objection was legally and factually supportable."  Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 25; 861 F. Supp. 408, 474
(1994) (case below). The "reassessment" was the legislature's
determination that it may be susceptible to a Section 2 challenge. Id.,
at 464-465. Even if the General Assembly properly reached that
conclusion, we doubt that a showing of discriminatory effect under
Section 2, alone, could support a claim of discriminatory purpose
under Section 5. Even if discriminatory purpose could be shown, the
means of avoiding such a violation could be race-neutral, and so we
also doubt that the prospect of violating the purpose prong of Section
5 could justify a race-based redistricting plan such as the one
implemented by North Carolina.

7 We do not suggest that where the governmental interest is
eradicating the effects of past discrimination the race-based action
necessarily would have to achieve fully its task to be narrowly
tailored.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS in dissent argues that it does not matter that
District 12 could not possibly remedy a Section 2 violation because
he believes the State's plan would avoid Section 2 liability. Post, at
31. As support, JUSTICE STEVENS relies on our decision in
Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. ___ (1994), which he reads to say
that "a plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of vote dilution
under Section 2 unless he can demonstrate that his proposed plan
contains more majority-minority districts than the State's."  Id.
(citing De Grandy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10)). The dissent's
reading is flawed by its omission. In De Grandy, we presumed that
the minority districts drawn in the State's plan were lawfully drawn
and, indeed, we expressly stated that a vote dilution claim under
Section 2 "requires the possibility of creating more than the existing
number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large
minority population to elect candidates of its choice."  De Grandy,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis added).

9 This does not mean that a Section 2 plaintiff has the right to be
placed in a majority-minority district once a violation of the statute is
shown. States retain broad discretion in drawing districts to comply
with the mandate of Section 2. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146,
156-157 (1993); Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 32-37 (1993).


ENDNOTES for Justice Stevens dissenting

1 Tr. of Oral Arg. 58.

2 Counsel went so far as to liken the State's districting plan to State-
run water fountains that are available to citizens of all races but are
nevertheless labeled "Black" and "White."  He argued that the State's
race-based redistricting map constituted an unlawful racial
classification in the same way that the signs above the fountains
would. Although neither racial classification would deprive any
person of a tangible benefit--water from both fountains and effective
political representation would remain equally available to persons of
all races--each would be unconstitutional because of the very fact that
the State had espoused a racial classification publicly. Id., at 5-6.

3 There, a majority of the Court stated that "[w]e have consistently
held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about
government--claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in
proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief
that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public
at large--does not state an Article III case or controversy."  Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 573-574.

4 The Court's decision in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991),
and Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), are not to the
contrary. There, we have held that defendants have third-party
standing, no matter what their race, to assert the rights of jurors, who
have been deprived because of their race of a benefit available to all
others. No voter in this litigation has shown either that he has
uniquely been denied an otherwise generally available benefit on
account of race, or that anyone else has.

5 As I have explained, even if the Hays test showed that much, it
would still only demonstrate that the State had used geography,
rather than race, to select the citizens who would be deprived of a
color-blind districting process.

6 That is particularly true here because the author of the District Court
opinion was also the author of the District Court opinion in Gingles
v. Edmisten, 590 F. Supp. 345 (EDNC 1984), aff'd in part, rev'd in
part, Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986).

7 For example, the State argued that it drew the majority-minority
district under review so that it would follow precinct lines, but the
Court found that precinct lines had been relied on only because they
happened to facilitate the State's effort to achieve a particular racial
makeup. Similarly, the State argued that District 11 was drawn in
order to ensure that communities of interest would be kept within a
single district, but the Court found that no such communities could
be found within the district's boundaries. See Miller v. Johnson,
515 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-19).

8 It is unclear whether the majority believes that it is the combination
of these two pieces of evidence that satisfies Miller, or whether either
one would suffice.

9 Citing to trial and deposition testimony, the majority also relies on a
statement by North Carolina's chief mapmaker, Gerry Cohen, that
the creation of a majority-minority district was the "`principal
reason'" for the configurations of District 1 and District 12. Ante, at
6. Mr. Cohen's more complete explanation of the "`principal
reason'" was to create "two majority black districts that had
communities of interest within each one."  Tr. 514. What Mr. Cohen
admitted, therefore, was only that the State intentionally drew a
majority-minority district that would respect traditional districting
principles. Moreover, Mr. Cohen's "admission" in his deposition
only pertained to District 1. App. 675. Finally, he explained in his
deposition that "other reasons" also explained that District's
configuration. Ibid. Absent a showing that those "other reasons"
were race-based, Mr. Cohen's admission does not show that North
Carolina subordinated race-neutral districting criteria in drawing
District 1; it shows only that the need to comply with federal law was
critical.

10  In DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409 (ED Cal. 1994), for
example, the State conceded that compliance with Section 5 of the
Voting Rights Act constituted the one unavoidable limitation on its
redistricting process. Id., at 1410. Nevertheless, we affirmed the
District Court's conclusion that strict scrutiny did not apply because
the State gave significant weight to several race-natural
considerations in meeting that goal. Id., at 1415. Moreover, in
Miller v. Johnson, the Court applied strict scrutiny only after it
concluded that the State considered only race in adding African-
American voters to District 11; it did not hold that Georgia's general
admissions about its desire to comply with federal law themselves
sufficed. 515 U. S., at ___-___  (slip op., at 17-19).

11 The State Constitution sets forth no limitation on districting for
federal offices. Moreover, the state-prepared 1991 Legislator's
Guide to North Carolina Legislative and Congressional Redistricting
points out that the state law prohibition against dividing counties in
formulating state electoral districts was eliminated in the 1980's. See
Legislator's Guide to North Carolina Legislative and Congressional
Redistricting 12 (Feb. 1991).


12 Indeed, the State's guide to redistricting specifically informed
state legislators that compactness was of little legal significance.
"Neither the State nor federal constitution requires districts to be
compact. Critics often refer to the lack of compactness of a particular
district or group of districts as a sign of gerrymandering, but no court
has ever struck down a plan merely on the basis that it did not appear
to be compact. Although there are geometric methods for measuring
the compactness of an area, these methods have not been recognized
as judicial standards for evaluating the compactness of districts.


The recent decision in Davis v. Bandemer . . . mentions irregularly-
shaped districts as a possible sign of gerrymandering but makes clear
that irregular shapes alone do not invalidate a redistricting plan."
Ibid.

13 The State's decision to give little weight to how the district would
look on a map is entirely justifiable. Although a voter clearly has an
interest in being in a district whose members share similar interests
and concerns, that interest need not, and often is not, vindicated by
drawing districts with attractive shapes. "[The Districts] perceived
`ugliness'--their extreme irregularity of shape--is entirely a function
of an artificial perspective unrelated to the common goings and
comings of the citizen-voter. From the mapmaker's wholly
imaginary vertical perspective of 1:25,000 or so range, a citizen may
well find his district's one-dimensional, featureless shape
aesthetically `bizarre,' `grotesque,' or `ugly.'  But back down at
ground or eye-level, viewing things from his normal closely-bound
horizontal perspective, the irregularity of outline or exact volume of
the district in which he resides surely is not a matter of any great
practical consequence to his conduct as a citizen-voter."  861 F.
Supp. 408, 472, n. 60 (EDNC 1994).


In the same vein, I doubt that residents of hook-shaped
Massachusetts receive less effective representation than their
counterparts in perfectly rectangular Wyoming, or that the voting
power of residents of Hawaii is in any way impaired by virtue of the
fact that their State is not even contiguous.

14 It is ironic that despite the clear indications that party politics
explain the district's odd shape, the Court affirmed the district court's
dismissal of the plaintiffs' partisan gerrymandering claim. See Pope
v. Blue, 506 U. S. 801 (1992).

15 Interestingly, the Justice Department concluded that it was the
State's impermissible desire to favor white incumbents over African-
American voters that explained North Carolina's refusal to create a
second district and thus gave rise to a violation of the purpose prong
of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. See Shaw I, 509 U. S. 630,
___ (1993). Of course, the white plaintiffs before us here have no
standing to object to District 12 on similar grounds.

16 Although the majority asserts that North Carolina "subordinated"
traditional districting principles to racial concerns because "[r]ace was
the criterion that, in the State's view, could not be compromised,"
ante, at 7, no evidence suggests that North Carolina would have
sacrificed traditional districting principles in order to draw a second
majority-minority district. Rather, the record reveals that the State
chose District 12 over other options so that its plan would remain
faithful to traditional, race-neutral districting criteria. If strict scrutiny
applies even when a State draws a majority-minority district that
respects traditional districting principles, then I do not see how a
State can ever create a majority-minority district in order to fulfill its
obligations under the Voting Rights Act without inviting
constitutional suspicion. I had thought that the "demanding"
standard Miller established, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 1) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring), as well as our
summary affirmance in DeWitt, reflected our determination that
States should not be so constrained.

17 Although Attorney General Reno has endorsed the position taken
by the Republican administration in 1991, it was her male
predecessor who refused to preclear the State's original plan.

18  While the majority is surely correct in stating that the threat of a
lawsuit, however unlikely to succeed, does not constitute a
compelling interest, ante, at 9, n. 4, it does not follow that a State has
no compelling interest in avoiding litigation over a substantial
challenge. Here, of course, the District Court found that North
Carolina premised its decision to draw a second-majority minority
district on its reasonable conclusion that it would otherwise be
subject to a successful Section 2 challenge, not a "meritless" one.
Ibid.

19 Interestingly, although this Court in Thornburg v. Gingles held
that Section 2 plaintiffs must demonstrate that they live in "compact"
majority-minority districts, we affirmed the district court which had
found that the plaintiffs' proposed districts were contiguous but not
compact. 478 U. S., at 38. Arguably, therefore, the State could
have reasonably concluded that the maps proposing District 12 would
have themselves provided the foundation for a viable Section 2 suit.
For a discussion of how compact "compact" districts must be, see
Karlan, Maps and Misreadings: The Role of Geographic
Compactness in Racial Vote Dilution Litigation, 24 Harv. Civ.
Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 173, 199-213 (1989). See also Dillard v.
Baldwin County Bd. of Ed., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1465-1466 (MD
Ala. 1988); Houston v. Lafayette County, Miss., 56 F. 3d 606, 611
(CA5 1995).

20 Moreover, Mr. Cohen, the State's chief mapmaker, testified at
trial that in statewide elections, Native Americans and African-
Americans in the southeastern portion of North Carolina had voted
for the same candidates. Tr. 411-412.

21 The majority's assertion that De Grandy only requires a plaintiff
to show that more "reasonably compact" majority-minority districts
could have been drawn would seem to expand dramatically a State's
potential liability under Section 2. Ante, at 16-17, n. 8. I would
have thought that a State that had drawn three majority-minority
districts, one of which was "reasonably compact" and two of which
straggled in order to preserve certain distinctive communities of
interest, would at the very least be immune to a challenge by a single
African-American plaintiff bearing a map proposing to draw but two
compact majority-minority districts. The Court's expansive notion of
Section 2 liability, combined with its apparent eagerness to subject all
legislative attempts to comply with that Act to strict scrutiny, will
place many States in the untenable position of facing substantial
litigation no matter how they draw their maps. See Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17-18) (GINSBURG, J.,
dissenting).


Of course, a State that unfairly "packs" African-American voters into
a limited number of districts may be subject to a Section 2 challenge
on the ground that it failed to create so-called "influence" districts,
and perhaps the majority means to endorse that proposition as well. I
note here, however, that there is no indication that such a challenge
could be successfully brought against North Carolina's two majority-
minority district plan, which creates districts with only bare African-
American majorities.

22 The Court's strict analysis in this case is in some tension with the
more reasonable approach endorsed by JUSTICE O'CONNOR this
same day. On her view, state legislatures seeking to comply with the
Voting Right Act clearly possess more freedom to draw majority-
minority districts than do federal courts attempting to enforce it.
Bush, post, at 6 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).

23 That judicial creativity rather than constitutional principle defines
the narrowing tailoring requirement in this area of our law is clear
from Bush's quite different analysis of the same question. See
Bush, post, at 21.

<P>The Supreme Court's decision overturning a lower court ruling that ordered increased sentences for the two former Los Angeles police officers convicted in the 1991 beating of black motorist Rodney King. The justices said an appeals court was wrong to rule that former sergeant Stacey Koon and officer Laurence Powell should get new sentences ranging up to five years and 10 months in prison.</P>

<P>The appeals court had held that the trial judge was too lenient in departing from federal sentencing guidelines and giving each of the two officers a 30-month prison sentence. But the Court said the trial judge was not entirely right either in the sentence he gave the two officers and it sent the case back to the courts in California for further hearings on the proper punishment.</P>

<P>Koon, Powell and two other white officers were charged with using excessive force in the March 1991 beating of King, which a bystander had captured on videotape. After the officers were acquitted on state charges, the Justice Department then brought separate federal civil rights charges, and Koon and Powell were convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force.</P>

v.

UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 94-1664.  Argued February 20, 1996-Decided June 13, 1996*

After petitioners, Los Angeles police officers, were acquitted on state
charges of assault and excessive use of force in the beating of a
suspect during an arrest, they were convicted under 18 U. S. C.
Section 242 of violating the victim's constitutional rights under color
of law. Although the applicable United States Sentencing Guideline,
1992 USSG Section 2H1.4, indicated that they should be imprisoned
for 70 to 87 months, the District Court granted them two downward
departures from that range. The first was based on the victim's
misconduct, which contributed significantly to provoking the offense.
The second was based on a combination of four factors: (1) that
petitioners were unusually susceptible to abuse in prison; (2) that
petitioners would lose their jobs and be precluded from employment in
law enforcement; (3) that petitioners had been subject to successive
state and federal prosecutions; and (4) that petitioners posed a low risk
of recidivism. The sentencing range after the departures was 30 to 37
months, and the court sentenced each petitioner to 30 months. The
Ninth Circuit reviewed the departure decisions de novo and rejected all
of them.

Held:

1. An appellate court should not review de novo a decision to depart
from the Guideline sentencing range, but instead should ask whether
the sentencing court abused its discretion. Pp. 8-17.

(a) Although the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 requires that a
district court impose a sentence within the applicable Guideline range
in an ordinary case, 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(a), it does not eliminate
all of the district court's traditional sentencing discretion. Rather, it
allows a departure from the range if the court finds ``there exists an
aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, to a degree, not
adequately taken into consideration'' by the Sentencing Commission
in formulating the Guidelines, Section 3553(b). The Commission
states that it has formulated each Guideline to apply to a ``heartland''
of typical cases and that it did not "adequately . . . conside[r]" atypical
cases, 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A., intro. comment. 4(b). The
Commission prohibits consideration of a few factors, and it provides
guidance as to the factors that are likely to make a case atypical by
delineating certain of them as ``encouraged'' bases for departure and
others as ``discouraged'' bases for departure. Courts may depart on
the basis of an encouraged factor if the applicable Guideline does not
already take the factor into account. A court may depart on the basis
of a discouraged factor, or an encouraged factor already taken into
account, however, only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree
or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case.
If the Guidelines do not mention a factor, the court must, after
considering the structure and theory of relevant individual Guidelines
and the Guidelines as a whole, decide whether the factor is sufficiently
unusual to take the case out of the Guideline's heartland, bearing in
mind the Commission's expectation that departures based on factors
not mentioned in the Guidelines will be "highly infrequent."  Pp. 8-
13.



(b) Although Section 3742 established a limited appellate review of
sentencing decisions, Section 3742(e)(4)'s direction to "give due
deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the
facts" demonstrates that the Act was not intended to vest in appellate
courts wide-ranging authority over district court sentencing decisions.
See, e.g., Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193, 205. The
deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.
A departure decision will in most cases be due substantial deference,
for it embodies the sentencing court's traditional exercise of
discretion. See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. To
determine if a departure is appropriate, the district court must make a
refined assessment of the many facts that bear on the outcome,
informed by its vantage point and day-to-day sentencing experience.
Whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately
considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor
nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or
exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison
with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District courts have an
institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of
determinations, especially given that they see so many more
Guidelines cases. Such considerations require adoption of the abuse-
of-discretion standard of review, not de novo review. See, e.g.,
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 403. Pp. 13-17.

2. Because the Court of Appeals erred in rejecting certain of the
downward departure factors relied upon by the District Judge, the
foregoing principles require reversal of the appellate court's rulings in
significant part. Pp. 18-31.

(a) Victim misconduct is an encouraged basis for departure under
USSG Section 5K2.10, and the District Court did not abuse its
discretion in basing a departure on it. The court's analysis of this
departure factor showed a correct understanding in applying Section
2H1.4, the Guideline applicable to 18 U. S. C. Section 242, both as a
mechanical matter and in interpreting its heartland. As the court
recognized, Section 2H1.4 incorporates the Guideline for the offense
underlying the Section 242 violation, here Section 2A2.2 for
aggravated assault, and thus creates a Guideline range and a heartland
for aggravated assault committed under color of law. A downward
departure under Section 5K2.10 was justified because the punishment
prescribed by Section 2A2.2 contemplates unprovoked assaults, not
cases like this where what begins as legitimate force in response to
provocation becomes excessive. The Court of Appeals misinterpreted
the District Court to have found that the victim had been the but-for
cause of the crime, but not that he had provoked it; it also
misinterpreted the heartland of the applicable Guideline range by
concentrating on whether the victim's misconduct made this an
unusual case of excessive force. Pp. 18-23.

(b) This Court rejects the Government's contention that some of the
four considerations underlying the District Court's second downward
departure are impermissible departure factors under all circumstances.
For a court to conclude that a factor must never be considered would
be to usurp the policy-making authority that Congress vested in the
Commission, and 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(a)(2) does not compel
such a result. A court's examination of whether a factor can ever be
an appropriate basis for departure is limited to determining whether the
Commission has proscribed, as a categorical matter, that factor's
consideration. If the answer is no--as it will be most of the time--the
sentencing court must determine whether the factor, as occurring in
the particular circumstances, takes the case outside the applicable
Guideline's heartland. Pp. 23-26.

(c) The District Court abused its discretion in relying on petitioners'
collateral employment consequences as support for its second
departure. Because it is to be expected that a public official convicted
of using his governmental authority to violate a person's rights will
lose his or her job and be barred from similar employment in the
future, it must be concluded that the Commission adequately
considered these consequences in formulating 1992 USSG Section
2H1.4. Thus, the career loss factor, as it exists in this case, cannot
take the case out of Section 2H1.4's heartland. Pp. 26-28.

(d) The low likelihood of petitioners' recidivism was also an
inappropriate ground for departure, since the Commission specifically
addressed this factor in formulating the sentencing range for
petitioners' criminal history category.  See Section 4A1.3. Pp. 28-
29.

(e) However, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in relying
upon susceptibility to abuse in prison and the burdens of successive
prosecutions. The District Court's finding that the case is unusual due
to petitioners exceptional susceptibility to abuse in prison is just the
sort of determination that must be accorded deference on appeal.
Moreover, although consideration of petitioners' successive
prosecutions could be incongruous with the dual responsibilities of
citizenship in our federal system, this Court cannot conclude the
District Court abused its discretion by considering that factor. Pp. 29-
30.

(f) Where a reviewing court concludes that a district court based a
departure on both valid and invalid factors, a remand is required
unless the reviewing court determines that the district court would
have imposed the same sentence absent reliance on the invalid factors.
Williams, supra, at 203. Because the District Court here stated that
none of four factors standing alone would justify its second departure,
it is not evident that the court would have imposed the same sentence
had it relied only on susceptibility to abuse and the hardship of
successive prosecutions. The Court of Appeals should therefore
remand the case to the District Court. Pp. 30-31. 34 F. 3d 1416,
affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 13, 1996]

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The United States Sentencing Guidelines establish ranges of criminal
sentences for federal offenses and offenders. A district court must
impose a sentence within the applicable Guideline range, if it finds the
case to be a typical one. See 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(a). District
courts may depart from the Guideline range in certain circumstances,
however, see ibid., and here the District Court departed downward
eight levels. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the
District Court's departure rulings, and, over the published objection of
nine of its judges, declined to rehear the case en banc. In this case we
explore the appropriate standards of appellate review of a district
court's decision to depart from the Guidelines.


The petitioners' guilt has been established, and we are concerned here
only with the sentencing determinations made by the District Court
and Court of Appeals. A sentencing court's departure decisions are
based on the facts of the case, however, so we must set forth the
details of the crime at some length.

On the evening of March 2, 1991, Rodney King and two of his
friends sat in King's wife's car in Altadena, California, a city in Los
Angeles County, and drank malt liquor for a number of hours. Then,
with King driving, they left Altadena via a major freeway. King was
intoxicated.

California Highway Patrol officers observed King's car traveling at a
speed they estimated to be in excess of 100 m.p.h. The officers
followed King with red lights and sirens activated and ordered him by
loudspeaker to pull over, but he continued to drive. The Highway
Patrol officers called on the radio for help. Units of the Los Angeles
Police Department joined in the pursuit, one of them manned by
petitioner Laurence Powell and his trainee, Timothy Wind.

King left the freeway, and after a chase of about eight miles, stopped
at an entrance to a recreation area. The officers ordered King and his
two passengers to exit the car and to assume a felony prone position--
that is, to lie on their stomachs with legs spread and arms behind their
backs. King's two friends complied. King, too, got out of the car
but did not lie down. Petitioner Stacey Koon arrived, at once
followed by Ted Briseno and Roland Solano. All were officers of the
Los Angeles Police Department, and as sergeant, Koon took charge.
The officers again ordered King to assume the felony prone position.
King got on his hands and knees but did not lie down. Officers
Powell, Wind, Briseno and Solano tried to force King down, but
King resisted and became combative, so the officers retreated. Koon
then fired taser darts (designed to stun a combative suspect) into King.

The events that occurred next were captured on videotape by a
bystander. As the videotape begins, it shows that King rose from the
ground and charged toward Officer Powell. Powell took a step and
used his baton to strike King on the side of his head. King fell to the
ground. From the 18th to the 30th second on the videotape, King
attempted to rise, but Powell and Wind each struck him with their
batons to prevent him from doing so. From the 35th to the 51st
second, Powell administered repeated blows to King's lower
extremities; one of the blows fractured King's leg. At the 55th
second, Powell struck King on the chest, and King rolled over and lay
prone. At that point, the officers stepped back and observed King for
about 10 seconds. Powell began to reach for his handcuffs. (At the
sentencing phase, the District Court found that Powell no longer
perceived King to be a threat at this point).

At one-minute-five-seconds (1:05) on the videotape, Briseno, in the
District Court's words, "stomped" on King's upper back or neck.
King's body writhed in response. At 1:07, Powell and Wind again
began to strike King with a series of baton blows, and Wind kicked
him in the upper thoracic or cervical area six times until 1:26. At
about 1:29, King put his hands behind his back and was handcuffed.
Where the baton blows fell and the intentions of King and the officers
at various points were contested at trial, but, as noted, petitioners'
guilt has been established.

Powell radioed for an ambulance. He sent two messages over a
communications network to the other officers that said "`ooops'" and
"`I havent [sic] beaten anyone this bad in a long time.'"  34 F. 3d
1416, 1425 (CA9 1994). Koon sent a message to the police station
that said "`U[nit] just had a big time use of force. . . . Tased and beat
the suspect of CHP pursuit big time.'"  Id., at 1425.

King was taken to a hospital where he was treated for a fractured leg,
multiple facial fractures, and numerous bruises and contusions.
Learning that King worked at Dodger Stadium, Powell said to King:
"`We played a little ball tonight, didn't we Rodney? . . . You know,
we played a little ball, we played a little hardball tonight, we hit quite a
few home runs. . . . Yes, we played a little ball and you lost and we
won.'"  Ibid.

Koon, Powell, Briseno, and Wind were tried in state court on charges
of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police
officer. The officers were acquitted of all charges, with the exception
of one assault charge against Powell that resulted in a hung jury. The
verdicts touched off widespread rioting in Los Angeles. More than 40
people were killed in the riots, more than 2,000 were injured, and
nearly $1 billion in property was destroyed. New Initiatives for a
New Los Angeles: Final Report and Recommendations, Senate
Special Task Force on a New Los Angeles, Dec. 9, 1992, at 10-11.

On August 4, 1992, a federal grand jury indicted the four officers
under 18 U. S. C. Section 242, charging them with violating King's
constitutional rights under color of law. Powell, Briseno, and Wind
were charged with willful use of unreasonable force in arresting King.
Koon was charged with willfully permitting the other officers to use
unreasonable force during the arrest. After a trial in United States
District Court for the Central District of California, the jury convicted
Koon and Powell but acquitted Wind and Briseno.

We now consider the District Court's sentencing determinations.
Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court identifies the base
offense level assigned to the crime in question, adjusts the level as the
Guidelines instruct, and determines the defendant's criminal history
category. 1992 USSG Section 1B1.1. Coordinating the adjusted
offense level and criminal history category yields the appropriate
sentencing range. Ibid.

The District Court sentenced petitioners pursuant to Section 2H1.4 of
the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov.
1992) (1992 USSG), which applies to violations of 18 U. S. C.
Section 242. Section 2H1.4 prescribes a base offense level which is
the greater of the following: 10; or 6 plus the offense level applicable
to any underlying offense. The District Court found the underlying
offense was aggravated assault, which carries a base offense level of
15, 1992 USSG Section 2A2.2(a), to which 6 was added for a total of
21.

The court increased the offense level by four because petitioners had
used dangerous weapons, Section 2A2.2(b)(2)(B). The Government
asked the court also to add four levels for King's serious bodily injury
pursuant to Section 2A2.2(b) (3)(B). The court found, however, that
King's serious injuries were sustained when the officers were using
lawful force. (At trial, the Government contended that all the blows
administered after King fell to the ground 30 seconds into the
videotape violated Section 242. The District Court found that many of
those blows "may have been tortious," but that the criminal violations
did not commence until 1:07 on the videotape, after Briseno stomped
King). The court did add two levels for bodily injury pursuant to
Section 2A2.2(b)(3)(A). The adjusted offense level totaled 27, and
because neither petitioner had a criminal record, each fell within
criminal history category I. The sentencing range for an offense level
of 27 and a criminal history category I was, under the 1992
Guidelines, 70-to-87 months' imprisonment. Rather than sentencing
petitioners to a term within the Guideline range, however, the District
Court departed downward eight levels. The departure determinations
are the subject of this controversy.

The court granted a five-level departure because "the victim's
wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense
behavior," Section 5K2.10 (policy statement). 833 F. Supp. 769,
787 (CD Cal. 1993). The court also granted a three-level departure,
based on a combination of four factors. First, as a result of the
"widespread publicity and emotional outrage which have surrounded
this case," petitioners were "particularly likely to be targets of abuse"
in prison. Id., at 788. Second, petitioners would face job-termination
proceedings, after which they would lose their positions as police
officers, be disqualified from prospective employment in the field of
law enforcement, and suffer the "anguish and disgrace these
deprivations entail."  Id., at 789. Third, petitioners had been
"significantly burden[ed]" by having been subjected to successive
state and federal prosecutions. Id., at 790. Fourth, petitioners were
not "violent, dangerous, or likely to engage in future criminal
conduct," so there was "no reason to impose a sentence that reflects a
need to protect the public from [them]."  Ibid. The court concluded
these factors justified a departure when taken together, although none
would have been sufficient standing alone. Id., at 786.

The departures yielded an offense level of 19 and a sentencing range
of 30-to-37 months' imprisonment. The court sentenced each
petitioner to 30 months' imprisonment. The petitioners appealed their
convictions, and the Government appealed the sentences, arguing that
the District Court erred in granting the downward departures and in
failing to adjust the offense level upward for serious bodily injury.
The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' convictions, and affirmed
the District Court's refusal to adjust the offense level, but it reversed
the District Court's departure determinations. Only the last ruling is
before us.

The Court of Appeals reviewed "de novo whether the district court
had authority to depart."  34 F. 3d 1416, 1451 (CA9 1994). The
court reversed the five-level departure for victim misconduct,
reasoning that misbehavior by suspects is typical in cases involving
excessive use of force by police and is thus comprehended by the
applicable Guideline. Id., at 1460.

As for the three-level departure, the court rejected each factor cited.
Acknowledging that a departure for susceptibility to abuse in prison
may be appropriate in some instances and that police officers as a
group are susceptible to prison abuse, the court nevertheless said the
factor did not justify departure because "reliance solely on hostility
toward a group of which the defendant is a member provides an
unlimited open-ended rationale for departing."  Id., at 1455. The
court further noted that, unlike cases in which a defendant is
vulnerable to prison abuse due to physical characteristics over which
he has no control, here the petitioners' vulnerability stemmed from
public condemnation of their crimes. Id., at 1456.

As for petitioners' collateral employment consequences, the court first
held consideration of the factor by the trial court inconsistent with the
sentencing goals of 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(a) because the factor
did not "speak to the offender's character, the nature or seriousness of
the offense, or some other legitimate sentencing concern."  34 F. 3d,
at 1453. The court noted further that because the societal
consequences of a criminal conviction are almost unlimited, reliance
on them "would create a system of sentencing that would be
boundless in the moral, social, and psychological examinations it
required courts to make."  Id., at 1454. Third, the court noted the ease
of using the factor to justify departures based on a defendant's socio-
economic status, a consideration that, under 1992 USSG Section
5H1.10, is never a permitted basis for departure. As a final point, the
Court of Appeals said the factor was "troubling" because petitioners,
as police officers, held positions of trust they had abused. Section
3B1.3 of the Guidelines increases, rather than decreases, punishment
for those who abuse positions of trust. 34 F. 3d., at 1454.

The Court of Appeals next found the successive state and federal
prosecutions could not be a downward departure factor. It deemed the
factor irrelevant to the sentencing goals of Section 3553(a)(2) and
contradictory to the Attorney General's determination that compelling
federal interests warranted a second prosecution. Id., at 1457. The
court rejected the last departure factor as well, ruling that low risk of
recidivism was comprehended in the criminal history category and so
should not be double counted. Id., at 1456-1457.

We granted certiorari to determine the standard of review governing
appeals from a district court's decision to depart from the sentencing
ranges in the Guidelines. The appellate court should not review the
departure decision de novo, but instead should ask whether the
sentencing court abused its discretion. Having invoked the wrong
standard, the Court of Appeals erred further in rejecting certain of the
downward departure factors relied upon by the District Judge.


The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 18 U. S. C.
Section 3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. Sections 991-998, made far-
reaching changes in federal sentencing. Before the Act, sentencing
judges enjoyed broad discretion in determining whether and how long
an offender should be incarcerated. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.
S. 361, 363 (1989). The discretion led to perceptions that "federal
judges mete out an unjustifiably wide range of sentences to offenders
with similar histories, convicted of similar crimes, committed under
similar circumstances."  S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983). In
response, Congress created the United States Sentencing Commission
and charged it with developing a comprehensive set of sentencing
guidelines, 28 U. S. C. Section 994. The Commission promulgated
the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which "specify an
appropriate [sentencing range] for each class of convicted persons"
based on various factors related to the offense and the offender.
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 1, pt.
A (Nov. 1995) (1995 USSG). A district judge now must impose on a
defendant a sentence falling within the range of the applicable
Guideline, if the case is an ordinary one.

The Act did not eliminate all of the district court's discretion,
however. Acknowledging the wisdom, even the necessity, of
sentencing procedures that take into account individual circumstances,
see 28 U. S. C. Section 991(b)(1)(B), Congress allows district courts
to depart from the applicable Guideline range if "the court finds that
there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to
a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing
Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a
sentence different from that described."  18 U. S. C. Section 3553(b).
To determine whether a circumstance was adequately taken into
consideration by the Commission, Congress instructed courts to
"consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and
official commentary of the Sentencing Commission."  Ibid.

Turning our attention, as instructed, to the Guidelines Manual, we
learn that the Commission did not adequately take into account cases
that are, for one reason or another, "unusual."  1995 USSG ch. 1, pt.
A, intro. comment. 4(b). The Introduction to the Guidelines explains:

"The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline
as carving out a `heartland,' a set of typical cases embodying the
conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical
case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but
where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may
consider whether a departure is warranted."  Ibid.

The Commission lists certain factors which never can be bases for
departure (race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socio-economic
status, 1995 USSG Section 5H1.10; lack of guidance as a youth,
Section 5H1.12; drug or alcohol dependence, Section 5H1.4; and
economic hardship, Section 5K2.12), but then states that with the
exception of those listed factors, it "does not intend to limit the kinds
of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines,
that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case."  1995
USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b). The Commission gives
two reasons for its approach: "First, it is difficult to prescribe a single
set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct
potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also
recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The
Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and
rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By
monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing
their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references
thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the
guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and
should not be permitted.

"Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts' legal
freedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often.
This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take
account of those factors that the Commission's data indicate made a
significant difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice."  Ibid.

So the Act authorizes district courts to depart in cases that feature
aggravating or mitigating circumstances of a kind or degree not
adequately taken into consideration by the Commission. The
Commission, in turn, says it has formulated each Guideline to apply
to a heartland of typical cases. Atypical cases were not "adequately
taken into consideration," and factors that may make a case atypical
provide potential bases for departure. Potential departure factors
"cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listed and analyzed
in advance," 1995 USSG Section 5K2.0, of course. Faced with this
reality, the Commission chose to prohibit consideration of only a few
factors, and not otherwise to limit, as a categorical matter, the
considerations which might bear upon the decision to depart.

Sentencing courts are not left adrift, however. The Commission
provides considerable guidance as to the factors that are apt or not apt
to make a case atypical, by listing certain factors as either encouraged
or discouraged bases for departure. Encouraged factors are those "the
Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating
the guidelines."  Section 5K2.0. Victim provocation, a factor relied
upon by the District Court in this case, is an example of an encouraged
downward departure factor, Section 5K2.10, whereas disruption of a
governmental function is an example of an encouraged upward
departure factor, Section 5K2.7. Even an encouraged factor is not
always an appropriate basis for departure, for on some occasions the
applicable Guideline will have taken the encouraged factor into
account. For instance, a departure for disruption of a governmental
function "ordinarily would not be justified when the offense of
conviction is an offense such as bribery or obstruction of justice; in
such cases interference with a government function is inherent in the
offense."  Ibid. A court still may depart on the basis of such a factor
but only if it "is present to a degree substantially in excess of that
which ordinarily is involved in the offense."  Section 5K2.0.

Discouraged factors, by contrast, are those "not ordinarily relevant to
the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the
applicable guideline range." 1995 USSG ch. 5, pt. H, intro.
comment. Examples include the defendant's family ties and
responsibilities, 1995 USSG Section 5H1.6, his or her education and
vocational skills, Section 5H1.2, and his or her military, civic,
charitable, or public service record, Section 5H1.11. The
Commission does not view discouraged factors "as necessarily
inappropriate" bases for departure but says they should be relied upon
only "in exceptional cases."  1995 USSG ch. 5, pt. H, intro.
comment.

The Commission's treatment of departure factors led then-Chief Judge
Breyer to explain that a sentencing court considering a departure
should ask the following questions:


"1) What features of this case, potentially, take it outside the
Guidelines' `heartland' and make of it a special, or unusual, case?

"2) Has the Commission forbidden departures based on those
features?

"3) If not, has the Commission encouraged departures based on those
features?

"4) If not, has the Commission discouraged departures based on those
features?"  United States v. Rivera, 994 F. 2d 942, 949 (CA1 1993).

We agree with this summary. If the special factor is a forbidden
factor, the sentencing court cannot use it as a basis for departure. If
the special factor is an encouraged factor, the court is authorized to
depart if the applicable Guideline does not already take it into account.
If the special factor is a discouraged factor, or an encouraged factor
already taken into account by the applicable Guideline, the court
should depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or
in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case
where the factor is present. Cf. ibid. If a factor is unmentioned in the
Guidelines, the court must, after considering the "structure and theory
of both relevant individual guidelines and the Guidelines taken as a
whole," id., at 949, decide whether it is sufficient to take the case out
of the Guideline's heartland. The court must bear in mind the
Commission's expectation that departures based on grounds not
mentioned in the Guidelines will be "highly infrequent."  1995 USSG
ch. 1, pt. A.

Against this background, we consider the standard of review.


Before the Guidelines system, a federal criminal sentence within
statutory limits was, for all practical purposes, not reviewable on
appeal. Dorszynski v. United States, 418 U. S. 424, 431 (1974)
(reiterating "the general proposition that once it is determined that a
sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it
is imposed, appellate review is at an end"); United States v. Tucker,
404 U. S. 443, 447 (1972) (same). The Act altered this scheme in
favor of a limited appellate jurisdiction to review federal sentences. 18
U. S. C. Section 3742. Among other things, it allows a defendant to
appeal an upward departure and the Government to appeal a
downward one. Sections 3742(a), (b).

That much is clear. Less clear is the standard of review on appeal.
The Government advocates de novo review, saying that, like the
Guidelines themselves, appellate review of sentencing, and in
particular of departure decisions, was intended to reduce unjustified
disparities in sentencing. In its view, de novo review of departure
decisions is necessary "to protect against unwarranted disparities
arising from the differing sentencing approaches of individual district
judges."  Brief for United States 12.

We agree that Congress was concerned about sentencing disparities,
but we are just as convinced that Congress did not intend, by
establishing limited appellate review, to vest in appellate courts wide-
ranging authority over district court sentencing decisions. Indeed, the
text of Section 3742 manifests an intent that district courts retain much
of their traditional sentencing discretion. Section 3742(e), as enacted
in 1984, provided "[t]he court of appeals shall give due regard to the
opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the
witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court
unless they are clearly erroneous."  In 1988, Congress amended the
statute to impose the additional requirement that courts of appeals
"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines
to the facts." Examining Section 3742 in Williams v. United States,
503 U. S. 193 (1992), we stated as follows:

"Although the Act established a limited appellate review of sentencing
decisions, it did not alter a court of appeals' traditional deference to a
district court's exercise of its sentencing discretion. . . . The
development of the guideline sentencing regime has not changed our
view that, except to the extent specifically directed by statute, `it is not
the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the
sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.'"
(quoting Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290, n. 16 (1983)). 503 U.
S., at 205.

See also S. Rep. No. 225, at 150 ("The sentencing provisions of the
reported bill are designed to preserve the concept that the discretion of
a sentencing judge has a proper place in sentencing and should not be
displaced by the discretion of an appellate court").

That the district court retains much of its traditional discretion does not
mean appellate review is an empty exercise. Congress directed courts
of appeals to "give due deference to the district court's application of
the guidelines to the facts."  18 U. S. C. Section 3742(e)(4). The
deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.
The district court may be owed no deference, for instance, when the
claim on appeal is that it made some sort of mathematical error in
applying the Guidelines; under these circumstances, the appellate court
will be in as good a position to consider the question as the district
court was in the first instance.

A district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines, by contrast,
will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the
traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court. See Mistretta,
488 U. S., at 367 (noting that although the Act makes the Guidelines
binding on sentencing courts, "it preserves for the judge the discretion
to depart from the guideline applicable to a particular case"). Before a
departure is permitted, certain aspects of the case must be found
unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the
Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a
refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome,
informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal
sentencing. Whether a given factor is present to a degree not
adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged
factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some
unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by
comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District courts
have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these
sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more
Guidelines cases than appellate courts do. In 1994, for example,
93.9% of Guidelines cases were not appealed. Letter from Pamela G.
Montgomery, Deputy General Counsel, United States Sentencing
Commission (Mar. 29, 1996). "To ignore the district court's special
competence--about the `ordinariness' or `unusualness' of a particular
case--would risk depriving the Sentencing Commission of an
important source of information, namely, the reactions of the trial
judge to the fact-specific circumstances of the case. . . ."  Rivera, 994
F. 2d, at 951.

Considerations like these persuaded us to adopt the abuse-of-
discretion standard in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.
384 (1990), which involved review of a district court's imposition of
Rule 11 sanctions, and in Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552
(1988), which involved review of a district court's determination
under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U. S. C. Section 2412(d),
that the position of the United States was "substantially justified,"
thereby precluding an award of attorneys' fees against the
Government. There, as here, we noted that deference was owed to
the "`judicial actor . . . better positioned than another to decide the
issue in question.'" Pierce, supra, at 559-560 (quoting Miller v.
Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985); Cooter & Gell, supra, at 403.
Furthermore, we adopted deferential review to afford "the district
court the necessary flexibility to resolve questions involving
`multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist
generalization.'"  496 U. S., at 404 (quoting Pierce, supra, at 561-
562). Like the questions involved in those cases, a district court's
departure decision involves "the consideration of unique factors that
are `little susceptible . . . of useful generalization,'" 496 U. S., at
404, and as a consequence, de novo review is "unlikely to establish
clear guidelines for lower courts," id., at 405.

The Government seeks to avoid the factual nature of the departure
inquiry by describing it at a higher level of generality linked closely to
questions of law. The relevant question, however, is not, as the
Government says, "whether a particular factor is within the
`heartland'" as a general proposition, Brief for United States 28, but
whether the particular factor is within the heartland given all the facts
of the case. For example, it does not advance the analysis much to
determine that a victim's misconduct might justify a departure in some
aggravated assault cases. What the district court must determine is
whether the misconduct which occurred in the particular instance
suffices to make the case atypical. The answer is apt to vary
depending on, for instance, the severity of the misconduct, its timing,
and the disruption it causes. These considerations are factual matters.

This does not mean that district courts do not confront questions of
law in deciding whether to depart. In the present case, for example,
the Government argues that the District Court relied on factors that
may not be considered in any case. The Government is quite correct
that whether a factor is a permissible basis for departure under any
circumstances is a question of law, and the court of appeals need not
defer to the district court's resolution of the point. Little turns,
however, on whether we label review of this particular question abuse
of discretion or de novo, for an abuse of discretion standard does not
mean a mistake of law is beyond appellate correction. Cooter & Gell,
supra, at 402. A district court by definition abuses its discretion when
it makes an error of law. 496 U. S., at 405. That a departure
decision, in an occasional case, may call for a legal determination does
not mean, as a consequence, that parts of the review must be labeled
de novo while other parts are labeled an abuse of discretion. See id.,
at 403 (court of appeals should "apply a unitary abuse-of-discretion
standard"). The abuse of discretion standard includes review to
determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal
conclusions.

The principles we have explained require us to reverse the rulings of
the Court of Appeals in significant part.

The District Court departed downward five levels because King's
"wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense
behavior."  833 F. Supp., at 786. Victim misconduct was an
encouraged basis for departure under the 1992 Guidelines and is so
now. 1992 USSG Section 5K2.10; 1995 USSG Section 5K2.10.

Most Guidelines prescribe punishment for a single discrete statutory
offense or a few similar statutory offenses with rather predictable fact
patterns. Petitioners were convicted of violating 18 U. S. C. Section
242, however, a statute unusual for its application in so many varied
circumstances. It prohibits, among other things, subjecting any
person under color of law "to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,
or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the
United States."  A violation of Section 242 can arise in a myriad of
forms, and the Guideline applicable to the statute applies to any
violation of Section 242 regardless of the form it takes. 1992 USSG
Section 2H1.4. Section 2H1.4 takes account of the different kinds of
conduct that might constitute a Section 242 violation by instructing
courts to use as a base offense level the greater of 10, or 6 plus the
offense level applicable to any underlying offense. In this way,
Section 2H1.4 incorporates the base offense level of the underlying
offense; as a consequence, the heartland of Section 2H1.4 will vary
depending on the defendant's conduct.

Here, the underlying offense was aggravated assault. After adjusting
the offense level for use of a dangerous weapon and bodily injury, see
1992 USSG Section 1B1.5(a) (a Guideline that incorporates another
Guideline incorporates as well the other's specific offense
characteristics), the District Court added six levels as required by
Section 2H1.4. Section 2H1.4 adds the six levels to account for the
fact that the offense was committed "under actual or purported legal
authority," commentary to Section 2H1.4, and that "the harm involved
both the underlying conduct and activity intended to deprive a person
of his civil rights," ibid. (incorporating introductory commentary to
Section 2H1.1).

The District Court's analysis of this departure factor showed a correct
understanding in applying Section 2H1.4 as a mechanical matter and
in interpreting its heartland. After summarizing King's misconduct--
his driving while intoxicated, fleeing from the police, refusing to obey
the officers' commands, attempting to escape from police custody,
etc.--the District Court concluded that a downward departure pursuant
to Section 5K2.10 was justified:

"Mr. King's provocative behavior eventually subsided. The Court
recognizes that by the time the defendants' conduct crossed the line to
unlawfulness, Mr. King was no longer resisting arrest. He posed no
objective threat, and the defendants had no reasonable perception of
danger. Nevertheless, the incident would not have escalated to this
point, indeed it would not have occurred at all, but for Mr. King's
initial misconduct."  833 F. Supp., at 787.

The court placed these facts within the context of the relevant
Guideline range:

"Messrs. Koon and Powell were convicted of conduct which began as
a legal use of force against a resistant suspect and subsequently
crossed the line to unlawfulness, all in a matter of seconds, during the
course of a dynamic arrest situation. However, the convicted offenses
fall under the same Guideline Sections that would apply to a jailor,
correctional officer, police officer or other state agent who
intentionally used a dangerous weapon to assault an inmate, without
legitimate cause to initiate a use of force.

"The two situations are clearly different. Police officers are always
armed with `dangerous weapons' and may legitimately employ those
weapons to administer reasonable force. Where an officer's initial use
of force is provoked and lawful, the line between a legal arrest and an
unlawful deprivation of civil rights within the aggravated assault
Guideline is relatively thin. The stringent aggravated assault
Guideline, along with its upward adjustments for use of a deadly
weapon and bodily injury, contemplates a range of offenses involving
deliberate and unprovoked assaultive conduct. The Guidelines do not
adequately account for the differences between such `heartland'
offenses and the case at hand."  Ibid.

The Court of Appeals rejected this analysis. It interpreted the District
Court to have found that King had been the but-for cause of the crime,
not that he had provoked it. According to the Court of Appeals, the
District Court "ultimately focused not on provocation itself but rather
on the volatility of the incident, and the close proximity between, on
the one hand, the victim's misconduct and the officers' concomitant
lawful use of force, and, on the other hand, the appellants' unlawful
use or authorization of the use of force." 34 F. 3d, at 1459. The Court
of Appeals thought these considerations did not justify departure for
victim misconduct. It first quoted the test this Court formulated for
excessive force cases under the Fourth Amendment:

"`The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact
that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments--in
circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-- about
the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.'"  Ibid.
(quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396-397 (1989)).

The Court of Appeals reasoned that "before a use of force can be
found excessive, the Graham `calculus,' embracing the very factor
which the district court found to be unusual in this case--the `dynamic
arrest situation'--has been taken into consideration."  34 F. 3d., at
1459. Indeed, it noted the jury not only had to take the Graham factors
into account, but also, to establish criminal liability, had to conclude
that the petitioners "willfully came down on the wrong side of the
Graham standard."  Ibid. (emphasis in original). The Court of
Appeals concluded that "the feature which the district court found
unusual, and exculpatory, is built into the most fundamental structure
of excessive force jurisprudence, and in criminal cases is built in
twice."  Ibid.

The court misinterpreted both the District Court's opinion and the
heartland of the applicable Guideline range. The District Court's
observation that the incident would not have occurred at all "but for"
King's misconduct does not alter the further ruling that King
provoked petitioners' illegal use of force. At the outset of its analysis,
the District Court stated:  "[T]he Court finds, and considers as a
mitigating circumstance, that Mr. King's wrongful conduct
contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior."  833 F.
Supp., at 786. It later discussed "Mr. King's wrongdoing and the
substantial role it played in bringing about the defendants' unlawful
conduct."  Id., at 787. Indeed, a finding that King's misconduct
provoked lawful force but not the unlawful force that followed
without interruption would be a startling interpretation and contrary to
ordinary understandings of provocation. A response need not
immediately follow an action in order to be provoked by it. The
Commission recognized this when it noted that although victim
misconduct would rarely be a basis for departure in a nonviolent
offense, "an extended course of provocation and harassment might
lead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation."  1992
USSG Section 5K2.10. Furthermore, even if an immediate response
were required by Section 5K2.10, it occurred here: The excessive
force followed within seconds of King's misconduct.

The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the heartland of Section 2H1.4
by concentrating on whether King's misconduct made this an unusual
case of excessive force. If Section 2H1.4 covered punishment only
for excessive force cases, it might well be a close question whether
victim misconduct of this kind would be sufficient to take the case out
of the heartland. Section 2H1.4 is not so designed, however. It
incorporates the Guideline for the underlying offense, here Section
2A2.2 for aggravated assault, and thus creates a Guideline range and a
heartland for aggravated assault committed under color of law. As the
District Court was correct to point out, the same Guideline range
applies both to a Government official who assaults a citizen without
provocation as well as instances like this where what begins as
legitimate force becomes excessive. The District Court did not abuse
its discretion in differentiating between the classes of cases, nor did it
do so in concluding that unprovoked assaults constitute the relevant
heartland. Victim misconduct is an encouraged ground for departure.
A district court, without question, would have had discretion to
conclude that victim misconduct could take an aggravated assault case
outside the heartland of Section 2A2.2. That petitioners' aggravated
assaults were committed under color of law does not change the
analysis. The Court of Appeals thought that it did because Section
2H1.4 "explicitly enhances sentences for official misconduct beyond
those for civilian misconduct." 34 F. 3d, at 1460. The statement is a
non sequitur. Section 2H1.4 imposes a six-level increase regardless
of whether the Government official's aggravated assault is provoked
or unprovoked. Aggravated assault committed under color of law
always will be punished more severely than ordinary aggravated
assault. The District Court did not compare civilian offenders with
official offenders; it compared official offenders who are provoked
with official offenders who are not. That was the correct inquiry.
The punishment prescribed by Section 2A2.2 contemplates
unprovoked assaults, and as a consequence, the District Court did not
abuse its discretion in departing downward for King's misconduct in
provoking the wrong.


We turn now to the three-level departure. As an initial matter, the
Government urges us to hold each of the factors relied upon by the
District Court to be impermissible departure factors under all
circumstances. A defendant's loss of career opportunities must always
be an improper consideration, the Government argues, because
"persons convicted of crimes suffer a wide range of consequences in
addition to the sentence."  Brief for United States 38. Susceptibility to
prison abuse, continues the Government, likewise never should be
considered because the "degree of vulnerability to assault is an entirely
`subjective' judgment, and the number of defendants who may qualify
for that departure is `virtually unlimited.'"  Id., at 39 (quoting 34 F.
3d, at 1455). And so on.

Those arguments, however persuasive as a matter of sentencing
policy, should be directed to the Commission. Congress did not grant
federal courts authority to decide what sorts of sentencing
considerations are inappropriate in every circumstance. Rather, 18 U.
S. C. Section 3553(b) instructs a court that, in determining whether
there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a
degree not adequately considered by the Commission, it should
consider "only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and
official commentary of the Sentencing Commission."  The Guidelines,
however, "place essentially no limit on the number of potential factors
that may warrant departure."  Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129,
136-137 (1991). The Commission set forth factors courts may not
consider under any circumstances but made clear that with those
excep-tions, it "does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether
or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute
grounds for departure in an unusual case."  1995 USSG ch. I, pt. A,
intro. comment. 4(b). Thus, for the courts to conclude a factor must
not be considered under any circumstances would be to transgress the
policymaking authority vested in the Commission.

An example is helpful. In United States v. Lara, 905 F. 2d 599
(1990), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a District
Court's downward departure based on the defendant's "potential for
victimization" in prison due to his diminutive size, immature
appearance, and bisexual orientation. Id., at 601. In what appeared
to be a response to Lara, the Commission amended 1989 USSG
Section 5H1.4, to make [p]hysicial . . . appearance, including
physique" a discouraged factor. 1995 USSG App. C., Amend. 386
(effective Nov. 1, 1991). The Commission did not see fit, however,
to prohibit consideration of physical appearance in all cases, nor did it
address the broader category of susceptibility to abuse in prison. By
urging us to hold susceptibility to abuse in prison to be an
impermissible factor in all cases, the Government would have us reject
the Commission's considered judgment in favor of our own.

The Government acknowledges as much but says its position is
required by 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(a)(2). The statute provides:

"The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall
consider--

"(2) the need for the sentence imposed--

"(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for
the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;

"(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;

"(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and

"(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational
training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most
effective manner."

Echoing the Court of Appeals, the Government interprets Section
3553(a)(2) to direct courts to test potential departure factors against its
broad sentencing goals and to reject, as a categorical matter, factors
that are inconsistent with them. The Government and the Court of
Appeals read too much into Section 3553(a)(2). The statute requires a
court to consider the listed goals in determining "the particular
sentence to be imposed."  The wording suggests that the goals should
be considered in determining which sentence to choose from a given
Guideline range or from outside the range, if a departure is
appropriate. The statute says nothing about requiring each potential
departure factor to advance one of the specified goals. So long as the
overall sentence is "sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to
comply" with the above-listed goals, the statute is satisfied. Section
3553(a).

Even if the text of the statute were ambiguous, we would reject the
Government's interpretation. The Government's theory--that Section
3553(a)(2) directs courts to decide for themselves, by reference to the
broad, open-ended goals of the provision, whether a given factor ever
can be an appropriate sentencing consideration-- would impose
widespread judicial control over sentencing policy. This in turn would
nullify the Commission's treatment of particular departure factors and
its determination that, with few exceptions, departure factors should
not be ruled out on a categorical basis. The sparse text of Section
3553(a)(2) cannot support this implausible result. Congress created
the Commission to "establish sentencing policies and practices for the
Federal criminal justice system," 28 U. S. C. Section 991(b)(1), and
Congress instructed the Commission, not the courts, to "review and
revise" the Guidelines periodically, Section 994(o). As a result, the
Commission has assumed that its role is "over time [to]. . . refine the
guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and
should not be permitted."  1992 USSG ch. I, pt. A, intro. comment.
4(b). Had Congress intended the courts to supervise the
Commission's treatment of departure factors, we expect it would have
said so in a clear way. It did not, and we will not assume this role.

We conclude, then, that a federal court's examination of whether a
factor can ever be an appropriate basis for departure is limited to
determining whether the Commission has proscribed, as a categorical
matter, consideration of the factor. If the answer to the question is no-
-as it will be most of the time--the sentencing court must determine
whether the factor, as occurring in the particular circumstances, takes
the case outside the heartland of the applicable Guideline. We now
turn to the four factors underlying the District Court's three-level
departure.


The first question is whether the District Court abused its discretion in
relying on the collateral employment consequences petitioners would
face as a result of their convictions. The District Court stated:

"Defendants Koon and Powell will be subjected to a multiplicity of
adversarial proceedings. The LAPD Board of Rights will charge
Koon and Powell with a felony conviction and, in a quasi-judicial
proceeding, will strip them of their positions and tenure. Koon and
Powell will be disqualified from other law enforcement careers. In
combination, the additional proceedings, the loss of employment and
tenure, prospective disqualification from the field of law enforcement,
and the anguish and disgrace these deprivations entail, will constitute
substantial punishment in addition to any court-imposed sentence. In
short, because Koon and Powell are police officers, certain unique
burdens flow from their convictions."  833 F. Supp., at 789
(footnotes omitted).

The Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's analysis, noting
among other things the "ease with which this factor can be used to
justify departures that are based, either consciously or unconsciously,
on the defendant's socioeconomic status, a factor that is never a
permissible basis for review."  34 F. 3d, at 1454. We agree with the
Court of Appeals that a defendant's career may relate to his or her
socio-economic status, but the link is not so close as to justify
categorical exclusion of the effect of conviction on a career. Although
an impermissible factor need not be invoked by name to be rejected,
socio-economic status and job loss are not the semantic or practical
equivalents of each other.

We nonetheless conclude that the District Court abused its discretion
by considering petitioners' career loss because the factor, as it exists
in these circumstances, cannot take the case out of the heartland of
1992 USSG Section 2H1.4. As noted above, 18 U. S. C. Section
242 offenses may take a variety of forms, but they must involve
willful violations of rights under color of law. Although cognizant of
the deference owed to the district court, we must conclude it is not
unusual for a public official who is convicted of using his
governmental authority to violate a person's rights to lose his or her
job and to be barred from future work in that field. Indeed, many
public employees are subject to termination and are prevented from
obtaining future government employment following conviction of a
serious crime, whether or not the crime relates to their employment.
See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. Section 19572(k) (West 1995)
("Conviction of a felony or conviction of a misdemeanor involving
moral turpitude" constitutes cause for dismissal); Section 18935(f)
(State Personnel Board may refuse to declare eligible for state
employment one who has "been convicted of a felony, or convicted of
a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude"); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann.
18A.146(2) (Michie 1992); 4 Pa. Code Section 7.173 (1995). Public
officials convicted of violating Section 242 have done more than
engage in serious criminal conduct; they have done so under color of
the law they have sworn to uphold. It is to be expected that a
government official would be subject to the career-related
consequences petitioners faced after violating Section 242, so we
conclude these consequences were adequately considered by the
Commission in formulating Section 2H1.4.


We further agree with the Court of Appeals that the low likelihood of
petitioners' recidivism was not an appropriate basis for departure.
Petitioners were first-time offenders and so were classified in Criminal
History Category I. The District Court found that "[w]ithin Criminal
History Category I, the Guidelines do not adequately distinguish
defendants who, for a variety of reasons, are particularly unlikely to
commit crimes in the future. Here, the need to protect the public from
the defendants' future criminal conduct is absent `to a degree' not
contemplated by the Guidelines."  833 F. Supp., at 790, n. 20. The
District Court failed to account for the Commission's specific
treatment of this issue, however. After explaining that a district court
may depart upward from the highest Criminal Offense Category, the
Commission stated:

"However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the
range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with
the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower
limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I on the
basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate."
1992 USSG Section 4A1.3

The District Court abused its discretion by considering appellants' low
likelihood of recidivism. The Commission took that factor into
account in formulating the criminal history category.


The two remaining factors are susceptibility to abuse in prison and
successive prosecutions. The District Court did not abuse its
discretion in considering these factors. The Court of Appeals did not
dispute, and neither do we, the District Court's finding that "[t]he
extraordinary notoriety and national media coverage of this case,
coupled with the defendants' status as police officers, make Koon and
Powell unusually susceptible to prison abuse,"  833 F. Supp., at 785-
786. Petitioners' crimes, however brutal, were by definition the same
for purposes of sentencing law as those of any other police officers
convicted under 18 U. S. C. Section 242 of using unreasonable force
in arresting a suspect, sentenced under Section 2H1.4, and receiving
the upward adjustments petitioners received. Had the crimes been still
more severe, petitioners would have been assigned a different base
offense level or received additional upward adjustments. Yet, due in
large part to the existence of the videotape and all the events that
ensued, "widespread publicity and emotional outrage . . . have
surrounded this case from the outset," 833 F. Supp., at 788, which
led the District Court to find petitioners "particularly likely to be
targets of abuse during their incarceration," ibid. The District Court's
conclusion that this factor made the case unusual is just the sort of
determination that must be accorded deference by the appellate courts.

As for petitioners' successive prosecutions, it is true that consideration
of this factor could be incongruous with the dual responsibilities of
citizenship in our federal system in some instances. Successive state
and federal prosecutions do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82 (1985). Nonetheless, the District
Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a "federal
conviction following a state acquittal based on the same underlying
conduct . . . significantly burden[ed] the defendants." 833 F. Supp.,
at 790. The state trial was lengthy, and the toll it took is not beyond
the cognizance of the District Court.


The goal of the Sentencing Guidelines is, of course, to reduce
unjustified disparities and so reach towards the evenhandedness and
neutrality that are the distinguishing marks of any principled system of
justice. In this respect, the Guidelines provide uniformity,
predictability, and a degree of detachment lacking in our earlier
system. This too must be remembered, however. It has been uniform
and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to
consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a
unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes
magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue. We do not
understand it to have been the congressional purpose to withdraw all
sentencing discretion from the United States District Judge.
Discretion is reserved within the Sentencing Guidelines, and reflected
by the standard of appellate review we adopt.


*    *    *

The Court of Appeals identified the wrong standard of review. It
erred as well in finding that victim misconduct did not justify the five-
level departure and that susceptibility to prison abuse and the burdens
of successive prosecutions could not be relied upon for the three-level
departure. Those sentencing determinations were well within the
sound discretion of the District Court. The District Court did abuse its
discretion in relying on the other two factors forming the three-level
departure: career loss and low recidivism risk. When a reviewing
court concludes that a district court based a departure on both valid
and invalid factors, a remand is required unless it determines the
district court would have imposed the same sentence absent reliance
on the invalid factors. Williams, 503 U. S., at 203. As the District
Court here stated that none of the four factors standing alone would
justify the three-level departure, it is not evident that the court would
have imposed the same sentence if it had relied only on susceptibility
to abuse in prison and the hardship of successive prosecutions. The
Court of Appeals should therefore remand the case to the District
Court.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed
in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

In my opinion the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it

Part IV-B-1 from my otherwise complete endorsement of the Court's
opinion. I also note that I do not understand the opinion to foreclose
the District Court from basing a downward departure on an
aggregation of factors each of which might in itself be insufficient to

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 13, 1996]


JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree with the way today's opinion describes a district court's tasks
in sentencing under the Guidelines, and the role of a court of appeals
in reviewing sentences, but I part company from the Court in applying
its standard on two specific points. I would affirm the Court of
Appeals's rejection of the downward departures based on
susceptibility to abuse in prison and on successive prosecution, for to
do otherwise would be to attribute an element of irrationality to the
Commission and to its "heartland" concept. Accordingly, I join the
Court's opinion except Part IV-B-3.

As the majority notes, ante, at 23, "Congress did not grant federal
courts authority to decide what sorts of sentencing considerations are
inappropriate in every circumstance."  In fact, Congress allowed
district courts to depart from the Guidelines only if "the court finds
that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,
or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the
Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should
result in a sentence different from that described."  18 U. S. C.
Section 3553(b); see also ante, at 9. While discussing departures, the
Commission quotes this language from Section 3553(b), before
stating that "[w]hen a court finds an atypical case,... the court may
consider whether a departure is warranted."  United States Sentencing
Guidelines Manual, ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b) (Nov. 1995)
(1995 USSG). Thus, both Congress and the Commission envisioned
that departures would require some unusual factual circumstance, but
would be justified only if the factual difference "should" result in a
different sentence. Departures, in other words, must be consistent
with rational normative order.

As to the consideration of susceptibility to abuse in prison, the District
Court departed downward because it believed that "the widespread
publicity and emotional outrage which have surrounded this case from
the outset, in addition to the [petitioners'] status as police officers,
lead the Court to find that Koon and Powell are particularly likely to
be targets of abuse during their incarceration."  833 F. Supp. 769,
788 (CD Cal. 1993). That is, the District Court concluded that
petitioners would be subject to abuse not simply because they were
former police officers, but in large part because of the degree of
publicity and condemnation surrounding their crime.1   But that
reasoning overlooks the fact that the publicity stemmed from the
remarkable brutality of petitioners' proven behavior, which it was
their misfortune to have precisely documented on film. To allow a
departure on this basis is to reason, in effect, that the more serious the
crime, and the more widespread its consequent publicity and
condemnation, the less one should be punished; the more egregious
the act, the less culpable the offender. In the terminology of the
Guidelines, such reasoning would take the heartland to be the domain
of the less, not the more, deplorable of the acts that might come within
the statute. This moral irrationality cannot be attributed to the
heartland scheme, however, and rewarding the relatively severe
offender could hardly have been in the contemplation of a
Commission that discouraged downward departures for susceptibility
to prison abuse even when the nonculpable reason is an unusual
"[p]hysical . . . appearance, including physique."  1995 USSG
Section 5H1.4; see also ante, at 24; 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro.
comment. 3 (discussing the principle of "just deserts," which the
Commission describes as a concept under which "punishment should
be scaled to the offender's culpability and the resulting harms").2

The Court of Appeals appreciated the significance of the requisite
moral calculus when it wrote that "[a]ny public outrage was the direct
result of [petitioners'] criminal acts. It is incongruous and
inappropriate to reduce [petitioners'] sentences specifically because
individuals in society have condemned their acts as criminal and an
abuse of the trust that society placed in them."  34 F. 3d 1416, 1456
(CA9 1994). The Court of Appeals should be affirmed on this point.

I believe that it was also an abuse of discretion for the District Court to
depart downward because of the successive prosecutions.3   In these
cases, there were facial showings that the state court system had
malfunctioned when the petitioners were acquitted (or, in the case of
one charge, had received no verdict), and without something more one
cannot accept the District Court's conclusion that there was no
demonstration that a "clear miscarriage of justice" caused the result in
the state trial. 833 F. Supp., at 790. This is so simply because the
federal prosecutors, in proving their cases, proved conduct
constituting the crimes for which petitioners had been prosecuted
unsuccessfully in the state court. See Powell v. Superior Court, 232
Cal. App. 3d 785, 789, 283 Cal. Rptr. 777, 779 (1991) (noting that
petitioners were charged, inter alia, with assault by force likely to
produce great bodily injury, Cal. Penal Code Ann. Section 245(a)(1),
and being an officer unnecessarily assaulting or beating any person in
violation of Section 149); Cal. Pen. Code Section 149 ("Every public
officer who, under color of authority, without lawful necessity,
assaults or beats any person" commits an offense); Cal. Pen. Code
Section 245(a)(1) ("Every person who commits an assault upon the
person of another . . . by any means of force likely to produce great
bodily injury" commits an offense); ante, at 4 (observing that
petitioners were tried in state court for assault with a deadly weapon
and excessive use of force by a police officer and tried in federal court
for willfully using or willfully allowing others to use unreasonable
force in arresting King); 833 F. Supp., at 790 (stating that the "same
underlying conduct" was involved in both cases). While such a facial
showing resulting from the identity of factual predicates for the state
and federal prosecutions might in some cases be overcome, (by
demonstrating, say, that a crucial witness for the State was unavailable
in the state trial through no one's fault), there was no evidence to
overcome it here.

As a consequence, reading the guidelines to suggest that those who
profit from state court malfunctions should get the benefit of a
downward departure would again attribute a normative irrationality to
the heartland concept. The sense of irrationality here is, to be sure,
different from what was presupposed by the District Court's analysis
on the issue of susceptibility to abuse in prison, for the incongruity
produced by downward departures here need not depend on the
defendant's responsibility for the particular malfunction of the state
system. But the fact remains that it would be a normatively obtuse
sentencing scheme that would reward a defendant whose federal
prosecution is justified solely because he has obtained the advantage
of injustice produced by the failure of the state system.

This is not, of course, to say that a succession of state and federal
prosecutions may never justify a downward departure. If a
comparison of state and federal verdicts in relation to their factual
predicates indicates no incongruity, a downward departure at federal
sentencing could well be consistent with an application of a rational
heartland concept. But these are not such cases.

ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[June 13, 1996]


JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join the Court's opinion with the exception of Part IV-B-3. I agree
with JUSTICE SOUTER's conclusion in respect to that section. The
record here does not support departures based upon either the simple
fact of two prosecutions or the risk of mistreatment in prison.

In my view, the relevant Guideline, 1992 USSG Section 2H1.4,
encompasses the possibility of a double prosecution. That Guideline
applies to various civil rights statutes, which Congress enacted, in
part, to provide a federal forum for the protection of constitutional
rights where state law enforcement efforts had proved inadequate.
See, e.g., Ngiraingas v. Sanchez, 495 U. S. 182, 187-189 (1990);
Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171-180 (1961);  Screws v. United
States, 325 U. S. 91, 131-134 (1945) (Rutledge, J., concurring in
result). Before promulgating the Guidelines, the Commission
"examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States
Code," 1995 USSG ch.1, pt. A, intro. comment 5, and it would
likely have been aware of this well-known legislative purpose. The
centrality of this purpose, the Commission's likely awareness of it,
and other considerations that JUSTICE SOUTER mentions, ante, at
__, lead me to conclude on the basis of the statute and Guideline itself,
18 U. S. C. Section 3553(b), that the Commission would have
considered a "double prosecution" case as one ordinarily within, not
outside, the "civil rights" Guideline's "heartland."  For that reason, a
simple double prosecution, without more, does not support a
departure. See 18 U. S. C. Section 3553(b) (departures permitted
only when circumstances were "not adequately taken into
consideration" by the Commission) (emphasis added).

The departure on the basis of potential mistreatment in prison presents
a closer question. Nonetheless, differences in prison treatment are
fairly common--to the point where too frequent use of this factor as a
basis for departure could undermine the uniformity that the Guidelines
seek. For that reason, and others that JUSTICE SOUTER mentions,
ante, at __, I believe that the Guidelines themselves embody an
awareness of potentially harsh (or lenient) treatment in prison, thereby
permitting departure on that basis only in a truly unusual case. Even
affording the District Court "due deference," 18 U. S. C. Section
3742(e), I cannot find in this record anything sufficiently unusual,
compared, say, with other policemen imprisoned for civil rights
violations, as to justify departure.


ENDNOTES


1 Although it is not essential to my analysis, I note in passing that the
unusual extent of outside publicity is probably irrelevant in the prison
environment. Given any amount of outside publicity, prison inmates
quickly learn about new arrivals, including former police officers, and
the crimes of which they were convicted.

2 The requirement of normative order does not, of course, say
anything one way or the other about considering exceptionally unusual
physical appearance as a basis to anticipate abuse.

3 It is true, factually, that successive federal prosecutions after state
proceedings occur very rarely even in criminal civil rights
prosecutions, U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Who is Guarding
the Guardians?, 112, 116 (Oct. 1981) (noting that between 50 and
100 police misconduct cases are brought each year and that from
March 1977 to September 1980 only seven successive prosecutions
were authorized); United States v. Davis, 906 F. 2d 829, 832 (CA2
1990) ("In practice, successive prosecutions for the same conduct
remain rarities"). Those figures do not, however, demonstrate that all
convictions on successive federal prosecutions under 18 U. S. C.
Section 242 should for that reason be subject to discretion to depart
downward, for they do not take account of the normative ordering,
discussed below.

v.

UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

No. 95-5841.  Argued April 17, 1996-Decided June 10, 1996

Plainclothes policemen patrolling a "high drug area" in an unmarked
vehicle observed a truck driven by petitioner Brown waiting at a stop
sign at an intersection for an unusually long time; the truck then turned
suddenly, without signalling, and sped off at an "unreasonable"
speed. The officers stopped the vehicle, assertedly to warn the driver
about traffic violations, and upon approaching the truck observed
plastic bags of crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's hands. Petitioners
were arrested. Prior to trial on federal drug charges, they moved for
suppression of the evidence, arguing that the stop had not been
justified by either a reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe
petitioners were engaged in illegal drug-dealing activity, and that the
officers' traffic-violation ground for approaching the truck was
pretextual. The motion to suppress was denied, petitioners were
convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:  The temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to
believe that he has violated the traffic laws does not violate the Fourth
Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if a
reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some
additional law enforcement objective. Pp. 3-13.

(a) Detention of a motorist is reasonable where probable cause exists
to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. See, e.g., Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 659. Petitioners claim that, because the
police may be tempted to use commonly occurring traffic violations as
means of investigating violations of other laws, the Fourth
Amendment test for traffic stops should be whether a reasonable
officer would have stopped the car for the purpose of enforcing the
traffic violation at issue. However, this Court's cases foreclose the
argument that ulterior motives can invalidate police conduct justified
on the basis of probable cause. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson,
414 U. S. 218, 221, n. 1, 236. Subjective intentions play no role in
ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis. Pp. 3-7.

(b) Although framed as an empirical question--whether the officer's
conduct deviated materially from standard police practices--petitioners'
proposed test is plainly designed to combat the perceived danger of
pretextual stops. It is thus inconsistent with this Court's cases, which
make clear that the Fourth Amendment's concern with
"reasonableness" allows certain actions to be taken in certain
circumstances, whatever the subjective intent. See, e.g., Robinson,
supra, at 236. Nor can the Fourth Amendment's protections be
thought to vary from place to place and from time to time, which
would be the consequence of assessing the reasonableness of police
conduct in light of local law enforcement practices. Pp. 7-10.

(c) Also rejected is petitioners' argument that the balancing of interests
inherent in Fourth Amendment inquiries does not support enforcement
of minor traffic laws by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles,
since that practice only minimally advances the government's interest
in traffic safety while subjecting motorists to inconvenience,
confusion, and anxiety. Where probable cause exists, this Court has
found it necessary to engage in balancing only in cases involving
searches or seizures conducted in a manner unusually harmful to the
individual. See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1. The making
of a traffic stop out-of-uniform does not remotely qualify as such an
extreme practice. Pp. 10-13. 53 F. 3d 371, affirmed.

SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 95-5841

MICHAEL A. WHREN AND JAMES L. BROWN, PETITIONERS

v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[June 10, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case we decide whether the temporary detention of a motorist
who the police have probable cause to believe has committed a civil
traffic violation is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer
would have been motivated to stop the car by a desire to enforce the
traffic laws.

On the evening of June 10, 1993, plainclothes vice-squad officers of
the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department were
patrolling a "high drug area" of the city in an unmarked car. Their
suspicions were aroused when they passed a dark Pathfinder truck
with temporary license plates and youthful occupants waiting at a stop
sign, the driver looking down into the lap of the passenger at his right.
The truck remained stopped at the intersection for what seemed an
unusually long time--more than 20 seconds. When the police car
executed a U-turn in order to head back toward the truck, the
Pathfinder turned suddenly to its right, without signalling, and sped
off at an "unreasonable" speed. The policemen followed, and in a
short while overtook the Pathfinder when it stopped behind other
traffic at a red light. They pulled up alongside, and Officer Ephraim
Soto stepped out and approached the driver's door, identifying
himself as a police officer and directing the driver, petitioner Brown,
to put the vehicle in park. When Soto drew up to the driver's
window, he immediately observed two large plastic bags of what
appeared to be crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's hands. Petitioners
were arrested, and quantities of several types of illegal drugs were
retrieved from the vehicle.

Petitioners were charged in a four-count indictment with violating
various federal drug laws, including 21 U. S. C. Sections 844(a) and
860(a). At a pretrial suppression hearing, they challenged the legality
of the stop and the resulting seizure of the drugs. They argued that the
stop had not been justified by probable cause to believe, or even
reasonable suspicion, that petitioners were engaged in illegal drug-
dealing activity; and that Officer Soto's asserted ground for
approaching the vehicle--to give the driver a warning concerning
traffic violations-- was pretextual. The District Court denied the
suppression motion, concluding that "the facts of the stop were not
controverted," and "[t]here was nothing to really demonstrate that the
actions of the officers were contrary to a normal traffic stop."  App. 5.

Petitioners were convicted of the counts at issue here. The Court of
Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding with respect to the
suppression issue that, "regardless of whether a police officer
subjectively believes that the occupants of an automobile may be
engaging in some other illegal behavior, a traffic stop is permissible as
long as a reasonable officer in the same circumstances could have
stopped the car for the suspected traffic violation."  53 F. 3d 371,
374-375 (CADC 1995). We granted certiorari. 516 U. S. ___
(1996).

The Fourth Amendment guarantees "[t]he right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures." Temporary detention of
individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if
only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a
"seizure" of "persons" within the meaning of this provision. See
Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 653 (1979); United States v.
Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 556 (1976); United States v.
Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873, 878 (1975). An automobile stop is
thus subject to the constitutional imperative that it not be
"unreasonable" under the circumstances. As a general matter, the
decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have
probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. See
Prouse, supra, at 659; Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 109
(1977) (per curiam).

Petitioners accept that Officer Soto had probable cause to believe that
various provisions of the District of Columbia traffic code had been
violated. See 18 D. C. Mun. Regs. Sections 2213.4 (1995) ("An
operator shall . . . give full time and attention to the operation of the
vehicle"); 2204.3 ("No person shall turn any vehicle . . . without
giving an appropriate signal"); 2200.3 ("No person shall drive a
vehicle . . . at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the
conditions"). They argue, however, that "in the unique context of
civil traffic regulations" probable cause is not enough. Since, they
contend, the use of automobiles is so heavily and minutely regulated
that total compliance with traffic and safety rules is nearly impossible,
a police officer will almost invariably be able to catch any given
motorist in a technical violation. This creates the temptation to use
traffic stops as a means of investigating other law violations, as to
which no probable cause or even articulable suspicion exists.
Petitioners, who are both black, further contend that police officers
might decide which motorists to stop based on decidedly
impermissible factors, such as the race of the car's occupants. To
avoid this danger, they say, the Fourth Amendment test for traffic
stops should be, not the normal one (applied by the Court of Appeals)
of whether probable cause existed to justify the stop; but rather,
whether a police officer, acting reasonably, would have made the stop
for the reason given.

Petitioners contend that the standard they propose is consistent with
our past cases' disapproval of police attempts to use valid bases of
action against citizens as pretexts for pursuing other investigatory
agendas. We are reminded that in Florida v. Wells, 495 U. S. 1, 4
(1990), we stated that "an inventory search[1 ] must not be used as a
ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating
evidence"; that in Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U. S. 367, 372 (1987), in
approving an inventory search, we apparently thought it significant
that there had been "no showing that the police, who were following
standard procedures, acted in bad faith or for the sole purpose of
investigation"; and that in New York v. Burger, 482 U. S. 691, 716-
717, n. 27 (1987), we observed, in upholding the constitutionality of
a warrantless administrative inspection,2  that the search did not
appear to be "a `pretext' for obtaining evidence of . . . violation of...
penal laws."  But only an undiscerning reader would regard these
cases as endorsing the principle that ulterior motives can invalidate
police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of probable cause to
believe that a violation of law has occurred. In each case we were
addressing the validity of a search conducted in the absence of
probable cause. Our quoted statements simply explain that the
exemption from the need for probable cause (and warrant), which is
accorded to searches made for the purpose of inventory or
administrative regulation, is not accorded to searches that are not made
for those purposes. See Bertine, supra, at 371-372; Burger, supra, at
702-703.

Petitioners also rely upon Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S. 1 (1980)
(per curiam), a case which, like this one, involved a traffic stop as the
prelude to a plain-view sighting and arrest on charges wholly
unrelated to the basis for the stop. Petitioners point to our statement
that "there was no evidence whatsoever that the officer's presence to
issue a traffic citation was a pretext to confirm any other previous
suspicion about the occupants" of the car. Id., at 4, n. 4. That dictum
at most demonstrates that the Court in Bannister found no need to
inquire into the question now under discussion; not that it was certain
of the answer. And it may demonstrate even less than that: if by
"pretext" the Court meant that the officer really had not seen the car
speeding, the statement would mean only that there was no reason to
doubt probable cause for the traffic stop.

It would, moreover, be anomalous, to say the least, to treat a
statement in a footnote in the per curiam Bannister opinion as
indicating a reversal of our prior law. Petitioners' difficulty is not
simply a lack of affirmative support for their position. Not only have
we never held, outside the context of inventory search or
administrative inspection (discussed above), that an officer's motive
invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth
Amendment; but we have repeatedly held and asserted the contrary.
In United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 584, n. 3
(1983), we held that an otherwise valid warrantless boarding of a
vessel by customs officials was not rendered invalid "because the
customs officers were accompanied by a Louisiana state policeman,
and were following an informant's tip that a vessel in the ship channel
was thought to be carrying marihuana."  We flatly dismissed the idea
that an ulterior motive might serve to strip the agents of their legal
justification. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973),
we held that a traffic-violation arrest (of the sort here) would not be
rendered invalid by the fact that it was "a mere pretext for a narcotics
search," id., at 221, n. 1; and that a lawful postarrest search of the
person would not be rendered invalid by the fact that it was not
motivated by the officer-safety concern that justifies such searches,
see id., at 236. See also Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U. S. 260, 266
(1973). And in Scott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978), in
rejecting the contention that wiretap evidence was subject to exclusion
because the agents conducting the tap had failed to make any effort to
comply with the statutory requirement that unauthorized acquisitions
be minimized, we said that "[s]ubjective intent alone . . . does not
make otherwise lawful conduct illegal or unconstitutional."  We
described Robinson as having established that "the fact that the officer
does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons
which provide the legal justification for the officer's action does not
invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed
objectively, justify that action." 436 U. S., at 138.

We think these cases foreclose any argument that the constitutional
reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of
the individual officers involved. We of course agree with petitioners
that the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based
on considerations such as race. But the constitutional basis for
objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the
Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective
intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment
analysis.

Recognizing that we have been unwilling to entertain Fourth
Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual
officers, petitioners disavow any intention to make the individual
officer's subjective good faith the touchstone of "reasonableness."
They insist that the standard they have put forward--whether the
officer's conduct deviated materially from usual police practices, so
that a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would not have
made the stop for the reasons given--is an "objective" one.

But although framed in empirical terms, this approach is plainly and
indisputably driven by subjective considerations. Its whole purpose is
to prevent the police from doing under the guise of enforcing the
traffic code what they would like to do for different reasons.
Petitioners' proposed standard may not use the word "pretext," but it
is designed to combat nothing other than the perceived "danger" of the
pretextual stop, albeit only indirectly and over the run of cases.
Instead of asking whether the individual officer had the proper state of
mind, the petitioners would have us ask, in effect, whether (based on
general police practices) it is plausible to believe that the officer had
the proper state of mind.

Why one would frame a test designed to combat pretext in such
fashion that the court cannot take into account actual and admitted
pretext is a curiosity that can only be explained by the fact that our
cases have foreclosed the more sensible option. If those cases were
based only upon the evidentiary difficulty of establishing subjective
intent, petitioners' attempt to root out subjective vices through
objective means might make sense. But they were not based only
upon that, or indeed even principally upon that. Their principal basis-
-which applies equally to attempts to reach subjective intent through
ostensibly objective means--is simply that the Fourth Amendment's
concern with "reasonableness" allows certain actions to be taken in
certain circumstances, whatever the subjective intent. See, e.g.,
Robinson, supra, at 236 ("Since it is the fact of custodial arrest which
gives rise to the authority to search, it is of no moment that [the
officer] did not indicate any subjective fear of the [arrestee] or that he
did not himself suspect that [the arrestee] was armed"); Gustafson,
supra, at 266 (same). But even if our concern had been only an
evidentiary one, petitioners' proposal would by no means assuage it.
Indeed, it seems to us somewhat easier to figure out the intent of an
individual officer than to plumb the collective consciousness of law
enforcement in order to determine whether a "reasonable officer"
would have been moved to act upon the traffic violation. While police
manuals and standard procedures may sometimes provide objective
assistance, ordinarily one would be reduced to speculating about the
hypothetical reaction of a hypothetical constable--an exercise that
might be called virtual subjectivity.

Moreover, police enforcement practices, even if they could be
practicably assessed by a judge, vary from place to place and from
time to time. We cannot accept that the search and seizure protections
of the Fourth Amendment are so variable, cf. Gustafson, supra, at
265; United States v. Caceres, 440 U. S. 741, 755-756 (1979), and
can be made to turn upon such trivialities. The difficulty is illustrated
by petitioners' arguments in this case. Their claim that a reasonable
officer would not have made this stop is based largely on District of
Columbia police regulations which permit plainclothes officers in
unmarked vehicles to enforce traffic laws "only in the case of a
violation that is so grave as to pose an immediate threat to the safety of
others."  Metropolitan Police Department--Washington, D. C.,
General Order 303.1, pt. 1, Objectives and Policies (A)(2)(4) (Apr.
30, 1992), reprinted as Addendum to Brief for Petitioners. This basis
of invalidation would not apply in jurisdictions that had a different
practice. And it would not have applied even in the District of
Columbia, if Officer Soto had been wearing a uniform or patrolling in
a marked police cruiser.

Petitioners argue that our cases support insistence upon police
adherence to standard practices as an objective means of rooting out
pretext. They cite no holding to that effect, and dicta in only two
cases. In Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960), the petitioner
had been arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS), on the basis of an administrative warrant that, he claimed, had
been issued on pretextual grounds in order to enable the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search his room after his arrest. We
regarded this as an allegation of "serious misconduct," but rejected
Abel's claims on the ground that "[a] finding of bad faith is... not
open to us on th[e] record" in light of the findings below, including
the finding that "`the proceedings taken by the [INS] differed in no
respect from what would have been done in the case of an individual
concerning whom [there was no pending FBI investigation],'" id., at
226-227. But it is a long leap from the proposition that following
regular procedures is some evidence of lack of pretext to the
proposition that failure to follow regular procedures proves (or is an
operational substitute for) pretext. Abel, moreover, did not involve
the assertion that pretext could invalidate a search or seizure for which
there was probable cause--and even what it said about pretext in other
contexts is plainly inconsistent with the views we later stated in
Robinson, Gustafson, Scott, and Villamonte-Marquez. In the other
case claimed to contain supportive dicta, United States v. Robinson,
414 U. S. 218 (1973), in approving a search incident to an arrest for
driving without a license, we noted that the arrest was "not a departure
from established police department practice."  Id., at 221, n. 1. That
was followed, however, by the statement that "[w]e leave for another
day questions which would arise on facts different from these."  Ibid.
This is not even a dictum that purports to provide an answer, but
merely one that leaves the question open.

In what would appear to be an elaboration on the "reasonable officer"
test, petitioners argue that the balancing inherent in any Fourth
Amendment inquiry requires us to weigh the governmental and
individual interests implicated in a traffic stop such as we have here.
That balancing, petitioners claim, does not support investigation of
minor traffic infractions by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles;
such investigation only minimally advances the government's interest
in traffic safety, and may indeed retard it by producing motorist
confusion and alarm--a view said to be supported by the Metropolitan
Police Department's own regulations generally prohibiting this
practice. And as for the Fourth Amendment interests of the
individuals concerned, petitioners point out that our cases
acknowledge that even ordinary traffic stops entail "a possibly
unsettling show of authority"; that they at best "interfere with freedom
of movement, are inconvenient, and consume time" and at worst "may
create substantial anxiety," Prouse, 440 U. S., at 657. That anxiety is
likely to be even more pronounced when the stop is conducted by
plainclothes officers in unmarked cars.

It is of course true that in principle every Fourth Amendment case,
since it turns upon a "reasonableness" determination, involves a
balancing of all relevant factors. With rare exceptions not applicable
here, however, the result of that balancing is not in doubt where the
search or seizure is based upon probable cause. That is why
petitioners must rely upon cases like Prouse to provide examples of
actual "balancing" analysis. There, the police action in question was a
random traffic stop for the purpose of checking a motorist's license
and vehicle registration, a practice that--like the practices at issue in the
inventory search and administrative inspection cases upon which
petitioners rely in making their "pretext" claim--involves police
intrusion without the probable cause that is its traditional justification.
Our opinion in Prouse expressly distinguished the case from a stop
based on precisely what is at issue here: "probable cause to believe
that a driver is violating any one of the multitude of applicable traffic
and equipment regulations."  440 U. S., at 661. It noted approvingly
that "[t]he foremost method of enforcing traffic and vehicle safety
regulations... is acting upon observed violations," id., at 659, which
afford the "`quantum of individualized suspicion'" necessary to ensure
that police discretion is sufficiently constrained, id., at 654-655
(quoting United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S., at 560). What
is true of Prouse is also true of other cases that engaged in detailed
"balancing" to decide the constitutionality of automobile stops, such as
Martinez-Fuerte, supra, which upheld checkpoint stops, see 428 U.
S., at 556-562, and Brignoni-Ponce, supra, which disallowed so-
called "roving patrol" stops, see 422 U. S., at 882-884: the detailed
"balancing" analysis was necessary because they involved seizures
without probable cause.

Where probable cause has existed, the only cases in which we have
found it necessary actually to perform the "balancing" analysis
involved searches or seizures conducted in an extraordinary manner,
unusually harmful to an individual's privacy or even physical
interests--such as, for example, seizure by means of deadly force, see
Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985), unannounced entry into a
home, see Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. ___ (1995), entry into a
home without a warrant, see Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740
(1984), or physical penetration of the body, see Winston v. Lee, 470
U. S. 753 (1985). The making of a traffic stop out-of-uniform does
not remotely qualify as such an extreme practice, and so is governed
by the usual rule that probable cause to believe the law has been
broken "outbalances" private interest in avoiding police contact.

Petitioners urge as an extraordinary factor in this case that the
"multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations" is so large
and so difficult to obey perfectly that virtually everyone is guilty of
violation, permitting the police to single out almost whomever they
wish for a stop. But we are aware of no principle that would allow us
to decide at what point a code of law becomes so expansive and so
commonly violated that infraction itself can no longer be the ordinary
measure of the lawfulness of enforcement. And even if we could
identify such exorbitant codes, we do not know by what standard (or
what right) we would decide, as petitioners would have us do, which
particular provisions are sufficiently important to merit enforcement.

For the run-of-the-mine case, which this surely is, we think there is
no realistic alternative to the traditional common-law rule that probable
cause justifies a search and seizure.

Here the District Court found that the officers had probable cause to
believe that petitioners had violated the traffic code. That rendered the
stop reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the evidence thereby
discovered admissible, and the upholding of the convictions by the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit correct.

Judgment affirmed.

Syllabus

LOVING v. UNITED STATES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces 

No. 94-1966. Argued January 9, 1996-Decided June 3, 1996 

A general court-martial found petitioner Loving, an Army private, 
guilty of both premeditated murder and felony murder under Article 
118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. 
C.918(1), (4). Finding three aggravating factors-(1) that the 
premeditated murder was committed during a robbery, Rule for 
Courts-Martial (RCM) 1004(c)(7)(B); (2) that Loving acted as the 
triggerman in the felony murder, RCM 1004(c)- (8); and (3) that 
Loving, having been found guilty of the premeditated murder, had 
committed a second murder, also proved at his single trial, RCM 
1004(c)(7)(J)-the court-martial sentenced Loving to death. The 
commander who convened the court-martial approved the findings and 
sen- tence. The United States Army Court of Military Review and the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed, 
rejecting Loving's attack on the promulgation by Executive Order of 
the aggravating factors in RCM 1004. He contends that the Eighth 
Amendment and the separation-of- powers doctrine require that 
Congress, not the President, make the funda- mental policy 
determination respecting the factors that warrant the death penalty. 

Held:

1. On the assumption that Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and 
subsequent cases apply to this crime and sentence, the Constitution 
requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges. Under the 
Eighth Amend- ment, the military capital sentencing scheme must 
genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty 
and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence 
on the accused compared to others found guilty of murder, see, e.g., 
Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244. That narrowing is not 
achieved in the statute. Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but 
two of the four types of murder therein specified, premeditated and 
felony murder, 918(1), (4), whereas intentional murder without 
premeditation and murder resulting from wanton and dangerous 
conduct are not punishable by death, 918(2), (3). Moreover, Article 
118(4) by its terms permits the death penalty for felony murder even if 
the accused had no intent to kill and did not do the killing himself. 
Because the Eighth Amendment does not permit death to be imposed 
in those circum- stances, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801, 
additional aggravating factors establishing a higher culpability are 
necessary to Article 118's constitutional validity, see, e.g., 
Lowenfield, supra, at 244. Pp. 5-6. 

2. The President's prescription of the challenged aggravating factors 
did not violate the separation-of-powers principle. Pp. 6-25. 

(a) The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine, a strand of this 
Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence, is that the lawmaking 
function belongs to Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, 1, and may not be 
conveyed to another branch or entity, Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 
692. This princi- ple does not mean, however, that only Congress can 
make a rule of pro- spective force. Although it may not delegate the 
power to make the law, which necessarily involves discretion as to 
what the law shall be, Congress may delegate to others the authority 
or discretion to execute the law under and in pursuance of its terms. 
Id., at 693-694. Pp. 6-10. 

(b) The Court rejects Loving's argument that Congress lacks power to 
delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors 
in capital murder cases. An analysis of English constitutional history 
and of the historical necessities and events that instructed the Framers 
demonstrates that U. S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 14-which empowers 
Congress "[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the 
land and naval forc- es--does not grant an exclusive, nondelegable 
power to determine military punishments, but gives Congress such 
flexibility to exercise or share power as the times might demand. And 
it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander 
in Chief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion and 
authority. Thus, in the circumstances presented here, Con- gress may 
delegate authority to the President to define the aggravating factors that 
permit imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations 
providing the narrowing of the death-eligible class that the Eighth 
Amend- ment requires. Pp. 10-19. 

(c) Also rejected is Loving's contention that, even if Congress can 
delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors, 
Congress did not do so by implicit or explicit action in this instance. 
In fact, Congress exercised that power of delegation in 1950, when it 
enacted Articles 18, 56, and 36(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. 818 (A 
court- martial -may, under such limitations as the President may 
prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the UCMJ], 
including the penalty of death when specifically authorized-), 856 (-
The punishment which a court-martial may direct . . . may not exceed 
such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense-), and 
836(a) (which empowers the President to make proce- dural rules for 
courts-martial, and was identified by Congress in 1985 as a source of 
Presidential authority to provide capital aggravating factors). 
Together, these Articles give clear authority to the President to 
promulgate RCM 1004. Pp. 20-22. 

(d) Loving's final assertion-that even if Articles 18, 56, and 36 can be 
construed as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle to guide the 
President's discretion-is also rejected. Had the delegations here called 
for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the 
President's traditional authority, this argument might have more 
weight. However, because the President's duties as Commander in 
Chief require him to take responsible and continuing action to 
superintend the military, including the courts-martial, the delegated 
duty to prescribe aggravating factors for capital cases is interlinked 
with duties already assigned to him by the Constitution's express 
terms. The same limitations on delegation do not apply where the 
entity exercising the delegated authority possesses independent 
authority over the subject matter. See, e.g., United States v. Mazurie, 
419 U. S. 544, 556-557. Pp. 22-25. 

41 M. J. 213, affirmed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 94-1966

DWIGHT J. LOVING, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed 
forces [June 3, 1996] 

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. The case before 
us concerns the authority of the President, in our system of separated 
powers, to prescribe aggravating factors that permit a court-martial to 
impose the death penalty upon a member of the armed forces 
convicted of murder. 

I
On December 12, 1988, petitioner Dwight Loving, an Army private 
stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, murdered two taxicab drivers from the 
nearby town of Killeen.  He attempted to murder a third, but the driver 
disarmed him and escaped. Civilian and Army authorities arrested 
Loving the next afternoon.  He confessed. After a trial, an eight-
member general court-martial found Loving guilty of, among other 
offenses, premeditated murder and felony murder under Article 118 of 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. 918(1), 
(4).  In the sentencing phase of the trial, the court-martial found three 
aggravating factors: (1) that the premeditated murder of the second 
driver was committed during the course of a robbery, Rule for Courts-
Martial (RCM) 1004(c)(7)(B); (2) that Loving acted as the triggerman 
in the felony murder of the first driver, RCM 1004(c)(8); and (3) that 
Loving, having been found guilty of the premeditated murder, had 
committed a second murder, also proven at the single trial, RCM 
1004(c)(- 7)(J).  The court-martial sentenced Loving to death.  The 
commander who convened the court-martial approved the findings and 
sentence.  Cf. 10 U. S. C. 860.  The United States Army Court of 
Military Review and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed 
Forces (formerly the United States Court of Military Appeals (CMA)) 
affirmed, relying on United States v. Curtis, 32 M. J. 252 (CMA), 
cert. denied, 502 U. S. 952 (1991), to reject Loving's claims that the 
President lacked authority to promulgate the aggravating factors that 
enabled the court-martial to sentence him to death. We granted 
certiorari.  515 U. S. ___ (1995). 

II
Although American courts-martial from their inception have had the 
power to decree capital punishment, they have not long had the 
authority to try and to sentence members of the armed forces for 
capital murder committed in the United States in peacetime.  In the 
early days of the Republic the powers of courts-martial were fixed in 
the Articles of War. Congress enacted the first Articles in 1789 by 
adopting in full the Articles promulgated in 1775 (and revised in 1776) 
by the Continental Congress.  Act of Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 25, 4, 1 
Stat. 96.  (Congress reenacted the Articles in 1790 "as far as the same 
may be applicable to the constitution of the United States," Act of Apr. 
30, 1790, ch. 10, 13, 1 Stat. 121). The Articles adopted by the First 
Congress placed significant restrictions on court-martial jurisdiction 
over capital offenses. Although the death penalty was authorized for 
14 military offenses, American Articles of War of 1776, reprinted in 
W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 961 (reprint 2d ed. 1920) 
(hereinafter Winthrop); Allred, Comment, Rocks and Shoals in a Sea 
of Otherwise Deep Commitment: General Court-Martial Size and 
Voting Requirements, 35 Nav. L. Rev. 153, 156-158 (1986), the 
Articles followed the British example of ensuring the supremacy of 
civil court jurisdiction over ordinary capital crimes that were 
punishable by the law of the land and were not special military 
offenses.  1776 Articles, 10, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 964 
(requiring commanders, upon application, to exert utmost effort to 
turn offender over to civil authorities).  Cf. British Articles of War of 
1765, 11, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 937 (same).  That provision 
was deemed protection enough for soldiers, and in 1806 Congress 
debated and rejected a proposal to remove the death penalty from 
court-martial jurisdiction.  Wiener, Courts- Martial and the Bill of 
Rights: The Original Practice I, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 20-21 (1958). 
Over the next two centuries, Congress expanded court- martial 
jurisdiction.  In 1863, concerned that civil courts could not function in 
all places during hostilities, Congress granted courts-martial 
jurisdiction of common-law capital crimes and the authority to impose 
the death penalty in wartime.  Act of Mar. 3, 1863, 30, 12 Stat. 736, 
Rev. Stat. 1342, Art. 58 (1875); Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 
509, 514 (1879).  In 1916, Congress granted to the military courts a 
general jurisdiction over common-law felonies committed by service 
members, except for murder and rape committed within the continental 
United States during peacetime. Articles of War of 1916, ch. 418, 3, 
Arts. 92-93, 39 Stat. 664.  Persons accused of the latter two crimes 
were to be turned over to the civilian authorities.  Art. 74, 39 Stat. 
662. In 1950, with the passage of the UCMJ, Congress lifted even 
this restriction.  Article 118 of the UCMJ describes four types of 
murder subject to court-martial jurisdiction, two of which are 
punishable by death: "Any person subject to this chapter who, without 
justi- fication or excuse, unlawfully kills a human being, when he- 
"(1) has a premeditated design to kill; "(2) intends to kill or inflict 
great bodily harm; "(3) is engaged in an act which is inherently dan- 
gerous to another and evinces a wanton disregard of human life; or 
"(4) is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of 
burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson; -is guilty of 
murder, and shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial may 
direct, except that if found guilty under clause (1) or (4), he shall 
suffer death or imprison- ment for life as a court-martial may direct."  
10 U. S. - C. 918. So matters stood until 1983, when the CMA 
confronted a challenge to the constitutionality of the military capital 
punishment scheme in light of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 
(1972), and our ensuing death penalty jurisprudence. Although it held 
valid most of the death penalty procedures followed in courts-martial, 
the court found one fundamental defect: the failure of either the UCMJ 
or the RCM to require that court-martial members "specifically identify 
the aggravat- ing factors upon which they have relied in choosing to 
impose the death penalty."  United States v. Matthews, 16 M. J. 354, 
379.  The Court reversed Matthews' death sentence, but ruled that 
either Congress or the President could remedy the defect and that the 
new procedures could be applied retroactively. 16 M. J., at 380-382. 
The President responded to Matthews in 1984 with an Executive 
Order promulgating RCM 1004.  In conformity with 10 U. S. C. 
852(a)(1), the Rule, as amended, requires a unanimous finding that 
the accused was guilty of a capital offense before a death sentence may 
be imposed, RCM 1004(a)(2).  The Rule also requires unanimous 
findings (1) that at least one aggravating factor is present and (2) that 
any extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially 
outweighed by any admissible aggravating circumstances, 1004(b).  
RCM 1004(c) enumerates 11 categories of aggravat- ing factors 
sufficient for imposition of the death penalty.  The Rule also provides 
that the accused is to have "broad latitude to present evidence in 
extenuation and mitigation," 1004(b)(3), and is entitled to have the 
members of the court-martial instructed to consider all such evidence 
before deciding upon a death sentence, 1004(b)(6). This is the scheme 
Loving attacks as unconstitutional.  He contends that the Eighth 
Amendment and the doctrine of separation of powers require that 
Congress, and not the President, make the fundamental policy 
determination respecting the factors that warrant the death penalty. 

III
A preliminary question in this case is whether the Constitu- tion 
requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges. The 
Government does not contest the application of our death penalty 
jurisprudence to courts-martial, at least in the context of a conviction 
under Article 118 for murder committed in peacetime within the 
United States, and we shall assume that Furman and the case law 
resulting from it are applicable to the crime and sentence in question.  
Cf. Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958) (analyzing court-martial 
punishments under the Eighth Amendment).  The Eighth Amendment 
requires, among other things, that "a capital sentencing scheme must 
`genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty 
and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence 
on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.'"  
Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988) (quoting Zant v. 
Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)).  Some schemes accomplish 
that narrowing by requiring that the sentencer find at least one 
aggravating circumstance.  Ibid.  The narrowing may also be 
achieved, however, in the definition of the capital offense, in which 
circumstance the requirement that the sentencer "find the ex- istence of 
an aggravating circumstance in addition is no part of the 
constitutionally required narrowing process."  Id., at 246. Although 
the Government suggests the contrary, Brief for United States 11, n. 
6, we agree with Loving, on the assumption that Furman applies to 
this case, that aggravating factors are necessary to the constitutional 
validity of the military capital-punishment scheme as now enacted.  
Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the four types 
of murder specified: premeditated and felony murder are punishable 
by death, 10 U. S. C. 918(1), (4), whereas intentional murder 
without premeditation and murder resulting from wanton and 
dangerous conduct are not, 918(2), (3). The statute's selection of the 
two types of murder for the death penalty, however, does not narrow 
the death-eligible class in a way consistent with our cases.  Article 
118(4) by its terms permits death to be imposed for felony murder 
even if the accused had no intent to kill and even if he did not do the 
killing himself.  The Eighth Amendment does not permit the death 
penalty to be imposed in those circumstances. Enmund v. Florida, 
458 U. S. 782, 801 (1982).  As a result, additional aggravating 
factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to save Article 
118.  We turn to the question whether it violated the principle of 
separation of powers for the President to prescribe the aggravating 
factors required by the Eighth Amendment. 

IV
Even before the birth of this country, separation of powers was 
known to be a defense against tyranny.  Montesquieu, The Spirit of 
the Laws 151-152 (T. Nugent trans. 1949); 1 W. Blackstone, 
Commentaries *146-*147, *269-*270. Though faithful to the precept 
that freedom is imperiled if the whole of legislative, executive, and 
judicial power is in the same hands, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-
326 (J. Madison) (J. Cooke ed. 1961), the Framers understood that a 
"hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government from one 
another would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of 
governing itself effectively," Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 120-121 
(1976) (per curiam). -While the Constitution diffuses power the better 
to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the 
dispersed powers into a workable govern- ment.  It enjoins upon its 
branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but 
reciprocity."  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 
579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). Although separation of 
powers "d[oes] not mean that these [three] departments ought to have 
no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other,'" 
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 380-381 (1989) (quoting 
The Federalist No. 47, supra, at 325-326 (emphasis deleted)), it 
remains a basic principle of our constitutional scheme that one branch 
of the Government may not intrude upon the central prerogatives of 
another.  See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms, 514 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) 
(slip op., at 14-15) (Congress may not revise ju- dicial determinations 
by retroactive legislation reopening judgments); Bowsher v. Synar, 
478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986) (Congress may not remove executive 
officers except by impeachment); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 
954-955 (1983) (Congress may not enact laws without bicameral 
passage and presentment of the bill to the President); United States v. 
Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 147 (1872) (Congress may not deprive court of 
jurisdiction based on the outcome of a case or undo a Presidential 
pardon).  Even when a branch does not arrogate power to itself, 
moreover, the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not 
impair another in the per- formance of its constitutional duties.  
Mistretta v. United States, supra, 397-408 (examining whether statute 
requiring participation of Article III judges in the United States 
Sentencing Commission threatened the integrity of the Judicial 
Branch); Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 
445 (1977) (examining whether law requiring agency control of 
Presidential papers disrupted the functioning of the Executive). 
Deterrence of arbitrary or tyrannical rule is not the sole reason for 
dispersing the federal power among three branches, however.  By 
allocating specific powers and responsibilities to a branch fitted to the 
task, the Framers created a National Government that is both effective 
and accountable.  Article I's precise rules of representation, member 
qualifications, bicameralism, and voting procedure make Congress the 
branch most capable of responsive and deliberative lawmaking.  See 
Chadha, supra, at 951.  Ill suited to that task are the Presidency, 
designed for the prompt and faithful execution of the laws and its own 
legitimate powers, and the Judiciary, a branch with tenure and 
authority independent of direct electoral control.  The clear assignment 
of power to a branch, furthermore, allows the citizen to know who 
may be called to answer for making, or not making, those delicate and 
necessary decisions essential to governance. Another strand of our 
separation-of-powers jurisprudence, the delegation doctrine, has 
developed to prevent Congress from forsaking its duties.  Loving 
invokes this doctrine to question the authority of the President to 
promulgate RCM 1004.  The fundamental precept of the delegation 
doctrine is that the lawmaking function belongs to Congress, U. S. 
Const., Art. I, 1, and may not be conveyed to another branch or 
entity.  Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892). This principle 
does not mean, however, that only Congress can make a rule of 
prospective force.  To burden Congress with all federal rulemaking 
would divert that branch from more pressing issues, and defeat the 
Framers' design of a workable National Government.  Thomas 
Jefferson observed, -Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous 
in a great assembly as the details of execution."  5 Works of Thomas 
Jefferson 319 (P. Ford ed. 1904) (Letter to E. Carrington, Aug. 4, 
1787).  See also A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 
295 U. S. 495, 529-530 (1935) (recognizing -the necessity of 
adapting legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details 
with which the national legislature cannot deal directly-).  This Court 
established long ago that Congress must be permitted to delegate to 
others at least some authority that it could exercise itself.  Wayman v. 
Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42 (1825). "`The true distinction . . . is 
between the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily 
involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring authority or 
discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance 
of the law.  The first cannot be done; to the latter no valid objection 
can be made.'"  Field, supra, at 693-694, quoting Cincinnati, W. & 
Z. R. Co. v. Commissioners of Clinton County, 1 Ohio St. 77, 88-89 
(1852). Loving contends that the military death penalty scheme of 
Article 118 and RCM 1004 does not observe the limits of the 
delegation doctrine.  He presses his constitutional challenge on three 
fronts.  First, he argues that Congress cannot delegate to the President 
the authority to prescribe aggravating factors in capital murder cases.  
Second, he contends that, even if it can, Congress did not delegate the 
authority by implicit or explicit action.  Third, Loving believes that 
even if certain statutory provisions can be construed as delegations, 
they lack an intelligible principle to guide the President's discretion. 
Were Loving's premises to be accepted, the President would lack 
authority to prescribe aggravating factors in RCM 1004, and the death 
sentence imposed upon him would be unconstitutional. 

A
Loving's first argument is that Congress lacks power to allow the 
President to prescribe aggravating factors in military capital cases 
because any delegation would be inconsistent with the Framers' 
decision to vest in Congress the power "To make Rules for the 
Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces."  U. S. 
Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 14.  At least in the context of capital punishment 
for peacetime crimes, which implicates the Eighth Amendment, this 
power must be deemed exclusive, Loving contends.  In his view, not 
only is the determination of aggravating factors a quintessential policy 
judgment for the legislature, but the history of military capital 
punishment in England and America refutes a contrary interpretation.  
He asserts that his offense was not tried in a military court throughout 
most of English and American history.  It is this historical exclusion 
of common-law capital crimes from military jurisdiction, he urges, 
which must inform our understanding of whether Clause 14 reserves 
to Congress the power to prescribe what conduct warrants a death 
sen- tence, even if it permits Congress to authorize courts-martial to 
try such crimes.  See Brief for Petitioner 42-43; Brief for United 
States Navy-Marine Corps Appellate Defense Division as Amicus 
Curiae 7-12, 19-26.  Mindful of the historical dangers of autocratic 
military justice and of the limits Parlia- ment set on the peacetime 
jurisdiction of courts-martial over capital crimes in the first Mutiny 
Act, 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5 (1689), and having experienced the 
military excesses of the Crown in colonial America, the Framers 
harbored a deep dis- trust of executive military power and military 
tribunals.  See Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-24 (1957) (plurality); 
Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228, 232 (1959).  It follows, Loving 
says, that the Framers intended that Congress alone should possess 
the power to decide what aggravating factors justify sentencing a 
member of the armed forces to death. We have undertaken before, in 
resolving other issues, the difficult task of interpreting Clause 14 by 
drawing upon English constitutional history.  See, e.g., Reid, supra, 
at 23-30; O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258, 268-272 (1969) 
(determining that courts-martial only had jurisdiction of service-
connected crimes); Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 
(1987) (overruling O'Callahan and taking issue with its historical 
analysis).  Doing so here, we find that, although there is a grain of 
truth in Loving's historical arguments, the struggle of Parliament to 
control military tribunals and the lessons the Framers drew from it are 
more complex than he suggests.  The history does not require us to 
read Clause 14 as granting to Congress an exclusive, nondele- gable 
power to determine military punishments.  If anything, it appears that 
England found security in divided authority, with Parliament at times 
ceding to the Crown the task of fixing military punishments.  From 
the English experience the Framers understood the necessity of 
balancing efficient military discipline, popular control of a standing 
army, and the rights of soldiers; they perceived the risks inherent in 
assigning the task to one part of the government to the exclusion of 
another; and they knew the resulting parliamenta- ry practice of 
delegation.  The Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress 
the same flexibility to exercise or share power as times might demand. 
In England after the Norman Conquest, military justice was a matter 
of royal prerogative.  The rudiments of law in English military justice 
can first be seen in the written orders issued by the King for various 
expeditions.  Winthrop 17-18. For example, in 1190 Richard I issued 
an ordinance outlining six offenses to which the crusaders would be 
subject, includ- ing two punishable by death: "Whoever shall slay a 
man on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man and thrown 
into the sea.  If he shall slay him on land he shall be bound to the dead 
man and buried in the earth."  Ordinance of Richard I-A.D. 1190, 
reprinted in id., at 903.  The first comprehensive articles of war were 
those declared by Richard II at Durham in 1385 and Henry V at 
Mantes in 1419, which decreed capital offenses that not only served 
military discipline but also protected foreign noncombatants from the 
ravages of war.  T. Meron, Henry's Wars and Shakespeare's Laws: 
Perspectives on the Law of War in the Later Middle Ages 91-93 
(1993).  Articles of War, sometimes issued by military commanders 
acting under royal commission in the ensuing centuries, Winthrop 19, 
were not fixed codes, at least through the 17th century; rather, "each 
war, each expedition, had its own edict," which lost force after the 
cessation of hostilities and the disbanding of the army that had been 
formed.  J. Pipon & J. Collier, Manual of Military Law 14 (3d rev. 
ed. 1863). Thus, royal ordinances governed the conduct of war, but 
the common law did not countenance the enforcement of military law 
in times of peace "when the king's courts [were] open for all persons 
to receive justice according to the laws of the land."  1 Blackstone's 
Commentaries *413.  See also M. Hale, History of the Common Law 
of England 25-27 (C. Gray ed. 1971) (describing efforts of 
Parliament and the common law courts to limit the jurisdiction of the 
military Courts of the Constable and the Marshal). "The Common 
Law made no distinction between the crimes of soldiers and those of 
civilians in time of peace. All subjects were tried alike by the same 
civil courts, so `if a life-guardsman deserted, he could only be sued 
for breach of contract, and if he struck his officer he was only liable to 
an indictment or action of battery.'"  Reid, supra, at 26, n. 44 
(quoting 2 J. Campbell, Lives of the Chief Justices of England 91 
(1849)). See also 1 T. Macaulay, History of England 272 (hereinafter 
Macaulay). The triumph of civil jurisdiction was not absolute, 
however. The political disorders of the 17th century ushered in 
periods of harsh military justice, with soldiers and at times civilian 
rebels punished, even put to death, under the summary decrees of 
courts-martial.  See C. Clode, Administration of Justice Under 
Military and Martial Law 20-42 (1872) (hereinafter Clode).  Cf. 
Petition of Right of 1627, 3 Car. I, ch. 1 (protesting court-martial 
abuses).  Military justice was brought under the rule of parliamentary 
law in 1689, when William and Mary accepted the Bill of Rights 
requiring Parliament's consent to the raising and keeping of armies.  
In the Mutiny Act of 1689, Parliament declared the general principle 
that -noe Man may be forejudged of Life or Limbe or subjected to any 
kinde of punishment by Martiall Law or in any other manner then by 
the Judgment of his Peeres and according to the knowne and 
Established Laws of this Realme," but decreed that "Soldiers who 
shall Mutiny or stirr up Sedition or shall desert Their Majestyes 
Service be brought to a more Exemplary and speedy Punishment than 
the usuall Forms of Law will allow," and "shall suffer Death or such 
other Pun- ishment as by a Court-Martiall shall be Inflicted." 1 Wm. 
Mary, ch. 5. In one sense, as Loving wants to suggest, the Mutiny 
Act was a sparing exercise of parliamentary authority, since only the 
most serious domestic offenses of soldiers were made capital, and the 
militia was exempted.  See Solorio, supra, at 442.  He 
misunderstands the Mutiny Act of 1689, however, in arguing that it 
bespeaks a special solicitude for the rights of soldiers and a desire of 
Parliament to exclude Executive power over military capital 
punishment. The Mutiny Act, as its name suggests, came on the heels 
of the mutiny of Scottish troops loyal to James II.  3 Macaulay 45-49.  
The mutiny occurred at a watershed time.  Menaced by great 
continental powers, England had come to a grudging recognition that a 
standing army, long decried as an instru- ment of despotism, had to be 
maintained on its soil.  The mutiny cast in high relief the dangers to 
the polity of a standing army turned bad.  Macaulay describes the 
sentiment of the time: -There must then be regular soldiers; and, if 
there were to be regular soldiers, it must be indispensable, both to 
their efficiency, and to the security of every other class, that they 
should be kept under a strict discipline.  An ill disciplined army . . . 
[is] formidable only to the country which it is paid to defend.  A 
strong line of demarcation must therefore be drawn between the 
soldiers and the rest of the community.  For the sake of public 
freedom, they must, in the midst of freedom, be placed under a 
despotic rule.  They must be subject to a sharper penal code, and to a 
more stringent code of procedure, than are ad- ministered by the 
ordinary tribunals."  Id., at 50.  The Mutiny Act, then, was no 
measure of leniency for sol- diers.  With its passage, "the Army of 
William III was governed under a severer Code than that made by his 
predecessors under the Prerogative authority of the Crown. The 
Mutiny Act, without displacing the Articles of War and those Military 
Tribunals under which the Army had hitherto been governed, gave 
statutory sanction to the infliction of Capital Punishments for offences 
rather Political than Military, and which had rarely been so punished 
under Prerogative authority."  Clode 9-10.  See also Duke & Vogel, 
The Constitution and the Standing Army: Another Problem of Court-
Martial Jurisdiction, 13 Vand. L. Rev. 435, 443, and n. 40 (1960) 
(noting that the Articles of War of 1662 and 1686 prohibited the 
infliction in peacetime of punishment costing life or limb).  Indeed, it 
was the Crown which later tempered the excesses of courts-martial 
wielding the power of capital punishment.  It did so by stipulating in 
the Articles of War (which remained a matter of royal prerogative) that 
all capital sentences be sent to it for revision or approval.  Clode 9-10. 
Popular suspicion of the standing army persisted, 5 Ma- caulay 253-
273, 393, and Parliament authorized the Mutiny Acts only for periods 
of six months and then a year, 3 id., at 51-53.  But renewed they were 
time and again, and Parlia- ment would alter the power of courts-
martial to impose the death penalty for peacetime offenses throughout 
the next century.  It withdrew the power altogether in 1713, 12 Anne, 
ch. 13, 1, only to regret the absence of the penalty during the 
rebellion of 1715, Clode 49.  The third of the Mutiny Acts of 1715 
subjected the soldier to capital punishment for a wide array of 
peacetime offenses related to political disorder and troop discipline.  
Id., at 50.  And, for a short time in the 18th century, Parliament 
allowed the Crown to invest courts- martial with a general criminal 
jurisdiction over soldiers even at home, placing no substantive limit on 
the penalties that could be imposed; until 1718, that jurisdiction was 
superior to civil courts.  Id., at 52-53.  The propriety of that general 
jurisdiction within the kingdom was questioned, and the jurisdiction 
was withdrawn in 1749.  Id., at 53.  Nevertheless, even as it 
continued to adjust the scope of military jurisdiction at home, 
Parliament entrusted broad powers to the Crown to define and punish 
military crimes abroad.  In 1713, it gave statutory sanction to the 
Crown's longstanding practice of issuing Articles of War without 
limiting the kind of punish- ments that might be imposed; and, in the 
same Act, it delegated the power to "erect and constitute Courts 
Martial with Power to try hear and determine any Crime or Offence by 
such Articles of War and inflict Penalties by Sentence or Judgement in 
any of Her Majesties Dominions beyond the Seas or elsewhere 
beyond the Seas (except in the Kingdom of Ireland) . . . as might have 
been done by Her Majesties Authority beyond the Seas in Time of 
War."  12 Anne, ch. 13, 43; Winthrop 20.  Cf. Duke & Vogel, 
supra, at 444 (noting that Parliament in 1803 gave statutory authority 
to the Crown to promulgate Articles of War applicable to troops sta- 
tioned in England as well).  See Solorio, 483 U. S., at 442 
(discussing a provision in the British Articles of War of 1774 
providing court-martial jurisdiction of civilian offenses by soldiers). 
As Loving contends, and as we have explained elsewhere, the 
Framers well knew this history, and had encountered firsthand the 
abuses of military law in the colonies.  See Reid, 354 U. S., at 27-28.  
As many were themselves veterans of the Revolutionary War, 
however, they also knew the impera- tives of military discipline.  
What they distrusted were not courts-martial per se, but military 
justice dispensed by a commander unchecked by the civil power in 
proceedings so summary as to be lawless.  The latter was the evil that 
caused Blackstone to declare that "martial law" " by which he, not 
observing the modern distinction between military and martial law, 
meant decrees of courts-martial disciplining soldiers in wartime " "is 
built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its 
decisions, [and] is, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, in truth and reality 
no law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a law."  1 
Blackstone's Commentaries *413.  See also Hale, History of the 
Common Law of England, at 26-27; Clode 21 (military law in early 
seven- teenth century England amounted to "the arbitrary right to 
punish or destroy, without legal trial, any assumed delinquent).  The 
partial security Englishmen won against such abuse in 1689 was to 
give Parliament, preeminent guardian of the British constitution, 
primacy in matters of military law. This fact does not suggest, 
however, that a legislature's power must be exclusive.  It was for 
Parliament, as it did in the various Mutiny Acts, to designate as the 
times required what peacetime offenses by soldiers deserved the 
punishment of death; and it was for Parliament, as it did in 1713, to 
delegate the authority to define wartime offenses and devise their 
punishments, including death.  The Crown received the delegated 
power and the concomitant responsibility for its prudent exercise.  The 
lesson from the English constitutional experience was that Parliament 
must have the primary power to regulate the armed forces and to 
determine the punishments that could be imposed upon soldiers by 
courts-martial.  That was not inconsistent, however, with the further 
power to divide authority between it and the Crown as conditions 
might warrant. Far from attempting to replicate the English system, of 
course, the Framers separated the powers of the Federal Government 
into three branches to avoid dangers they thought latent or inevitable in 
the parliamentary structure.  The historical necessities and events of 
the English constitutional experience, though, were familiar to them 
and inform our understanding of the purpose and meaning of 
constitutional provisions.  As we have observed before, with this 
experience to consult they elected not to "freeze court-martial usage at 
a particular time" for all ages following, Solorio, 483 U. S., at 446, 
nor did they deprive Congress of the services of the Executive in 
establishing rules for the governance of the military, including rules 
for capital punishment.  In the words of Alexander Hamilton, the 
power to regulate the armed forces, like other powers related to the 
common defense, was given to Congress without limitation: Because 
it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national 
exigencies, or the corresponding extent & variety of the means which 
may be necessary to satisfy them.  The circumstances that endanger 
the safety of nations are infinite, and for this reason no constitutional 
shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is 
committed.  This power ought to be co-extensive with all the possible 
combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the 
direction of the same councils, which are appointed to preside over the 
common defence."  The Federalist, No. 23, at 147 (emphasis 
omitted). The later-added Bill of Rights limited this power to some 
degree, cf. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plurality 
opinion); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300 (1983), but did 
not alter the allocation to Congress of the -primary responsibility for 
the delicate task of balancing the rights of servicemen against the 
needs of the military,- Solorio, supra, at 447-448. Under Clause 14, 
Congress, like Parliament, exercises a power of precedence over, not 
exclusion of, Executive authority.  Cf. United States v. Eliason, 16 
Pet. 291, 301 (1842) (The power of the executive to establish rules 
and regulations for the government of the army, is undoubted). This 
power is no less plenary than other Article I powers, Solorio, supra, 
at 441, and we discern no reasons why Congress should have less 
capacity to make measured and appropriate delegations of this power 
than of any other, see Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. 
S. 212, 220-221 (1989) (Congress may delegate authority under the 
taxing power); cf. Lichter v. United States, 334 U. S. 742, 778 
(1948) (general rule is that "[a] constitutional power implies a power 
of delegation of authority under it sufficient to effect its purposes-) 
(emphasis deleted).  Indeed, it would be contrary to precedent and 
tradition for us to impose a special limitation on this particular Article I 
power, for we give Con- gress the highest deference in ordering 
military affairs.  Rost- ker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981).  
And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as 
Commander in Chief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion 
and authority.  We decline to import into Clause 14 a restrictive 
nondelegation principle that the Framers left out. There is no absolute 
rule, furthermore, against Congress' delegation of authority to define 
criminal punishments.  We have upheld delegations whereby the 
Executive or an indepen- dent agency defines by regulation what 
conduct will be criminal, so long as Congress makes the violation of 
regula- tions a criminal offense and fixes the punishment, and the 
regulations "confin[e] themselves within the field covered by the 
statute."  United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, 518 (1911).  See 
also Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160 (1991).  The exercise of a 
delegated authority to define crimes may be sufficient in certain 
circumstances to supply the notice to defendants the Constitution 
requires.  See M. Kraus & Bros., Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 
614, 622 (1946).  In the circumstances presented here, so too may 
Congress delegate authority to the President to define the aggravating 
factors that permit imposition of a statutory penalty, with the 
regulations providing the narrowing of the death-eligible class that the 
Eighth Amendment requires. In 1950, Congress confronted the 
problem of what criminal jurisdiction would be appropriate for armed 
forces of colossal size, stationed on bases that in many instances were 
small societies unto themselves.  Congress, confident in the 
procedural protections of the UCMJ, gave to courts-martial 
jurisdiction of the crime of murder.  Cf. Solorio, supra, at 450-451 
(Congress may extend court-martial jurisdiction to any criminal 
offense committed by a service member during his period of service).  
It further declared the law that service members who commit 
premeditated and felony murder may be sentenced to death by a court-
martial.  There is nothing in the constitutional scheme or our traditions 
to prohibit Congress from delegating the prudent and proper 
implementation of the capital murder statute to the President acting as 
Commander in Chief. 

B
Having held that Congress has the power of delegation, we further 
hold that it exercised the power in Articles 18 and 56 of the UCMJ.  
Article 56 specifies that "[t]he punishment which a court-martial may 
direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President may 
prescribe for that offense."  10 U. S. C. 856.  Article 18 states that a 
court- martial "may, under such limitations as the President may 
prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the UCMJ], 
including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by" the 
Code.  818.  As the Court of Military Appeals pointed out in Curtis, 
for some decades the President has used his authority under these 
Articles to increase the penalties for certain noncapital offenses if 
aggravating circumstances are present.  For example, by regulation, 
deserters who are apprehended are punished more severely than those 
who surrender; drunk drivers suffer a harsher fate if they cause an 
accident resulting in the death of a victim; and the punishment of 
thieves is graded by the value of the stolen goods.  See Curtis, 32 M. 
J., at 261.  The President has thus provided more precision in 
sentencing than is provided by the statute, while remaining within 
statutory bounds.  This past practice suggests that Articles 18 and 56 
support as well an authority in the President to restrict the death 
sentence to murders in which certain aggravating circumstances have 
been established. There is yet a third provision of the UCMJ indicative 
of congressional intent to delegate this authority to the President. 
Article 36 of the UCMJ, which gives the President the power to make 
procedural rules for courts-martial, provides: -Pretrial, trial, and post-
trial procedures, including modes of proof, for [courts martial] . . . 
may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far 
as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of 
evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the 
United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or 
inconsistent with this chapter."  10 U. S. C. 836(a). Although the 
language of Article 36 seems further afield from capital aggravating 
factors than that of Article 18 or 56, it is the provision that a later 
Congress identified as the source of Presidential authority to prescribe 
these factors.  In 1985, Congress enacted Article 106(a) of the UCMJ, 
10 U. S. C. 906a, which authorized the death penalty for espionage.  
The Article requires a finding of an aggravating factor if the accused is 
to be sentenced to death; it enumerates three such factors, but allows 
death to be decreed on "[a]ny other factor that may be prescribed by 
the President by regulations under section 836 of this title (article 
36)."  906(a)(c)(4).  Article 106a itself, then, is premised on the 
President's having authority under Article 36 to prescribe capital 
aggravating factors, and "`[s]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent 
of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory 
construction.'" Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, 
Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980), quoting Red Lion 
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969).  Whether 
or not Article 36 would stand on its own as the source of the delegated 
power, we hold that Articles 18, 36, and 56 together give clear 
authority to the President for the promulga- tion of RCM 1004. 
Loving points out that the three Articles were enacted as part of the 
UCMJ in 1950, well before the need for eliminat- ing absolute 
discretion in capital sentencing was established in Furman v. Georgia, 
408 U. S. 238 (1972), and the cases that followed.  (Slight 
amendments to the Articles have been made since but are not relevant 
here.)  In 1950, he argues, Congress could not have understood that it 
was giving the President the authority to bring an otherwise invalid 
capital murder statute in line with Eighth Amendment strictures. 
Perhaps so, but Furman did not somehow undo the prior delegation.  
What would have been an act of leniency by the President prior to 
Furman may have become a constitutional necessity thereafter, see 
supra, at 5-6, but the fact remains the power to prescribe aggravating 
circumstances has resided with the President since 1950. 

C
It does not suffice to say that Congress announced its will to delegate 
certain authority.  Congress as a general rule must also "lay down by 
legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body 
authorized to [act] is directed to conform."  J. W. Hampton, Jr., & 
Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928); Touby, 500 U. S., 
at 165.  The intelligible-principle rule seeks to enforce the 
understanding that Congress may not delegate the power to make laws 
and so may delegate no more than the authority to make policies and 
rules that implement its statutes.  Field, 143 U. S., at 693-694.  
Though in 1935 we struck down two delegations for lack of an 
intelligible principle, A. L. A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United 
States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 
293 U. S. 388 (1935), we have since upheld, without exception, 
delegations under standards phrased in sweeping terms.  See, e.g., 
National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 216-217, 
225-226 (1943) (upholding delegation to the Federal Communications 
Commis- sion to regulate radio broadcasting according to "public 
interest, convenience, or necessity-).  Had the delegations here called 
for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the 
traditional authority of the President, Loving's last argument that 
Congress failed to provide guiding principles to the President might 
have more weight.  We find no fault, however, with the delegation in 
this case. In United States v. Curtis, the Court of Military Appeals 
discerned a principle limiting the President's discretion to define 
aggravating factors for capital crimes in Article 36: namely, the 
directive that regulations the President prescribes must "apply the 
principles of law . . . generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases 
in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to 
or inconsistent with this chapter," 10 U. S. C. 836(a).  We think, 
however, that the question to be asked is not whether there was any 
explicit principle telling the President how to select aggravating 
factors, but whether any such guidance was needed, given the nature 
of the delegation and the officer who is to exercise the delegated 
authority.  First, the delegation is set within boundaries the President 
may not exceed.  Second, the delega- tion here was to the President in 
his role as Commander in Chief.  Perhaps more explicit guidance as to 
how to select aggravating factors would be necessary if delegation 
were made to a newly created entity without independent authority in 
the area.  Cf. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 374-379 (upholding delegation 
to the United States Sentencing Commission because of detailed 
congressional directives channeling agency discre- tion).  The 
President's duties as Commander in Chief, however, require him to 
take responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, 
including the courts-martial.  The delegated duty, then, is interlinked 
with duties already assigned to the President by express terms of the 
Constitution, and the same limitations on delegation do not apply 
"where the entity exercising the delegated authority itself possesses 
independent authority over the subject matter," United States v. 
Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557 (1975).  See also United States v. 
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319-322 (1936).  Cf. 
Swaim v. United States, 165 U. S. 553, 557-558 (1897) (President 
has inherent authority to convene courts-martial).  Like the Court of 
Military Appeals, Curtis, 32 M. J., at 263, n. 9, we need not decide 
whether the Presi- dent would have inherent power as Commander in 
Chief to prescribe aggravating factors in capital cases.  Once delegated 
that power by Congress, the President, acting in his constitu- tional 
office of Commander in Chief, had undoubted compe- tency to 
prescribe those factors without further guidance. -The military 
constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline 
from that of the civilian," Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 
(1953), and the President can be entrusted to determine what 
limitations and conditions on punishments are best suited to preserve 
that special discipline. It is hard to deem lawless a delegation giving 
the President broad discretion to prescribe rules on this subject.  From 
the early days of the Republic, the President has had congressio- nal 
authorization to intervene in cases where courts-martial decreed death.  
American Articles of War of 1806, Art. 65, reprinted in Winthrop 
976, 982.  It would be contradictory to say that Congress cannot 
further empower him to limit by prospective regulation the 
circumstances in which courts- martial can impose a death sentence.  
Specific authority to make rules for the limitation of capital 
punishment contributes more towards principled and uniform military 
sentencing regimes than does case-by-case intervention, and it 
provides greater opportunity for congressional oversight and revision. 
Separation-of-powers principles are vindicated, not disserv- ed, by 
measured cooperation between the two political branches of the 
Government, each contributing to a lawful objective through its own 
processes.  The delegation to the President as Commander in Chief of 
the authority to prescribe aggravating factors was in all respects 
consistent with these precepts, and the promulgation of RCM 1004 
was well within the delegated authority.  Loving's sentence was 
lawful, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces 
is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.


SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 94-1966

DWIGHT J. LOVING, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed 
forces [June 3, 1996] 

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and 
Justice Breyer join, concurring. As Justice Scalia correctly points out, 
petitioner has not challenged the power of the tribunal to try him for a 
capital offense.  Post, at 1.  It is important to add to this observation 
that petitioner's first victim was a member of the Armed Forces on 
active duty and that the second was a retired serviceman who gave 
petitioner a ride from the barracks on the same night as the first 
killing.  Brief for United States 5. On these facts, this does not appear 
to be a case in which petitioner could appropriately have raised the 
question whether the holding in Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 
435 (1987), should be extended to reach the imposition of the death 
penalty for an offense that did not have the "service connec- tion" 
required prior to the change in the law effected in that case.  Id., at 
451 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). The question whether a 
"service connection" requirement should obtain in capital cases is an 
open one both because Solorio was not a capital case, and because 
Solorio's review of the historical materials would seem to undermine 
any contention that a military tribunal's power to try capital offenses 
must be as broad as its power to try non-capital ones. See id., at 442-
446.  Moreover, the question is a substantial one because, when the 
punishment may be death, there are particular reasons to ensure that 
the men and women of the Armed Forces do not by reason of serving 
their country receive less protection than the Constitution provides for 
civilians. As a consequence of my conclusion that the "service 
connection" requirement has been satisfied here, I join not only the 
Court's analysis of the delegation issue, but also its disposition of the 
case.  By joining in the Court's opinion, however, I do not thereby 
accept the proposition that our decision in Solorio must be understood 
to apply to capital offenses.  Nor do I understand the Court's decision 
to do so. That question, as I have explained, remains to be decided. 


SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 94-1966

DWIGHT J. LOVING, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed 
forces [June 3, 1996] 

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in part 
and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court's opinion, except that 
with respect to Part IV thereof I join only subparts B and C. The 
discussion of English history that features so prominent- ly in the 
Court's discussion of Congress's power to grant the authority at issue 
to the President is in my view irrelevant. To be sure, there is ample 
precedent in our cases for looking to the history of English courts-
martial-but not where the question is of the sort before us today.  We 
have surveyed that history for the purpose of establishing the 
permissible scope of the jurisdiction of military tribunals over certain 
classes of defendants and offenses, see, e.g., Solorio v. United 
States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 
228, 232 (1959); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-27 (1957) 
(plurality); see also Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 745 (1974).  This 
case does not present such a question. Petitioner does not assert that 
tradition establishes his offense to be, in its nature, beyond the 
jurisdiction of military courts, or that courts-martial are historically 
incapable of adjudicating capital offenses.  His arguments are 
altogether different: that Congress cannot authorize the President to 
establish "aggravat- ing factors" designed to carry out the narrowing 
function that (we assume) is necessary for imposition of a capital 
sentence; and that, even if Congress can give the President authority to 
perform this function, such authorization has not been effected by the 
statutes upon which the Government relies. I do not see how 
consideration of those arguments profits from analysis of the historical 
sharing of power between Parliament and the English throne.  William 
and Mary's acceptance of the Bill of Rights, and Parliament's 
enactment of the Mutiny Act of 1689, see ante, at 13-16, are presum- 
ably significant occurrences for students of the unwritten English 
constitution.  Our written Constitution does not require us to trace out 
that history; it provides, in straightfor- ward fashion, that "The 
Congress shall have Power . . . To make Rules for the Government 
and Regulation of the land and naval forces," U. S. Const., Art. I, 
8, cl. 14, and as the Court notes, see ante, at 18, it does not set forth 
any special limitation on Congress's assigning to the President the 
task of implementing the laws enacted pursuant to that power. And it 
would be extraordinary simply to infer such a special limitation upon 
tasks given to the President as Commander in Chief, where his 
inherent powers are clearly extensive. In drafting the Constitution, the 
Framers were not seeking to replicate in America the government of 
England; indeed, they set their plan of government out in writing in 
part to make clear the ways in which it was different from the one it 
replaced.  The Court acknowledges this, see ante, at 17, but 
nonetheless goes on to treat the form of English government as 
relevant to determining the limitations upon Clause 14's grant of 
power to Congress.  I would leave this historical discussion aside.  
While it is true, as the Court demonstrates, that the scheme of 
assigned responsibility here conforms to English practices, that is so 
not because Clause 14 requires such conformity, but simply because 
what seemed like a good arrangement to Parliament has seemed like a 
good arrangement to Congress as well. I have one point of definition 
or conceptualization, which applies to those portions of the opinion 
that I have joined. While it has become the practice in our opinions to 
refer to -unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority" versus 
-lawful delegations of legislative authority," in fact the latter category 
does not exist.  Legislative power is nondelegable. Congress can no 
more "delegate" some of its Article I power to the Executive than it 
could "delegate" some to one of its committees.  What Congress does 
is to assign responsibilities to the Executive; and when the Executive 
undertakes those assigned responsibilities it acts, not as the "delegate" 
of Congress, but as the agent of the People.  At some point the 
responsibilities assigned can become so extensive and so 
unconstrained that Congress has in effect delegated its legislative 
power; but until that point of excess is reached there exists, not a 
"lawful" delegation, but no delegation at all. 


SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 94-1966

DWIGHT J. LOVING, PETITIONER
v. UNITED STATES
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed 
forces [June 3, 1996] 

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment. It is not clear to me that 
the extensive rules we have developed under the Eighth Amendment 
for the prosecution of civilian capital cases, including the requirement 
of proof of aggravating factors, necessarily apply to capital 
prosecutions in the military, cf. Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 
300-302 (1983), and this Court has never so held, see Schick v. 
Reed, 419 U. S. 256, 260 (1974).  I am therefore not certain that this 
case even raises a delegation question, for if Loving can 
constitutionally be sentenced to death without proof of aggravating 
factors, he surely cannot claim that the President violated the 
Constitution by promulgating aggravating factors that afforded more 
protection than that to which Loving is constitutionally entitled. Like 
the majority, I conclude that the Government prevails even if we 
assume, without deciding, that aggravating factors are required in this 
context.  There is abundant authority for according Congress and the 
President sufficient deference in the regulation of military affairs to 
uphold the delegation here, and I see no need to resort to our 
nonmilitary separation-of- powers and "delegation doctrine" cases in 
reaching this conclusion.  I write separately to explain that by 
concurring in the judgment in this case, I take no position with respect 
to Congress' power to delegate authority or otherwise alter the 
traditional separation of powers outside the military context. 

In light of Congress' express constitutional authority to regulate the 
Armed Forces, see U. S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 14, and the unique 
nature of the military's mission, we have afforded an unparalleled 
degree of deference to congressional action governing the military.  
See Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981).  "[I]t is the 
primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight 
wars should the occasion arise," United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 
350 U. S. 11, 17 (1955), and this Court has recognized the limits on 
its own competence in advancing this core national interest, see 
Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973).  Mindful of the factors 
that "differentiate military society from civilian society," we have 
concluded that the Constitution permits Congress "to legislate both 
with greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the 
rules by which the former shall be governed than it is when 
prescribing rules for the latter."  Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 
(1974). This heightened deference extends not only to congressional 
action but also to executive action by the President, who by virtue of 
his constitutional role as Commander in Chief, see U. S. Const, Art. 
II, 2, cl. 1, possesses shared authority over military discipline.  See 
Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 510 (1975) (-The 
responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces shall attend 
to th[e] business [of fighting or preparing to fight wars] rests with 
Congress and with the President-) (citations omitted).  See also 
Brown v. Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 360 (1980) (-Both Congress and 
this Court have found that the special character of the military requires 
civilian authorities to accord military commanders some flexibility in 
dealing with matters that affect internal discipline and morale.  In 
construing a statute that touches on such matters, therefore, courts 
must be careful not to `circum- scribe the authority of military 
commanders to an extent never intended by Congress'-) (citations 
omitted).  Under these and many similar cases reviewing legislative 
and executive control of the military, the sentencing scheme at issue in 
this case, and the manner in which it was created, are constitutionally 
unassailable.  On a separate point, I agree with Justice Scalia that the 
majority's extended analysis of the division of authority between the 
English Parliament and the Crown with regard to regulation of the 
military, see ante, at 10-17, has no rele- vance to this case.  It is true 
that we frequently consult English history and common law in 
attempting to determine the content of constitutional provisions, but 
the majority fails to cite a single separation-of-powers case in which 
we have relied on the structure of the English Government in attempt- 
ing to understand the governmental structure erected by the Framers of 
the Constitution.  Nor does the majority cite any historical evidence, 
whether from the constitutional debates, the Federalist Papers, or 
some other source, that demonstrates that the Framers sought to 
embrace, or at least actively considered, the English system of shared 
power over the military.  If the majority pointed to some basis for 
conducting the inquiry that it does, I might be willing to accept its 
analysis.  Instead, the majority repeatedly substitutes ipse dixit for 
historical evidence.  See, e.g., ante, at 11 (-From the English 
experience the Framers . . . knew the . . . parliamen- tary practice of 
delegation" and "[t]he Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give 
Congress the same flexibility to exercise or share power-); ante, at 16 
(-the Framers well knew this history-); ante, at 17 (-The historical 
necessities and events of the English constitutional experience . . . 
were familiar to [the Framers] and inform our understanding of the 
purpose and meaning of constitutional provisions-).  I have no doubt 
that the Framers were well versed in English history. But it is too 
simplistic for purposes of constitutional analysis to draw conclusions 
about the allocation of constitutional authority among the branches of 
the United States Government from mere speculation about the 
Framers' familiarity with English military history and the significance 
that they attached to it.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

Syllabus

SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

certiorari to the supreme court of california

No. 95-860. Argued April 24, 1996-Decided June 3, 1996

Petitioner, a resident of California, held credit cards
issued by respondent, a national bank located in South
Dakota. She filed suit in state court, alleging that late-
payment fees charged by respondent, although legal under
South Dakota law, violated California law. Respondent
moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that
petitioner's state law claims were pre-empted by a
provision of the National Bank Act of 1864 that permits a
national bank to charge its loan customers "interest at the
rate allowed by the laws of the State . . . where the bank
is located," 12 U. S. C. 85, see Marquette Nat. Bank of
Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp., 439 U. S.
299. The California Superior Court, accepting
respondent's argument that credit card late-payment fees
constitute "interest" for purposes of 85, granted
respondent's motion. The State Court of Appeal and State
Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: The Comptroller of the Currency has reasonably
interpreted the term "interest" in 85 to include late-
payment fees, see 12 CFR 7.4001(a), and petitioner has
failed to establish that the Court should not accord its
customary deference to the Comptroller's interpretation
of an ambiguous provision of the National Bank Act. Pp.
3-11.

(a) Where a provision of the National Bank Act is
ambiguous, the Court, pursuant to Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.
837, 842-845, defers to reasonable judgments of the
Comptroller, the official charged with administering the
Act. NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity
Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioner's argument
that deference is not owing to the recently adopted 12
CFR 7.4001(a) is unpersuasive. The validity of the
Comptroller's interpretation is not affected by the fact
that the regulation was issued more than 100 years after
85 was enacted or that it was litigation, including this
very suit, which disclosed the need for the regulation.
And the distinction that the regulation makes between
those charges designated as interest and those not so
classified is not arbitrary or capricious. See Chevron,
supra, at 844. Petitioner errs in contending that an agency
interpretation that contradicts a prior agency position is
necessarily invalid; in any event, she fails to show that a
change of official agency position has occurred here.
Finally, the issue here, the meaning of 85, does not bring
into play the pre-emption considerations that petitioner
raises. Pp. 3-8.

(b) The Comptroller's interpretation of the statutory term
``interest'' is reasonable. There is no indication that, at the
time of the passage of the National Bank Act, common
usage of the word ``interest'' or the phrase ``at the rate
allowed'' required that interest charges be expressed as
functions of time and amount owing. Nor is there support
for petitioner's contention that the late fees are
``penalties'' rather than ``interest.'' See Citizens' National
Bank v. Donnell, 195 U. S. 369. Pp. 9-11. 11 Cal. 4th
138, 900 P. 2d 690, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.


NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision
before publication in the preliminary print of the United
States Reports. Readers are requested to notify the
Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United
States, Washington, D.C. 20543, of any typographical or
other formal errors, in order that corrections may be
made before the preliminary print goes to press.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 95-860

BARBARA SMILEY, PETITIONER v. CITIBANK
(SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A. on writ of certiorari to the
supreme court of california [June 3, 1996]

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court. Section
30 of the National Bank Act of 1864, Rev. Stat. 5197, as
amended, 12 U. S. C. 85, provides that a national bank
may charge its loan customers "interest at the rate allowed
by the laws of the State . . . where the bank is located."
In Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha
Service Corp., 439 U. S. 299 (1978), we held that this
provision authorizes a national bank to charge out-of-state
credit-card customers an interest rate allowed by the
bank's home State, even when that rate is higher than
what is permitted by the States in which the cardholders
reside. The question in this case is whether 85 also
authorizes a national bank to charge late-payment fees that
are lawful in the bank's home State but prohibited in the
States where the cardholders reside-in other words,
whether the statutory term "interest" encompasses late-
payment fees.

I
Petitioner, a resident of California, held two credit cards-
a "Classic Card" and a "Preferred Card"-issued by
respondent, a national bank located in Sioux Falls, South
Dakota. The Classic Card agreement provided that
respondent would charge petitioner a late fee of $15 for
each monthly period in which she failed to make her
minimum monthly payment within 25 days of the due
date. Under the Preferred Card agreement, respondent
would impose a late fee of $6 if the minimum monthly
payment was not received within 15 days of its due date;
and an additional charge of $15 or 0.65% of the
outstanding balance on the Preferred Card, whichever
was greater, if the minimum payment was not received by
the next minimum monthly payment due date. Petitioner
was charged late fees on both cards. These late fees are
permitted by South Dakota law, see S. D. Codified Laws
54-3-1, 54-3-1.1 (1990 and Supp. 1995). Petitioner,
however, is of the view that exacting such
"unconscionable" late charges from California residents
violates California law, and in 1992 brought a class action
against respondent on behalf of herself and other
California holders of respondent's credit cards, asserting
various statutory and common-law claims. Respondent
moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that
petitioner's claims were pre- empted by 85. The
Superior Court of Los Angeles County initially denied
respondent's motion, but the California Court of Appeal,
Second Appellate District, issued a writ of mandate
directing the Superior Court to either grant the motion or
show cause why it should not be required to do so. The
Superior Court chose the former course, and the Court of
Appeal affirmed its dismissal of the complaint, 26 Cal.
App. 4th 1767, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562 (1994). The
Supreme Court of California granted review and
affirmed, two Justices dissenting. 11 Cal. 4th 138, 900 P.
2d 690 (1995). We granted certiorari. 516 U. S. ___
(1996).

II
In light of the two dissents from the opinion of the
Supreme Court of California, see 11 Cal. 4th, at 165, 177,
900 P. 2d, at 708, 716 (Arabian, J., dissenting, and
George, J., dissent- ing), and in light of the opinion of the
Supreme Court of New Jersey creating the conflict that
has prompted us to take this case, it would be difficult
indeed to contend that the word "interest" in the National
Bank Act is unambiguous with regard to the point at issue
here. It is our practice to defer to the reasonable
judgments of agencies with regard to the meaning of
ambiguous terms in statutes that they are charged with
administering. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845
(1984). As we observed only last Term, that practice
extends to the judgments of the Comptroller of the
Currency with regard to the meaning of the banking laws.
"The Comptroller of the Currency," we said, "is charged
with the enforcement of banking laws to an extent that
warrants the invocation of [the rule of deference] with
respect to his deliberative conclusions as to the meaning
of these laws."  NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable
Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip
op., at 4) (citations and internal quota- tion marks
omitted). On March 3, 1995, which was after the
California Superior Court's dismissal of petitioner's
complaint, the Comptroller of the Currency noticed for
public comment a proposed regula- tion dealing with the
subject before us, see 60 Fed. Reg. 11924, 11940, and on
February 9, 1996, which was after the California
Supreme Court's decision, he adopted the following
provision: "The term `interest' as used in 12 U. S. C. 85
in- cludes any payment compensating a creditor or
prospec- tive creditor for an extension of credit, making
available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a
borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended.
It includes, among other things, the following fees
connected with credit extension or availability: numerical
periodic rates, late fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees,
overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and
membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal
fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance
guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit,
finders' fees, fees for document preparation or
notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports."
61 Fed. Reg. 4869 (to be codified in 12 CFR 7.4001(a)).
Petitioner proposes several reasons why the ordinary rule
of deference should not apply to this regulation. First,
petitioner points to the fact that this regulation was issued
more than 100 years after the enactment of 85, and
seemingly as a result of this and similar litigation in
which the Comptroller has participated as amicus curiae
on the side of the banks. The 100-year delay makes no
difference. To be sure, agency interpretations that are of
long standing come before us with a certain credential of
reasonableness, since it is rare that error would long
persist. But neither antiquity nor contem- poraneity with
the statute is a condition of validity. We accord deference
to agencies under Chevron, not because of a presumption
that they drafted the provisions in question, or were
present at the hearings, or spoke to the principal spon-
sors; but rather because of a presumption that Congress,
when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for
implementation by an agency, understood that the
ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the
agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to
possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity
allows. See Chevron, supra, at 843-844. Nor does it
matter that the regulation was prompted by litigation,
including this very suit. Of course we deny deference "to
agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by
regulations, rulings, or administrative practice," Bowen
v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988).
The deliberateness of such positions, if not indeed their
authorita- tiveness, is suspect. But we have before us here
a full-dress regulation, issued by the Comptroller himself
and adopted pursuant to the notice-and-comment
procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act designed
to assure due deliberation, see 5 U. S. C. 553; Thompson
v. Clark, 741 F. 2d 401, 409 (CADC 1984). That it was
litigation which disclosed the need for the regulation is
irrelevant. Second, petitioner contends that the
Comptroller's regulation is not deserving of our
deference because "there is no rational basis for
distinguishing the various charges [it] has denominat- ed
interest . . . from those charges it has denominated `non-
interest.'"  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14. We disagree.
As an analytical matter, it seems to us perfectly possible
to draw a line, as the regulation does, between (1)
"payment compen- sating a creditor or prospective
creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a
line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of
a condition upon which credit was extended," and (2) all
other payments. To be sure, in the broadest sense all
payments connected in any way with the loan-including
reimbursement of the lender's costs in processing the
application, insuring the loan, and appraising the
collateral-can be regarded as "compensating [the] creditor
for [the] extension of credit."  But it seems to us quite
possible and rational to distinguish, as the regulation does,
between those charges that are specifically assigned to
such expenses and those that are assessed for simply
making the loan, or for the borrower's default. In its
logic, at least, the line is not "arbitrary [or] capricious,"
and thereby disentitled to deference under Chevron, see
467 U. S., at 844. Whether it is "arbitrary [or]
capricious" as an interpretation of what the statute means-
or perhaps even (what Chevron also excludes from
deference) "manifestly contrary to the statute,"we will
discuss in the next Part of this opinion. Finally, petitioner
argues that the regulation is not entitled to deference
because it is inconsistent with positions taken by the
Comptroller in the past. Of course the mere fact that an
agency interpretation contradicts a prior agency position
is not fatal. Sudden and unexplained change, see, e.g.,
Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State
Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 46-57
(1983), or change that does not take account of legitimate
reliance on prior interpretation, see, e.g., United States v.
Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., 411 U. S. 655,
670-675 (1973); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S.
267, 295 (1974), may be "arbitrary, capricious [or] an
abuse of discretion," 5 U. S. C. 706(2)(A). But if these
pitfalls are avoided, change is not invalidating, since the
whole point of Chevron is to leave the discretion provided
by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing
agency. In any case, we do not think that anything which
can ac- curately be described as a change of official
agency position has occurred here. The agency's Notice
of Proposed Rulema- king asserted that the new
regulation "reflect[s] current law and [Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)] interpretive letters,"
60 Fed. Reg. 11929 (1995), and the Statement of Basis
and Purpose accompanying the final adoption stated that
"[t]he final ruling is consistent with OCC interpretive
letters in this area . . . and reflects the position the OCC
has taken in amicus curiae briefs in litigation pending in
many state and Federal courts," 61 Fed. Reg. 4859 (1996)
(citing OCC interpretive letters). Petitioner points only
to (1) a June 1964 letter from the Comptroller to the
Presi- dent's Committee on Consumer Interests, which
states that "[c]harges for late payments, credit life
insurance, recording fees, documentary stamp are
illustrations of charges which are made by some banks
which would not properly be character- ized as interest,"
see App. to Brief for Petitioner 5a; and (2) a 1988
opinion letter from the Deputy Chief Counsel of the OCC
stating "it is my position that [under 85] the laws of the
states where the banks are located . . . determine whether
or not the banks can impose the foregoing fees and
charges [including late fees] on Iowa residents," OCC
Interpretive Letter No. 452, reprinted in 1988-1989
Transfer Binder, CCH Fed. Banking L. Rep. 85,676 p.
78,064 (1988). We doubt whether either of these
statements was sufficient in and of itself to establish a
binding agency policy-the former, because it was too
informal, and the latter because it only purported to
represent the position of the Deputy Chief Counsel in
response to an inquiry concerning particular banks. Nor
can it even be argued that the two statements reflect a
prior agency policy, since, in addition to contradicting the
regula- tion before us here, they also contradict one
another-the former asserting that "interest" is a nationally
uniform concept, and the latter that it is to be determined
by reference to state law. What these statements show, if
anything, is that there was good reason for the
Comptroller to promulgate the new regulation, in order
to eliminate uncertainty and confu- sion. In addition to
offering these reasons why 12 CFR 7.4001- (a) in
particular is not entitled to deference, petitioner contends
that no Comptroller interpretation of 85 is entitled to
deference, because 85 is a provision that pre-empts state
law. She argues that the "presumption against . . . pre-
emption" announced in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,
505 U. S. 504, 518 (1992), in effect trumps Chevron, and
requires a court to make its own interpretation of 85 that
will avoid (to the extent possible) pre-emption of state
law. This argument confuses the question of the
substantive (as opposed to pre-emptive) meaning of a
statute with the question of whether a statute is pre-
emptive. We may assume (without deciding) that the
latter question must always be decided de novo by the
courts. That is not the question at issue here; there is no
doubt that 85 preempts state law. In Marquette Nat.
Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp.,
439 U. S. 299 (1978), we dismissed petitioners' argument
that the "exportation" of interest rates from the bank's
home State would "significantly impair the ability of
States to enact effective usury laws" with the observation
that "[t]his impairment . . . has always been implicit in the
structure of the National Bank Act . . . . [T]he protection
of state usury laws is an issue of legislative policy, and
any plea to alter 85 to further that end is better
addressed to the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment
of this Court."  Id., at 318-319. What is at issue here is
simply the meaning of a provision that does not (like the
provision in Cipollone) deal with pre-emption, and hence
does not bring into play the considerations petitioner
raises.

III
Since we have concluded that the Comptroller's regulation
deserves deference, the question before us is not whether
it represents the best interpretation of the statute, but
whether it represents a reasonable one. The answer is
obviously yes. Petitioner argues that the late fees charged
by respondent do not constitute "interest" because they
"do not vary based on the payment owed or the time
period of delay."  Brief for Petitioner 32-33. We do not
think that such a limitation must be read into the statutory
term. Most legal dictionaries of the era of the National
Bank Act did not place such a limitation upon "interest."
See, e.g., 1 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 652 (6th ed.
1856) ("The compensation which is paid by the borrower
to the lender or by the debtor to the creditor for Glossary
90 (2d ed. 1860); 11 American and English Encyclo-
pedia of Law 379 (J. Merrill ed. 1890). But see J.
Wharton, Law Lexicon or Dictionary of Jurisprudence
391 (2d. Amer. ed. 1860). The definition of "interest"
that we ourselves set out in Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall.
177, 185 (1873), decided shortly after the enactment of
the National Bank Act, likewise contained no indication
that it was limited to charges ex- pressed as a function of
time or of amount owing: "Interest is the compensation
allowed by law, or fixed by the parties, for the use or
forbearance of money or as damages for its detention."
See also Hollowell v. Southern Building & Loan Assn.,
120 N. C. 286, 26 S. E. 781 (1897) ("[A]ny charges made
against [the borrower] in excess of the lawful rate of
interest, whether called `fines,' `charges,' `dues,' or
`interest,' are in fact interest, and usurious"). Petitioner
suggests another source for the asserted require- ment
that the charges be time- and rate-based: What is
authorized by 85, she notes, is the charging of interest
"at the rate allowed" by the laws of the bank's home State.
This requires, in her view, that the interest charges be
expressed as functions of time and amount owing. It
would be surpris- ing to find such a requirement in the
Act, if only because it would be so pointless. Any flat
charge may, of course, readily be converted to a
percentage charge-which was indeed the basis for 19th-
century decisions holding that flat charges violated state
usury laws establishing maximum "rates."  See, e.g.,
Craig v. Pleiss, 26 Pa. 271, 272-273 (1856); Hollowell,
supra, at 286, 26 S. E., at 781. And there is no apparent
reason why home-state-approved percentage charges
should be permissible but home-state-approved flat
charges unlawful. In any event, common usage at the
time of the National Bank Act prevents the conclusion that
the Comptroller's refusal to give the word "rate" the
narrow meaning petitioner demands is unreasonable. The
1849 edition of Webster's gives as one of the definitions
of "rate" the "[p]rice or amount stated or fixed on any
thing."  N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English
Language 910. To illustrate this sense of the word, it
provides the following examples: "A king may purchase
territory at too dear a rate. The rate of interest is
prescribed by law."  Ibid. Cf. 2 Bouvier, supra, at 421
(defining "rate of exchange" as "the price at which a bill
drawn in one country upon another, may be sold in the
former"). Finally, petitioner contends that the late fees
cannot be "interest" because they are "penalties."  To
support that dichotomy, she points to our opinion in
Meilink v. Unemploy- ment Reserves Comm'n of Cal.,
314 U. S. 564, 570 (1942). But Meilink involved a
provision of the Bankruptcy Act that disallowed debts
owing to governmental entities "as a penalty," except for
"the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act . . .
out of which the penalty . . . arose, with . . . such interest
as may have accrued thereon according to law."  Id., at
566. Obviously, this provision uses "inter- est" to mean
only that interest which is exacted as commercial
compensation, and not that interest which is exacted as a
penalty. A word often takes on a more narrow
connotation when it is expressly opposed to another word:
"car," for ex- ample, has a broader meaning by itself than
it does in a passage speaking of "cars and taxis."  In 85,
the term "interest" is not used in contradistinction to
"penalty," and there is no reason why it cannot include
interest charges imposed for that purpose. More relevant
than Meilink is our opinion in Citizens' Nat. Bank of
Kansas City v. Donnell, 195 U. S. 369 (1904), which did
involve 85 (or, more precisely, its predecessor, Rev.
Stat. 5197). There, a bank argued that a 12% charge on
overdrafts did not violate a state law setting an 8% ceiling
on interest rates because, inter alia, the overdraft charge
"was a penalty because of a failure to pay a debt when
due."  Id., at 373-374. We dismissed the argu- ment out
of hand: "The suggestions as to the twelve per cent charge
on overdrafts do not seem to us to need answer."  Id., at
374.

Petitioner devotes much of her brief to the question
whether the meaning of "interest" in 85 can
constitutionally be left to be defined by the law of the
bank's home State-a question that is not implicated by the
Comptroller's regulation. Because the regulation is
entitled to deference, and because the Comptroller's
interpretation of 85 is not an unreasonable one, the
decision of the Supreme Court of California must be
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

<P>The Supreme Court 's May 28, 1996, ruling that federal appellate judges should conduct a new review on whether police had sufficient grounds to conduct a search without a warrant. The high court by an 8-1 vote in a drug search case set out the standard to be used in determining if there had been reasonable suspicion by the police to stop and make a search without a warrant. The case involved two men who pleaded guilty to drug possession charges in federal court in Wisconsin. Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma was sentenced to 60 months in prison and Saul Ornelas received a 63-month prison term.</P>

v.

UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-5257.  Argued March 26, 1996-Decided May 28, 1996


In denying petitioners' motion to suppress cocaine found in their car,
the District Court ruled that the police had reasonable suspicion to
stop and question petitioners, and probable cause to remove one of
the interior panels where a package containing the cocaine was
found. The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed both
determinations, reviewing each "deferentially," and "for clear error,"
and finding no clear error in either instance.

Held:  The ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion to stop and
probable cause to make a warrantless search should be reviewed de
novo. The principal components of either inquiry are (1) a
determination of the historical facts leading up to the stop or search,
and (2) a decision on the mixed question of law and fact whether the
historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively
reasonable police officer, amount to reasonable suspicion or to
probable cause. Independent appellate review of the latter
determination is consistent with the position taken by this Court, see,
e.g., Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 160; will prevent
unacceptably varied results based on the interpretation of similar facts
by different trial judges, see id., at 171; is necessary if appellate
courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify, the pertinent legal
rules, see Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114; and will tend to
unify precedent and to provide police with a defined set of rules
which, in most instances, will make it possible to reach a correct
determination beforehand as to whether an invasion of privacy is
justified in the interest of law enforcement, see, e.g., New York v.
Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458. However, a reviewing court should
take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error
and to give due weight to inferences drawn therefrom by resident
judges, who view such facts in light of the community's distinctive
features and events, and by local police, who view the facts through
the lens of their experience and expertise. Pp. 5-10.

16 F. 3d 714 and 52 F. 3d 328, vacated and remanded.

REHNQUIST, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which
STEVENS, O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, SOUTER, THOMAS,

SAUL ORNELAS AND ISMAEL ORNELAS-LEDESMA,
PETITIONERS

v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[May 28, 1996]


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.


Petitioners each pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute. They reserved their right to appeal the District Court's
denial of their motion to suppress the cocaine found in their car. The
District Court had found reasonable suspicion to stop and question
petitioners as they entered their car, and probable cause to remove
one of the interior panels where a package containing two kilos of
cocaine was found. The Court of Appeals opined that the findings of
reasonable suspicion to stop, and probable cause to search, should be
reviewed "deferentially," and "for clear error."  We hold that the
ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to
make a warrantless search should be reviewed de novo.

The facts are not disputed. In the early morning of a December day
in 1992, Detective Michael Pautz, a 20-year veteran of the Milwaukee
County Sheriff's Department with 2 years specializing in drug
enforcement, was conducting drug-interdiction surveillance in
downtown Milwaukee. Pautz noticed a 1981 two-door Oldsmobile
with California license plates in a motel parking lot. The car attracted
Pautz's attention for two reasons: because older model, two-door
General Motors cars are a favorite with drug couriers because it is
easy to hide things in them; and because California is a "source State"
for drugs. Detective Pautz radioed his dispatcher to inquire about the
car's registration. The dispatcher informed Pautz that the owner was
either Miguel Ledesma Ornelas or Miguel Ornelas Ledesma from San
Jose, California; Pautz was unsure which name the dispatcher gave.
Detective Pautz checked the motel registry and learned that an Ismael
Ornelas accompanied by a second man had registered at 4:00 a.m.,
without reservations.

Pautz called for his partner, Donald Hurrle, a detective with
approximately 25 years of law enforcement experience, assigned for
the past 6 years to the drug enforcement unit. When Hurrle arrived at
the scene, the officers contacted the local office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) and asked DEA personnel to run
the names Miguel Ledesma Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas through the
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS), a
federal database of known and suspected drug traffickers. Both
names appeared in NADDIS. The NADDIS report identified Miguel
Ledesma Ornelas as a heroin dealer from El Centro, California, and
Ismael Ornelas, Jr. as a cocaine dealer from Tucson, Arizona. The
officers then summoned Deputy Luedke and the department's drug-
sniffing dog, Merlin. Upon their arrival, Detective Pautz left for
another assignment. Detective Hurrle informed Luedke of what they
knew and together they waited.

Sometime later, petitioners emerged from the motel and got into the
Oldsmobile. Detective Hurrle approached the car, identified himself
as a police officer, and inquired whether they had any illegal drugs or
contraband. Petitioners answered "No."  Hurrle then asked for
identification and was given two California driver's licenses bearing
the names Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas. Hurrle asked them if he
could search the car and petitioners consented. The men appeared
calm, but Ismael was shaking somewhat. Deputy Luedke, who over
the past nine years had searched approximately 2,000 cars for
narcotics, searched the Oldsmobile's interior. He noticed that a panel
above the right rear passenger armrest felt somewhat loose and
suspected that the panel might have been removed and contraband
hidden inside. Luedke would testify later that a screw in the door
jam adjacent to the loose panel was rusty, which to him meant that
the screw had been removed at some time. Luedke dismantled the
panel and discovered two kilograms of cocaine. Petitioners were
arrested.

Petitioners filed pretrial motions to suppress, alleging that the police
officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when the officers
detained them in the parking lot and when Deputy Luedke searched
inside the panel without a warrant.1   The Government conceded in
the court below that when the officers approached petitioners in the
parking lot, a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave, so
the encounter was an investigatory stop. See 16 F. 3d 714, 716
(CA7 1994). An investigatory stop is permissible under the Fourth
Amendment if supported by reasonable suspicion, Terry v. Ohio,
392 U. S. 1 (1968), and a warrantless search of a car is valid if
based on probable cause, California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565,
569-570 (1991).

After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the Magistrate Judge
concluded that the circumstances gave the officers reasonable
suspicion, but not probable cause. The Magistrate found, as a
finding of fact, that there was no rust on the screw and hence
concluded that Deputy Luedke had an insufficient basis to conclude
that drugs would be found within the panel. The Magistrate
nonetheless recommended that the District Court deny the
suppression motions because he thought, given the presence of the
drug-sniffing dog, that the officers would have found the cocaine by
lawful means eventually and therefore the drugs were admissible
under the inevitable discovery doctrine. See Nix v. Williams, 467 U.
S. 431 (1984).

The District Court adopted the Magistrate's recommendation with
respect to reasonable suspicion, but not its reasoning as to probable
cause. The District Court thought that the model, age, and source-
State origin of the car, and the fact that two men traveling together
checked into a motel at 4 o'clock in the morning without
reservations, formed a drug-courier profile and that this profile
together with the NADDIS reports gave rise to reasonable suspicion
of drug-trafficking activity; in the court's view, reasonable suspicion
became probable cause when Deputy Luedke found the loose panel.
Accordingly, the court ruled that the cocaine need not be excluded.2

The Court of Appeals reviewed deferentially the District Court's
determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause; it would
reverse only upon a finding of "clear error."3   16 F. 3d, at 719. The
court found no clear error in the reasonable-suspicion analysis and
affirmed that determination. Ibid. With respect to the probable-cause
finding, however, the court remanded the case for a determination on
whether Luedke was credible when testifying about the loose panel.
Id., at 721-722.

On remand, the Magistrate Judge expressly found the testimony
credible. The District Court accepted the finding, and once again
ruled that probable cause supported the search. The Seventh Circuit
held that determination not clearly erroneous. Judgt. order reported
at 52 F. 3d 328 (1995).

We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits over
the applicable standard of appellate review. 516 U. S. ___ (1996).4

Articulating precisely what "reasonable suspicion" and "probable
cause" mean is not possible. They are commonsense, nontechnical
conceptions that deal with "`the factual and practical considerations of
everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal
technicians, act.'"  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231 (1983)
(quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949)); see
United States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1989). As such, the
standards are "not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of
legal rules."  Gates, supra, at 232. We have described reasonable
suspicion simply as "a particularized and objective basis" for
suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity, United States v.
Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417-418 (1981), and probable cause to
search as existing where the known facts and circumstances are
sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that
contraband or evidence of a crime will be found, see Brinegar, supra,
at 175-176; Gates, supra, at 238. We have cautioned that these two
legal principles are not "finely-tuned standards," comparable to the
standards of proof beyond a reasonable doubt or of proof by a
preponderance of the evidence. Gates, supra, at 235. They are
instead fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the
particular contexts in which the standards are being assessed. Gates,
supra, at 232; Brinegar, supra, at 175 ("The standard of proof [for
probable cause] is . . . correlative to what must be proved"); Ker v.
California, 374 U. S. 23, 33 (1963) ("This Cour[t] [has a] long-
established recognition that standards of reasonableness under the
Fourth Amendment are not susceptible of Procrustean application";
"[e]ach case is to be decided on its own facts and circumstances"
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 29 (the
limitations imposed by the Fourth Amendment "will have to be
developed in the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases").

The principal components of a determination of reasonable suspicion
or probable cause will be the events which occurred leading up to the
stop or search, and then the decision whether these historical facts,
viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police
officer, amount to reasonable suspicion or to probable cause. The
first part of the analysis involves only a determination of historical
facts, but the second is a mixed question of law and fact: "[T]he
historical facts are admitted or established, the rule of law is
undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the [relevant]
statutory [or constitutional] standard, or to put it another way,
whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not
violated."  Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19
(1982).

We think independent appellate review of these ultimate
determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause is
consistent with the position we have taken in past cases. We have
never, when reviewing a probable-cause or reasonable-suspicion
determination ourselves, expressly deferred to the trial court's
determination. See, e.g., Brinegar, supra (rejecting district court's
conclusion that the police lacked probable cause); Alabama v. White,
496 U. S. 325 (1990) (conducting independent review and finding
reasonable suspicion). A policy of sweeping deference would
permit, "[i]n the absence of any significant difference in the facts,"
"the Fourth Amendment's incidence [to] tur[n] on whether different
trial judges draw general conclusions that the facts are sufficient or
insufficient to constitute probable cause."  Brinegar, supra, at 171.
Such varied results would be inconsistent with the idea of a unitary
system of law. This, if a matter-of-course, would be unacceptable.

In addition, the legal rules for probable cause and reasonable
suspicion acquire content only through application. Independent
review is therefore necessary if appellate courts are to maintain
control of, and to clarify the legal principles. See Miller v. Fenton,
474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) (where the "relevant legal principle can
be given meaning only through its application to the particular
circumstances of a case, the Court has been reluctant to give the trier
of fact's conclusions presumptive force and, in so doing, strip a
federal appellate court of its primary function as an expositor of
law").

Finally, de novo review tends to unify precedent and will come
closer to providing law enforcement officers with a defined " `set of
rules which, in most instances, makes it possible to reach a correct
determination beforehand as to whether an invasion of privacy is
justified in the interest of law enforcement.' " New York v. Belton,
453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981); see also Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.
S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 16) ("[T]he law declaration aspect of
independent review potentially may guide police, unify precedent,
and stabilize the law," and those effects "serve legitimate law
enforcement interests").

It is true that because the mosaic which is analyzed for a reasonable-
suspicion or probable-cause inquiry is multi-faceted, "one
determination will seldom be a useful `precedent' for another,"
Gates, supra, at 238, n. 11. But there are exceptions. For instance,
the circumstances in Brinegar, supra, and Carroll v. United States,
267 U. S. 132 (1925), were so alike that we concluded that reversing
the Circuit Court's decision in Brinegar was necessary to be faithful
to Carroll. Brinegar, supra, at 178 ("Nor... can we find in the
present facts any substantial basis for distinguishing this case from
the Carroll case"). We likewise recognized the similarity of facts in
United States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1 (1989) and Florida v. Royer,
460 U. S. 491 (1983) (in both cases, the defendant traveled under an
assumed name; paid for an airline ticket in cash with a number of
small bills; traveled from Miami, a source city for illicit drugs; and
appeared nervous in the airport). The same was true both in United
States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982) and California v. Acevedo,
500 U. S. 565 (1991), see id., at 572 ("The facts in this case closely
resemble the facts in Ross"); and in United States v. Mendenhall,
446 U. S. 544 (1980), and Reid v. Georgia, 448 U. S. 438 (1980),
see id., at 443 (Powell, J., concurring) ("facts [in Mendenhall] [are]
remarkably similar to those in the present case"). And even where
one case may not squarely control another one, the two decisions
when viewed together may usefully add to the body of law on the
subject.

The Court of Appeals, in adopting its deferential standard of review
here, reasoned that de novo review for warrantless searches would
be inconsistent with the "`great deference'" paid when reviewing a
decision to issue a warrant, see Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213
(1983). See United States v. Spears, 965 F. 2d 262, 269-271 (CA7
1992). We cannot agree. The Fourth Amendment demonstrates a
"strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,"
Gates, supra, at 236, and the police are more likely to use the warrant
process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate's probable-cause
determination to issue a warrant is less than that for warrantless
searches. Were we to eliminate this distinction, we would eliminate
the incentive.

We therefore hold that as a general matter determinations of
reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo
on appeal. Having said this, we hasten to point out that a reviewing
court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only
for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those
facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.

A trial judge views the facts of a particular case in light of the
distinctive features and events of the community; likewise a police
officer views the facts through the lens of his police experience and
expertise. The background facts provide a context for the historical
facts, and when seen together yield inferences that deserve deference.
For example, what may not amount to reasonable suspicion at a
motel located alongside a transcontinental highway at the height of
the summer tourist season may rise to that level in December in
Milwaukee. That city is unlikely to have been an overnight stop
selected at the last minute by a traveler coming from California to
points east. The 85-mile width of Lake Michigan blocks any further
eastward progress. And while the city's salubrious summer climate
and seasonal attractions bring many tourists at that time of year, the
same is not true in December. Milwaukee's average daily high
temperature in that month is 31 degrees and its average daily low is
17 degrees; the percentage of possible sunshine is only 38 percent. It
is a reasonable inference that a Californian stopping in Milwaukee in
December is either there to transact business or to visit family or
friends. The background facts, though rarely the subject of explicit
findings, inform the judge's assessment of the historical facts.

In a similar vein, our cases have recognized that a police officer may
draw inferences based on his own experience in deciding whether
probable cause exists. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 422 U. S.
891, 897 (1975). To a layman the sort of loose panel below the back
seat arm rest in the automobile involved in this case may suggest only
wear and tear, but to Officer Luedke, who had searched roughly
2,000 cars for narcotics, it suggested that drugs may be secreted
inside the panel. An appeals court should give due weight to a trial
court's finding that the officer was credible and the inference was
reasonable.

We vacate the judgments and remand the case to the Court of Appeals
to review de novo the District Court's determinations that the officer
had reasonable suspicion and probable cause in this case.


It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 95-5257


SAUL ORNELAS AND ISMAEL ORNELAS-LEDESMA,
PETITIONERS

v.

UNITED STATES

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

[May 28, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.

The Court today decides that a district court's determinations whether
there was probable cause to justify a warrantless search and
reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop should be
reviewed de novo. We have in the past reviewed some mixed
questions of law and fact on a de novo basis, and others on a
deferential basis, depending upon essentially practical considerations.
Because, with respect to the questions at issue here, the purpose of
the determination and its extremely fact-bound nature will cause de
novo review to have relatively little benefit, it is in my view unwise
to require courts of appeals to undertake the searching inquiry that
standard requires. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

As the Court recognizes, determinations of probable cause and
reasonable suspicion involve a two-step process. First, a court must
identify all of the relevant historical facts known to the officer at the
time of the stop or search; and second, it must decide whether, under
a standard of objective reasonableness, those facts would give rise to
a reasonable suspicion justifying a stop or probable cause to search.
See ante, at 6-7. Because this second step requires application of an
objective legal standard to the facts, it is properly characterized as a
mixed question of law and fact. See ante, at 7; Pullman-Standard v.
Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19 (1982).

Merely labeling the issues "mixed questions," however, does not
establish that they receive de novo review. While it is well settled
that appellate courts "accep[t] findings of fact that are not `clearly
erroneous' but decid[e] questions of law de novo," First Options of
Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 9),
there is no rigid rule with respect to mixed questions. We have said
that "deferential review of mixed questions of law and fact is
warranted when it appears that the district court is `better positioned'
than the appellate court to decide the issue in question or that probing
appellate scrutiny will not contribute to the clarity of legal doctrine."
Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991) (citing
Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985)).

These primary factors that counsel in favor of deferential review of
some mixed questions of law and fact--expertise of the district court
and lack of law-clarifying value in the appellate decision--are
ordinarily present with respect to determinations of reasonable
suspicion and probable cause. The factual details bearing upon those
determinations are often numerous and (even when supported by
uncontroverted police testimony) subject to credibility
determinations. An appellate court never has the benefit of the
district court's intimate familiarity with the details of the case--nor the
full benefit of its hearing of the live testimony, unless the district
court makes specific findings on the "totality of the circumstances"
bearing upon the stop or search. As we recognized in Cooter & Gell
v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384 (1990), a case holding that
deferential (abuse-of-discretion) review should be applied to a district
court's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 determination that an
attorney did not conduct a reasonable inquiry or entertain a
"substantiated belief" regarding the nonfrivolousness of the
complaint, see id., at 393: a district court, "[f]amiliar with the issues
and litigants . . . is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal
the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal standard . . . ."
Id., at 402.

Moreover, as the Court acknowledges, "reasonable suspicion" and
"probable cause" are "commonsense, nontechnical conceptions that
deal with `"the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on
which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act."'"
Ante, at 5-6 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231 (1983)
(quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949))).
Where a trial court makes such commonsense determinations based
on the totality of circumstances, it is ordinarily accorded deference.
What we said in a case concerning the question whether certain
payments were a "gift" excludable from income under the Internal
Revenue Code, is equally pertinent here.

"Decision of the issue presented in these cases must be based
ultimately on the application of the fact-finding tribunal's experience
with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of
each case. The nontechnical nature of the . . . standard, the close
relationship of it to the data of practical human experience, and the
multiplicity of relevant factual elements, with their various
combinations, creating the necessity of ascribing the proper force to
each, confirm us in our conclusion that primary weight in this area
must be given to the conclusions of the trier of fact." Commissioner
v. Duberstein, 363 U. S. 278, 289 (1960).

With respect to the second factor counseling in favor of deferential
review, level of law-clarifying value in the appellate decision: Law
clarification requires generalization, and some issues lend themselves
to generalization much more than others. Thus, in Pierce v.
Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 562 (1988), a principal basis for our
applying an abuse-of-discretion standard to a district court's
determination that the United States' litigating position was
"substantially justified" within the meaning of the Equal Access to
Justice Act, 28 U. S. C. Section2412(d), was that the question was
"a multifarious and novel question, little susceptible, for the time
being at least, of useful generalization."  Ibid. Probable cause and
reasonable suspicion determinations are similarly resistant to
generalization. As the Court recognizes, these are "fluid concepts,"
"`not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules'";
and "because the mosaic which is analyzed for a reasonable-
suspicion or probable-cause inquiry is multifaceted, `one
determination will seldom be a useful "precedent" for another.'"
Ante, at 6, 8 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, supra, at 232, 238, n. 11).
The Court maintains that there will be exceptions to this--that fact-
patterns will occasionally repeat themselves, so that a prior de novo
appellate decision will provide useful guidance in a similar case.
Ante, at 8-9. I do not dispute that, but I do not understand why we
should allow the exception to frame the rule. Here, as in Anderson
v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574-575 (1985), "[d]uplication of
the trial judge's efforts in the court of appeals would very likely
contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact de-termination at a
huge cost in diversion of judicial resources."

The facts of this very case illustrate the futility of attempting to craft
useful precedent from the fact-intensive review demanded by
determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion. On
remand, in conducting de novo review, the Seventh Circuit might
consider, inter alia, the following factors relevant to its determination
whether there was probable cause to conduct a warrantless search
and reasonable suspicion  justifying the investigatory stop: (i) the two
NADDIS tips; (ii) that the car was a 1981 two-door General Motors
product; (iii) that the car was from California, a source state; (iv) that
the car was in Milwaukee; (v) that it was December; (vi) that one
suspect checked into the hotel at 4 a.m.; (vii) that he did not have
reservations; (viii) that he had one traveling companion; (ix) that one
suspect appeared calm but shaking; and (x) that there was a loose
panel in the car door. If the Seventh Circuit were to find that this
unique confluence of factors supported probable cause and
reasonable suspicion, the absence of any one of these factors in the
next case would render the precedent inapplicable.

Of course, even when all of the factors are replicated, use of a de
novo standard as opposed to a deferential standard will provide
greater clarity only where the latter would not suffice to set the trial
court's conclusion aside. For where the appellate court holds, on the
basis of deferential review, that it was reversible error for a district
court to find probable cause or reasonable suspicion in light of certain
facts, it advances the clarity of the law just as much as if it had
reversed the district court after conducting plenary review.

In the present case, an additional factor counseling against de novo
review must be mentioned: The prime benefit of de novo appellate
review in criminal cases is, of course, to prevent a miscarriage of
justice that might result from permitting the verdict of guilty to rest
upon the legal determinations of a single judge. But the issue in
these probable-cause and reasonable-suspicion cases is not innocence
but deterrence of unlawful police conduct. That deterrence will not be
at all lessened if the trial judge's determination, right or wrong, is
subjected to only deferential review.

The Court is wrong in its assertion, ante, at 9, that unless there is a
dual standard of review--deferential review of a magistrate's decision
to issue a warrant, and de novo review of a district court's ex post
facto approval of a warrantless search--the incentive to obtain a
warrant would be eliminated. In United States v. Leon, 468 U. S.
897, 913 (1984), we held that "reliable physical evidence seized by
officers reasonably relying on a warrant issued by a detached and
neutral magistrate . . . should be admissible in the prosecutor's case
in chief."  Only a warrant can provide this assurance that the fruits of
even a technically improper search will be admissible. Law
enforcement officers would still have ample incentive to proceed by
warrant.

Finally, I must observe that the Court does not appear to have the
courage of its conclusions. In an apparent effort to reduce the
unproductive burden today's decision imposes upon appellate courts,
or perhaps to salvage some of the trial court's superior familiarity
with the facts that it has cast aside, the Court suggests that an
appellate court should give "due weight" to a trial court's finding that
an officer's inference of wrongdoing (i.e., his assessment of
probable cause to search), was reasonable. Ante, at 10. The Court
cannot have it both ways. This finding of "reasonableness" is
precisely what it has told us the appellate court must review de novo;
and in de novo review, the "weight due" to a trial court's finding is
zero. In the last analysis, there-

fore, the Court's opinion seems to me not only wrong but
contradictory.


*  *  *


I would affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit on the ground that
it correctly applied a deferential standard of review to the District
Court's findings of probable cause and reasonable suspicion.


ENDNOTES


1 Petitioners also alleged that they had not given their consent to
search the interior of the car. The Magistrate Judge rejected this
claim, finding that the record "clearly establishe[d] consent to search
the Oldsmobile" and that "neither [petitioner] placed any restrictions
on the areas the officers could search."  App. 21. The Magistrate
ruled that this consent did not give the officers authority to search
inside the panel, however, because under Seventh Circuit precedent
the police may not dismantle the car body during an otherwise valid
search unless the police have probable cause to believe the car's
panels contain narcotics. See United States v. Garcia, 897 F. 2d
1413, 1419-1420 (1990). We assume correct the Circuit's limitation
on the scope of consent only for purposes of this decision.

2 The District Court emphasized twice that it did not reject the
Magistrate's recommendation with respect to the inevitable discovery
doctrine. App. 30-31, and n. 2; id., at 43-44. But on appeal the
Government did not defend the seizure on this alternative ground and
the Seventh Circuit considered the argument waived. Id., at 71-72.

3 While the Seventh Circuit uses the term "clear error" to denote the
deferential standard applied when reviewing determinations of
reasonable suspicion or probable cause, we think the preferable term
is "abuse of discretion."  See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552,
558 (1988). "Clear error" is a term of art derived from Rule 52(a) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and applies when reviewing
questions of fact.

4 Compare, e.g., United States v. Puerta, 982 F. 2d 1297, 1300
(CA9 1992) (de novo review); United States v. Ramos, 933 F. 2d
968, 972 (CA11 1991) (de novo review), cert. denied, 503 U. S.
908 (1992); United States v. Patrick, 899 F. 2d 169, 171 (CA2
1990) (de novo review) with United States v. Spears, 965 F. 2d
262, 268-271 (CA7 1992) (clear error).

The United States, in accord with petitioners, contends that a de novo
standard of review should apply to determinations of probable cause
and reasonable suspicion. We therefore invited Peter D. Isakoff to
brief and argue this case as amicus curiae in support of the judgment
below. 516 U. S. ___ (1996). Mr. Isakoff accepted the
appointment and has well fulfilled his assigned responsibility.

Syllabus



BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC.

v.

GORE

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA

No. 94-896.  Argued October 11, 1995-Decided May 20, 1996

After respondent Gore purchased a new BMW automobile from an
authorized Alabama dealer, he discovered that the car had been
repainted. He brought this suit for compensatory and punitive
damages against petitioner, the American distributor of BMW's,
alleging, inter alia, that the failure to disclose the repainting
constituted fraud under Alabama law. At trial, BMW acknowledged
that it followed a nationwide policy of not advising its dealers, and
hence their customers, of predelivery damage to new cars when the
cost of repair did not exceed 3 percent of the car's suggested retail
price. Gore's vehicle fell into that category. The jury returned a
verdict finding BMW liable for compensatory damages of $4,000,
and assessing $4 million in punitive damages. The trial judge denied
BMW's post-trial motion to set aside the punitive damages award,
holding, among other things, that the award was not "grossly
excessive" and thus did not violate the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., TXO Production Corp. v.
Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 454. The Alabama
Supreme Court agreed, but reduced the award to $2 million on the
ground that, in computing the amount, the jury had improperly
multiplied Gore's compensatory damages by the number of similar
sales in all States, not just those in Alabama.

Held:  The $2 million punitive damages award is grossly excessive
and therefore exceeds the constitutional limit. Pp. 7-26.

(a) Because such an award violates due process only when it can
fairly be categorized as "grossly excessive" in relation to the State's
legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its
repetition, cf. TXO, 509 U. S., at 456, the federal excessiveness
inquiry appropriately begins with an identification of the state
interests that such an award is designed to serve. Principles of state
sovereignty and comity forbid a State to enact policies for the entire
Nation, or to impose its own policy choice on neighboring States.
See e.g., Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, 335-336.
Accordingly, the economic penalties that a State inflicts on those who
transgress its laws, whether the penalties are legislatively authorized
fines or judicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported by
the State's interest in protecting its own consumers and economy,
rather than those of other States or the entire Nation. Gore's award
must therefore be analyzed in the light of conduct that occurred solely
within Alabama, with consideration being given only to the interests
of Alabama consumers. Pp. 7-13.


(b) Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in this Court's
constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice
not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also
of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose. Three
guideposts, each of which indicates that BMW did not receive
adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might
impose, lead to the conclusion that the $2 million award is grossly
excessive. Pp. 13-14.

(c) None of the aggravating factors associated with the first (and
perhaps most important) indicium of a punitive damages award's
excessiveness--the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's
conduct, see e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371--is
present here. The harm BMW inflicted on Gore was purely
economic; the presale repainting had no effect on the car's
performance, safety features, or appearance; and BMW's conduct
evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the health and
safety of others. Gore's contention that BMW's nondisclosure was
particularly reprehensible because it formed part of a nationwide
pattern of tortious conduct is rejected, because a corporate executive
could reasonably have interpreted the relevant state statutes as
establishing safe harbors for nondisclosure of presumptively minor
repairs, and because there is no evidence either that BMW acted in
bad faith when it sought to establish the appropriate line between
minor damage and damage requiring disclosure to purchasers, or that
it persisted in its course of conduct after it had been adjudged
unlawful. Finally, there is no evidence that BMW engaged in
deliberate false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or
concealment of evidence of improper motive. Pp. 14-20.

(d) The second (and perhaps most commonly cited) indicium of
excessiveness--the ratio between the plaintiff's compensatory
damages and the amount of the punitive damages, see e.g., TXO,
509 U. S., at 459--also weighs against Gore, because his $2 million
award is 500 times the amount of his actual harm as determined by
the jury, and there is no suggestion that he or any other BMW
purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm by
BMW's nondisclosure policy. Although it is not possible to draw a
mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and
the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case, see, e.g.,
id., at 458, the ratio here is clearly outside the acceptable range. Pp.
20-23.

(e) Gore's punitive damages award is not saved by the third relevant
indicium of excessiveness--the difference between it and the civil or
criminal sanctions that could be imposed for comparable misconduct,
see, e.g., Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 23--
because $2 million is substantially greater than Alabama's applicable
$2,000 fine and the penalties imposed in other States for similar
malfeasance, and because none of the pertinent statutes or interpretive
decisions would have put an out-of-state distributor on notice that it
might be subject to a multimillion dollar sanction. Moreover, in the
absence of a BMW history of noncompliance with known statutory
requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a more modest
sanction would not have been sufficient. Pp. 23-25.

(f) Thus, BMW's conduct was not sufficiently egregious to justify
the severe punitive sanction imposed against it. Whether the
appropriate remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent
determination by the Alabama Supreme Court of the award necessary
to vindicate Alabama consumers' economic interests is a matter for
that court to address in the first instance. Pp. 25-26. 646 So. 2d
619, reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-896


BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC.,
PETITIONER

v.

IRA GORE, JR.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALABAMA

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a
State from imposing a "`grossly excessive'" punishment on a
tortfeasor. TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509
U. S. 443, 454 (1993) (and cases cited). The wrongdoing involved
in this case was the decision by a national distributor of automobiles
not to advise its dealers, and hence their customers, of predelivery
damage to new cars when the cost of repair amounted to less than 3
percent of the car's suggested retail price. The question presented is
whether a $2 million punitive damages award to the purchaser of one
of these cars exceeds the constitutional limit.


In January 1990, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr. (respondent), purchased a black
BMW sports sedan for $40,750.88 from an authorized BMW dealer
in Birmingham, Alabama. After driving the car for approximately
nine months, and without noticing any flaws in its appearance, Dr.
Gore took the car to "Slick Finish," an independent detailer, to make
it look "`snazzier than it normally would appear.'"  646 So. 2d 619,
621 (Ala. 1994). Mr. Slick, the proprietor, detected evidence that the
car had been repainted.1   Convinced that he had been cheated, Dr.
Gore brought suit against petitioner BMW of North America
(BMW), the American distributor of BMW automobiles.2   Dr. Gore
alleged, inter alia, that the failure to disclose that the car had been
repainted constituted suppression of a material fact.3 The complaint
prayed for $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, and
costs.

At trial, BMW acknowledged that it had adopted a nationwide policy
in 1983 concerning cars that were damaged in the course of
manufacture or transportation. If the cost of repairing the damage
exceeded 3 percent of the car's suggested retail price, the car was
placed in company service for a period of time and then sold as used.
If the repair cost did not exceed 3 percent of the suggested retail
price, however, the car was sold as new without advising the dealer
that any repairs had been made. Because the $601.37 cost of
repainting Dr. Gore's car was only about 1.5 percent of its suggested
retail price, BMW did not disclose the damage or repair to the
Birmingham dealer.

Dr. Gore asserted that his repainted car was worth less than a car that
had not been refinished. To prove his actual damages of $4,000, he
relied on the testimony of a former BMW dealer, who estimated that
the value of a repainted BMW was approximately 10 percent less
than the value of a new car that had not been damaged and repaired.4
To support his claim for punitive damages, Dr. Gore introduced
evidence that since 1983 BMW had sold 983 refinished cars as new,
including 14 in Alabama, without disclosing that the cars had been
repainted before sale at a cost of more than $300 per vehicle.5
Using the actual damage estimate of $4,000 per vehicle, Dr. Gore
argued that a punitive award of $4 million would provide an
appropriate penalty for selling approximately 1,000 cars for more
than they were worth.

In defense of its disclosure policy, BMW argued that it was under no
obligation to disclose repairs of minor damage to new cars and that
Dr. Gore's car was as good as a car with the original factory finish.
It disputed Dr. Gore's assertion that the value of the car was impaired
by the repainting and argued that this good-faith belief made a
punitive award inappropriate. BMW also maintained that
transactions in jurisdictions other than Alabama had no relevance to
Dr. Gore's claim.

The jury returned a verdict finding BMW liable for compensatory
damages of $4,000. In addition, the jury assessed $4 million in
punitive damages, based on a determination that the nondisclosure
policy constituted "gross, oppressive or malicious" fraud.6   See Ala.
Code Sections 6-11-20, 6-11-21 (1993).

BMW filed a post-trial motion to set aside the punitive damages
award. The company introduced evidence to establish that its
nondisclosure policy was consistent with the laws of roughly 25
States defining the disclosure obligations of automobile
manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. The most stringent of these
statutes required disclosure of repairs costing more than 3 percent of
the suggested retail price; none mandated disclosure of less costly
repairs.7   Relying on these statutes, BMW contended that its
conduct was lawful in these States and therefore could not provide
the basis for an award of punitive damages.

BMW also drew the court's attention to the fact that its nondisclosure
policy had never been adjudged unlawful before this action was filed.
Just months before Dr. Gore's case went to trial, the jury in a similar
lawsuit filed by another Alabama BMW purchaser found that BMW's
failure to disclose paint repair constituted fraud. Yates v. BMW of
North America, Inc., 642 So. 2d 937 (Ala. 1993).8 Before the
judgment in this case, BMW changed its policy by taking steps to
avoid the sale of any refinished vehicles in Alabama and two other
States. When the $4 million verdict was returned in this case, BMW
promptly instituted a nationwide policy of full disclosure of all
repairs, no matter how minor.

In response to BMW's arguments, Dr. Gore asserted that the policy
change demonstrated the efficacy of the punitive damages award. He
noted that while no jury had held the policy unlawful, BMW had
received a number of customer complaints relating to undisclosed
repairs and had settled some lawsuits.9   Finally, he maintained that
the disclosure statutes of other States were irrelevant because BMW
had failed to offer any evidence that the disclosure statutes
supplanted, rather than supplemented, existing causes of action for
common-law fraud.

The trial judge denied BMW's post-trial motion, holding, inter alia,
that the award was not excessive. On appeal, the Alabama Supreme
Court also rejected BMW's claim that the award exceeded the
constitutionally permissible amount. 646 So. 2d 619 (1994). The
court's excessiveness inquiry applied the factors articulated in Green
Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So. 2d 218, 223-224 (Ala. 1989), and
approved in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 21-22
(1991). 646 So. 2d, at 624-625. Based on its analysis, the court
concluded that BMW's conduct was "reprehensible"; the
nondisclosure was profitable for the company; the judgment "would
not have a substantial impact upon [BMW's] financial position"; the
litigation had been expensive; no criminal sanctions had been
imposed on BMW for the same conduct; the award of no punitive
damages in Yates reflected "the inherent uncertainty of the trial
process"; and the punitive award bore a "reasonable relationship" to
"the harm that was likely to occur from [BMW's] conduct as well as
. . . the harm that actually occurred."  Id., at 625-627.

The Alabama Supreme Court did, however, rule in BMW's favor on
one critical point: The court found that the jury improperly computed
the amount of punitive damages by multiplying Dr. Gore's
compensatory damages by the number of similar sales in other
jurisdictions. Id., at 627. Having found the verdict tainted, the court
held that "a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in
this case is $2,000,000," id., at 629, and therefore ordered a
remittitur in that amount.10   The court's discussion of the amount of
its remitted award expressly disclaimed any reliance on "acts that
occurred in other jurisdictions"; instead, the court explained that it
had used a "comparative analysis" that considered Alabama cases,
"along with cases from other jurisdictions, involving the sale of an
automobile where the seller misrepresented the condition of the
vehicle and the jury awarded punitive damages to the purchaser."11
Id., at 628.

Because we believed that a review of this case would help to
illuminate "the character of the standard that will identify
constitutionally excessive awards" of punitive damages, see Honda
Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 4), we
granted certiorari, 513 U. S. ___ (1995).


Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State's
legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its
repetition. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974);
Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 266-267 (1981);
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 22. In our federal system, States necessarily
have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive
damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any
particular case. Most States that authorize exemplary damages afford
the jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damages awarded be
reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's legitimate interests in
punishment and deterrence. See TXO, 509 U. S., at 456; Haslip,
499 U. S., at 21, 22. Only when an award can fairly be categorized
as "grossly excessive" in relation to these interests does it enter the
zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. TXO, 509 U. S., at 456. For that
reason, the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins with
an identification of the state interests that a punitive award is designed
to serve. We therefore focus our attention first on the scope of
Alabama's legitimate interests in punishing BMW and deterring it
from future misconduct.

No one doubts that a State may protect its citizens by prohibiting
deceptive trade practices and by requiring automobile distributors to
disclose presale repairs that affect the value of a new car. But the
States need not, and in fact do not, provide such protection in a
uniform manner. Some States rely on the judicial process to
formulate and enforce an appropriate disclosure requirement by
applying principles of contract and tort law.12   Other States have
enacted various forms of legislation that define the disclosure
obligations of automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.13
The result is a patchwork of rules representing the diverse policy
judgments of lawmakers in 50 States.

That diversity demonstrates that reasonable people may disagree
about the value of a full disclosure requirement. Some legislatures
may conclude that affirmative disclosure requirements are
unnecessary because the self-interest of those involved in the
automobile trade in developing and maintaining the goodwill of their
customers will motivate them to make voluntary disclosures or to
refrain from selling cars that do not comply with self-imposed
standards. Those legislatures that do adopt affirmative disclosure
obligations may take into account the cost of government regulation,
choosing to draw a line exempting minor repairs from such a
requirement. In formulating a disclosure standard, States may also
consider other goals, such as providing a "safe harbor" for
automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers against lawsuits
over minor repairs.14

We may assume, arguendo, that it would be wise for every State to
adopt Dr. Gore's preferred rule, requiring full disclosure of every
presale repair to a car, no matter how trivial and regardless of its
actual impact on the value of the car. But while we do not doubt that
Congress has ample authority to enact such a policy for the entire
Nation,15  it is clear that no single State could do so, or even impose
its own policy choice on neighboring States. See Bonaparte v. Tax
Court, 104 U. S. 592, 594 (1881) ("No State can legislate except
with reference to its own jurisdiction. . . . Each State is independent
of all the others in this particular").16   Similarly, one State's power
to impose burdens on the interstate market for automobiles is not
only subordinate to the federal power over interstate commerce,
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194-196 (1824), but is also
constrained by the need to respect the interests of other States, see,
e.g., Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, 335-336 (1989) (the
Constitution has a "special concern both with the maintenance of a
national economic union unfettered by state-imposed limitations on
interstate commerce and with the autonomy of the individual States
within their respective spheres" (footnote omitted)); Edgar v. MITE
Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 643 (1982).

We think it follows from these principles of state sovereignty and
comity that a State may not impose economic sanctions on violators
of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct
in other States.17 Before this Court Dr. Gore argued that the large
punitive damages award was necessary to induce BMW to change the
nationwide policy that it adopted in 1983.18   But by attempting to
alter BMW's nationwide policy, Alabama would be infringing on the
policy choices of other States. To avoid such encroachment, the
economic penalties that a State such as Alabama inflicts on those who
transgress its laws, whether the penalties take the form of
legislatively authorized fines or judicially imposed punitive damages,
must be supported by the State's interest in protecting its own
consumers and its own economy. Alabama may insist that BMW
adhere to a particular disclosure policy in that State. Alabama does
not have the power, however, to punish BMW for conduct that was
lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its
residents.19   Nor may Alabama impose sanctions on BMW in order
to deter conduct that is lawful in other jurisdictions.

In this case, we accept the Alabama Supreme Court's interpretation
of the jury verdict as reflecting a computation of the amount of
punitive damages "based in large part on conduct that happened in
other jurisdictions."  646 So. 2d, at 627. As the Alabama Supreme
Court noted, neither the jury nor the trial court was presented with
evidence that any of BMW's out-of-state conduct was unlawful.
"The only testimony touching the issue showed that approximately
60% of the vehicles that were refinished were sold in states where
failure to disclose the repair was not an unfair trade practice." Id., at
627, n. 6.20   The Alabama Supreme Court therefore properly
eschewed reliance on BMW's out-of-state conduct, id., at 628, and
based its remitted award solely on conduct that occurred within
Alabama.21   The award must be analyzed in the light of the same
conduct, with consideration given only to the interests of Alabama
consumers, rather than those of the entire Nation. When the scope of
the interest in punishment and deterrence that an Alabama court may
appropriately consider is properly limited, it is apparent--for reasons
that we shall now address--that this award is grossly excessive.


Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional
jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the
conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity of
the penalty that a State may impose.22   Three guideposts, each of
which indicates that BMW did not receive adequate notice of the
magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose for adhering to
the nondisclosure policy adopted in 1983, lead us to the conclusion
that the $2 million award against BMW is grossly excessive: the
degree of reprehensibility of the nondisclosure; the disparity between
the harm or potential harm suffered by Dr. Gore and his punitive
damages award; and the difference between this remedy and the civil
penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. We discuss
these considerations in turn.

Degree of Reprehensibility

Perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a
punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the
defendant's conduct.23   As the Court stated nearly 150 years ago,
exemplary damages imposed on a defendant should reflect "the
enormity of his offense."  Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371
(1852). See also St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Williams, 251 U.
S. 63, 66-67 (1919) (punitive award may not be "wholly
disproportioned to the offense"); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,
Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 301 (1989)
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(reviewing court "should examine the gravity of the defendant's
conduct and the harshness of the award of punitive damages").24
This principle reflects the accepted view that some wrongs are more
blameworthy than others. Thus, we have said that "nonviolent
crimes are less serious than crimes marked by violence or the threat
of violence."  Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 292-293 (1983).
Similarly, "trickery and deceit", TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, are more
reprehensible than negligence. In TXO, both the West Virginia
Supreme Court and the Justices of this Court placed special emphasis
on the principle that punitive damages may not be "grossly out of
proportion to the severity of the offense."25   Id., at 453, 462.
Indeed, for JUSTICE KENNEDY, the defendant's intentional malice
was the decisive element in a "close and difficult" case. Id., at
468.26

In this case, none of the aggravating factors associated with
particularly reprehensible conduct is present. The harm BMW
inflicted on Dr. Gore was purely economic in nature. The presale
refinishing of the car had no effect on its performance or safety
features, or even its appearance for at least nine months after his
purchase. BMW's conduct evinced no indifference to or reckless
disregard for the health and safety of others. To be sure, infliction of
economic injury, especially when done intentionally through
affirmative acts of misconduct, id., at 453, or when the target is
financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty. But this
observation does not convert all acts that cause economic harm into
torts that are sufficiently reprehensible to justify a significant sanction
in addition to compensatory damages.

Dr. Gore contends that BMW's conduct was particularly
reprehensible because nondisclosure of the repairs to his car formed
part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct. Certainly, evidence
that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while
knowing or suspecting that it was unlawful would provide relevant
support for an argument that strong medicine is required to cure the
defendant's disrespect for the law. See id., at 462, n. 28. Our
holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first
offender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible
than an individual instance of malfeasance. See Gryger v. Burke,
334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948).

In support of his thesis, Dr. Gore advances two arguments. First, he
asserts that the state disclosure statutes supplement, rather than
supplant, existing remedies for breach of contract and common-law
fraud. Thus, according to Dr. Gore, the statutes may not properly be
viewed as immunizing from liability the nondisclosure of repairs
costing less than the applicable statutory threshold. Brief for
Respondent 18-19. Second, Dr. Gore maintains that BMW should
have anticipated that its failure to disclose similar repair work could
expose it to liability for fraud. Id., at 4-5.

We recognize, of course, that only state courts may authoritatively
construe state statutes. As far as we are aware, at the time this action
was commenced no state court had explicitly addressed whether its
State's disclosure statute provides a safe harbor for nondisclosure of
presumptively minor repairs or should be construed instead as
supplementing common-law duties.27   A review of the text of the
statutes, however, persuades us that in the absence of a state-court
determination to the contrary, a corporate executive could reasonably
interpret the disclosure requirements as establishing safe harbors. In
California, for example, the disclosure statute defines "material"
damage to a motor vehicle as damage requiring repairs costing in
excess of 3 percent of the suggested retail price or $500, whichever
is greater. Cal. Veh. Code Ann. Section 9990 (West Supp. 1996).
The Illinois statute states that in cases in which disclosure is not
required, "nondisclosure does not constitute a misrepresentation or
omission of fact."  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, Section 710/5
(1994).28   Perhaps the statutes may also be interpreted in another
way. We simply emphasize that the record contains no evidence that
BMW's decision to follow a disclosure policy that coincided with the
strictest extant state statute was sufficiently reprehensible to justify a
$2 million award of punitive damages.

Dr. Gore's second argument for treating BMW as a recidivist is that
the company should have anticipated that its actions would be
considered fraudulent in some, if not all, jurisdictions. This
contention overlooks the fact that actionable fraud requires a material
misrepresentation or omission.29   This qualifier invites line drawing
of just the sort engaged in by States with disclosure statutes and by
BMW. We do not think it can be disputed that there may exist minor
imperfections in the finish of a new car that can be repaired (or
indeed, left unrepaired) without materially affecting the car's
value.30   There is no evidence that BMW acted in bad faith when it
sought to establish the appropriate line between presumptively minor
damage and damage requiring disclosure to purchasers. For this
purpose, BMW could reasonably rely on state disclosure statutes for
guidance. In this regard, it is also significant that there is no
evidence that BMW persisted in a course of conduct after it had been
adjudged unlawful on even one occasion, let alone repeated
occasions.31

Finally, the record in this case discloses no deliberate false
statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of
evidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslip and
TXO. Haslip, 499 U. S., at 5, TXO, 509 U. S., at 453. We accept,
of course, the jury's finding that BMW suppressed a material fact
which Alabama law obligated it to communicate to prospective
purchasers of repainted cars in that State. But the omission of a
material fact may be less reprehensible than a deliberate false
statement, particularly when there is a good-faith basis for believing
that no duty to disclose exists.

That conduct is sufficiently reprehensible to give rise to tort liability,
and even a modest award of exemplary damages, does not establish
the high degree of culpability that warrants a substantial punitive
damages award. Because this case exhibits none of the
circumstances ordinarily associated with egregiously improper
conduct, we are persuaded that BMW's conduct was not sufficiently
reprehensible to warrant imposition of a $2 million exemplary
damages award.

Ratio

The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an
unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the
actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff. See TXO, 509 U. S., at 459;
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23. The principle that exemplary damages
must bear a "reasonable relationship" to compensatory damages has a
long pedigree.32   Scholars have identified a number of early English
statutes authorizing the award of multiple damages for particular
wrongs. Some 65 different enactments during the period between
1275 and 1753 provided for double, treble, or quadruple damages.33
Our decisions in both Haslip and TXO endorsed the proposition that
a comparison between the compensatory award and the punitive
award is significant.

In Haslip we concluded that even though a punitive damages award
of "more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages," might
be "close to the line," it did not "cross the line into the area of
constitutional impropriety."  Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23-24. TXO,
following dicta in Haslip, refined this analysis by confirming that the
proper inquiry is "`whether there is a reasonable relationship between
the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the
defendant's conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.'"
TXO, 509 U. S., at 460 (emphasis in original), quoting Haslip, 499
U. S., at 21. Thus, in upholding the $10 million award in TXO, we
relied on the difference between that figure and the harm to the victim
that would have ensued if the tortious plan had succeeded. That
difference suggested that the relevant ratio was not more than 10 to
1.34

The $2 million in punitive damages awarded to Dr. Gore by the
Alabama Supreme Court is 500 times the amount of his actual harm
as determined by the jury.35   Moreover, there is no suggestion that
Dr. Gore or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any
additional potential harm by BMW's nondisclosure policy. The
disparity in this case is thus dramatically greater than those
considered in Haslip and TXO.36

Of course, we have consistently rejected the notion that the
constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even
one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award.
TXO, 509 U. S., at 458.37   Indeed, low awards of compensatory
damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory
awards, if, for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in
only a small amount of economic damages. A higher ratio may also
be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect or the
monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to
determine. It is appropriate, therefore, to reiterate our rejection of a
categorical approach. Once again, "we return to what we said . . . in
Haslip: `We need not, and indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical
bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the
constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say,
however, that [a] general concer[n] of reasonableness... properly
enter[s] into the constitutional calculus.'" TXO, 509 U. S., at 458
(quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18). In most cases, the ratio will be
within a constitutionally acceptable range, and remittitur will not be
justified on this basis. When the ratio is a breathtaking 500 to 1,
however, the award must surely "raise a suspicious judicial
eyebrow."  TXO, 509 U. S., at 482 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).

Sanctions for Comparable Misconduct

Comparing the punitive damages award and the civil or criminal
penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct provides
a third indicium of excessiveness. As JUSTICE O'CONNOR has
correctly observed, a reviewing court engaged in determining
whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should "accord
`substantial deference' to legislative judgments concerning
appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue."  Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S., at 301
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23, the Court noted that although the
exemplary award was "much in excess of the fine that could be
imposed," imprisonment was also authorized in the criminal
context.38   In this case the $2 million economic sanction imposed on
BMW is substantially greater than the statutory fines available in
Alabama and elsewhere for similar malfeasance.

The maximum civil penalty authorized by the Alabama Legislature for
a violation of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act is $2,000;39  other
States authorize more severe sanctions, with the maxima ranging
from $5,000 to $10,000.40   Significantly, some statutes draw a
distinction between first offenders and recidivists; thus, in New York
the penalty is $50 for a first offense and $250 for subsequent
offenses. None of these statutes would provide an out-of-state
distributor with fair notice that the first violation--or, indeed the first
14 violations--of its provisions might subject an offender to a
multimillion dollar penalty. Moreover, at the time BMW's policy
was first challenged, there does not appear to have been any judicial
decision in Alabama or elsewhere indicating that application of that
policy might give rise to such severe punishment.

The sanction imposed in this case cannot be justified on the ground
that it was necessary to deter future misconduct without considering
whether less drastic remedies could be expected to achieve that goal.
The fact that a multimillion dollar penalty prompted a change in
policy sheds no light on the question whether a lesser deterrent
would have adequately protected the interests of Alabama consumers.
In the absence of a history of noncompliance with known statutory
requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a more modest
sanction would not have been sufficient to motivate full compliance
with the disclosure requirement imposed by the Alabama Supreme
Court in this case.


We assume, as the juries in this case and in the Yates case found, that
the undisclosed damage to the new BMW's affected their actual
value. Notwithstanding the evidence adduced by BMW in an effort
to prove that the repainted cars conformed to the same quality
standards as its other cars, we also assume that it knew, or should
have known, that as time passed the repainted cars would lose their
attractive appearance more rapidly than other BMW's. Moreover, we
of course accept the Alabama courts' view that the state interest in
protecting its citizens from deceptive trade practices justifies a
sanction in addition to the recovery of compensatory damages. We
cannot, however, accept the conclusion of the Alabama Supreme
Court that BMW's conduct was sufficiently egregious to justify a
punitive sanction that is tantamount to a severe criminal penalty.

The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious
individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the
demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its
business. Indeed, its status as an active participant in the national
economy implicates the federal interest in preventing individual States
from imposing undue burdens on interstate commerce. While each
State has ample power to protect its own consumers, none may use
the punitive damages deterrent as a means of imposing its regulatory
policies on the entire Nation.

As in Haslip, we are not prepared to draw a bright line marking the
limits of a constitutionally acceptable punitive damages award.
Unlike that case, however, we are fully convinced that the grossly
excessive award imposed in this case transcends the constitutional
limit.41   Whether the appropriate remedy requires a new trial or
merely an independent determination by the Alabama Supreme Court
of the award necessary to vindicate the economic interests of
Alabama consumers is a matter that should be addressed by the state
court in the first instance.

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-896


BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC.,
PETITIONER

v.

IRA GORE, JR.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALABAMA

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR and
JUSTICE SOUTER join, concurring.

The Alabama state courts have assessed the defendant $2 million in
"punitive damages" for having knowingly failed to tell a BMW
automobile buyer that, at a cost of $600, it had repainted portions of
his new $40,000 car, thereby lowering its potential resale value by
about 10%. The Court's opinion, which I join, explains why we
have concluded that this award, in this case, was "grossly excessive"
in relation to legitimate punitive damages objectives, and hence an
arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property in violation of the
Due Process Clause. See TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance
Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 453, 454 (1993) (A "grossly
excessive" punitive award amounts to an "arbitrary deprivation of
property without due process of law") (plurality opinion). Members
of this Court have generally thought, however, that if "fair
procedures were followed, a judgment that is a product of that
process is entitled to a strong presumption of validity."  Id., at 457.
See also Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 40-42
(1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). And the Court
also has found that punitive damages procedures very similar to those
followed here were not, by themselves, fundamentally unfair. Id., at
15-24. Thus, I believe it important to explain why this presumption
of validity is overcome in this instance.

The reason flows from the Court's emphasis in Haslip upon the
constitutional importance of legal standards that provide "reasonable
constraints" within which "discretion is exercised," that assure
"meaningful and adequate review by the trial court whenever a jury
has fixed the punitive damages," and permit "appellate review [that]
makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in their
amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has
occurred and to deter its repetition." Id., at 20-21. See also id., at 18
("[U]nlimited jury discretion--or unlimited judicial discretion for that
matter--in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results
that jar one's constitutional sensibilities").

This constitutional concern, itself harkening back to the Magna Carta,
arises out of the basic unfairness of depriving citizens of life, liberty,
or property, through the application, not of law and legal processes,
but of arbitrary coercion. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331
(1986); Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 123 (1889).
Requiring the application of law, rather than a decisionmaker's
caprice, does more than simply provide citizens notice of what
actions may subject them to punishment; it also helps to assure the
uniform general treatment of similarly situated persons that is the
essence of law itself. See Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New
York, 336 U. S. 106, 112 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring)
("[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and
unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law
which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed
generally").

Legal standards need not be precise in order to satisfy this
constitutional concern. See Haslip, supra, at 20 (comparing punitive
damages standards to such legal standards as "reasonable care," "due
diligence," and "best interests of the child") (internal quotation marks
omitted). But they must offer some kind of constraint upon a jury or
court's discretion, and thus protection against purely arbitrary
behavior. The standards the Alabama courts applied here are vague
and open-ended to the point where they risk arbitrary results. In my
view, although the vagueness of those standards does not, by itself,
violate due process, see Haslip, supra, it does invite the kind of
scrutiny the Court has given the particular verdict before us. See id.,
at 18 ("[C]oncerns of . . . adequate guidance from the court when the
case is tried to a jury properly enter into the constitutional calculus");
TXO, supra, at 475 ("[I]t cannot be denied that the lack of clear
guidance heightens the risk that arbitrariness, passion, or bias will
replace dispassionate deliberation as the basis for the jury's verdict")
(O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). This is because the standards, as the
Alabama Supreme Court authoritatively interpreted them here,
provided no significant constraints or protection against arbitrary
results.

First, the Alabama statute that permits punitive damages does not
itself contain a standard that readily distinguishes between conduct
warranting very small, and conduct warranting very large, punitive
damages awards. That statute permits punitive damages in cases of
"oppression, fraud, wantonness, or malice."  Ala. Code Section 6-
11-20(a) (1993). But the statute goes on to define those terms
broadly, to encompass far more than the egregious conduct that those
terms, at first reading, might seem to imply. An intentional
misrepresentation, made through a statement or silence, can easily
amount to "fraud" sufficient to warrant punitive damages. See
Section 6-11-20(b)(1) ("Fraud" includes "intentional . . .
concealment of a material fact the concealing party had a duty to
disclose, which was gross, oppressive, or malicious and committed
with the intention . . . of thereby depriving a person or entity of
property") (emphasis added); Section 6-11-20(b)(2)("Malice"
includes any "wrongful act without just cause or excuse . . . [w]ith
an intent to injure the... property of another") (emphasis added);
Section 6-11-20(b)(5) ("Oppression" includes "[s]ubjecting a person
to . . . unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's
rights"). The statute thereby authorizes punitive damages for the
most serious kinds of misrepresentations, say, tricking the elderly
out of their life savings, for much less serious conduct, such as the
failure to disclose repainting a car, at issue here, and for a vast range
of conduct in between.

Second, the Alabama courts, in this case, have applied the "factors"
intended to constrain punitive damages awards, in a way that belies
that purpose. Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So. 2d 218 (Ala.
1989), sets forth seven factors that appellate courts use to determine
whether or not a jury award was "grossly excessive" and which, in
principle, might make up for the lack of significant constraint in the
statute. But, as the Alabama courts have authoritatively interpreted
them, and as their application in this case illustrates, they impose little
actual constraint.

(a) Green Oil requires that a punitive damages award "bear a
reasonable relationship to the harm that is likely to occur from the
defendant's conduct as well as to the harm that actually has
occurred."  Id., at 223. But this standard does little to guide a
determination of what counts as a "reasonable" relationship, as this
case illustrates. The record evidence of past, present, or likely future
harm consists of (a) $4,000 of harm to Dr. Gore's BMW; (b) 13
other similar Alabama instances; and (c) references to about 1,000
similar instances in other States. The Alabama Supreme Court,
disregarding BMW's failure to make relevant objection to the out-of-
state instances at trial (as was the court's right), held that the last
mentioned, out-of-state instances did not count as relevant harm. It
went on to find "a reasonable relationship" between the  harm and the
$2 million punitive damages award without "consider[ing] those acts
that occurred in other jurisdictions."  646 So. 2d 619, 628 (1995)
(emphasis added). For reasons explored by the majority in greater
depth, see ante, at 13-25, the relationship between this award and the
underlying conduct seems well beyond the bounds of the
"reasonable."  To find a "reasonable relationship" between purely
economic harm totaling $56,000, without significant evidence of
future repetition, and a punitive award of $2 million is to empty the
"reasonable relationship" test of meaningful content. As thus
construed, it does not set forth a legal standard that could have
significantly constrained the discretion of Alabama factfinders.
(b) Green Oil's second factor is the "degree of reprehensibility" of
the defendant's conduct. Green Oil, supra, at 223. Like the
"reasonable relationship" test, this factor provides little guidance on
how to relate culpability to the size of an award. The Alabama court,
in considering this factor, found "reprehensible" that BMW followed
a conscious policy of not disclosing repairs to new cars when the
cost of repairs amounted to less than 3% of the car's value. Of
course, any conscious policy of not disclosing a repair--where one
knows the nondisclosure might cost the customer resale value--is
"reprehensible" to some degree. But, for the reasons discussed by
the majority, ante, at 14-20, I do not see how the Alabama courts
could find conduct that (they assumed) caused $56,000 of relevant
economic harm especially or unusually reprehensible enough to
warrant $2 million in punitive damages, or a significant portion of
that award. To find to the contrary, as the Alabama courts did, is not
simply unreasonable; it is to make "reprehensibility" a concept
without constraining force, i.e., to deprive the concept of its
constraining power to protect against serious and capricious
deprivations.

(c) Green Oil's third factor requires "punitive damages" to "remove
the profit" of the illegal activity and "be in excess of the profit, so that
the defendant recognizes a loss."  Green Oil, supra, at 223. This
factor has the ability to limit awards to a fixed, rational amount. But
as applied, that concept's potential was not realized, for the court did
not limit the award to anywhere near the $56,000 in profits evidenced
in the record. Given the record's description of the conduct and its
prevalence, this factor could not justify much of the $2 million
award.


(d) Green Oil's fourth factor is the "financial position" of the
defendant. Ibid. Since a fixed dollar award will punish a poor
person more than a wealthy one, one can understand the relevance of
this factor to the state's interest in retribution (though not necessarily
to its interest in deterrence, given the more distant relation between a
defendant's wealth and its responses to economic incentives). See
TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, and n. 28 (plurality opinion); id., at 469
(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21-22; Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc.
v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 300 (1989) (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). This factor, however, is
not necessarily intended to act as a significant constraint on punitive
awards. Rather, it provides an open-ended basis for inflating awards
when the defendant is wealthy, as this case may illustrate. That does
not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this
factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as
"reprehensibility," to constrain significantly an award that purports to
punish a defendant's conduct.

(e) Green Oil's fifth factor is the "costs of litigation" and the State's
desire "to encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial."  539 So.
2d, at 223. This standard provides meaningful constraint to the
extent that the enhancement it authorized is linked to a fixed,
ascertainable amount approximating actual costs, even when defined
generously to reflect the contingent nature of plaintiffs' victories.
But as this case shows, the factor cannot operate as a constraint when
an award much in excess of costs is approved for other reasons. An
additional aspect of the standard--the need to "encourage plaintiffs to
bring wrongdoers to trial"--is a factor that does not constrain, but
enhances, discretionary power--especially when unsupported by
evidence of a special need to encourage litigation (which the Alabama
courts here did not mention).


(f) Green Oil's sixth factor is whether or not "criminal sanctions have
been imposed on the defendant for his conduct."  Ibid. This factor
did not apply here.

(g) Green Oil's seventh factor requires that "other civil actions" filed
"against the same defendant, based on the same conduct" be
considered in mitigation. Id., at 224. That factor did not apply here.

Thus, the first, second, and third Green Oil factors, in principle,
might sometimes act as constraints on arbitrary behavior. But as the
Alabama courts interpreted those standards in this case, even taking
those three factors together, they could not have significantly
constrained the court system's ability to impose "grossly excessive"
awards.

Third, the state courts neither referred to, nor made any effort to find,
nor enunciated any other standard, that either directly, or indirectly as
background, might have supplied the constraining legal force that the
statute and Green Oil standards (as interpreted here) lack. Dr. Gore
did argue to the jury an economic theory based on the need to offset
the totality of the harm that the defendant's conduct caused. Some
theory of that general kind might have provided a significant
constraint on arbitrary awards (at least where confined to the relevant
harm-causing conduct, see ante, at 10-13). Some economists, for
example, have argued for a standard that would deter illegal activity
causing solely economic harm through the use of punitive damages
awards that, as a whole, would take from a wrongdoer the total cost
of the harm caused. See, e.g., S. Shavell, Economic Analysis of
Accident Law 162 (1987) ("If liability equals losses caused
multiplied by... the inverse of the probability of suit, injurers will act
optimally under liability rules despite the chance that they will escape
suit"); Cooter, Punitive Damages for Deterrence: When and How
Much, 40 Ala. L. Rev. 1143, 1146-1148 (1989). My understanding
of the intuitive essence of some of those theories, which I put in
crude form (leaving out various qualifications), is that they could
permit juries to calculate punitive damages by making a rough
estimate of global harm, dividing that estimate by a similarly rough
estimate of the number of successful lawsuits that would likely be
brought, and adding generous attorneys fees and other costs.
Smaller damages would not sufficiently discourage firms from
engaging in the harmful conduct, while larger damages would "over-
deter" by leading potential defendants to spend more to prevent the
activity that causes the economic harm, say, through employee
training, than the cost of the harm itself. See Galligan, Augmented
Awards: The Efficient Evolution of Punitive Damages, 51 La. L.
Rev. 3, 17-20, 28-30 (1990). Larger damages might also "double
count" by including in the punitive damages award some of the
compensatory, or punitive, damages that subsequent plaintiffs would
also recover.

The record before us, however, contains nothing suggesting that the
Alabama Supreme Court, when determining the allowable award,
applied any "economic" theory that might explain the $2 million
recovery. Cf. Browning-Ferris, supra, at 300 (noting that the
Constitution "does not incorporate the views of the Law and
Economics School," nor does it "`require the States to subscribe to
any particular economic theory'") (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (quoting CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp.
of America, 481 U. S. 69, 92 (1987)). And courts properly tend to
judge the rationality of judicial actions in terms of the reasons that
were given, and the facts that were before the court, cf. TXO, 509
U. S., at 468 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment), not those that might have been given on the basis of some
conceivable set of facts (unlike the rationality of economic statutes
enacted by legislatures subject to the public's control through the
ballot box, see, e.g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.
S. 307, 315 (1993)). Therefore, reference to a constraining
"economic" theory, which might have counseled more deferential
review by this Court, is lacking in this case.

Fourth, I cannot find any community understanding or historic
practice that this award might exemplify and which, therefore, would
provide background standards constraining arbitrary behavior and
excessive awards. A punitive damages award of $2 million for
intentional misrepresentation causing $56,000 of harm is
extraordinary by historical standards, and, as far as I am aware, finds
no analogue until relatively recent times. Amici for Dr. Gore attempt
to show that this is not true, pointing to various historical cases
which, according to their calculations, represented roughly equivalent
punitive awards for similarly culpable conduct. See Brief for James
D. A. Boyle et al. as Amici Curiae 4-5 (hereinafter Legal Historians'
Brief). Among others, they cite Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 98 Eng.
Rep. 489 (C. P. 1763) (1,000 said to be equivalent of $1.5 million,
for warrantless search of papers); Huckle v. Money, 2 Wills. 205,
95 Eng. Rep. 768 (K. B. 1763) (300, said to be $450,000, for 6-
hour false imprisonment); Hewlett v. Cruchley, 5 Taunt. 277, 128
Eng. Rep. 696 (C. P. 1813) (2,000, said to be $680,000, for
malicious prosection); Merest v. Harvey, 5 Taunt. 442, 128 Eng.
Rep. 761 (C. P. 1814) (500, said to be $165,000, for poaching).
But amici apparently base their conversions on a mathematical
assumption, namely that inflation has progressed at a constant 3%
rate of inflation. See Legal Historians' Brief 4. In fact, consistent,
cumulative inflation is a modern phenomenon. See McCusker, How
Much Is That in Real Money? A Historical Price Index for Use as a
Deflator of Money Values in the Economy of the United States, 101
Proceedings of American Antiquarian Society 297, 310, 323-332
(1992). Estimates based on historical rates of valuation, while highly
approximate, suggest that the ancient extraordinary awards are small
compared to the $2 million here at issue, or other modern punitive
damages figures. See Appendix to this opinion, infra, at 13-14
(suggesting that the modern equivalent of the awards in the above
cases is something like $150,000, $45,000, $100,000, and $25,000
respectively). And, as the majority opinion makes clear, the record
contains nothing to suggest that the extraordinary size of the award in
this case is explained by the extraordinary wrongfulness of the
defendant's behavior, measured by historical or community
standards, rather than arbitrariness or caprice.

Fifth, there are no other legislative enactments here that classify
awards and impose quantitative limits that would significantly cabin
the fairly unbounded discretion created by the absence of
constraining legal standards. Cf., e.g., Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code Ann. Section 41.008 (Supp. 1996) (punitive damages
generally limited to greater of double damages, or $200,000, except
cap does not apply to suits arising from certain serious criminal acts
enumerated in the statute); Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 52-240b (1995)
(punitive damages may not exceed double compensatory damages in
product liability cases); Fla. Stat. Section 768.73(1) (Supp. 1993)
(punitive damages in certain actions limited to treble compensatory
damages); Ga. Code. Ann. Section 51-12-5.1(g) (Supp. 1995)
($250,000 cap in certain actions).

The upshot is that the rules that purport to channel discretion in this
kind of case, here did not do so in fact. That means that the award in
this case was both (a) the product of a system of standards that did
not significantly constrain a court's, and hence a jury's, discretion in
making that award; and (b) was grossly excessive in light of the
State's legitimate punitive damages objectives.

The first of these reasons has special importance where courts review
a jury-determined punitive damages award. That is because one
cannot expect to direct jurors like legislators through the ballot box;
nor can one expect those jurors to interpret law like judges, who
work within a discipline and hierarchical organization that normally
promotes roughly uniform interpretation and application of the law.
Yet here Alabama expects jurors to act, at least a little, like legislators
or judges, for it permits them, to a certain extent, to create public
policy and to apply that policy, not to compensate a victim, but to
achieve a policy-related objective outside the confines of the
particular case.

To the extent that neither clear legal principles, nor fairly obvious
historical or community-based standards (defining, say, especially
egregious behavior) significantly constrain punitive damages awards,
is there not a substantial risk of outcomes so arbitrary that they
become difficult to square with the Constitution's assurance, to every
citizen, of the law's protection? The standards here, as
authoritatively interpreted, in my view, make this threat real and not
theoretical. And, in these unusual circumstances, where legal
standards offer virtually no constraint, I believe that this lack of
constraining standards warrants this Court's detailed examination of
the award.

The second reason--the severe disproportionality between the award
and the legitimate punitive damages objectives--reflects a judgment
about a matter of degree. I recognize that it is often difficult to
determine just when a punitive award exceeds an amount reasonably
related to a State's legitimate interests, or when that excess is so great
as to amount to a matter of constitutional concern. Yet whatever the
difficulties of drawing a precise line, once we examine the award in
this case, it is not difficult to say that this award lies on the line's far
side. The severe lack of proportionality between the size of the
award and the underlying punitive damages objectives shows that the
award falls into the category of "gross excessiveness" set forth in this
Court's prior cases.

These two reasons taken together overcome what would otherwise
amount to a "strong presumption of validity." TXO, 509 U. S., at
457. And, for those two reasons, I conclude that the award in this
unusual case violates the basic guarantee of nonarbitrary
governmental behavior that the Due Process Clause provides.


APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.

Although I recognize that all estimates of historic rates of inflation are
subject to dispute, including, I assume, the sources below, those
sources suggest that the value of the eighteenth and nineteenth
century judgments cited by amici is much less than the figures amici
arrived at under their presumption of a constant 3% rate of inflation.


In 1763, 1 (Eng.) was worth 1.73 Pennsylvania currency. See U.
S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States:
Colonial Times to 1970, Series Z--585, p. 1198 (Bicentennial ed.
1975). For the period 1766-1772, 1 (Penn.) was worth $45.99 (U.
S. 1991). See McCusker, How Much Is That in Real Money? A
Historical Price Index for Use as a Deflator of Money Values in the
Economy of the United States, 101 American Antiquarian Society
297, 333 (1992). Thus, 1 (Eng. 1763) is worth about $79.56 (U. S.
1991). Accounting for the 12% inflation of the U. S. dollar between
1991 and 1995 (when amici filed their brief), see Economic
Indicators, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 23 (Feb. 1996), 1 (Eng. 1763)
is worth about $89.11 (U. S. 1995).

Calculated another way, 1 (Eng. 1763) is worth about 72.84 (Eng.
1991). See McCusker, supra, at 312, 342, 350. And 1 (Eng. 1991)
is worth $1.77 (U. S. 1991). See 78 Fed. Reserve Bulletin A68
(Feb. 1992). Thus, 1 (Eng. 1763) amounts to about $128.93 (U. S.
1991). Again, accounting for inflation between 1991 and 1995, this
amounts to about $144.40 (U. S. 1995).

Thus, the above sources suggest that the 1,000 award in Wilkes in
1763 roughly amounts to between $89,110 and $144,440 today, not
$1.5 million. And the 300 award in Huckle that same year would
seem to be worth between $26,733 and $43,320 today, not
$450,000.

For the period of the Hewlett and Merest decisions, 1 (Eng. 1813) is
worth about 25.3 (Eng. 1991). See McCusker, supra, at 344, 350.
Using the 1991 exchange rate, 1 (Eng. 1813) is worth about $44.78
(U. S. 1991). Accounting for inflation between 1991 and 1995, this
amounts to about $50.16 (U. S. 1995).

Thus, the 2,000 and 500 awards in Hewlett and Merest would seem
to be closer to $100,320 and $25,080, respectively, than to amici's
estimates of $680,000 and $165,000.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-896


BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC.,
PETITIONER

v.

IRA GORE, JR.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALABAMA

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.

Today we see the latest manifestation of this Court's recent and
increasingly insistent "concern about punitive damages that `run
wild.'" Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 18
(1991). Since the Constitution does not make that concern any of
our business, the Court's activities in this area are an unjustified
incursion into the province of state governments.

In earlier cases that were the prelude to this decision, I set forth my
view that a state trial procedure that commits the decision whether to
impose punitive damages, and the amount, to the discretion of the
jury, subject to some judicial review for "reasonableness," furnishes
a defendant with all the process that is "due." See TXO Production
Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 470 (1993)
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Haslip, supra, at 25-28
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Honda Motor Co. v.
Oberg, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 1-2) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring). I do not regard the Fourteenth Amendment's Due
Process Clause as a secret repository of substantive guarantees
against "unfairness"--neither the unfairness of an excessive civil
compensatory award, nor the unfairness of an "unreasonable"
punitive award. What the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural
guarantee assures is an opportunity to contest the reasonableness of a
damages judgment in state court; but there is no federal guarantee a
damages award actually be reasonable. See TXO, supra, at 471
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).

This view, which adheres to the text of the Due Process Clause, has
not prevailed in our punitive-damages cases. See TXO Production
Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S., at 453-462 (plurality
opinion); id., at 478-481 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Haslip,
supra, at 18. When, however, a constitutional doctrine adopted by
the Court is not only mistaken but also insusceptible of principled
application, I do not feel bound to give it stare decisis effect--indeed,
I do not feel justified in doing so. See, e.g., Witte v. United States,
515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment);
Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 673 (1990) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Our punitive-
damages jurisprudence compels such a response. The Constitution
provides no warrant for federalizing yet another aspect of our
Nation's legal culture (no matter how much in need of correction it
may be), and the application of the Court's new rule of constitutional
law is constrained by no principle other than the Justices' subjective
assessment of the "reasonableness" of the award in relation to the
conduct for which it was assessed.

Because today's judgment represents the first instance of this Court's
invalidation of a state-court punitive assessment as simply
unreasonably large, I think it a proper occasion to discuss these
points at some length.


The most significant aspects of today's decision--the identification of
a "substantive due process" right against a "grossly excessive"
award, and the concomitant assumption of ultimate authority to
decide anew a matter of "reasonableness" resolved in lower court
proceedings--are of course not new. Haslip and TXO revived the
notion, moribund since its appearance in the first years of this
century, that the measure of civil punishment poses a question of
constitutional dimension to be answered by this Court. Neither of
those cases, however, nor any of the precedents upon which they
relied, actually took the step of declaring a punitive award
unconstitutional simply because it was "too big."

At the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was well
understood that punitive damages represent the assessment by the
jury, as the voice of the community, of the measure of punishment
the defendant deserved. See, e.g., Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S.
550, 565 (1886); Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Humes, 115 U. S. 512,
521 (1885); Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852). See
generally Haslip, supra, at 25-27 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment). Today's decision, though dressed up as a legal opinion,
is really no more than a disagreement with the community's sense of
indignation or outrage expressed in the punitive award of the
Alabama jury, as reduced by the State Supreme Court. It reflects not
merely, as the concurrence candidly acknowledges, "a judgment
about a matter of degree," ante, at 12; but a judgment about the
appropriate degree of indignation or outrage, which is hardly an
analytical determination.

There is no precedential warrant for giving our judgment priority
over the judgment of state courts and juries on this matter. The only
support for the Court's position is to be found in a handful of errant
federal cases, bunched within a few years of one other, which
invented the notion that an unfairly severe civil sanction amounts to a
violation of constitutional liberties. These were the decisions upon
which the TXO plurality relied in pronouncing that the Due Process
Clause "imposes substantive limits `beyond which penalties may not
go,'" 509 U. S., at 454 (quoting Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v.
Seegers, 207 U. S. 73, 78 (1907)); see also 509 U. S., at 478-481
(O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18. Although
they are our precedents, they are themselves too shallowly rooted to
justify the Court's recent undertaking. The only case relied upon in
which the Court actually invalidated a civil sanction does not even
support constitutional review for excessiveness, since it really
concerned the validity, as a matter of procedural due process, of state
legislation that imposed a significant penalty on a common carrier
which lacked the means of determining the legality of its actions
before the penalty was imposed. See Southwestern Telegraph &
Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238 U. S. 482, 489-491 (1915). The
amount of the penalty was not a subject of independent scrutiny. As
for the remaining cases, while the opinions do consider arguments
that statutory penalties can, by reason of their excessiveness, violate
due process, not a single one of these judgments invalidates a
damages award. See Seaboard, supra, at 78-79; Waters-Pierce Oil
Co. v. Texas (No. 1), 212 U. S. 86, 111-112 (1909); Standard Oil
Co. of Ind. v. Missouri, 224 U. S. 270, 286, 290 (1912); St. Louis,
I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Williams, 251 U. S. 63, 66-67 (1919).

More importantly, this latter group of cases--which again are the sole
precedential foundation put forward for the rule of constitutional law
espoused by today's Court--simply fabricated the "substantive due
process" right at issue. Seaboard assigned no precedent to its bald
assertion that the Constitution imposes "limits beyond which
penalties may not go," 207 U. S., at 78. Waters-Pierce cited only
Coffey v. County of Harlan, 204 U. S. 659 (1907), a case which
inquired into the constitutionality of state procedure, id., at 662-663.
Standard Oil simply cited Waters-Pierce, and St. Louis, I. M. & S.
R. Co. offered in addition to these cases only Collins v. Johnston,
237 U. S. 502 (1915), which said nothing to support the notion of a
"substantive due process" right against excessive civil penalties, but
to the contrary asserted that the prescribing and imposing of criminal
punishment were "functions peculiarly belonging to the several
States," id., at 509-510. Thus, the only authority for the Court's
position is simply not authoritative. These cases fall far short of
what is needed to supplant this country's longstanding practice
regarding exemplary awards, see, e.g., Haslip, 499 U. S., at 15-18;
id., at 25-28 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).


One might understand the Court's eagerness to enter this field, rather
than leave it with the state legislatures, if it had something useful to
say. In fact, however, its opinion provides virtually no guidance to
legislatures, and to state and federal courts, as to what a
"constitutionally proper" level of punitive damages might be.

We are instructed at the outset of Part II of the Court's opinion--the
beginning of its substantive analysis--that "the federal excessiveness
inquiry . . . begins with an identification of the state interests that a
punitive award is designed to serve."  Ante, at 7. On first reading
this, one is faced with the prospect that federal punitive-damages law
(the new field created by today's decision) will be beset by the sort of
"interest analysis" that has laid waste the formerly comprehensible
field of conflict of laws. The thought that each assessment of
punitive damages, as to each offense, must be examined to determine
the precise "state interests" pursued, is most unsettling. Moreover, if
those "interests" are the most fundamental determinant of an award,
one would think that due process would require the assessing jury to
be instructed about them.

It appears, however (and I certainly hope), that all this is a false
alarm. As Part II of the Court's opinion unfolds, it turns out to be
directed, not to the question "How much punishment is too much?"
but rather to the question "Which acts can be punished?"  "Alabama
does not have the power," the Court says, "to punish BMW for
conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on
Alabama or its residents."  Ante, at 12. That may be true, though
only in the narrow sense that a person cannot be held liable to be
punished on the basis of a lawful act. But if a person has been held
subject to punishment because he committed an unlawful act, the
degree of his punishment assuredly can be increased on the basis of
any other conduct of his that displays his wickedness, unlawful or
not. Criminal sentences can be computed, we have said, on the basis
of "information concerning every aspect of a defendant's life,"
Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 250-252 (1949). The Court
at one point seems to acknowledge this, observing that, although a
sentencing court "[cannot] properly punish lawful conduct," it may in
assessing the penalty "consider . . . lawful conduct that bears on the
defendant's character."  Ante, at 12, n. 19. That concession is quite
incompatible, however, with the later assertion that, since "neither
the jury nor the trial court was presented with evidence that any of
BMW's out-of-state conduct was unlawful," the Alabama Supreme
Court "therefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW's out-of-state
conduct, . . . and based its remitted award solely on conduct that
occurred within Alabama."  Ante, at 13. Why could the Supreme
Court of Alabama not consider lawful (but disreputable) conduct,
both inside and outside Alabama, for the purpose of assessing just
how bad an actor BMW was?

The Court follows up its statement that "Alabama does not have the
power . . . to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it
occurred" with the statement: "Nor may Alabama impose sanctions
on BMW in order to deter conduct that is lawful in other
jurisdictions."  Ante, at 12. The Court provides us no citation of
authority to support this proposition--other than the barely analogous
cases cited earlier in the opinion, see ante, at 10-11--and I know of
none.

These significant issues pronounced upon by the Court are not
remotely presented for resolution in the present case. There is no
basis for believing that Alabama has sought to control conduct
elsewhere. The statutes at issue merely permit civil juries to treat
conduct such as petitioner's as fraud, and authorize an award of
appropriate punitive damages in the event the fraud is found to be
"gross, oppressive, or malicious," Ala. Code Section 6-11-20(b)(1)
(1993). To be sure, respondent did invite the jury to consider out-of-
state conduct in its calculation of damages, but any increase in the
jury's initial award based on that consideration is not a component of
the remitted judgment before us. As the Court several times
recognizes, in computing the amount of the remitted award the
Alabama Supreme Court--whether it was constitutionally required to
or not--"expressly disclaimed any reliance on acts that occurred in
other jurisdictions." Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted); see
also ante, at 13.*  Thus, the only question presented by this case is
whether that award, limited to petitioner's Alabama conduct and
viewed in light of the factors identified as properly informing the
inquiry, is excessive. The Court's sweeping (and largely
unsupported) statements regarding the relationship of punitive
awards to lawful or unlawful out-of-state conduct are the purest
dicta.


In Part III of its opinion, the Court identifies "[t]hree guideposts" that
lead it to the conclusion that the award in this case is excessive:
degree of reprehensibility, ratio between punitive award and
plaintiff's actual harm, and legislative sanctions provided for
comparable misconduct. Ante, at 14-25. The legal significance of
these "guideposts" is nowhere explored, but their necessary effect is
to establish federal standards governing the hitherto exclusively state
law of damages. Apparently (though it is by no means clear) all three
federal "guideposts" can be overridden if "necessary to deter future
misconduct," ante, at 25--a loophole that will encourage state
reviewing courts to uphold awards as necessary for the "adequat[e]
protect[ion]" of state consumers, ibid. By effectively requiring state
reviewing courts to concoct rationalizations--whether within the
"guideposts" or through the loophole--to justify the intuitive punitive
reactions of state juries, the Court accords neither category of
institution the respect it deserves.

Of course it will not be easy for the States to comply with this new
federal law of damages, no matter how willing they are to do so. In
truth, the "guideposts" mark a road to nowhere; they provide no real
guidance at all. As to "degree of reprehensibility" of the defendant's
conduct, we learn that "`nonviolent crimes are less serious than
crimes marked by violence or the threat of violence,'" ante, at 15
(quoting Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 292-293 (1983)), and that
"`trickery and deceit'" are "more reprehensible than negligence,"
ante, at 15. As to the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, we
are told that a "`general concer[n] of reasonableness . . . enter[s] into
the constitutional calculus,'" ante, at 23 (quoting TXO, supra, at
458)--though even "a breathtaking 500 to 1" will not necessarily do
anything more than "`raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow,'" ante, at
23 (quoting TXO, supra, at 481 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), an
opinion which, when confronted with that "breathtaking" ratio,
approved it). And as to legislative sanctions provided for comparable
misconduct, they should be accorded "`substantial deference,'" ibid.
(quoting Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 301 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part)). One expects the Court to conclude: "To thine
own self be true."

These criss-crossing platitudes yield no real answers in no real cases.
And it must be noted that the Court nowhere says that these three
"guideposts" are the only guideposts; indeed, it makes very clear that
they are not--explaining away the earlier opinions that do not really
follow these "guideposts" on the basis of additional factors, thereby
"reiterat[ing] our rejection of a categorical approach."  Ante, at 23.
In other words, even these utter platitudes, if they should ever
happen to produce an answer, may be overridden by other unnamed
considerations. The Court has constructed a framework that does not
genuinely constrain, that does not inform state legislatures and lower
courts--that does nothing at all except confer an artificial air of
doctrinal analysis upon its essentially ad hoc determination that this
particular award of punitive damages was not "fair."

The Court distinguishes today's result from Haslip and TXO partly
on the ground that "the record in this case discloses no deliberate
false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of
evidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslip and
TXO." Ante, at 19. This seemingly rejects the findings necessarily
made by the jury--that petitioner had committed a fraud that was
"gross, oppressive, or malicious," Ala. Code Section 6-11-20(b)(1)
(1996). Perhaps that rejection is intentional; the Court does not say.

The relationship between judicial application of the new "guideposts"
and jury findings poses a real problem for the Court, since as a
matter of logic there is no more justification for ignoring the jury's
determination as to how reprehensible petitioner's conduct was (i.e.,
how much it deserves to be punished), than there is for ignoring its
determination that it was reprehensible at all (i.e., that the wrong was
willful and punitive damages are therefore recoverable). That the
issue has been framed in terms of a constitutional right against
unreasonably excessive awards should not obscure the fact that the
logical and necessary consequence of the Court's approach is the
recognition of a constitutional right against unreasonably imposed
awards as well. The elevation of "fairness" in punishment to a
principle of "substantive due process" means that every punitive
award unreasonably imposed is unconstitutional; such an award is by
definition excessive, since it attaches a penalty to conduct
undeserving of punishment. Indeed, if the Court is correct, it must
be that every claim that a state jury's award of compensatory
damages is "unreasonable" (because not supported by the evidence)
amounts to an assertion of constitutional injury. See TXO, supra, at
471 (SCALIA, J. concurring in judgment). And the same would be
true for determinations of liability. By today's logic, every dispute as
to evidentiary sufficiency in a state civil suit poses a question of
constitutional moment, subject to review in this Court. That is a
stupefying proposition.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

*The Alabama Supreme Court said:

"[W]e must conclude that the award of punitive damages was based
in large part on conduct that happened in other jurisdictions. . . .
Although evidence of similar acts in other jurisdictions is admissible
as to the issue of `pattern and practice' of such acts, . . . this jury
could not use the number of similar acts that a defendant has
committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the
dollar amount of a punitive damages award. Such evidence may not
be considered in setting the size of the civil penalty, because neither
the jury nor the trial court had evidence before it showing in which
states the conduct was wrongful."  646 So. 2d 619, 627 (1994).

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-896


BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC.,
PETITIONER

v.

IRA GORE, JR.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALABAMA

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
dissenting.

The Court, I am convinced, unnecessarily and unwisely ventures into
territory traditionally within the States' domain, and does so in the
face of reform measures recently adopted or currently under
consideration in legislative arenas. The Alabama Supreme Court, in
this case, endeavored to follow this Court's prior instructions; and,
more recently, Alabama's highest court has installed further controls
on awards of punitive damages (see infra, at 8, n. 6). I would
therefore leave the state court's judgment undisturbed, and resist
unnecessary intrusion into an area dominantly of state concern.


The respect due the Alabama Supreme Court requires that we strip
from this case a false issue: no impermissible "extraterritoriality"
infects the judgment before us; the excessiveness of the award is the
sole issue genuinely presented. The Court ultimately so recognizes,
see ante, at 12-13, but further clarification is in order.

Dr. Gore's experience was not unprecedented among customers who
bought BMW vehicles sold as flawless and brand-new. In addition
to his own encounter, Gore showed, through paint repair orders
introduced at trial,

that on 983 other occasions since 1983, BMW had shipped new
vehicles to dealers without disclosing paint repairs costing at least
$300, Tr. 585-586; at least 14 of the repainted vehicles, the evidence
also showed, were sold as new and undamaged to consumers in
Alabama. 646 So. 2d 619, 623 (Ala. 1994). Sales nationwide,
Alabama's Supreme Court said, were admissible "as to the issue of a
`pattern and practice' of such acts."  Id., at 627. There was "no
error," the court reiterated, "in the admission of the evidence that
showed how pervasive the nondisclosure policy was and the intent
behind BMW NA's adoption of it."  Id., at 628. That determination
comports with this Court's expositions. See TXO Production Corp.
v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 462, and n. 28 (1993)
(characterizing as "well-settled" the admissibility of "evidence of
[defendant's] alleged wrongdoing in other parts of the country" and
of defendant's "wealth"); see also Brief for Petitioner 22 (recognizing
that similar acts, out-of-state, traditionally have been considered
relevant "for the limited purpose of determining that the conduct
before the [c]ourt was reprehensible because it was part of a pattern
rather than an isolated incident").

Alabama's highest court next declared that the "jury could not use the
number of similar acts that a defendant has committed in other
jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a
punitive damages award. Such evidence may not be considered in
setting the size of the civil penalty, because neither the jury nor the
trial court had evidence before it showing in which states the conduct
was wrongful."  646 So. 2d, at 627 (emphasis in original) (footnote
omitted).

Because the Alabama Supreme Court provided this clear statement of
the State's law, the multiplier problem encountered in Gore's case is
not likely to occur again. Now, as a matter of Alabama law, it is
plainly impermissible to assess punitive damages by multiplication
based on out-of-state events not shown to be unlawful. See, e.g.,
Independent Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Harrington, 658 So. 2d
892, 902-903 (Ala. 1994) (under BMW v. Gore, trial court erred in
relying on defendant insurance company's out-of-state insurance
policies in determining harm caused by defendant's unlawful
actions).


No Alabama authority, it bears emphasis--no statute, judicial
decision, or trial judge instruction--ever countenanced the jury's
multiplication of the $4,000 diminution in value estimated for each
refinished car by the number of such cars (approximately 1,000)
shown to have been sold nationwide. The sole prompt to the jury to
use nationwide sales as a multiplier came from Gore's lawyer during
summation. App. 31, Tr. 812-813. Notably, counsel for BMW
failed to object to Gore's multiplication suggestion, even though
BMW's counsel interrupted to make unrelated objections four other
times during Gore's closing statement. Tr. 810-811, 854-855, 858,
870-871. Nor did BMW's counsel request a charge instructing the
jury not to consider out-of-state sales in calculating the punitive
damages award. See Record 513-529 (listing all charges requested
by counsel).

Following the verdict, BMW's counsel challenged the admission of
the paint repair orders, but not, alternately, the jury's apparent use of
the orders in a multiplication exercise. Curiously, during postverdict
argument, BMW's counsel urged that if the repair orders were indeed
admissible, then Gore would have a "full right" to suggest a
multiplier-based disgorgement. Tr. 932.

In brief, Gore's case is idiosyncratic. The jury's improper
multiplication, tardily featured by petitioner, is unlikely to recur in
Alabama and does not call for error correction by this Court.

Because the jury apparently (and erroneously) had used acts in other
states as a multiplier to arrive at a $4 million sum for punitive
damages, the Alabama Supreme Court itself determined "'the
maximum amount that a properly functioning jury could have
awarded.'"  646 So. 2d, at 630 (Houston, J., concurring specially)
(quoting Big B, Inc. v. Cottingham, 634 So. 2d 999, 1006 (Ala.
1993)). The per curiam opinion emphasized that in arriving at $2
million as "the amount of punitive damages to be awarded in this
case, [the court did] not consider those acts that occurred in other
jurisdictions." 646 So. 2d, at 628 (emphasis in original). As this
Court recognizes, the Alabama high court "properly eschewed
reliance on BMW's out-of-state conduct and based its remitted award
solely on conduct that occurred within Alabama."  Ante, at 13
(citation omitted). In sum, the Alabama Supreme Court left standing
the jury's decision that the facts warranted an award of punitive
damages--a determination not contested in this Court--and the state
court concluded that, considering only acts in Alabama, $2 million
was "a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award."  646
So. 2d, at 629.



Alabama's Supreme Court reports that it "thoroughly and
painstakingly" reviewed the jury's award, ibid., according to
principles set out in its own pathmarking decisions and in this
Court's opinions in TXO and Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,
499 U. S. 1, 21 (1991). 646 So. 2d, at 621. The Alabama court said
it gave weight to several factors, including BMW's deliberate
("reprehensible") presentation of refinished cars as new and
undamaged, without disclosing that the value of those cars had been
reduced by an estimated 10%,1  the financial position of the
defendant, and the costs of litigation. Id., at 625-626. These
standards, we previously held, "impos[e] a sufficiently definite and
meaningful constraint on the discretion of Alabama factfinders in
awarding punitive damages."  Haslip, 499 U. S., at 22; see also
TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, n. 28. Alabama's highest court could have
displayed its labor pains more visibly,2  but its judgment is
nonetheless entitled to a presumption of legitimacy. See Rowan v.
Runnels, 5 How. 134, 139 (1847) ("[T]his court will always feel
itself bound to respect the decisions of the State courts, and from the
time they are made will regard them as conclusive in all cases upon
the construction of their own constitution and laws.").

We accept, of course, that Alabama's Supreme Court applied the
State's own law correctly. Under that law, the State's objectives--
"punishment and deterrence"--guide punitive damages awards. See
Birmingham v. Benson, 631 So. 2d 902, 904 (Ala. 1994). Nor
should we be quick to find a constitutional infirmity when the highest
state court endeavored a corrective for one counsel's slip and the
other's oversight--counsel for plaintiff's excess in summation,
unobjected to by counsel for defendant, see supra, at 3--and when
the state court did so intending to follow the process approved in our
Haslip and TXO decisions.


The Court finds Alabama's $2 million award not simply excessive,
but grossly so, and therefore unconstitutional. The decision leads us
further into territory traditionally within the States' domain,3  and
commits the Court, now and again, to correct "misapplication of a
properly stated rule of law."  But cf. S. Ct. Rule 10 ("A petition for a
writ of certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error consists of
erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of a properly stated
rule of law.").4   The Court is not well equipped for this mission.
Tellingly, the Court repeats that it brings to the task no "mathematical
formula," ante, at 22, no "categorical approach," ante, at 23, no
"bright line," ante, at 26. It has only a vague concept of substantive
due process, a "raised eyebrow" test, see ante, at 23, as its ultimate
guide.5

In contrast to habeas corpus review under 28 U. S. C. Section 2254,
the Court will work at this business alone. It will not be aided by the
federal district courts and courts of appeals. It will be the only
federal court policing the area. The Court's readiness to superintend
state court punitive damages awards is all the more puzzling in view
of the Court's longstanding reluctance to countenance review, even
by courts of appeals, of the size of verdicts returned by juries in
federal district court proceedings. See generally 11 C. Wright, A.
Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Section 2820 (2d
ed. 1995). And the reexamination prominent in state courts6 and in
legislative arenas, see Appendix, infra, at 9, serves to underscore
why the Court's enterprise is undue.

For the reasons stated, I dissent from this Court's disturbance of the
judgment the Alabama Supreme Court has made.


APPENDIX TO DISSENTING OPINION OF
GINSBURG, J.

STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY REGARDING
PUNITIVE DAMAGES

State legislatures have in the hopper or have enacted a variety of
measures to curtail awards of punitive damages. At least one state
legislature has prohibited punitive damages altogether, unless
explicitly provided by statute. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section
507:16 (1994). We set out in this appendix some of the several
controls enacted or under consideration in the States. The measures
surveyed are: (1) caps on awards; (2) provisions for payment of
sums to state agencies rather than to plaintiffs; and (3) mandatory
bifurcated trials with separate proceedings for punitive damages
determinations.

I. CAPS ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARDS

general, caps punitive damages at lesser of defendant's annual gross
income, or $5 million).

* Maryland--S. 187, 1995 Leg. Sess. (introduced Jan. 27, 1995) (in
general, would cap punitive damages at four times compensatory

punitive damages at greater of five times compensatory damages, or
$350,000, in certain tort cases).

* North Dakota--N. D. Cent. Code Section 32-03.2-11(4) (Supp.
1995) (caps punitive damages at greater of two times compensatory
damages, or $250,000).

* Oklahoma--Okla Stat., Tit. 23, Sections 9.1(B)-(D) (Supp. 1996)
(caps punitive damages at greater of $100,000, or actual damages, if
jury finds defendant guilty of reckless disregard; and at greatest of
$500,000, twice actual damages, or the benefit accruing to defendant
from the injury-causing conduct, if jury finds that defendant has
acted intentionally and maliciously).

ENDNOTES FOR OPINION

1 The top, hood, trunk, and quarter panels of Dr. Gore's car were
repainted at BMW's vehicle preparation center in Brunswick,
Georgia. The parties presumed that the damage was caused by
exposure to acid rain during transit between the manufacturing plant
in Germany and the preparation center.

2 Dr. Gore also named the German manufacturer and the
Birmingham dealership as defendants.

3 Alabama codified its common-law cause of action for fraud in a
1907 statute that is still in effect. Hackmeyer v. Hackmeyer, 268
Ala. 329, 333, 106 So. 2d 245, 249 (Ala. 1958). The statute
provides: "Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an
obligation to communicate constitutes fraud. The obligation to
communicate may arise from the confidential relations of the parties
or from the particular circumstances of the case."  Ala. Code Section
6-5-102 (1993); see Ala. Code Section 4299 (1907).

4 The dealer who testified to the reduction in value is the former
owner of the Birmingham dealership sued in this action. He sold the
dealership approximately one year before the trial.

5 Dr. Gore did not explain the significance of the $300 cut-off.

6 The jury also found the Birmingham dealership liable for Dr.
Gore's compensatory damages and the German manufacturer liable
for both the compensatory and punitive damages. The dealership did
not appeal the judgment against it. The Alabama Supreme Court held
that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the German
manufacturer and therefore reversed the judgment against that
defendant.

7 BMW acknowledged that a Georgia statute enacted after Dr. Gore
purchased his car would require disclosure of similar repairs to a car
before it was sold in Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. Sections 40-1-5(b)-(e)
(1994).

8 While awarding a comparable amount of compensatory damages,
the Yates jury awarded no punitive damages at all. In Yates, the
plaintiff also relied on the 1983 nondisclosure policy, but instead of
offering evidence of 983 repairs costing more than $300 each, he
introduced a bulk exhibit containing 5,856 repair bills to show that
petitioner had sold over 5,800 new BMW vehicles without disclosing
that they had been repaired.

9 Prior to the lawsuits filed by Dr. Yates and Dr. Gore, BMW and
various BMW dealers had been sued 14 times concerning presale
paint or damage repair. According to the testimony of BMW's in-
house counsel at the postjudgment hearing on damages, only one of
the suits concerned a car repainted by BMW.

10 The Alabama Supreme Court did not indicate whether the $2
million figure represented the court's independent assessment of the
appropriate level of punitive damages, or its determination of the
maximum amount that the jury could have awarded consistent with
the Due Process Clause.

11 Other than Yates v. BMW of North America, Inc., 642 So. 2d
937 (Ala. 1993), in which no punitive damages were awarded, the
Alabama Supreme Court cited no such cases. In another portion of
its opinion, 646 So. 2d, at 629, the court did cite five Alabama cases,
none of which involved either a dispute arising out of the purchase of
an automobile or an award of punitive damages. G. M. Mosley
Contractors, Inc. v. Phillips, 487 So. 2d 876, 879 (Ala. 1986);
Hollis v. Wyrosdick, 508 So. 2d 704 (Ala. 1987); Campbell v.
Burns, 512 So. 2d 1341, 1343 (Ala. 1987); Ashbee v. Brock, 510
So. 2d 214 (Ala. 1987); and Jawad v. Granade, 497 So. 2d 471
(Ala. 1986). All of these cases support the proposition that appellate
courts in Alabama presume that jury verdicts are correct. In light of
the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (1) the jury had
computed its award by multiplying $4,000 by the number of
refinished vehicles sold in the United States and (2) that the award
should have been based on Alabama conduct, respect for the error-
free portion of the jury verdict would seem to produce an award of
$56,000 ($4,000 multiplied by 14, the number of repainted vehicles
sold in Alabama).

12 See, e.g., Rivers v. BMW of North America, Inc., 214 Ga. App.
880, 449 S. E. 2d 337 (1994) (nondisclosure of presale paint repairs
that occurred before state disclosure statute enacted); Wedmore v.
Jordan Motors, Inc., 589 N. E. 2d 1180 (Ind. App. 1992) (same).

13 Four States require disclosure of vehicle repairs costing more than
3 percent of suggested retail price. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 28-
1304.03 (1989); N. C. Gen. Stat. Section 20-305.1(d)(5a) (1995);
S. C. Code Section 56-32-20 (Supp. 1995); Va. Code Ann. Section
46.2-1571(D) (Supp. 1995). An additional three States mandate
disclosure when the cost of repairs exceeds 3 percent or $500,
whichever is greater. Ala. Code Section 8-19-5(22)(c) (1993); Cal.
Veh. Code Ann. Sections 9990-9991 (West Supp. 1996); Okla.
Stat., Tit. 47, Section 1112.1 (1991). Indiana imposes a 4 percent
disclosure threshold. Ind. Code Sections 9-23-4-4, 9-23-4-5
(1993). Minnesota requires disclosure of repairs costing more than 4
percent of suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater.
Minn. Stat. Section 325F.664 (1994). New York requires
disclosure when the cost of repairs exceeds 5 percent of suggested
retail price. N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law Sections 396-p(5)(a), (d)
(McKinney Supp. 1996). Vermont imposes a 5 percent disclosure
threshold for the first $10,000 in repair costs and 2 percent
thereafter. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 9, Section 4087(d) (1993). Eleven
States mandate disclosure only of damage costing more than 6
percent of retail value to repair. Ark. Code Ann. Section 23-112-705
(1992); Idaho Code Section 49-1624 (1994); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.
815, Section 710/5 (1994); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section
190.0491(5) (Baldwin 1988); La. Rev. Stat. Ann Section 32:1260
(Supp. 1995); Miss. Motor Vehicle Comm'n, Regulation No. 1
(1992); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 357-C:5(III)(d) (1995); Ohio
Rev. Code Ann. Section 4517.61 (1994); R. I. Gen. Laws Sections
31-5.1-18(d), (f) (1995); Wis. Stat. Section 218.01(2d)(a) (1994);
Wyo. Stat. Section 31-16-115 (1994). Two States require disclosure
of repairs costing $3,000 or more. See Iowa Code Ann. Section
321.69 (Supp. 1996); N. D. Admin. Code Section 37-09-01-01
(1992). Georgia mandates disclosure of paint damage that costs more
than $500 to repair. Ga. Code Ann. Sections 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994)
(enacted after respondent purchased his car). Florida requires dealers
to disclose paint repair costing more than $100 of which they have
actual knowledge. Fla. Stat. Section 320.27(9)(n) (1992). Oregon
requires manufacturers to disclose all "post-manufacturing" damage
and repairs. It is unclear whether this mandate would apply to
repairs such as those at issue here. Ore. Rev. Stat. Section 650.155
(1991).

Many, but not all, of the statutes exclude from the computation of
repair cost the value of certain components--typically items such as
glass, tires, wheels and bumpers--when they are replaced with
identical manufacturer's original equipment. E.g., Cal. Veh. Code
Ann. Sections 9990-9991 (West Supp. 1996); Ga. Code Ann.
Sections 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, Section
710/5 (1994); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 190.0491(5) (Baldwin
1988); Okla. Stat., Tit. 47, Section 1112.1 (1991); Va. Code Ann.
Section 46.2-1571(D) (Supp. 1995); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 9, Section
4087(d) (1993).

14 Also, a state legislature might plausibly conclude that the
administrative costs associated with full disclosure would have the
effect of raising car prices to the State's residents.

15 Federal disclosure requirements are, of course, a familiar part of
our law. See, e.g., the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
added by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, 104
Stat. 2353, 21 U. S. C. Section 343; the Truth In Lending Act, 82
Stat. 148, as amended, 15 U. S. C. Section 1604; the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 892, 894, as amended, 15 U. S. C.
Sections 78l-78m; Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act,
79 Stat. 283, as amended, 15 U. S. C. Section 1333; Alcoholic
Beverage Labeling Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 4519, 27 U. S. C. Section
215.

16 See also Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 824 (1975) ("A
State does not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs
of another State merely because the welfare and health of its own
citizens may be affected when they travel to that State"); New York
Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U. S. 149, 161 (1914) ("[I]t would be
impossible to permit the statutes of Missouri to operate beyond the
jurisdiction of that State . . . without throwing down the
constitutional barriers by which all the States are restricted within the
orbits of their lawful authority and upon the preservation of which
the Government under the Constitution depends. This is so
obviously the necessary result of the Constitution that it has rarely
been called in question and hence authorities directly dealing with it
do not abound"); Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 669 (1892)
("Laws have no force of themselves beyond the jurisdiction of the
State which enacts them, and can have extra-territorial effect only by
the comity of other States").

17 State power may be exercised as much by a jury's application of a
state rule of law in a civil lawsuit as by a statute. See New York Co.
Times v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 265 (1964) ("The test is not the
form in which state power has been applied but, whatever the form,
whether such power has in fact been exercised"); San Diego Building
Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959) ("regulation
can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through
some form of preventive relief").

18 Brief for Respondent 11-12, 23, 27-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-54.
Dr. Gore's interest in altering the nationwide policy stems from his
concern that BMW would not (or could not) discontinue the policy in
Alabama alone. Id., at 11. "If Alabama were limited to imposing
punitive damages based only on BMW's gain from fraudulent sales
in Alabama, the resulting award would have no prospect of
protecting Alabama consumers from fraud, as it would provide no
incentive for BMW to alter the unitary, national policy of
nondisclosure which yielded BMW millions of dollars in profits."
Id., at 23. The record discloses no basis for Dr. Gore's contention
that BMW could not comply with Alabama's law without changing
its nationwide policy.

19 See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 363 (1978) ("To
punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him
to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort"). Our cases
concerning recidivist statutes are not to the contrary. Habitual
offender statutes permit the sentencing court to enhance a defendant's
punishment for a crime in light of prior convictions, including
convictions in foreign jurisdictions. See e.g., Ala. Code Section
13A-5-9 (1994); Cal. Penal Code Ann. Sections 667.5(f), 668 (West
Supp. 1996); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, Section 5/33B-1 (1994); N.
Y. Penal Law Sections 70.04, 70.06, 70.08, 70.10 (McKinney 1987
and Supp. 1996); Tex. Penal Code Ann. Section 12.42 (1994 and
Supp. 1995-1996). A sentencing judge may even consider past
criminal behavior which did not result in a conviction and lawful
conduct that bears on the defendant's character and prospects for
rehabilitation. Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949). But
we have never held that a sentencing court could properly punish
lawful conduct. This distinction is precisely the one we draw here.
See n. 21, infra.

20 Given that the verdict was based in part on out-of-state conduct
that was lawful where it occurred, we need not consider whether one
State may properly attempt to change a tortfeasors' unlawful conduct
in another State.

21 Of course, the fact that the Alabama Supreme Court correctly
concluded that it was error for the jury to use the number of sales in
other States as a multiplier in computing the amount of its punitive
sanction does not mean that evidence describing out-of-state
transactions is irrelevant in a case of this kind. To the contrary, as
we stated in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,
509 U. S. 443, 462, n. 28 (1993), and discuss more fully infra, at
16-19, such evidence is relevant to the determination of the degree of
reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.

22 See Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987) (Ex Post Facto
Clause violated by retroactive imposition of revised sentencing
guidelines that provided longer sentence for defendant's crime);
Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964) (retroactive
application of new construction of statute violated due process); id.,
at 350-355 (citing cases); Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S. 110 (1991)
(due process violated because defendant and his counsel did not have
adequate notice that judge might impose death sentence). The strict
constitutional safeguards afforded to criminal defendants are not
applicable to civil cases, but the basic protection against "judgments
without notice" afforded by the Due Process Clause, Shaffer v.
Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 217 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in
judgment), is implicated by civil penalties.

23 "The flagrancy of the misconduct is thought to be the primary
consideration in determining the amount of punitive damages."
Owen, A Punitive Damages Overview: Functions, Problems and
Reform, 39 Vill. L. Rev. 363, 387 (1994).

24 The principle that punishment should fit the crime "is deeply
rooted and frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence."
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 284 (1983). See Burkett v. Lanata,
15 La. Ann. 337, 339 (1860) (punitive damages should be
"commensurate to the nature of the offence"); Blanchard v. Morris,
15 Ill. 35, 36 (1853) ("[W]e cannot say [the exemplary damages] are
excessive under the circumstances; for the proofs show that threats,
violence, and imprisonment, were accompanied by mental fear,
torture, and agony of mind"); Louisville & Northern R. Co. v.
Brown, 127 Ky. 732, 749, 106 S. W. 795, 799 (1908) ("We are not
aware of any case in which the court has sustained a verdict as large
as this one unless the injuries were permanent").

25 Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 22 (1991).

26 The dissenters also recognized that "TXO's conduct was clearly
wrongful, calculated, and improper . . . ." TXO, 509 U. S., at 482
(O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).

27 In Jeter v. M & M Dodge, Inc., 634 So. 2d 1383 (La. App.
1994), a Louisiana court of appeals suggested that the Louisiana
disclosure statute functions as a safe harbor. Finding that the cost of
repairing presale damage to the plaintiff's car exceeded the statutory
disclosure threshold, the court held that the disclosure statute did not
provide a defense to the action. Id., at 1384.

During the pendency of this litigation, Alabama enacted a disclosure
statute which defines "material" damage to a new car as damage
requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of suggested retail
price or $500, whichever is greater. Ala. Code Section 8-19-5(22)
(1993). After its decision in this case, the Alabama Supreme Court
stated in dicta that the remedies available under this section of its
Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not displace or alter pre-existing
remedies available under either the common law or other statutes.
Hines v. Riverside Chevrolet-Olds, Inc., 655 So. 2d 909, 917, n. 2
(Ala. 1994). It refused, however, to "recognize, or impose on
automobile manufacturers, a general duty to disclose every repair of
damage, however slight, incurred during the manufacturing
process."  Id., at 921. Instead, it held that whether a defendant has a
duty to disclose is a question of fact "for the jury to determine."  Id.,
at 918. In reaching that conclusion it overruled two earlier decisions
that seemed to indicate that as a matter of law there was no disclosure
obligation in cases comparable to this one. Id., at 920 (overruling
Century 21-Reeves Realty, Inc. v. McConnell Cadillac, Inc., 626
So. 2d 1273 (Ala. 1993), and Cobb v. Southeast Toyota
Distributors, Inc., 569 So. 2d 395 (Ala. 1990)).

28 See also Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 28-1304.03 (1989) ("[I]f
disclosure is not required under this section, a purchaser may not
revoke or rescind a sales contract due solely to the fact that the new
motor vehicle was damaged and repaired prior to completion of the
sale"); Ind. Code Section 9-23-4-5 (1993) (providing that "[r]epaired
damage to a customer-ordered new motor vehicle not exceeding four
percent (4%) of the manufacturer's suggested retail price does not
need to be disclosed at the time of sale"); N. C. Gen. Stat. Section
20-305.1(e) (1993) (requiring disclosure of repairs costing more than
5 percent of suggested retail price and prohibiting revocation or
rescission of sales contract on the basis of less costly repairs); Okla.
Stat., Tit. 47, Section 1112.1 (1991) (defining "material" damage to
a car as damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of
suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater).

29 Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 538 (1977); W. Keeton,
D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of
Torts Section 108 (5th ed. 1984).

30 The Alabama Supreme Court has held that a car may be
considered "new" as a matter of law even if its finish contains minor
cosmetic flaws. Wilburn v. Larry Savage Chevrolet, Inc., 477 So.
2d 384 (Ala. 1985). We note also that at trial respondent only
introduced evidence of undisclosed paint damage to new cars
repaired at a cost of $300 or more. This decision suggests that
respondent believed that the jury might consider some repairs too de
minimis to warrant disclosure.

31 Before the verdict in this case, BMW had changed its policy with
respect to Alabama and two other States. Five days after the jury
award, BMW altered its nationwide policy to one of full disclosure.

32 See, e.g., Grant v. McDonogh, 7 La. Ann. 447, 448 (1852)
("[E]xemplary damages allowed should bear some proportion to the
real damage sustained"); Saunders v. Mullen, 66 Iowa 728, 729, 24
N. W. 529 (1885) ("When the actual damages are so small, the
amount allowed as exemplary damages should not be so large");
Flannery v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 15 D. C. 111, 125 (1885)
(when punitive damages award "is out of all proportion to the injuries
received, we feel it our duty to interfere"); Houston & Texas Central
R. Co. v. Nichols, 9 Am. & Eng. R. R. Cas. 361, 365 (Tex. 1882)
("Exemplary damages, when allowed, should bear proportion to the
actual damages sustained"); McCarthy v. Niskern, 22 Minn. 90, 91-
92 (1875) (punitive damages "enormously in excess of what may
justly be regarded as compensation" for the injury must be set aside
"to prevent injustice").

33 Owen, supra n. 23, at 368, and n. 23. One English statute, for
example, provides that officers arresting persons out of their
jurisdiction shall pay double damages. 3 Edw., I., ch. 35. Another
directs that in an action for forcible entry or detainer, the plaintiff
shall recover treble damages. 8 Hen. VI, ch. 9, Section 6.

Present-day federal law allows or mandates imposition of multiple
damages for a wide assortment of offenses, including violations of
the antitrust laws, see Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. Section 15, and the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, see 18 U. S. C. Section 1964, and
certain breaches of the trademark laws, see Section 35 of the
Trademark Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 439, as amended, 15 U. S. C.
Section 1117, and the patent laws, see 66 Stat. 813, 35 U. S. C.
Section 284.

34 "While petitioner stresses the shocking disparity between the
punitive award and the compensatory award, that shock dissipates
when one considers the potential loss to respondents, in terms of
reduced or eliminated royalties payments, had petitioner succeeded in
its illicit scheme. Thus, even if the actual value of the `potential harm'
to respondents is not between $5 million and $8.3 million, but is
closer to $4 million, or $2 million, or even $1 million, the disparity
between the punitive award and the potential harm does not, in our
view, `jar one's constitutional sensibilities.'"  TXO, 509 U. S., at
462, quoting Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18.

35 Even assuming each repainted BMW suffers a diminution in value
of approximately $4,000, the award is 35 times greater than the total
damages of all 14 Alabama consumers who purchased repainted
BMW's.

36 The ratio here is also dramatically greater than any award that
would be permissible under the statutes and proposed statutes
summarized in the appendix to JUSTICE GINSBURG's dissenting
opinion. Post, at 9-11.

37 Conceivably the Alabama Supreme Court's selection of a 500 to 1
ratio was an application of JUSTICE SCALIA's identification of one
possible reading of the plurality opinion in TXO: any future due
process challenge to a punitive damages award could be disposed of
with the simple observation that "this is no worse than TXO."  509
U. S., at 472 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As we explain
in the text, this award is significantly worse than the award in TXO.

38 Although the Court did not address the size of the punitive
damages award in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238
(1984), the dissenters commented on its excessive character, noting
that the "$10 million [punitive damages award] that the jury imposed
is 100 times greater than the maximum fine that may be imposed . . .
for a single violation of federal standards" and "more than 10 times
greater than the largest single fine that the Commission has ever
imposed."  Id., at 263 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). In New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), the Court observed
that the punitive award for libel was "one thousand times greater than
the maximum fine provided by the Alabama criminal statute," and
concluded that the "fear of damage awards under a rule such as that
invoked by the Alabama courts here may be markedly more inhibiting
than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute." Id., at 277.

39 Ala. Code Section 8-19-11(b) (1993).

40 See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. Section 23-112-309(b) (1992) (up to
$5,000 for violation of state Motor Vehicle Commission Act that
would allow suspension of dealer's license; up to $10,000 for
violation of Act that would allow revocation of dealer's license); Fla.
Stat. Section 320.27(12) (1992) (up to $1,000); Ga. Code Ann.
Sections 40-1-5(g), 10-1-397(a) (1994 and Supp. 1996) (up to
$2,000 administratively; up to $5,000 in superior court); Ind. Code
Ann. Section 9-23-6-4 (1993) ($50 to $1,000); N. H. Rev. Stat.
Ann. Sections 357-C:15, 651:2 (1995 and Supp. 1995) (corporate
fine of up to $20,000); N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law Section 396-p(6)
(McKinney Supp. 1995) ($50 for first offense; $250 for subsequent
offenses).

41 JUSTICE GINSBURG expresses concern that we are "the only
federal court policing" this limit. Post, at 7. The small number of
punitive damages questions that we have reviewed in recent years,
together with the fact that this is the first case in decades in which we
have found that a punitive damages award exceeds the constitutional
limit, indicates that this concern is at best premature. In any event,
this consideration surely does not justify an abdication of our
responsibility to enforce constitutional protections in an extraordinary
case such as this one.


ENDNOTES FOR APPENDIX TO DISSENT

1 According to trial testimony, in late May 1992, BMW began
redirecting refinished cars out of Alabama and two other States. Tr.
964. The jury returned its verdict in favor of Gore on June 12,
1992. Five days later, BMW changed its national policy to one of
full disclosure. Id., at 1026.

2 See, e.g., Brief for Law and Economics Scholars, et al. as Amici
Curiae 6-28 (economic analysis demonstrates that Alabama Supreme
Court's judgment was not unreasonable); W. Landes & R. Posner,
Economic Structure of Tort Law 160-163 (1987) (economic model
for assessing propriety of punitive damages in certain tort cases).

3 See ante, at 7 ("In our federal system, States necessarily have
considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages
that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular
case."); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 278 (1989) (In any "lawsuit where state law
provides the basis of decision, the propriety of an award of punitive
damages for the conduct in question, and the factors the jury may
consider in determining their amount, are questions of state law.");
Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 255 (1984)
("Punitive damages have long been a part of traditional state tort
law.").

4 Petitioner invites the Court to address the question of multiple
punitive damages awards stemming from the same alleged
misconduct. The Court does not take up the invitation, and rightly
so, in my judgment, for this case does not present the issue. For
three reasons, the question of multiple awards is hypothetical, not
real, in Gore's case. First, the punitive damages award in favor of
Gore is the only such award yet entered against BMW on account of
its nondisclosure policy.

Second, BMW did not raise the issue of multiple punitives below.
Indeed, in its reply brief before the Alabama Supreme Court, BMW
stated: "Gore confuses our point about fairness among plaintiffs. He
treats this point as a premature `multiple punitive damages' argument.
But, contrary to Gore's assertion, we are not asking this Court to
hold, as a matter of law, that a `constitutional violation occurs when a
defendant is subjected to punitive damages in two separate cases.'"
Reply Brief for Appellant in Nos. 1920324, 1920325 (Ala. Sup.
Ct.), p. 48 (internal citations omitted).

Third, if BMW had already suffered a punitive damages judgment in
connection with its nondisclosure policy, Alabama's highest court
presumably would have taken that fact into consideration. In
reviewing punitive damages awards attacked as excessive, the
Alabama Supreme Court considers whether "there have been other
civil actions against the same defendant, based on the same conduct."
646 So. 2d 619, 624 (1994) (quoting Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby,
539 So. 2d 218, 224 (Ala. 1989)). If so, "this should be taken into
account in mitigation of the punitive damages award."  Ibid. The
Alabama court accordingly observed that Gore's counsel had filed 24
other actions against BMW in Alabama and Georgia, but that no
other punitive damages award had so far resulted. Id., at 626.

5 Justice Breyer's concurring opinion offers nothing more solid.
Under Haslip, he acknowledges, Alabama's standards for punitive
damages, standing alone, do not violate due process. Ante, at 3.
But they "invit[e] the kind of scrutiny the Court has given the
particular verdict before us."  Ibid. Pursuing that invitation, Justice
Breyer concludes that, matching the particular facts of this case to
Alabama's "legitimate punitive damages objectives," ante, at 12, the
award was "grossly excessive."  Ibid. The exercise is engaging, but
ultimately tells us only this: too big will be judged unfair. What is
the Court's measure of too big? Not a cap of the kind a legislature
could order, or a mathematical test this Court can divine and impose.
Too big is, in the end, the amount at which five Members of the
Court bridle.


6 See, e.g., Distinctive Printing and Packaging Co. v. Cox, 232
Neb. 846, 857, 443 N. W. 2d 566, 574 (1989) (per curiam)
("[P]unitive, vindictive, or exemplary damages contravene Neb.
Const. art. VII, Section 5, and thus are not allowed in this
jurisdiction."); Santana v. Registrars of Voters of Worcester, 398
Mass. 862, 502 N. E. 2d 132 (1986) (punitive damages are not
permitted, unless expressly authorized by statute); Fisher Properties,
Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wash. 2d 826, 852, 726 P. 2d 8,
23 (1986) (en banc) (same).

In Life Ins. Co. of Georgia v. Johnson, No. 1940357 (Nov. 17,
1995), the Alabama Supreme Court revised the State's regime for
assessments of punitive damages. Henceforth, trials will be
bifurcated. Initially, juries will be instructed to determine liability
and the amount of compensatory damages, if any; also, the jury is to
return a special verdict on the question whether a punitive damages
award is warranted. If the jury answers yes to the punitive damages
question, the trial will be resumed for the presentation of evidence
and instructions relevant to the amount appropriate to award as
punitive damages.

After postverdict trial court review and subsequent appellate review,
the amount of the final punitive damages judgment will be paid into
the trial court. The trial court will then order payment of litigation
expenses, including the plaintiff's attorney fees, and instruct the clerk
to divide the remainder equally between the plaintiff and the State
General Fund. The provision for payment to the State General Fund
is applicable to all judgments not yet satisfied, and therefore would
apply to the judgment in Gore's case.

Syllabus


ROMER, GOVERNOR OF COLORADO, ET AL.

v.

EVANS ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
COLORADO

No. 94-1039.  Argued October 10, 1995-Decided May 20, 1996


After various Colorado municipalities passed ordinances banning
discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment,
education, public accommodations, health and welfare services, and
other transactions and activities, Colorado voters adopted by
statewide referendum "Amendment 2" to the State Constitution,
which precludes all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any
level of state or local government designed to protect the status of
persons based on their ``homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation,
conduct, practices or relationships.'' Respondents, who include
aggrieved homosexuals and municipalities, commenced this litigation
in state court against petitioner state parties to declare Amendment 2
invalid and enjoin its enforcement. The trial court's grant of a
preliminary injunction was sustained by the Colorado Supreme
Court, which held that Amendment 2 was subject to strict scrutiny
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
because it infringed the fundamental right of gays and lesbians to
participate in the political process. On remand, the trial court found
that the Amendment failed to satisfy strict scrutiny. It enjoined
Amendment 2's enforcement, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held:  Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 4-14.

(a) The State's principal argument that Amendment 2 puts gays and
lesbians in the same position as all other persons by denying them
special rights is rejected as implausible. The extent of the change in
legal status effected by this law is evident from the authoritative
construction of Colorado's Supreme Court--which establishes that
the amendment's immediate effect is to repeal all existing statutes,
regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities barring
discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that its ultimate effect
is to prohibit any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more
protective, measures in the future absent state constitutional
amendment--and from a review of the terms, structure, and operation
of the ordinances that would be repealsed and prohibited by
Amendment 2. Even if, as the State contends, homosexuals can find
protection in laws and policies of general application, Amendment 2
goes well beyond merely depriving them of special rights. It
imposes a broad disability upon those persons alone, forbidding
them, but no others, to seek specific legal protection from injuries
caused by discrimination in a wide range of public and private
transactions. Pp. 4-9.


(b) In order to reconcile the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that no
person shall be denied equal protection with the practical reality that
most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, the Court has
stated that it will uphold a law that neither burdens a fundamental
right nor targets a suspect class so long as the legislative
classification bears a rational relation to some independent and
legitimate legislative end. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312,
319-320. Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional
inquiry. First, the amendment is at once too narrow and too broad,
identifying persons by a single trait and then denying them the
possibility of protection across the board. This disqualification of a
class of persons from the right to obtain specific protection from the
law is unprecedented and is itself a denial of equal protection in the
most literal sense. Second, the sheer breadth of Amendment 2,
which makes a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not
have any particular protections from the law, is so far removed from
the reasons offered for it, i.e., respect for other citizens' freedom of
association, particularly landlords or employers who have personal
or religious objections to homosexuality, and the State's interest in
conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups,
that the amendment cannot be explained by reference to those
reasons; the Amendment raises the inevitable inference that it is born
of animosity toward the class that it affects. Amendment 2 cannot be
said to be directed to an identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete
objective. It is a status-based classification of persons undertaken for
its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.
Pp. 9-14. 882 P. 2d 1335, affirmed.

KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which
STEVENS, O'CONNOR, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER,
JJ., joined. SCALIA, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which
REHNQUIST, C. J., and THOMAS, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-1039


ROY ROMER, GOVERNOR OF COLORADO, ET AL.,
PETITIONERS

v.

RICHARD G. EVANS ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
COLORADO

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

One century ago, the first Justice Harlan admonished this Court that
the Constitution "neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens."  Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896)
(dissenting opinion). Unheeded then, those words now are
understood to state a commitment to the law's neutrality where the
rights of persons are at stake. The Equal Protection Clause enforces
this principle and today requires us to hold invalid a provision of
Colorado's Constitution.

The enactment challenged in this case is an amendment to the
Constitution of the State of Colorado, adopted in a 1992 statewide
referendum. The parties and the state courts refer to it as
"Amendment 2," its designation when submitted to the voters. The
impetus for the amendment and the contentious campaign that
preceded its adoption came in large part from ordinances that had
been passed in various Colorado municipalities. For example, the
cities of Aspen and Boulder and the City and County of Denver each
had enacted ordinances which banned discrimination in many
transactions and activities, including housing, employment,
education, public accommodations, and health and welfare services.
Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art. IV Sections 28-91 to 28-116
(1991); Aspen Municipal Code Section 13-98 (1977); Boulder Rev.
Code Sections 12-1-1 to 12-1-11 (1987). What gave rise to the
statewide controversy was the protection the ordinances afforded to
persons discriminated against by reason of their sexual orientation.
See Boulder Rev. Code Section 12-1-1 (defining "sexual orientation"
as "the choice of sexual partners, i.e., bisexual, homosexual or
heterosexual"); Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art. IV Section 28-92
(defining "sexual orientation" as "[t]he status of an individual as to
his or her heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality").
Amendment 2 repeals these ordinances to the extent they prohibit
discrimination on the basis of "homosexual, lesbian or bisexual
orientation, conduct, practices or relationships."  Colo. Const., Art.
II, Section 30b.

Yet Amendment 2, in explicit terms, does more than repeal or rescind
these provisions. It prohibits all legislative, executive or judicial
action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the
named class, a class we shall refer to as homosexual persons or gays
and lesbians. The amendment reads:

"No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian, or Bisexual
Orientation. Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its
branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political
subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or
enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby
homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or
relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle
any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status,
quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This
Section of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing."
Ibid.

Soon after Amendment 2 was adopted, this litigation to declare its
invalidity and enjoin its enforcement was commenced in the District
Court for the City and County of Denver. Among the plaintiffs
(respondents here) were homosexual persons, some of them
government employees. They alleged that enforcement of
Amendment 2 would subject them to immediate and substantial risk
of discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. Other
plaintiffs (also respondents here) included the three municipalities
whose ordinances we have cited and certain other governmental
entities which had acted earlier to protect homosexuals from
discrimination but would be prevented by Amendment 2 from
continuing to do so. Although Governor Romer had been on record
opposing the adoption of Amendment 2, he was named in his official
capacity as a defendant, together with the Colorado Attorney General
and the State of Colorado.

The trial court granted a preliminary injunction to stay enforcement of
Amendment 2, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of
Colorado. Sustaining the interim injunction and remanding the case
for further proceedings, the State Supreme Court held that
Amendment 2 was subject to strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth
Amendment because it infringed the fundamental right of gays and
lesbians to participate in the political process. Evans v. Romer, 854
P. 2d 1270 (Colo. 1993) (Evans I). To reach this conclusion, the
state court relied on our voting rights cases, e.g., Reynolds v. Sims,
377 U. S. 533 (1964); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U. S. 89 (1965);
Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966); Williams
v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), and on our precedents involving
discriminatory restructuring of governmental decisionmaking, see,
e.g., Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385 (1969); Reitman v.
Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 (1967); Washington v. Seattle School Dist.
No. 1, 458 U. S. 457 (1982); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U. S. 1
(1971). On remand, the State advanced various arguments in an
effort to show that Amendment 2 was narrowly tailored to serve
compelling interests, but the trial court found none sufficient. It
enjoined enforcement of Amendment 2, and the Supreme Court of
Colorado, in a second opinion, affirmed the ruling. Evans v. Romer,
882 P. 2d 1335 (Colo. 1994) (Evans II). We granted certiorari and
now affirm the judgment, but on a rationale different from that
adopted by the State Supreme Court.


The State's principal argument in defense of Amendment 2 is that it
puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all other persons. So,
the State says, the measure does no more than deny homosexuals
special rights. This reading of the amendment's language is
implausible. We rely not upon our own interpretation of the
amendment but upon the authoritative construction of Colorado's
Supreme Court. The state court, deeming it unnecessary to determine
the full extent of the amendment's reach, found it invalid even on a
modest reading of its implications. The critical discussion of the
amendment, set out in Evans I, is as follows:

"The immediate objective of Amendment 2 is, at a minimum, to
repeal existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state
and local entities that barred discrimination based on sexual
orientation. See Aspen, Colo., Mun. Code Section 13-98 (1977)
(prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing and public
accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation); Boulder, Colo.,
Rev. Code Sections 12-1-2 to -4 (1987) (same); Denver, Colo., Rev.
Mun. Code art. IV, Sections 28-91 to -116 (1991) (same); Executive
Order No. D0035 (December 10, 1990) (prohibiting employment
discrimination for `all state employees, classified and exempt' on the
basis of sexual orientation); Colorado Insurance Code, Section 10-3-
1104, 4A C. R. S. (1992 Supp.) (forbidding health insurance
providers from determining insurability and premiums based on an
applicant's, a beneficiary's, or an insured's sexual orientation); and
various provisions prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
orientation at state colleges.26

"26Metropolitan State College of Denver prohibits college sponsored
social clubs from discriminating in membership on the basis of
sexual orientation and Colorado State University has an
antidiscrimination policy which encompasses sexual orientation.

"The `ultimate effect' of Amendment 2 is to prohibit any
governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective
statutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future unless the
state constitution is first amended to permit such measures."  854 P.
2d, at 1284-1285, and n. 26.

Sweeping and comprehensive is the change in legal status effected by
this law. So much is evident from the ordinances that the Colorado
Supreme Court declared would be void by operation of Amendment
2. Homosexuals, by state decree, are put in a solitary class with
respect to transactions and relations in both the private and
governmental spheres. The amendment withdraws from
homosexuals, but no others, specific legal protection from the
injuries caused by discrimination, and it forbids reinstatement of
these laws and policies.

The change that Amendment 2 works in the legal status of gays and
lesbians in the private sphere is far-reaching, both on its own terms
and when considered in light of the structure and operation of
modern anti-discrimination laws. That structure is well illustrated by
contemporary statutes and ordinances prohibiting discrimination by
providers of public accommodations. "At common law, innkeepers,
smiths, and others who `made profession of a public employment,'
were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer."  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 13).
The duty was a general one and did not specify protection for
particular groups. The common law rules, however, proved
insufficient in many instances, and it was settled early that the
Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress a general power to
prohibit discrimination in public accommodations, Civil Rights
Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 25 (1883). In consequence, most States have
chosen to counter discrimination by enacting detailed statutory
schemes. See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws Sections 20-13-10, 20-13-
22, 20-13-23 (1995); Iowa Code Sections 216.6-216.8 (1994);
Okla. Stat., Tit. 25, Sections 1302, 1402 (1987); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat.
Sections 953, 955 (Supp. 1995); N. J. Stat. Ann. Sections 10:5-3,
10:5-4 (West Supp. 1995); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 354-A:7,
354-A:10, 354-A:17 (1995); Minn. Stat. Section 363.03 (1991 and
Supp. 1995).

Colorado's state and municipal laws typify this emerging tradition of
statutory protection and follow a consistent pattern. The laws first
enumerate the persons or entities subject to a duty not to discriminate.
The list goes well beyond the entities covered by the common law.
The Boulder ordinance, for example, has a comprehensive definition
of entities deemed places of "public accommodation."  They include
"any place of business engaged in any sales to the general public and
any place that offers services, facilities, privileges, or advantages to
the general public or that receives financial support through
solicitation of the general public or through governmental subsidy of
any kind."  Boulder Rev. Code Section 12-1-1(j) (1987). The
Denver ordinance is of similar breadth, applying, for example, to
hotels, restaurants, hospitals, dental clinics, theaters, banks,
common carriers, travel and insurance agencies, and "shops and
stores dealing with goods or services of any kind," Denver Rev.
Municipal Code, Art. IV, Section 28-92.

These statutes and ordinances also depart from the common law by
enumerating the groups or persons within their ambit of protection.
Enumeration is the essential device used to make the duty not to
discriminate concrete and to provide guidance for those who must
comply. In following this approach, Colorado's state and local
governments have not limited anti-discrimination laws to groups that
have so far been given the protection of heightened equal protection
scrutiny under our cases. See, e.g., J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.
B., 511 U. S. __, __ (1994) (slip op., at 8) (sex); Lalli v. Lalli, 439
U. S. 259, 265 (1978) (illegitimacy); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.
S. 184, 191-192 (1964) (race); Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633
(1948) (ancestry). Rather, they set forth an extensive catalogue of
traits which cannot be the basis for discrimination, including age,
military status, marital status, pregnancy, parenthood, custody of a
minor child, political affiliation, physical or mental disability of an
individual or of his or her associates--and, in recent times, sexual
orientation. Aspen Municipal Code Section 13-98(a)(1) (1977);
Boulder Rev. Code Sections 12-1-1 to 12-1-4 (1987); Denver Rev.
Municipal Code, Art. IV, Sections 28-92 to 28-119 (1991); Colo.
Rev. Stat. Sections 24-34-401 to 24-34-707 (1988 and Supp. 1995).

Amendment 2 bars homosexuals from securing protection against the
injuries that these public-accommodations laws address. That in
itself is a severe consequence, but there is more. Amendment 2, in
addition, nullifies specific legal protections for this targeted class in
all transactions in housing, sale of real estate, insurance, health and
welfare services, private education, and employment. See, e.g.,
Aspen Municipal Code Sections 13-98(b), (c) (1977); Boulder Rev.
Code Sections 12-1-2, 12-1-3 (1987); Denver Rev. Municipal Code,
Art. IV Sections 28-93 to 28-95, Section 28-97 (1991).

Not confined to the private sphere, Amendment 2 also operates to
repeal and forbid all laws or policies providing specific protection for
gays or lesbians from discrimination by every level of Colorado
government. The State Supreme Court cited two examples of
protections in the governmental sphere that are now rescinded and
may not be reintroduced. The first is Colorado Executive Order
D0035 (1990), which forbids employment discrimination against
"`all state employees, classified and exempt' on the basis of sexual
orientation."  854 P. 2d, at 1284. Also repealed, and now forbidden,
are "various provisions prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
orientation at state colleges."  Id., at 1284, 1285. The repeal of these
measures and the prohibition against their future reenactment
demonstrates that Amendment 2 has the same force and effect in
Colorado's governmental sector as it does elsewhere and that it
applies to policies as well as ordinary legislation.

Amendment 2's reach may not be limited to specific laws passed for
the benefit of gays and lesbians. It is a fair, if not necessary,
inference from the broad language of the amendment that it deprives
gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies
that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private
settings. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. Section 24-4-106(7) (1988)
(agency action subject to judicial review under arbitrary and
capricious standard); Section 18-8-405 (making it a criminal offense
for a public servant knowingly, arbitrarily or capriciously to refrain
from performing a duty imposed on him by law); Section 10-3-
1104(1)(f) (prohibiting "unfair discrimination" in insurance); 4 Colo.
Code of Regulations 801-1, Policy 11-1 (1983) (prohibiting
discrimination in state employment on grounds of specified traits or
"other non-merit factor"). At some point in the systematic
administration of these laws, an official must determine whether
homosexuality is an arbitrary and thus forbidden basis for decision.
Yet a decision to that effect would itself amount to a policy
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of homosexuality, and so
would appear to be no more valid under Amendment 2 than the
specific prohibitions against discrimination the state court held
invalid.

If this consequence follows from Amendment 2, as its broad
language suggests, it would compound the constitutional difficulties
the law creates. The state court did not decide whether the
amendment has this effect, however, and neither need we. In the
course of rejecting the argument that Amendment 2 is intended to
conserve resources to fight discrimination against suspect classes, the
Colorado Supreme Court made the limited observation that the
amendment is not intended to affect many anti-discrimination laws
protecting non-suspect classes, Romer II, 882 P. 2d at 1346, n. 9.
In our view that does not resolve the issue. In any event, even if, as
we doubt, homosexuals could find some safe harbor in laws of
general application, we cannot accept the view that Amendment 2's
prohibition on specific legal protections does no more than deprive
homosexuals of special rights. To the contrary, the amendment
imposes a special disability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals
are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without
constraint. They can obtain specific protection against discrimination
only by enlisting the citizenry of Colorado to amend the state
constitution or perhaps, on the State's view, by trying to pass helpful
laws of general applicability. This is so no matter how local or
discrete the harm, no matter how public and widespread the injury.
We find nothing special in the protections Amendment 2 withholds.
These are protections taken for granted by most people either because
they already have them or do not need them; these are protections
against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and
endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a free society.


The Fourteenth Amendment's promise that no person shall be denied
the equal protection of the laws must co-exist with the practical
necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another,
with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons. Personnel
Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 271- 272 (1979);
F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920).
We have attempted to reconcile the principle with the reality by
stating that, if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a
suspect class, we will uphold the legislative classification so long as
it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end. See, e.g., Heller v.
Doe, 509 U. S. ___, ___ (1993) (slip op., at 6).


Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry.
First, the amendment has the peculiar property of imposing a broad
and undifferentiated disability on a single named group, an
exceptional and, as we shall explain, invalid form of legislation.
Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons
offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but
animus toward the class that it affects; it lacks a rational relationship
to legitimate state interests.

Taking the first point, even in the ordinary equal protection case
calling for the most deferential of standards, we insist on knowing
the relation between the classification adopted and the object to be
attained. The search for the link between classification and objective
gives substance to the Equal Protection Clause; it provides guidance
and discipline for the legislature, which is entitled to know what sorts
of laws it can pass; and it marks the limits of our own authority. In
the ordinary case, a law will be sustained if it can be said to advance
a legitimate government interest, even if the law seems unwise or
works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for
it seems tenuous. See New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297 (1976)
(tourism benefits justified classification favoring pushcart vendors of
certain longevity); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.
S. 483 (1955) (assumed health concerns justified law favoring
optometrists over opticians); Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New
York, 336 U. S. 106 (1949) (potential traffic hazards justified
exemption of vehicles advertising the owner's products from general
advertising ban); Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm'rs for
Port of New Orleans, 330 U. S. 552 (1947) (licensing scheme that
disfavored persons unrelated to current river boat pilots justified by
possible efficiency and safety benefits of a closely knit pilotage
system). The laws challenged in the cases just cited were narrow
enough in scope and grounded in a sufficient factual context for us to
ascertain that there existed some relation between the classification
and the purpose it served. By requiring that the classification bear a
rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end,
we ensure that classifications are not drawn for the purpose of
disadvantaging the group burdened by the law. See United States
Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 181 (1980)
(STEVENS, J., concurring) ("If the adverse impact on the
disfavored class is an apparent aim of the legislature, its impartiality
would be suspect.").

Amendment 2 confounds this normal process of judicial review. It is
at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies persons by a single
trait and then denies them protection across the board. The resulting
disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific
protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence. The
absence of precedent for Amendment 2 is itself instructive;
"[d]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful
consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the
constitutional provision."  Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman,
277 U. S. 32, 37-38 (1928).

It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort.
Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that
government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all
who seek its assistance. "`Equal protection of the laws is not
achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.'" Sweatt
v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 635 (1950) (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer,
334 U. S. 1, 22 (1948)). Respect for this principle explains why
laws singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status
or general hardships are rare. A law declaring that in general it shall
be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek
aid from the government is itself a denial of equal protection of the
laws in the most literal sense. "The guaranty of `equal protection of
the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.'"  Skinner v.
Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942) (quoting
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369 (1886)).

Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), not cited by the parties but
relied upon by the dissent, is not evidence that Amendment 2 is
within our constitutional tradition, and any reliance upon it as
authority for sustaining the amendment is misplaced. In Davis, the
Court approved an Idaho territorial statute denying Mormons,
polygamists, and advocates of polygamy the right to vote and to hold
office because, as the Court construed the statute, it "simply excludes
from the privilege of voting, or of holding any office of honor, trust
or profit, those who have been convicted of certain offences, and
those who advocate a practical resistance to the laws of the Territory
and justify and approve the commission of crimes forbidden by it."
Id., at 347. To the extent Davis held that persons advocating a
certain practice may be denied the right to vote, it is no longer good
law. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). To
the extent it held that the groups designated in the statute may be
deprived of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling could
not stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome.
Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 337 (1972); cf. United States v.
Brown, 381 U. S. 437 (1965); United States v. Robel, 389 U. S.
258 (1967). To the extent Davis held that a convicted felon may be
denied the right to vote, its holding is not implicated by our decision
and is unexceptionable. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U. S. 24
(1974).

A second and related point is that laws of the kind now before us
raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of
animosity toward the class of persons affected. "[I]f the
constitutional conception of `equal protection of the laws' means
anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm
a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate
governmental interest."  Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413
U. S. 528, 534 (1973). Even laws enacted for broad and ambitious
purposes often can be explained by reference to legitimate public
policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on
certain persons. Amendment 2, however, in making a general
announcement that gays and lesbians shall not have any particular
protections from the law, inflicts on them immediate, continuing, and
real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate justifications that may
be claimed for it. We conclude that, in addition to the far-reaching
deficiencies of Amendment 2 that we have noted, the principles it
offends, in another sense, are conventional and venerable; a law must
bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose,
Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U. S. 450, 462 (1988),
and Amendment 2 does not.

The primary rationale the State offers for Amendment 2 is respect for
other citizens' freedom of association, and in particular the liberties
of landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections
to homosexuality. Colorado also cites its interest in conserving
resources to fight discrimination against other groups. The breadth
of the Amendment is so far removed from these particular
justifications that we find it impossible to credit them. We cannot say
that Amendment 2 is directed to any identifiable legitimate purpose or
discrete objective. It is a status-based enactment divorced from any
factual context from which we could discern a relationship to
legitimate state interests; it is a classification of persons undertaken
for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not
permit. "[C]lass legislation... [is] obnoxious to the prohibitions of
the Fourteenth Amendment . . . ."  Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S., at
24.

We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to
further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone
else. This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of
persons a stranger to its laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal
Protection Clause, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Colorado is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-1039


ROY ROMER, GOVERNOR OF COLORADO, ET AL.,
PETITIONERS

v.

RICHARD G. EVANS ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
COLORADO

[May 20, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and
JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.

The Court has mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit of spite. The
constitutional amendment before us here is not the manifestation of a
"`bare . . . desire to harm'" homosexuals, ante, at 13, but is rather a
modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve
traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful
minority to revise those mores through use of the laws. That
objective, and the means chosen to achieve it, are not only
unimpeachable under any constitutional doctrine hitherto pronounced
(hence the opinion's heavy reliance upon principles of righteousness
rather than judicial holdings); they have been specifically approved
by the Congress of the United States and by this Court.

In holding that homosexuality cannot be singled out for disfavorable
treatment, the Court contradicts a decision, unchallenged here,
pronounced only 10 years ago, see Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S.
186 (1986), and places the prestige of this institution behind the
proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as
racial or religious bias. Whether it is or not is precisely the cultural
debate that gave rise to the Colorado constitutional amendment (and
to the preferential laws against which the amendment was directed).
Since the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this
subject, it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means,
including the democratic adoption of provisions in state constitutions.
This Court has no business imposing upon all Americans the
resolution favored by the elite class from which the Members of this
institution are selected, pronouncing that "animosity" toward
homosexuality, ante, at 13, is evil. I vigorously dissent.



Let me first discuss Part II of the Court's opinion, its longest section,
which is devoted to rejecting the State's arguments that Amendment 2
"puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all other persons,"
and "does no more than deny homosexuals special rights," ante, at 4.
The Court concludes that this reading of Amendment 2's language is
"implausible" under the "authoritative construction" given
Amendment 2 by the Supreme Court of Colorado. Ibid.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court considers it unnecessary to
decide the validity of the State's argument that Amendment 2 does
not deprive homosexuals of the "protection [afforded by] general
laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in
governmental and private settings."  Ante, at 8. I agree that we need
not resolve that dispute, because the Supreme Court of Colorado has
resolved it for us. In Evans v. Romer, 882 P. 2d 1335 (1994), the
Colorado court stated:

"[I]t is significant to note that Colorado law currently proscribes
discrimination against persons who are not suspect classes, including
discrimination based on age, Section 24-34-402(1)(a), 10A C. R. S.
(1994 Supp.); marital or family status, Section 24-34-502(1)(a), 10A
C. R. S. (1994 Supp.); veterans' status, Section 28-3-506, 11B C.
R. S. (1989); and for any legal, off-duty conduct such as smoking
tobacco, Section 24-34-402.5, 10A C. R. S. (1994 Supp.). Of
course Amendment 2 is not intended to have any effect on this
legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adoption of anti-
discrimination laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and
bisexuals."  Id., at 1346, n. 9 (emphasis added).

The Court utterly fails to distinguish this portion of the Colorado
court's opinion. Colorado Rev. Stat. Section 24-34-402.5 (Supp.
1995), which this passage authoritatively declares not to be affected
by Amendment 2, was respondents' primary example of a generally
applicable law whose protections would be unavailable to
homosexuals under Amendment 2. See Brief for Respondents Evans
et al. 11-12. The clear import of the Colorado court's conclusion that
it is not affected is that "general laws and policies that prohibit
arbitrary discrimination" would continue to prohibit discrimination on
the basis of homosexual conduct as well. This analysis, which is
fully in accord with (indeed, follows inescapably from) the text of the
constitutional provision, lays to rest such horribles, raised in the
course of oral argument, as the prospect that assaults upon
homosexuals could not be prosecuted. The amendment prohibits
special treatment of homosexuals, and nothing more. It would not
affect, for example, a requirement of state law that pensions be paid
to all retiring state employees with a certain length of service;
homosexual employees, as well as others, would be entitled to that
benefit. But it would prevent the State or any municipality from
making death-benefit payments to the "life partner" of a homosexual
when it does not make such payments to the long-time roommate of a
nonhomosexual employee. Or again, it does not affect the
requirement of the State's general insurance laws that customers be
afforded coverage without discrimination unrelated to anticipated
risk. Thus, homosexuals could not be denied coverage, or charged a
greater premium, with respect to auto collision insurance; but neither
the State nor any municipality could require that distinctive health
insurance risks associated with homosexuality (if there are any) be
ignored.

Despite all of its hand-wringing about the potential effect of
Amendment 2 on general antidiscrimination laws, the Court's
opinion ultimately does not dispute all this, but assumes it to be true.
See ante, at 9. The only denial of equal treatment it contends
homosexuals have suffered is this: They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution. That is to say, the
principle underlying the Court's opinion is that one who is accorded
equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readily as others obtain
preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal
protection of the laws. If merely stating this alleged "equal
protection" violation does not suffice to refute it, our constitutional
jurisprudence has achieved terminal silliness.

The central thesis of the Court's reasoning is that any group is denied
equal protection when, to obtain advantage (or, presumably, to avoid
disadvantage), it must have recourse to a more general and hence
more difficult level of political decisionmaking than others. The
world has never heard of such a principle, which is why the Court's
opinion is so long on emotive utterance and so short on relevant legal
citation. And it seems to me most unlikely that any multilevel
democracy can function under such a principle. For whenever a
disadvantage is imposed, or conferral of a benefit is prohibited, at
one of the higher levels of democratic decisionmaking (i.e., by the
state legislature rather than local government, or by the people at
large in the state constitution rather than the legislature), the affected
group has (under this theory) been denied equal protection. To take
the simplest of examples, consider a state law prohibiting the award
of municipal contracts to relatives of mayors or city councilmen.
Once such a law is passed, the group composed of such relatives
must, in order to get the benefit of city contracts, persuade the state
legislature--unlike all other citizens, who need only persuade the
municipality. It is ridiculous to consider this a denial of equal
protection, which is why the Court's theory is unheard-of.

The Court might reply that the example I have given is not a denial of
equal protection only because the same "rational basis" (avoidance of
corruption) which renders constitutional the substantive
discrimination against relatives (i.e., the fact that they alone cannot
obtain city contracts) also automatically suffices to sustain what
might be called the electoral-procedural discrimination against them
(i.e., the fact that they must go to the state level to get this changed).
This is of course a perfectly reasonable response, and would explain
why "electoral-procedural discrimination" has not hitherto been heard
of: a law that is valid in its substance is automatically valid in its level
of enactment. But the Court cannot afford to make this argument, for
as I shall discuss next, there is no doubt of a rational basis for the
substance of the prohibition at issue here. The Court's entire novel
theory rests upon the proposition that there is something special--
something that cannot be justified by normal "rational basis"
analysis--in making a disadvantaged group (or a nonpreferred group)
resort to a higher decisionmaking level. That proposition finds no
support in law or logic.


I turn next to whether there was a legitimate rational basis for the
substance of the constitutional amendment--for the prohibition of
special protection for homosexuals.1   It is unsurprising that the
Court avoids discussion of this question, since the answer is so
obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue before us today is
not even mentioned in the Court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick,
478 U. S. 186 (1986), we held that the Constitution does not
prohibit what virtually all States had done from the founding of the
Republic until very recent years--making homosexual conduct a
crime. That holding is unassailable, except by those who think that
the Constitution changes to suit current fashions. But in any event it
is a given in the present case: Respondents' briefs did not urge
overruling Bowers, and at oral argument respondents' counsel
expressly disavowed any intent to seek such overruling, Tr. of Oral
Arg. 53. If it is constitutionally permissible for a State to make
homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible
for a State to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual
conduct. (As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit has aptly put it: "If the Court [in Bowers] was unwilling to
object to state laws that criminalize the behavior that defines the class,
it is hardly open . . . to conclude that state sponsored discrimination
against the class is invidious. After all, there can hardly be more
palpable discrimination against a class than making the conduct that
defines the class criminal."  Padula v. Webster, 822 F. 2d 97, 103
(1987).) And a fortiori it is constitutionally permissible for a State to
adopt a provision not even disfavoring homosexual conduct, but
merely prohibiting all levels of state government from bestowing
special protections upon homosexual conduct. Respondents (who,
unlike the Court, cannot afford the luxury of ignoring inconvenient
precedent) counter Bowers with the argument that a greater-includes-
the-lesser rationale cannot justify Amendment 2's application to
individuals who do not engage in homosexual acts, but are merely of
homosexual "orientation."  Some courts of appeals have concluded
that, with respect to laws of this sort at least, that is a distinction
without a difference. See Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati,
Inc. v. Cincinnati, 54 F. 3d 261, 267 (CA6 1995) ("[F]or purposes
of these proceedings, it is virtually impossible to distinguish or
separate individuals of a particular orientation which predisposes
them toward a particular sexual conduct from those who actually
engage in that particular type of sexual conduct"); Steffan v. Perry,
41 F. 3d 677, 689-690 (CADC 1994). The Supreme Court of
Colorado itself appears to be of this view. See 882 P. 2d, at 1349-
1350 ("Amendment 2 targets this class of persons based on four
characteristics: sexual orientation; conduct; practices; and
relationships. Each characteristic provides a potentially different way
of identifying that class of persons who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
These four characteristics are not truly severable from one another
because each provides nothing more than a different way of
identifying the same class of persons") (emphasis added).

But assuming that, in Amendment 2, a person of homosexual
"orientation" is someone who does not engage in homosexual
conduct but merely has a tendency or desire to do so, Bowers still
suffices to establish a rational basis for the provision. If it is rational
to criminalize the conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor
and protection to those with a self-avowed tendency or desire to
engage in the conduct. Indeed, where criminal sanctions are not
involved, homosexual "orientation" is an acceptable stand-in for
homosexual conduct. A State "does not violate the Equal Protection
Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are
imperfect," Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 485 (1970). Just
as a policy barring the hiring of methadone users as transit employees
does not violate equal protection simply because some methadone
users pose no threat to passenger safety, see New York City Transit
Authority v. Beazer, 440 U. S. 568 (1979), and just as a mandatory
retirement age of 50 for police officers does not violate equal
protection even though it prematurely ends the careers of many
policemen over 50 who still have the capacity to do the job, see
Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307 (1976)
(per curiam), Amendment 2 is not constitutionally invalid simply
because it could have been drawn more precisely so as to withdraw
special antidiscrimination protections only from those of homosexual
"orientation" who actually engage in homosexual conduct. As
JUSTICE KENNEDY wrote, when he was on the Court of Appeals,
in a case involving discharge of homosexuals from the Navy:
"Nearly any statute which classifies people may be irrational as
applied in particular cases. Discharge of the particular plaintiffs
before us would be rational, under minimal scrutiny, not because
their particular cases present the dangers which justify Navy policy,
but instead because the general policy of discharging all homosexuals
is rational." Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F. 2d 788, 808-809, n. 20
(CA9 1980) (citation omitted). See also Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881
F. 2d 454, 464 (CA7 1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1004 (1990).

Moreover, even if the provision regarding homosexual "orientation"
were invalid, respondents' challenge to Amendment 2--which is a
facial challenge--must fail. "A facial challenge to a legislative Act is,
of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since
the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under
which the Act would be valid."  United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.
739, 745 (1987). It would not be enough for respondents to
establish (if they could) that Amendment 2 is unconstitutional as
applied to those of homosexual "orientation"; since, under Bowers,
Amendment 2 is unquestionably constitutional as applied to those
who engage in homosexual conduct, the facial challenge cannot
succeed. Some individuals of homosexual "orientation" who do not
engage in homosexual acts might successfully bring an as-applied
challenge to Amendment 2, but so far as the record indicates, none of
the respondents is such a person. See App. 4-5 (complaint describing
each of the individual respondents as either "a gay man" or "a
lesbian").2


The foregoing suffices to establish what the Court's failure to cite
any case remotely in point would lead one to suspect: No principle
set forth in the Constitution, nor even any imagined by this Court in
the past 200 years, prohibits what Colorado has done here. But the
case for Colorado is much stronger than that. What it has done is not
only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable, with close,
congressionally approved precedent in earlier constitutional practice.

First, as to its eminent reasonableness. The Court's opinion contains
grim, disapproving hints that Coloradans have been guilty of
"animus" or "animosity" toward homosexuality, as though that has
been established as Unamerican. Of course it is our moral heritage
that one should not hate any human being or class of human beings.
But I had thought that one could consider certain conduct
reprehensible--murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to
animals--and could exhibit even "animus" toward such conduct.
Surely that is the only sort of "animus" at issue here: moral
disapproval of homosexual conduct, the same sort of moral
disapproval that produced the centuries-old criminal laws that we
held constitutional in Bowers. The Colorado amendment does not,
to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored status to people
who are homosexuals; they can be favored for many reasons--for
example, because they are senior citizens or members of racial
minorities. But it prohibits giving them favored status because of
their homosexual conduct--that is, it prohibits favored status for
homosexuality.

But though Coloradans are, as I say, entitled to be hostile toward
homosexual conduct, the fact is that the degree of hostility reflected
by Amendment 2 is the smallest conceivable. The Court's portrayal
of Coloradans as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled "gay-
bashing" is so false as to be comical. Colorado not only is one of the
25 States that have repealed their antisodomy laws, but was among
the first to do so. See 1971 Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 121, Section 1.
But the society that eliminates criminal punishment for homosexual
acts does not necessarily abandon the view that homosexuality is
morally wrong and socially harmful; often, abolition simply reflects
the view that enforcement of such criminal laws involves unseemly
intrusion into the intimate lives of citizens. Cf. Brief for Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae in
Bowers v. Hardwick, O. T. 1985, No. 85-140, p. 25, n. 21
(antisodomy statutes are "unenforceable by any but the most
offensive snooping and wasteful allocation of law enforcement
resources"); Kadish, The Crisis of Overcriminalization, 374 The
Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 157,
161 (1967) ("To obtain evidence [in sodomy cases], police are
obliged to resort to behavior which tends to degrade and demean both
themselves personally and law enforcement as an institution").

There is a problem, however, which arises when criminal sanction of
homosexuality is eliminated but moral and social disapprobation of
homosexuality is meant to be retained. The Court cannot be unaware
of that problem; it is evident in many cities of the country, and
occasionally bubbles to the surface of the news, in heated political
disputes over such matters as the introduction into local schools of
books teaching that homosexuality is an optional and fully acceptable
"alternate life style."  The problem (a problem, that is, for those who
wish to retain social disapprobation of homosexuality) is that,
because those who engage in homosexual conduct tend to reside in
disproportionate numbers in certain communities, see Record, Exh.
MMM, have high disposable income, see ibid.; App. 254 (affidavit
of Prof. James Hunter), and of course care about homosexual-rights
issues much more ardently than the public at large, they possess
political power much greater than their numbers, both locally and
statewide. Quite understandably, they devote this political power to
achieving not merely a grudging social toleration, but full social
acceptance, of homosexuality. See, e.g., Jacobs, The Rhetorical
Construction of Rights: The Case of the Gay Rights Movement,
1969-1991, 72 Neb. L. Rev. 723, 724 (1993) ("[T]he task of gay
rights proponents is to move the center of public discourse along a
continuum from the rhetoric of disapprobation, to rhetoric of
tolerance, and finally to affirmation").

By the time Coloradans were asked to vote on Amendment 2, their
exposure to homosexuals' quest for social endorsement was not
limited to newspaper accounts of happenings in places such as New
York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Key West. Three Colorado
cities--Aspen, Boulder, and Denver--had enacted ordinances that
listed "sexual orientation" as an impermissible ground for
discrimination, equating the moral disapproval of homosexual
conduct with racial and religious bigotry. See Aspen Municipal Code
Section 13-98 (1977); Boulder Rev. Municipal Code Sections 12-1-1
to 12-1-11 (1987); Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art. IV Sections
28-91 to 28-116 (1991). The phenomenon had even appeared
statewide: the Governor of Colorado had signed an executive order
pronouncing that "in the State of Colorado we recognize the diversity
in our pluralistic society and strive to bring an end to discrimination
in any form," and directing state agency-heads to "ensure non-
discrimination" in hiring and promotion based on, among other
things, "sexual orientation."  Executive Order No. D0035 (Dec. 10,
1990). I do not mean to be critical of these legislative successes;
homosexuals are as entitled to use the legal system for reinforcement
of their moral sentiments as are the rest of society. But they are
subject to being countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as
well.

That is where Amendment 2 came in. It sought to counter both the
geographic concentration and the disproportionate political power of
homosexuals by (1) resolving the controversy at the statewide level,
and (2) making the election a single-issue contest for both sides. It
put directly, to all the citizens of the State, the question: Should
homosexuality be given special protection? They answered no. The
Court today asserts that this most democratic of procedures is
unconstitutional. Lacking any cases to establish that facially absurd
proposition, it simply asserts that it must be unconstitutional, because
it has never happened before.

"[Amendment 2] identifies persons by a single trait and then denies
them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a
class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the
law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence. The absence of precedent
for Amendment 2 is itself instructive . . . .

"It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort.
Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that
government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all
who seek its assistance."  Ante, at 11-12.

As I have noted above, this is proved false every time a state law
prohibiting or disfavoring certain conduct is passed, because such a
law prevents the adversely affected group--whether drug addicts, or
smokers, or gun owners, or motorcyclists--from changing the policy
thus established in "each of [the] parts" of the State. What the Court
says is even demonstrably false at the constitutional level. The
Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, for example,
deprived those who drank alcohol not only of the power to alter the
policy of prohibition locally or through state legislation, but even of
the power to alter it through state constitutional amendment or federal
legislation. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment
prevents theocrats from having their way by converting their fellow
citizens at the local, state, or federal statutory level; as does the
Republican Form of Government Clause prevent monarchists.

But there is a much closer analogy, one that involves precisely the
effort by the majority of citizens to preserve its view of sexual
morality statewide, against the efforts of a geographically
concentrated and politically powerful minority to undermine it. The
constitutions of the States of Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, and Utah to this day contain provisions stating that
polygamy is "forever prohibited."  See Ariz. Const., Art. XX, par.
2; Idaho Const., Art. I, Section 4; N. M. Const., Art. XXI, Section
1; Okla. Const., Art. I, Section 2; Utah Const., Art. III, Section 1.
Polygamists, and those who have a polygamous "orientation," have
been "singled out" by these provisions for much more severe
treatment than merely denial of favored status; and that treatment can
only be changed by achieving amendment of the state constitutions.
The Court's disposition today suggests that these provisions are
unconstitutional, and that polygamy must be permitted in these States
on a state-legislated, or perhaps even local-option, basis--unless, of
course, polygamists for some reason have fewer constitutional rights
than homosexuals.

The United States Congress, by the way, required the inclusion of
these antipolygamy provisions in the constitutions of Arizona, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah, as a condition of their admission to
statehood. See Arizona Enabling Act, 36 Stat. 569; New Mexico
Enabling Act, 36 Stat. 558; Oklahoma Enabling Act, 34 Stat. 269;
Utah Enabling Act, 28 Stat. 108. (For Arizona, New Mexico, and
Utah, moreover, the Enabling Acts required that the antipolygamy
provisions be "irrevocable without the consent of the United States
and the people of said State"--so that not only were "each of [the]
parts" of these States not "open on impartial terms" to polygamists,
but even the States as a whole were not; polygamists would have to
persuade the whole country to their way of thinking.) Idaho adopted
the constitutional provision on its own, but the 51st Congress, which
admitted Idaho into the Union, found its constitution to be
"republican in form and . . . in conformity with the Constitution of
the United States." Act of Admission of Idaho, 26 Stat. 215
(emphasis added). Thus, this "singling out" of the sexual practices of
a single group for statewide, democratic vote--so utterly alien to our
constitutional system, the Court would have us believe--has not only
happened, but has received the explicit approval of the United States
Congress.

I cannot say that this Court has explicitly approved any of these state
constitutional provisions; but it has approved a territorial statutory
provision that went even further, depriving polygamists of the ability
even to achieve a constitutional amendment, by depriving them of the
power to vote. In Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), Justice
Field wrote for a unanimous Court:

"In our judgment, Section 501 of the Revised Statutes of Idaho
Territory, which provides that `no person . . . who is a bigamist or
polygamist or who teaches, advises, counsels, or encourages any
person or persons to become bigamists or polygamists, or to commit
any other crime defined by law, or to enter into what is known as
plural or celestial marriage, or who is a member of any order,
organization or association which teaches, advises, counsels, or
encourages its members or devotees or any other persons to commit
the crime of bigamy or polygamy, or any other crime defined by law
. . . is permitted to vote at any election, or to hold any position or
office of honor, trust, or profit within this Territory,' is not open to
any constitutional or legal objection."  Id., at 346-347 (emphasis
added).

To the extent, if any, that this opinion permits the imposition of
adverse consequences upon mere abstract advocacy of polygamy, it
has of course been overruled by later cases. See Brandenburg v.
Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). But the proposition that
polygamy can be criminalized, and those engaging in that crime
deprived of the vote, remains good law. See Richardson v. Ramirez,
418 U. S. 24, 53 (1974). Beason rejected the argument that "such
discrimination is a denial of the equal protection of the laws."  Brief
for Appellant in Davis v. Beason, O. T. 1889, No. 1261, p. 41.
Among the Justices joining in that rejection were the two whose
views in other cases the Court today treats as equal-protection
lodestars--Justice Harlan, who was to proclaim in Plessy v.
Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (dissenting opinion), that the
Constitution "neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens,"
quoted ante, at 1, and Justice Bradley, who had earlier declared that
"class legislation . . . [is] obnoxious to the prohibitions of the
Fourteenth Amendment," Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 24
(1883), quoted ante, at 14.3

This Court cited Beason with approval as recently as 1993, in an
opinion authored by the same Justice who writes for the Court today.
That opinion said: "[A]dverse impact will not always lead to a finding
of impermissible targeting. For example, a social harm may have
been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from
discrimination. . . . See, e.g., . . . Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333
(1890)."  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S.
520, 535  (1993). It remains to be explained how Section 501 of the
Idaho Revised Statutes was not an "impermissible targeting" of
polygamists, but (the much more mild) Amendment 2 is an
"impermissible targeting" of homosexuals. Has the Court concluded
that the perceived social harm of polygamy is a "legitimate concern of
government," and the perceived social harm of homosexuality is not?


I strongly suspect that the answer to the last question is yes, which
leads me to the last point I wish to make: The Court today,
announcing that Amendment 2 "defies... conventional
[constitutional] inquiry," ante, at 10, and "confounds [the] normal
process of judicial review," ante, at 11, employs a constitutional
theory heretofore unknown to frustrate Colorado's reasonable effort
to preserve traditional American moral values. The Court's stern
disapproval of "animosity" towards homosexuality might be
compared with what an earlier Court (including the revered Justices
Harlan and Bradley) said in Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U. S. 15
(1885), rejecting a constitutional challenge to a United States statute
that denied the franchise in federal territories to those who engaged in
polygamous cohabitation:

"[C]ertainly no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and
necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth,
fit to take rank as one of the co-ordinate States of the Union, than that
which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as
consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and
one woman in the holy estate of matrimony; the sure foundation of all
that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that
reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in
social and political improvement."  Id., at 45.

I would not myself indulge in such official praise for heterosexual
monogamy, because I think it no business of the courts (as opposed
to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war.

But the Court today has done so, not only by inventing a novel and
extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the victory away from
traditional forces, but even by verbally disparaging as bigotry
adherence to traditional attitudes. To suggest, for example, that this
constitutional amendment springs from nothing more than "`a bare . .
. desire to harm a politically unpopular group,'" ante, at 13, quoting
Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534 (1973), is
nothing short of insulting. (It is also nothing short of preposterous
to call "politically unpopular" a group which enjoys enormous
influence in American media and politics, and which, as the trial
court here noted, though composing no more than 4% of the
population had the support of 46% of the voters on Amendment 2,
see App. to Pet. for Cert. C-18.)

When the Court takes sides in the culture wars, it tends to be with the
knights rather than the villeins--and more specifically with the
Templars, reflecting the views and values of the lawyer class from
which the Court's Members are drawn. How that class feels about
homosexuality will be evident to anyone who wishes to interview job
applicants at virtually any of the Nation's law schools. The
interviewer may refuse to offer a job because the applicant is a
Republican; because he is an adulterer; because he went to the wrong
prep school or belongs to the wrong country club; because he eats
snails; because he is a womanizer; because she wears real-animal fur;
or even because he hates the Chicago Cubs. But if the interviewer
should wish not to be an associate or partner of an applicant because
he disapproves of the applicant's homosexuality, then he will have
violated the pledge which the Association of American Law Schools
requires all its member-schools to exact from job interviewers:
"assurance of the employer's willingness" to hire homosexuals.
Bylaws of the Association of American Law Schools, Inc. Section 6-
4(b); Executive Committee Regulations of the Association of
American Law Schools Section 6.19, in 1995 Handbook,
Association of American Law Schools. This law-school view of
what "prejudices" must be stamped out may be contrasted with the
more plebeian attitudes that apparently still prevail in the United
States Congress, which has been unresponsive to repeated attempts
to extend to homosexuals the protections of federal civil rights laws,
see, e.g., Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1994, S. 2238,
103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994); Civil Rights Amendments of 1975, H.
R. 5452, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975), and which took the pains to
exclude them specifically from the Americans With Disabilities Act of
1990, see 42 U. S. C. Section 12211(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

*   *   *

Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law,
and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an
entirely reasonable provision which does not even disfavor
homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them
preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal
deterioration of the sexual morality favored by a majority of
Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate
end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it
down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will. I
dissent.


ENDNOTES

1 The Court evidently agrees that "rational basis"--the normal test for
compliance with the Equal Protection Clause--is the governing
standard. The trial court rejected respondents' argument that
homosexuals constitute a "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" class, and
respondents elected not to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court of
Colorado. See Evans v. Romer, 882 P. 2d 1335, 1341, n. 3 (1994).
And the Court implicitly rejects the Supreme Court of Colorado's
holding, see Evans v. Romer, 854 P. 2d 1270, 1282 (1993), that
Amendment 2 infringes upon a "fundamental right" of
"independently identifiable class[es]" to "participate equally in the
political process."  Ante, at 4.

2  The Supreme Court of Colorado stated: "We hold that the portions
of Amendment 2 that would remain if only the provision concerning
sexual orientation were stricken are not autonomous and thus, not
severable," 882 P. 2d, at 1349. That statement was premised,
however, on the proposition that "[the] four characteristics [described
in the Amendment--sexual orientation, conduct, practices, and
relationships] are not truly severable from one another because each
provides nothing more than a different way of identifying the same
class of persons."  Id., at 1349-1350 (emphasis added). As I have
discussed above, if that premise is true--if the entire class affected by
the Amendment takes part in homosexual conduct, practices and
relationships--Bowers alone suffices to answer all constitutional
objections. Separate consideration of persons of homosexual
"orientation" is necessary only if one believes (as the Supreme Court
of Colorado did not) that that is a distinct class.

3 The Court labors mightily to get around Beason, see ante, at 12-13,
but cannot escape the central fact that this Court found the statute at
issue--which went much further than Amendment 2, denying
polygamists not merely special treatment but the right to vote--"not
open to any constitutional or legal objection," rejecting the appellant's
argument (much like the argument of respondents today) that the
statute impermissibly "single[d] him out," Brief for Appellant in
Davis v. Beason, O. T. 1889, No. 1261, p. 41. The Court adopts
my conclusions that (a) insofar as Beason permits the imposition of
adverse consequences based upon mere advocacy, it has been
overruled by subsequent cases, and (b) insofar as Beason holds that
convicted felons may be denied the right to vote, it remains good
law. To these conclusions, it adds something new: the claim that
"[t]o the extent [Beason] held that the groups designated in the statute
may be deprived of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling
could not stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful
outcome."  Ante, at 12-13. But if that is so, it is only because we
have declared the right to vote to be a "fundamental political right,"
see, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336 (1972),
deprivation of which triggers strict scrutiny. Amendment 2, of
course, does not deny the fundamental right to vote, and the Court
rejects the Colorado court's view that there exists a fundamental right
to participate in the political process. Strict scrutiny is thus not in
play here. See ante, at 10. Finally, the Court's suggestion that
Section 501 of the Revised Statutes of Idaho, and Amendment 2,
deny rights on account of "status" (rather than conduct) opens up a
broader debate involving the significance of Bowers to this case, a
debate which the Court is otherwise unwilling to join, see supra, at
6-9.

v.

RHODE ISLAND ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

No. 94-1140.  Argued November 1, 1995-Decided May 13, 1996


Petitioners, a licensed Rhode Island liquor retailer and a licensed
Massachusetts liquor retailer patronized by Rhode Island residents,
filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Rhode Island
laws banning the advertisement of retail liquor prices except at the
place of sale violate the First Amendment. In concluding that the ban
was unconstitutional because it did not directly advance the State's
asserted interest in the promotion of temperance and was more
extensive than necessary to serve that interest, the District Court
reasoned that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial
speech carries the burden of justifying it and that the Twenty-first
Amendment did not shift or diminish that burden. In reversing, the
Court of Appeals, inter alia, found "inherent merit" in the State's
submission that competitive price advertising would ultimately
increase sales, and agreed with it that the Twenty-first Amendment
gave its advertising ban an added presumption of validity.

Held:  The judgment is reversed.

39 F. 3d 5, reversed.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, VII, and VIII, concluding:

1. The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save Rhode Island's price
advertising ban because that Amendment does not qualify the First
Amendment's prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of
speech. Although the Twenty-first Amendment-which repealed
Prohibition and gave the States the power to prohibit commerce in, or
the use of, alcoholic beverages-limits the dormant Commerce
Clause's effect on a State's regulatory power over the delivery or use
of liquor within its borders, the Amendment does not license the
States to ignore their obligations under other constitutional
provisions. See, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S.
691, 712. California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 118-119,
disavowed. Because the First Amendment must be included among
those other provisions, the Twenty-first Amendment does not shield
the advertising ban from constitutional scrutiny. Pp. 28-30.


2. Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of
justifying its complete ban on price advertising, that ban is invalid.
P. 31.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the principal opinion with respect to
Parts III-VI, concluding that Rhode Island's ban on advertisements
that provide the public with accurate information about retail liquor
prices is an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech.
Pp. 8-28.

(a) JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part
III that although the First Amendment protects the dissemination of
truthful and nonmisleading commercial messages about lawful
products and services in order to ensure that consumers receive
accurate information, see, e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 765, the special
nature of commercial speech, including its "greater objectivity" and
"greater hardiness," authorizes the State to regulate potentially
deceptive or overreaching advertising more freely than other forms of
protected speech, see, e.g., id., at 771-772, n. 24, and requires less
than strict review of such regulations, Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566, n. 9.
However, regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in
order to pursue a policy not related to consumer protection must be
reviewed with "special care," and such blanket bans should not be
approved unless the speech itself was flawed in some way, either
because it was deceptive or related to unlawful activity. See ibid.
Pp. 8-13.

(b) JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part IV that a review of the
case law reveals that commercial speech regulations are not all subject
to a similar form of constitutional review simply because they target a
similar category of expression. When a State regulates commercial
messages to protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, or
aggressive sales practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial
consumer information, the regulation's purpose is consistent with the
reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech
and therefore justifies less than strict review. However, where a
State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading
commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a
fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the
rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands. The
special dangers that attend such complete bans-including, most
obviously, the fact that they all but foreclose alternative channels of
communication-present sound reasons that justify more careful
review. Pp. 14-17.

(c) JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part
V that because Rhode Island's advertising ban constitutes a blanket
prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful
product, and serves an end unrelated to consumer protection, it must
be reviewed with "special care" under Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at
566, n. 9. It cannot survive that review because it does not satisfy
even the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial
speech cases under Central Hudson, id., at 566. First, the
advertising ban does not directly advance the State's substantial
interest in promoting temperance. See ibid. Because a commercial
speech regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective
or remote support for the government's purpose, id., at 564, the
State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will
advance its interest, but also that it will do so "to a material degree,"
see, e.g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767. In this case,
therefore, the State must show that the ban will significantly reduce
alcohol consumption, but has presented no evidence to suggest a
significant reduction. Second, the ban is more extensive than
necessary to serve its stated interest, see 447 U. S., at 566, since
alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any speech
restrictions-e.g., the maintenance of higher prices either by direct
regulation or by increased taxation, the rationing of per capita
purchases, or the use of educational campaigns focused on drinking
problems-would be more likely to achieve the goal of promoting
temperance. Thus, the State has failed to establish the requisite
"reasonable fit" between its regulation and its goal. See, e.g., Board
of Trustees, State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480. Pp.
17-21.

(d) JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part
VI that the State's arguments in support of its claim that it merely
exercised appropriate "legislative judgment" in determining that a
price advertising ban would best promote temperance-i.e., (1) that
because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the ban "go both
ways," the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban
constituted a "reasonable choice" by the legislature; (2) that precedent
requires that particular deference be accorded that legislative choice
because the State could, if it chose, ban the sale of alcoholic
beverages outright; and (3) that deference is appropriate because
alcoholic beverages are so-called "vice" products-must be rejected.
See Rubin, 514 U. S., at ___, n. 2. United States v. Edge
Broadcasting, 509 U. S. 418, distinguished; Posadas de Puerto Rico
Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328, distinguished
and disavowed in part. Pp. 22-28.

JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that guidance as to what the First
Amendment forbids, where the core offense of suppressing particular
political ideas is not at issue, must be taken from the long accepted
practices of the American people. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Commission, 514 U. S. ___, ___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since,
however, the Court has before it no evidence as to state legislative
practices regarding regulation of commercial speech when the First
and Fourteenth Amendments were adopted, or even as to any
national consensus on the subject later developed, he would simply
adhere to the Court's existing jurisprudence, which renders the
Rhode Island regulation invalid. Pp. 1-2.

JUSTICE THOMAS concluded that in cases such as this, in which
the government's asserted interest is to keep legal users of a product
or service ignorant in order to manipulate their choices in the
marketplace, the Central Hudson balancing test should not be
applied. Rather, such an "interest" is per se illegitimate, cf., e.g.,
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 768-770, and can no more justify regulation of
"commercial" speech than it can justify regulation of
"noncommercial" speech. Pp. 1-12.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE BREYER, agreed with the
principal opinion that Rhode Island's prohibition on alcohol-price
advertising is invalid and cannot be saved by the Twenty-first
Amendment, but concluded that the First Amendment question must
be resolved more narrowly by applying the test established in Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, 566. Assuming that the prohibition satisfies the test's first
three prongs-i.e., that (1) the speech at issue concerns lawful activity
and is not misleading, (2) the asserted governmental interest is
substantial, and (3) the regulation directly advances the governmental
interest-Rhode Island's regulation fails the final fourth prong because
its ban is more extensive than necessary to serve its stated interest.
Rhode Island justifies its ban on price advertising on the grounds that
the ban is intended to keep alcohol prices high as a way to keep
consumption low. In order for a speech restriction to pass muster
under the fourth prong, there must be a reasonable fit between the
legislature's goal and method. Board of Trustees of State Univ. of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480. The fit here is not reasonable,
since the State has other methods at its disposal-e.g., establishing
minimum prices and/or increasing sales taxes on alcoholic beverages-
that would more directly accomplish its stated goal without intruding
on sellers' ability to provide truthful, nonmisleading information to
customers. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P.
R., 478 U. S. 328, 341-344, distinguished. The principal opinion
errs in adopting a new analysis for the evaluation of commercial
speech regulation. Pp. 1-7.

the opinion of the Court with respects to Parts I, II, and VII, in
which SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, THOMAS, and
GINSBURG, JJ., joined, the opinion of the Court with respect to

RHODE ISLAND AND RHODE ISLAND
LIQUOR STORES ASSOCIATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[May 13, 1996]

JUSTICE STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court and
delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, VII, and
VIII, an opinion with respect to Parts III and V, in which JUSTICE
KENNEDY, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join,
an opinion with respect to Part VI, in which JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, and an
opinion with respect to Part IV, in which JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE GINSBURG join.

Last Term we held that a federal law abridging a brewer's right to
provide the public with accurate information about the alcoholic
content of malt beverages is unconstitutional. Rubin v. Coors
Brewing Co., 514 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 14). We now
hold that Rhode Island's statutory prohibition against advertisements
that provide the public with accurate information about retail prices of
alcoholic beverages is also invalid. Our holding rests on the
conclusion that such an advertising ban is an abridgment of speech
protected by the First Amendment and that it is not shielded from
constitutional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment.1

In 1956, the Rhode Island Legislature enacted two separate
prohibitions against advertising the retail price of alcoholic
beverages. The first applies to vendors licensed in Rhode Island as
well as to out-of-state manufacturers, wholesalers, and shippers. It
prohibits them from "advertising in any manner whatsoever" the
price of any alcoholic beverage offered for sale in the State; the only
exception is for price tags or signs displayed with the merchandise
within licensed premises and not visible from the street.2   The
second statute applies to the Rhode Island news media. It contains a
categorical prohibition against the publication or broadcast of any
advertisements-even those referring to sales in other States-that
"make reference to the price of any alcoholic beverages."3

In two cases decided in 1985, the Rhode Island Supreme Court
reviewed the constitutionality of these two statutes. In S&S Liquor
Mart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d 729 (R. I.), a liquor retailer located
in Westerly, Rhode Island, a town that borders the State of
Connecticut, having been advised that his license would be revoked
if he advertised his prices in a Connecticut paper, sought to enjoin
enforcement of the first statute. Over the dissent of one Justice, the
court upheld the statute. It concluded that the statute served the
substantial state interest in "`the promotion of temperance.'"4   Id., at
737. Because the plaintiff failed to prove that the statute did not
serve that interest, the court held that he had not carried his burden of
establishing a violation of the First Amendment. In response to the
dissent's argument that the court had placed the burden on the wrong
party, the majority reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment gave
the statute "`an added presumption [of] validity.'"  S&S Liquor Mart,
Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d, at 732. Although that presumption had
not been overcome in that case, the State Supreme Court assumed
that in a future case the record might "support the proposition that
these advertising restrictions do not further temperance objectives."
Id., at 734.

In Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call Pub. Co., 497
A. 2d 331 (R. I. 1985), the plaintiff association5  sought to enjoin
the publisher of the local newspaper in Woonsocket, Rhode Island,
from accepting advertisements disclosing the retail price of alcoholic
beverages being sold across the state line in Millville, Massachusetts.
In upholding the injunction, the State Supreme Court adhered to its
reasoning in the Pastore case and rejected the argument that the
statute neither "directly advanced" the state interest in promoting
temperance, nor was "more extensive than necessary to serve that
interest" as required by this Court's decision in Central Hudson Gas
& Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557,
563 (1980). It assumed the existence of other, "perhaps more
effective means" of achieving the State's "goal of temperance", but
concluded that it was "not unreasonable for the State of Rhode Island
to believe that price advertising will result in increased sales of
alcoholic beverages generally."  Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v.
Evening Call Pub. Co., 497 A. 2d, at 336.

Petitioners 44 Liquormart, Inc. (44 Liquormart), and Peoples Super
Liquor Stores, Inc. (Peoples), are licensed retailers of alcoholic
beverages. Petitioner 44 Liquormart operates a store in Rhode Island
and petitioner Peoples operates several stores in Massachusetts that
are patronized by Rhode Island residents. Peoples uses alcohol price
advertising extensively in Massachusetts, where such advertising is
permitted, but Rhode Island newspapers and other media outlets have
refused to accept such ads.

Complaints from competitors about an advertisement placed by 44
Liquormart in a Rhode Island newspaper in 1991 generated
enforcement proceedings that in turn led to the initiation of this
litigation. The advertisement did not state the price of any alcoholic
beverages. Indeed, it noted that "State law prohibits advertising
liquor prices." The ad did, however, state the low prices at which
peanuts, potato chips, and Schweppes mixers were being offered,
identify various brands of packaged liquor, and include the word
"WOW" in large letters next to pictures of vodka and rum bottles.
Based on the conclusion that the implied reference to bargain prices
for liquor violated the statutory ban on price advertising, the Rhode
Island Liquor Control Administrator assessed a $400 fine.

After paying the fine, 44 Liquormart, joined by Peoples, filed this
action against the administrator in the Federal District Court seeking a
declaratory judgment that the two statutes and the administrator's
implementing regulations violate the First Amendment and other
provisions of federal law. The Rhode Island Liquor Stores
Association was allowed to intervene as a defendant and in due
course the State of Rhode Island replaced the administrator as the
principal defendant. The parties stipulated that the price advertising
ban is vigorously enforced, that Rhode Island permits "all advertising
of alcoholic beverages excepting references to price outside the
licensed premises," and that petitioners' proposed ads do not concern
an illegal activity and presumably would not be false or misleading.
44 Liquour Mart, Inc. v. Racine, 829 F. Supp. 543, 545 (R. I.
1993). The parties disagreed, however, about the impact of the ban
on the promotion of temperance in Rhode Island. On that question
the District Court heard conflicting expert testimony and reviewed a
number of studies.

In his findings of fact, the District Judge first noted that there was a
pronounced lack of unanimity among researchers who have studied
the impact of advertising on the level of consumption of alcoholic
beverages. He referred to a 1985 Federal Trade Commission study
that found no evidence that alcohol advertising significantly affects
alcohol abuse. Another study indicated that Rhode Island ranks in
the upper 30% of States in per capita consumption of alcoholic
beverages; alcohol consumption is lower in other States that allow
price advertising. After summarizing the testimony of the expert
witnesses for both parties, he found "as a fact that Rhode Island's
off-premises liquor price advertising ban has no significant impact on
levels of alcohol consumption in Rhode Island."  Id., at 549.

As a matter of law, he concluded that the price advertising ban was
unconstitutional because it did not "directly advance" the State's
interest in reducing alcohol consumption and was "more extensive
than necessary to serve that interest."  Id., at 555. He reasoned that
the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries
the burden of justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did
not shift or diminish that burden. Acknowledging that it might have
been reasonable for the state legislature to "assume a correlation
between the price advertising ban and reduced consumption," he held
that more than a rational basis was required to justify the speech
restriction, and that the State had failed to demonstrate a reasonable
"`fit'" between its policy objectives and its chosen means. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals reversed. It found "inherent merit" in the
State's submission that competitive price advertising would lower
prices and that lower prices would produce more sales. 39 F. 3d 5,
7 (CA1 1994). Moreover, it agreed with the reasoning of the Rhode
Island Supreme Court that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the
statutes an added presumption of validity. Id., at 8. Alternatively, it
concluded that reversal was compelled by this Court's summary
action in Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n of
Ohio, 459 U. S. 807 (1982). See 39 F. 3d, at 8. In that case the
Court dismissed the appeal from a decision of the Ohio Supreme
Court upholding a prohibition against off-premises advertising of the
prices of alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. See Queensgate
Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n of Ohio, 69 Ohio St. 2d
361, 433 N. E. 2d 138 (1982).

Queensgate has been both followed and distinguished in subsequent
cases reviewing the validity of similar advertising bans.6   We are
now persuaded that the importance of the First Amendment issue, as
well the suggested relevance of the Twenty-first Amendment, merits
more thorough analysis than it received when we refused to accept
jurisdiction of the Queensgate appeal. We therefore granted
certiorari. 514 U. S. ___ (1995).

Advertising has been a part of our culture throughout our history.
Even in colonial days, the public relied on "commercial speech" for
vital information about the market. Early newspapers displayed
advertisements for goods and services on their front pages, and town
criers called out prices in public squares. See J. Wood, The Story of
Advertising 21, 45-69, 85 (1958); J. Smith, Printers and Press
Freedom 49 (1988). Indeed, commercial messages played such a
central role in public life prior to the Founding that Benjamin
Franklin authored his early defense of a free press in support of his
decision to print, of all things, an advertisement for voyages to
Barbados. Franklin, An Apology for Printers, June 10, 1731,
reprinted in 2 Writings of Benjamin Franklin 172 (1907).

In accord with the role that commercial messages have long played,
the law has developed to ensure that advertising provides consumers
with accurate information about the availability of goods and
services. In the early years, the common law, and later, statutes,
served the consumers' interest in the receipt of accurate information
in the commercial market by prohibiting fraudulent and misleading
advertising. It was not until the 1970's, however, that this Court
held that the First Amendment protected the dissemination of truthful
and nonmisleading commercial messages about lawful products and
services. See generally Kozinski & Banner, The Anti-History and
Pre-History of Commercial Speech, 71 Texas L. Rev. 747 (1993).

In Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), we held that it was
error to assume that commercial speech was entitled to no First
Amendment protection or that it was without value in the marketplace
of ideas. Id., at 825-826. The following Term in Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.
748 (1976), we expanded on our holding in Bigelow and held that
the State's blanket ban on advertising the price of prescription drugs
violated the First Amendment.

Virginia Pharmacy Bd. reflected the conclusion that the same interest
that supports regulation of potentially misleading advertising, namely
the public's interest in receiving accurate commercial information,
also supports an interpretation of the First Amendment that provides
constitutional protection for the dissemination of accurate and
nonmisleading commercial messages. We explained:

"Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may
seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is
producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what
price. So long as we preserve a predominantly free enterprise
economy, the allocation of our resources in large measure will be
made through numerous private economic decisions. It is a matter of
public interest that those decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent
and well informed. To this end, the free flow of commercial
information is indispensable."  Id., at 765.7 The opinion further
explained that a State's paternalistic assumption that the public will
use truthful, nonmisleading commercial information unwisely cannot
justify a decision to suppress it:

"There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic
approach. That alternative is to assume that this information is not in
itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests if
only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that
end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close
them. If they are truly open, nothing prevents the `professional'
pharmacist from marketing his own assertedly superior product, and
contrasting it with that of the low-cost, high-volume prescription
drug retailer. But the choice among these alternative approaches is
not ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly's. It is precisely
this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information,
and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the First
Amendment makes for us."  Id. at 770.

On the basis of these principles, our early cases uniformly struck
down several broadly based bans on truthful, nonmisleading
commercial speech, each of which served ends unrelated to consumer
protection.8   Indeed, one of those cases expressly likened the
rationale that Virginia Pharmacy Bd. employed to the one that Justice
Brandeis adopted in his concurrence in Whitney v. California, 274
U. S. 357 (1927). See Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro,
431 U. S. 85, 97 (1977). There, Justice Brandeis wrote, in
explaining his objection to a prohibition of political speech, that "the
remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. Only an
emergency can justify repression."  Whitney, 274 U. S., at 377; see
also Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977)
(applying test for suppressing political speech set forth in
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969)).

At the same time, our early cases recognized that the State may
regulate some types of commercial advertising more freely than other
forms of protected speech. Specifically, we explained that the State
may require commercial messages to "appear in such a form, or
include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as
are necessary to prevent its being deceptive," Virginia Pharmacy Bd.,
425 U. S., at 772, n. 24, and that it may restrict some forms of
aggressive sales practices that have the potential to exert "undue
influence" over consumers. See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.
S. 350, 366 (1977).


Virginia Pharmacy Bd. attributed the State's authority to impose
these regulations in part to certain "commonsense differences" that
exist between commercial messages and other types of protected
expression. 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24. Our opinion noted that the
greater "objectivity" of commercial speech justifies affording the
State more freedom to distinguish false commercial advertisements
from true ones, ibid. and that the greater "hardiness" of commercial
speech, inspired as it is by the profit motive, likely diminishes the
chilling effect that may attend its regulation, ibid.

Subsequent cases explained that the State's power to regulate
commercial transactions justifies its concomitant power to regulate
commercial speech that is "linked inextricably" to those transactions.
Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U. S. 1, 10, n. 9 (1979); Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978) (commercial speech
"occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation. .
."). As one commentator has explained: "The entire commercial
speech doctrine, after all, represents an accommodation between the
right to speak and hear expression about goods and services and the
right of government to regulate the sales of such goods and
services."  L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Section 12-15, p.
903 (2d ed. 1988). Nevertheless, as we explained in Linmark, the
State retains less regulatory authority when its commercial speech
restrictions strike at "the substance of the information communicated"
rather than the "commercial aspect of [it]with offerors communicating
offers to offerees."  See Linmark 431 U. S., at 96; Carey v.
Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701, n. 28 (1977).

In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), we took stock of our developing
commercial speech jurisprudence. In that case, we considered a
regulation "completely" banning all promotional advertising by
electric utilities. Ibid. Our decision acknowledged the special
features of commercial speech but identified the serious First
Amendment concerns that attend blanket advertising prohibitions that
do not protect consumers from commercial harms.

Five Members of the Court recognized that the state interest in the
conservation of energy was substantial, and that there was "an
immediate connection between advertising and demand for
electricity." Id., at 569. Nevertheless, they concluded that the
regulation was invalid because the Commission had failed to make a
showing that a more limited speech regulation would not have
adequately served the State's interest. Id., at 571.9

In reaching its conclusion, the majority explained that although the
special nature of commercial speech may require less than strict
review of its regulation, special concerns arise from "regulations that
entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-
related policy."  Id., at 566, n. 9. In those circumstances, "a ban on
speech could screen from public view the underlying governmental
policy."  Ibid. As a result, the Court concluded that "special care"
should attend the review of such blanket bans, and it pointedly
remarked that "in recent years this Court has not approved a blanket
ban on commercial speech unless the speech itself was flawed in
some way, either because it was deceptive or related to unlawful
activity."  Ibid.10


As our review of the case law reveals, Rhode Island errs in
concluding that all commercial speech regulations are subject to a
similar form of constitutional review simply because they target a
similar category of expression. The mere fact that messages propose
commercial transactions does not in and of itself dictate the
constitutional analysis that should apply to decisions to suppress
them. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at ___-___
(slip op., at 1-3) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).

When a State regulates commercial messages to protect consumers
from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or requires
the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the purpose of its
regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional
protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict
review. However, when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination
of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons
unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far
less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First
Amendment generally demands.

Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech
regulation more carefully. Most obviously, complete speech bans,
unlike content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, or manner of
expression, see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 89 (1949), are
particularly dangerous because they all but foreclose alternative
means of disseminating certain information.

Our commercial speech cases have recognized the dangers that attend
governmental attempts to single out certain messages for
suppression. For example, in Linmark, 431 U. S., at 92-94, we
concluded that a ban on "For Sale" signs was "content based" and
failed to leave open "satisfactory" alternative channels of
communication; see also Virginia Pharmacy Bd., 425 U. S., at 771.
Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain
form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of
communication open to Florida lawyers. Florida Bar v. Went For It,
Inc., 515 U. S. ___, ___-___ (1995) (slip op., at 15-16).11

The special dangers that attend complete bans on truthful,
nonmisleading commercial speech cannot be explained away by
appeals to the "commonsense distinctions" that exist between
commercial and noncommercial speech. Virginia Pharmacy Bd., 425
U. S., at 771, n. 24. Regulations that suppress the truth are no less
troubling because they target objectively verifiable information, nor
are they less effective because they aim at durable messages. As a
result, neither the "greater objectivity" nor the "greater hardiness" of
truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its
complete suppression with added deference. Ibid.

It is the State's interest in protecting consumers from "commercial
harms" that provides "the typical reason why commercial speech can
be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial
speech." Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426
(1993). Yet bans that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial
messages rarely protect consumers from such harms.12   Instead,
such bans often serve only to obscure an "underlying governmental
policy" that could be implemented without regulating speech. Central
Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9. In this way, these commercial
speech bans not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate
over central issues of public policy. See id., at 575 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in judgment).13

Precisely because bans against truthful, nonmisleading commercial
speech rarely seek to protect consumers from either deception or
overreaching, they usually rest solely on the offensive assumption
that the public will respond "irrationally" to the truth. Linmark, 431
U. S., at 96. The First Amendment directs us to be especially
skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what
the government perceives to be their own good. That teaching
applies equally to state attempts to deprive consumers of accurate
information about their chosen products:

"The commercial market-place, like other spheres of our social and
cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.
Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth.
But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the
government, assess the value of the information presented. Thus,
even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial
transaction is entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment. See
Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 762."  Edenfield v. Fane,
507 U. S. 761, 767 (1993).

See also Linmark, 431 U. S. at 96 (1977); Rubin v. Coors Brewing
Co., 514 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment);
Tribe, American Constitutional Law Section 12-2, at 790, and n. 11.


In this case, there is no question that Rhode Island's price advertising
ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading
speech about a lawful product. There is also no question that the ban
serves an end unrelated to consumer protection. Accordingly, we
must review the price advertising ban with "special care," Central
Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9, mindful that speech prohibitions of
this type rarely survive constitutional review. Ibid.

The State argues that the price advertising prohibition should
nevertheless be upheld because it directly advances the State's
substantial interest in promoting temperance, and because it is no
more extensive than necessary. Cf. Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at
566. Although there is some confusion as to what Rhode Island
means by temperance, we assume that the State asserts an interest in
reducing alcohol consumption.14

In evaluating the ban's effectiveness in advancing the State's interest,
we note that a commercial speech regulation "may not be sustained if
it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's
purpose."  Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564. For that reason, the
State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will
advance its interest, but also that it will do so "to a material degree."
Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771; see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,
514 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8-9). The need for the State to make
such a showing is particularly great given the drastic nature of its
chosen means-the wholesale suppression of truthful, nonmisleading
information. Accordingly, we must determine whether the State has
shown that the price advertising ban will significantly reduce alcohol
consumption.

We can agree that common sense supports the conclusion that a
prohibition against price advertising, like a collusive agreement
among competitors to refrain from such advertising,15  will tend to
mitigate competition and maintain prices at a higher level than would
prevail in a completely free market. Despite the absence of proof on
the point, we can even agree with the State's contention that it is
reasonable to assume that demand, and hence consumption
throughout the market, is somewhat lower whenever a higher,
noncompetitive price level prevails. However, without any findings
of fact, or indeed any evidentiary support whatsoever, we cannot
agree with the assertion that the price advertising ban will
significantly advance the State's interest in promoting temperance.

Although the record suggests that the price advertising ban may have
some impact on the purchasing patterns of temperate drinkers of
modest means, 829 F. Supp., at 546, the State has presented no
evidence to suggest that its speech prohibition will significantly
reduce market-wide consumption.16   Indeed, the District Court's
considered and uncontradicted finding on this point is directly to the
contrary. Id., at 549.17  Moreover, the evidence suggests that the
abusive drinker will probably not be deterred by a marginal price
increase, and that the true alcoholic may simply reduce his purchases
of other necessities.

In addition, as the District Court noted, the State has not identified
what price level would lead to a significant reduction in alcohol
consumption, nor has it identified the amount that it believes prices
would decrease without the ban. Ibid. Thus, the State's own
showing reveals that any connection between the ban and a
significant change in alcohol consumption would be purely
fortuitous.

As is evident, any conclusion that elimination of the ban would
significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to
engage in the sort of "speculation or conjecture" that is an
unacceptable means of demonstrating that a restriction on commercial
speech directly advances the State's asserted interest. Edenfield, 507
U. S., at 770.18   Such speculation certainly does not suffice when
the State takes aim at accurate commercial information for
paternalistic ends.

The State also cannot satisfy the requirement that its restriction on
speech be no more extensive than necessary. It is perfectly obvious
that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any
restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the State's goal
of promoting temperance. As the State's own expert conceded,
higher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by
increased taxation. 829 F. Supp., at 549. Per capita purchases
could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs. Even
educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or even
moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.

As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally
applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a
"reasonable fit" between its abridgment of speech and its temperance
goal. Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.
469, 480 (1989); see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 15) (explaining that defects in a federal ban on
alcohol advertising are "further highlighted by the availability of
alternatives that would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment's
protections for commercial speech"); Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97
(suggesting that the State use financial incentives or counter-speech,
rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests). It necessarily
follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more
stringent constitutional review that Central Hudson itself concluded
was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful,
nonmisleading commercial speech. Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at
566, n. 9.


The State responds by arguing that it merely exercised appropriate
"legislative judgment" in determining that a price advertising ban
would best promote temperance. Relying on the Central Hudson
analysis set forth in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism
Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), and United States v. Edge
Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. ___ (1993), Rhode Island first argues
that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price
advertising ban "go both ways," the Court of Appeals correctly
concluded that the ban constituted a "reasonable choice" by the
legislature. 39 F. 3d, at 7. The State next contends that precedent
requires us to give particular deference to that legislative choice
because the State could, if it chose, ban the sale of alcoholic
beverages outright. See Posadas, 478 U. S., at 345-346. Finally,
the State argues that deference is appropriate because alcoholic
beverages are so-called "vice" products. See Edge, 509 U. S. ___
(slip op., at ___); Posadas, 478 U. S., at 346-347. We consider
each of these contentions in turn.


The State's first argument fails to justify the speech prohibition at
issue. Our commercial speech cases recognize some room for the
exercise of legislative judgment. See Metromedia, Inc. v. San
Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 507-508 (1981). However, Rhode Island
errs in concluding that Edge and Posadas establish the degree of
deference that its decision to impose a price advertising ban warrants.

In Edge, we upheld a federal statute that permitted only those
broadcasters located in States that had legalized lotteries to air lottery
advertising. The statute was designed to regulate advertising about
an activity that had been deemed illegal in the jurisdiction in which
the broadcaster was located. 509 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14-15).
Here, by contrast, the commercial speech ban targets information
about entirely lawful behavior.

Posadas is more directly relevant. There, a five-Member majority
held that, under the Central Hudson test, it was "up to the legislature"
to choose to reduce gambling by suppressing in-state casino
advertising rather than engaging in educational speech. Posadas, 478
U. S., at 344. Rhode Island argues that this logic demonstrates the
constitutionality of its own decision to ban price advertising in lieu of
raising taxes or employing some other less speech-restrictive means
of promoting temperance.

The reasoning in Posadas does support the State's argument, but, on
reflection, we are now persuaded that Posadas erroneously
performed the First Amendment analysis. The casino advertising ban
was designed to keep truthful, nonmisleading speech from members
of the public for fear that they would be more likely to gamble if they
received it. As a result, the advertising ban served to shield the
State's antigambling policy from the public scrutiny that more direct,
nonspeech regulation would draw. See Posadas, 478 U. S., at 351
(Brennan, J., dissenting).

Given our longstanding hostility to commercial speech regulation of
this type, Posadas clearly erred in concluding that it was "up to the
legislature" to choose suppression over a less speech-restrictive
policy. The Posadas majority's conclusion on that point cannot be
reconciled with the unbroken line of prior cases striking down
similarly broad regulations on truthful, nonmisleading advertising
when non-speech-related alternatives were available. See Posadas,
478 U. S., at 350 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (listing cases); Kurland,
Posadas de Puerto Rico v. Tourism Company: "`Twas Strange,
`Twas Passing Strange; `Twas Pitiful, `Twas Wondrous Pitiful,"
1986 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 12-15.

Because the 5-to-4 decision in Posadas marked such a sharp break
from our prior precedent, and because it concerned a constitutional
question about which this Court is the final arbiter, we decline to give
force to its highly deferential approach.     Instead, in keeping with
our prior holdings, we conclude that a state legislature does not have
the broad discretion to suppress truthful, nonmisleading information
for paternalistic purposes that the Posadas majority was willing to
tolerate. As we explained in Virginia Pharmacy Bd., "[i]t is precisely
this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information,
and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the First
Amendment makes for us."  425 U. S., at 770.

We also cannot accept the State's second contention, which is
premised entirely on the "greater-includes-the-lesser" reasoning
endorsed toward the end of the majority's opinion in Posadas.
There, the majority stated that "the greater power to completely ban
casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban
advertising of casino gambling."  478 U. S., at 345-346. It went on
to state that "because the government could have enacted a wholesale
prohibition of [casino gambling] it is permissible for the government
to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct, but reducing
the demand through restrictions on advertising."  Id., at 346. The
majority concluded that it would "surely be a strange constitutional
doctrine which would concede to the legislature the authority to
totally ban a product or activity, but deny to the legislature the
authority to forbid the stimulation of demand for the product or
activity through advertising on behalf of those who would profit
from such increased demand."  Ibid. On the basis of these
statements, the State reasons that its undisputed authority to ban
alcoholic beverages must include the power to restrict advertisements
offering them for sale.

In Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. ___ (1995), the United
States advanced a similar argument as a basis for supporting a
statutory prohibition against revealing the alcoholic content of malt
beverages on product labels. We rejected the argument, noting that
the statement in the Posadas opinion was made only after the majority
had concluded that the Puerto Rican regulation "survived the Central
Hudson test."  514 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at 5, n. 2). Further
consideration persuades us that the "greater-includes-the-lesser"
argument should be rejected for the additional and more important
reason that it is inconsistent with both logic and well-settled doctrine.

Although we do not dispute the proposition that greater powers
include lesser ones, we fail to see how that syllogism requires the
conclusion that the State's power to regulate commercial activity is
"greater" than its power to ban truthful, nonmisleading commercial
speech. Contrary to the assumption made in Posadas, we think it
quite clear that banning speech may sometimes prove far more
intrusive than banning conduct. As a venerable proverb teaches, it
may prove more injurious to prevent people from teaching others
how to fish than to prevent fish from being sold.19 Similarly, a local
ordinance banning bicycle lessons may curtail freedom far more than
one that prohibits bicycle riding within city limits. In short, we reject
the assumption that words are necessarily less vital to freedom than
actions, or that logic somehow proves that the power to prohibit an
activity is necessarily "greater" than the power to suppress speech
about it.

As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, the Posadas syllogism is
even less defensible. The text of the First Amendment makes clear
that the Constitution presumes that attempts to regulate speech are
more dangerous than attempts to regulate conduct. That presumption
accords with the essential role that the free flow of information plays
in a democratic society. As a result, the First Amendment directs that
government may not suppress speech as easily as it may suppress
conduct, and that speech restrictions cannot be treated as simply
another means that the government may use to achieve its ends.

These basic First Amendment principles clearly apply to commercial
speech; indeed, the Posadas majority impliedly conceded as much by
applying the Central Hudson test. Thus, it is no answer that
commercial speech concerns products and services that the
government may freely regulate. Our decisions from Virginia
Pharmacy Bd. on have made plain that a State's regulation of the sale
of goods differs in kind from a State's regulation of accurate
information about those goods. The distinction that our cases have
consistently drawn between these two types of governmental action
is fundamentally incompatible with the absolutist view that the State
may ban commercial speech simply because it may constitutionally
prohibit the underlying conduct.20

That the State has chosen to license its liquor retailers does not
change the analysis. Even though government is under no obligation
to provide a person, or the public, a particular benefit, it does not
follow that conferral of the benefit may be conditioned on the
surrender of a constitutional right. See, e.g., Frost & Frost Trucking
Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 594 (1926). In
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972), relying on a host of
cases applying that principle during the preceding quarter-century,
the Court explained that government "may not deny a benefit to a
person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected
interests-especially his interest in freedom of speech." Id., at 597.
That teaching clearly applies to state attempts to regulate commercial
speech, as our cases striking down bans on truthful, nonmisleading
speech by licensed professionals attest. See, e.g., Bates v. State Bar
of Ariz., 433 U. S., at 355; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976).

Thus, just as it is perfectly clear that Rhode Island could not ban all
obscene liquor ads except those that advocated temperance, we think
it equally clear that its power to ban the sale of liquor entirely does
not include a power to censor all advertisements that contain accurate
and nonmisleading information about the price of the product. As the
entire Court apparently now agrees, the statements in the Posadas
opinion on which Rhode Island relies are no longer persuasive.

Finally, we find unpersuasive the State's contention that, under
Posadas and Edge, the price advertising ban should be upheld
because it targets commercial speech that pertains to a "vice" activity.
The appellees premise their request for a so-called "vice" exception to
our commercial speech doctrine on language in Edge which
characterized gambling as a "vice". Edge, 507 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at ___); see also Posadas, 478 U. S., at 346-347. The
respondents misread our precedent. Our decision last Term striking
down an alcohol-related advertising restriction effectively rejected the
very contention respondents now make. See Rubin v. Coors
Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at ___, ___, n. 2.

Moreover, the scope of any "vice" exception to the protection
afforded by the First Amendment would be difficult, if not
impossible, to define. Almost any product that poses some threat to
public health or public morals might reasonably be characterized by a
state legislature as relating to "vice activity". Such characterization,
however, is anomalous when applied to products such as alcoholic
beverages, lottery tickets, or playing cards, that may be lawfully
purchased on the open market. The recognition of such an exception
would also have the unfortunate consequence of either allowing state
legislatures to justify censorship by the simple expedient of placing
the "vice" label on selected lawful activities, or requiring the federal
courts to establish a federal common law of vice. See Kurland, 1986
S. Ct. Rev., at 15. For these reasons, a "vice" label that is
unaccompanied by a corresponding prohibition against the
commercial behavior at issue fails to provide a principled justification
for the regulation of commercial speech about that activity.


From 1919 until 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution
totally prohibited "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of
intoxicating liquors" in the United States and its territories. Section 1
of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed that prohibition, and Section
2 delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in,
or the use of, alcoholic beverages.21   The States' regulatory power
over this segment of commerce is therefore largely "unfettered by the
Commerce Clause." Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U. S. 132, 138
(1939).

As is clear, the text of the Twenty-first Amendment supports the
view that, while it grants the States authority over commerce that
might otherwise be reserved to the Federal Government, it places no
limit whatsoever on other constitutional provisions. Nevertheless,
Rhode Island argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that in this
case the Twenty-first Amendment tilts the First Amendment analysis
in the State's favor. See 39 F. 3d, at 7-8.

In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our
decision in California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 (1972).22   In
LaRue, five Members of the Court relied on the Twenty-first
Amendment to buttress the conclusion that the First Amendment did
not invalidate California's prohibition of certain grossly sexual
exhibitions in premises licensed to serve alcoholic beverages.
Specifically, the opinion stated that the Twenty-first Amendment
required that the prohibition be given an added presumption in favor
of its validity. See id., at 118-119. We are now persuaded that the
Court's analysis in LaRue would have led to precisely the same result
if it had placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment.

Entirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, the State has ample
power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate
locations. Moreover, in subsequent cases the Court has recognized
that the States' inherent police powers provide ample authority to
restrict the kind of "bacchanalian revelries" described in the LaRue
opinion regardless of whether alcoholic beverages are involved. Id.,
at 118; see, e.g., Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S.
50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991). As
we recently noted: "LaRue did not involve commercial speech about
alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in
places where alcohol was served."  Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,
514 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at 4, n. 2).

Without questioning the holding in LaRue, we now disavow its
reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment. As we
explained in a case decided more than a decade after LaRue, although
the Twenty-first Amendment limits the effect of the dormant
Commerce Clause on a State's regulatory power over the delivery or
use of intoxicating beverages within its borders, "the Amendment
does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other
provisions of the Constitution."  Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,
467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984). That general conclusion reflects our
specific holdings that the Twenty-first Amendment does not in any
way diminish the force of the Supremacy Clause, id., at 712;
California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,
445 U. S. 97, 112-114 (1980), the Establishment Clause, Larkin v.
Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982), or the Equal
Protection Clause, Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 209 (1976). We
see no reason why the First Amendment should not also be included
in that list. Accordingly, we now hold that the Twenty-first
Amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against
laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the First
Amendment. The Twenty-first Amendment, therefore, cannot save
Rhode Island's ban on liquor price advertising.


Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of
justifying its complete ban on price advertising, we conclude that R.
I. Gen. Laws Sections 3-8-7 and 3-8-8.1, as well as Regulation 32
of the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administration, abridge speech
in violation of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.

It is so ordered.

STORES, INC., PETITIONERS

v.

RHODE ISLAND AND RHODE ISLAND
LIQUOR STORES ASSOCIATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[May 13, 1996]

JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.

I share JUSTICE THOMAS's discomfort with the Central Hudson
test, which seems to me to have nothing more than policy intuition to
support it. I also share JUSTICE STEVENS' aversion towards
paternalistic governmental policies that prevent men and women from
hearing facts that might not be good for them. On the other hand, it
would also be paternalism for us to prevent the people of the States
from enacting laws that we consider paternalistic, unless we have
good reason to believe that the Constitution itself forbids them. I will
take my guidance as to what the Constitution forbids, with regard to
a text as indeterminate as the First Amendment's preservation of "the
freedom of speech," and where the core offense of suppressing
particular political ideas is not at issue, from the long accepted
practices of the American people. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Comm'n, 514 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

The briefs and arguments of the parties in the present case provide no
illumination on that point; understandably so, since both sides
accepted Central Hudson. The amicus brief on behalf of the
American Advertising Federation et al. did examine various
expressions of view at the time the First Amendment was adopted;
they are consistent with First Amendment protection for commercial
speech, but certainly not dispositive. I consider more relevant the
state legislative practices prevalent at the time the First Amendment
was adopted, since almost all of the States had free-speech
constitutional guarantees of their own, whose meaning was not likely
to have been different from the federal constitutional provision
derived from them. Perhaps more relevant still are the state legislative
practices at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, since it
is most improbable that that adoption was meant to overturn any
existing national consensus regarding free speech. Indeed, it is rare
that any nationwide practice would develop contrary to a proper
understanding of the First Amendment itself-for which reason I think
also relevant any national consensus that had formed regarding state
regulation of advertising after the Fourteenth Amendment, and before
this Court's entry into the field. The parties and their amici provide
no evidence on these points.

Since I do not believe we have before us the wherewithal to declare
Central Hudson wrong-or at least the wherewithal to say what ought
to replace it-I must resolve this case in accord with our existing
jurisprudence, which all except JUSTICE THOMAS agree would
prohibit the challenged regulation. I am not disposed to develop new
law, or reinforce old, on this issue, and accordingly I merely concur
in the judgment of the Court. I believe, however, that JUSTICE
STEVENS' treatment of the application of the Twenty-First
Amendment to this case is correct, and accordingly join Parts I, II,
VII, and VIII of JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion.

44 LIQUORMART, INC. AND PEOPLES SUPER LIQUOR
STORES, INC., PETITIONERS

v.

RHODE ISLAND AND RHODE ISLAND
LIQUOR STORES ASSOCIATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[May 13, 1996]

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in Parts I, II, VI, and VII, and
concurring in the judgment.

In cases such as this, in which the government's asserted interest is
to keep legal users of a product or service ignorant in order to
manipulate their choices in the marketplace, the balancing test
adopted in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), should not be applied, in
my view. Rather, such an "interest" is per se illegitimate and can no
more justify regulation of "commercial" speech than it can justify
regulation of "noncommercial" speech.


In Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976), this Court held that
speech that does "`no more than propose a commercial transaction'"
was protected by the First Amendment, and struck down a ban on
price advertising regarding prescription drugs. The Court asserted
that a "particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial
information" may be as keen as, or keener than, his interest in "the
day's most urgent political debate," id., at 763, and that "the proper
allocation of resources" in our free enterprise system requires that
consumer decisions be "intelligent and well informed."  Id., at 765.
The Court also explained that, unless consumers are kept informed
about the operations of the free market system, they cannot form
"intelligent opinions as to how that system ought to be regulated or
altered."  Ibid. See also id., at 765-766, nn. 19-20.1   The Court
sharply rebuffed the State's argument that consumers would make
irresponsible choices if they were able to choose between higher
priced but higher quality pharmaceuticals accompanied by high
quality prescription monitoring services resulting from a "stable
pharmacist-customer relationshi[p]," id., at 768, on the one hand,
and cheaper but lower quality pharmaceuticals unaccompanied by
such services, on the other:

"[T]he State's protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on
the advantages of their being kept in ignorance. The advertising ban
does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other.
It affects them only through the reactions it is assumed people will
have to the free flow of drug price information.

"There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic
approach. That alternative is to assume that information is not in
itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests, if
only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that
end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close
them. . . . It is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of
suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely
available, that the First Amendment makes for us. . . . Virginia is
free to require whatever professional standards it wishes of its
pharmacists; it may subsidize them or protect them from competition
in other ways. But it may not do so by keeping the public in
ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that competing pharmacists are
offering. In this sense, the justifications Virginia has offered for
suppressing the flow of prescription drug price information, far from
persuading us that the flow is not protected by the First Amendment,
have reinforced our view that it is."  Id., at 769-770 (citation
omitted).

The Court opined that false or misleading advertising was not
protected, on the grounds that the accuracy of advertising claims may
be more readily verifiable than is the accuracy of political or other
claims, and that "commercial" speech is made more durable by its
profit motive. Id., at 771, and n. 24. The Court also made clear that
it did not envision protection for advertising that proposes an illegal
transaction. Id., at 772-773 (distinguishing Pittsburgh Press Co. v.
Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973)).

In case after case following Virginia Pharmacy Bd., the Court, and
individual Members of the Court, have continued to stress the
importance of free dissemination of information about commercial
choices in a market economy; the antipaternalistic premises of the
First Amendment; the impropriety of manipulating consumer choices
or public opinion through the suppression of accurate "commercial"
information; the near impossibility of severing "commercial" speech
from speech necessary to democratic decisionmaking; and the
dangers of permitting the government to do covertly what it might not
have been able to muster the political support to do openly.2

In other decisions, however, the Court has appeared to accept the
legitimacy of laws that suppress information in order to manipulate
the choices of consumers-so long as the government could show that
the manipulation was in fact successful. Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557
(1980), was the first decision to clearly embrace this position,
although the Court applied a very strict overbreadth analysis to strike
down the advertising ban at issue.3   In two other decisions, Posadas
de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328
(1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting, 509 U. S. 418
(1963), the Court simply presumed that advertising of a product or
service leads to increased consumption; since, as in Central Hudson,
the Court saw nothing impermissible in the government's
suppressing information in order to discourage consumption, it
upheld the advertising restrictions in those cases. Posadas, supra, at
341- 342; Edge, supra, at 425, 433-434.

The Court has at times appeared to assume that "commercial" speech
could be censored in a variety of ways for any of a variety of reasons
because, as was said without clear rationale in some post-Virginia
Pharmacy Bd. cases, such speech was in a "subordinate position in
the scale of First Amendment values," Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar
Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978); Board of Trustees of State Univ.
of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 478 (1989); Florida Bar v. Went
For It, Inc., 515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 4-5), or of "less
constitutional moment," Central Hudson, supra, at 562-563, n. 5.
But see Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418-
419 (1993) (rejecting this assertion); id., at 431 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring) (same). I do not see a philosophical or historical basis
for asserting that "commercial" speech is of "lower value" than
"noncommercial" speech. Indeed, some historical materials suggest
to the contrary. See, e.g., ante, at 8 (citing Franklin's Apology for
Printers); Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878) (dictum that
Congress could not, consistent with freedom of the press, prevent
the circulation of lottery advertising through methods other than the
United States mail); see also In re Rapier, 143 U. S. 110, 134-135
(1892) (continuing to assume that freedom of the press prevents
Congress from prohibiting circulation of newspapers containing
lottery advertisements); Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, 229 U. S.
288, 315 (1913) (same); see generally Brief for American
Advertising Federation et al. as Amici Curiae 12-24 (citing authorities
for propositions that commercial activity and advertising were
integral to life in colonial America and that Framers' political
philosophy equated liberty and property and did not distinguish
between commercial and noncommercial messages). Nor do I
believe that the only explanations that the Court has ever advanced
for treating "commercial" speech differently from other speech can
justify restricting "commercial" speech in order to keep information
from legal purchasers so as to thwart what would otherwise be their
choices in the marketplace.4


I do not join the principal opinion's application of the Central
Hudson balancing test because I do not believe that such a test should
be applied to a restriction of "commercial" speech, at least when, as
here, the asserted interest is one that is to be achieved through
keeping would-be recipients of the speech in the dark.5 Application
of the advancement-of-state-interest prong of Central Hudson makes
little sense to me in such circumstances. Faulting the State for failing
to show that its price advertising ban decreases alcohol consumption
"significantly," as JUSTICE STEVENS does, ante, at 19 (emphasis
omitted), seems to imply that if the State had been more successful at
keeping consumers ignorant and thereby decreasing their
consumption, then the restriction might have been upheld. This
contradicts Virginia Pharmacy Bd.'s rationale for protecting
"commercial" speech in the first instance.

Both JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR appear to
adopt a stricter, more categorical interpretation of the fourth prong of
Central Hudson than that suggested in some of our other opinions,6
one that could, as a practical matter, go a long way toward the
position I take. The State argues that keeping information about
lower priced alcohol from consumers will tend to raise the total price
of alcohol to consumers (defined as money price plus the costs of
searching out lower priced alcohol, see Brief for Respondents 23),
thus discouraging alcohol consumption. In their application of the
fourth prong, both JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR
hold that because the State can ban the sale of lower priced alcohol
altogether by instituting minimum prices or levying taxes, it cannot
ban advertising regarding lower priced liquor. Although the tenor of
JUSTICE O'CONNOR's opinion (and, to a lesser extent, that of
JUSTICE STEVENS's opinion) might suggest that this is just
another routine case-by-case application of Central Hudson's fourth
prong, the Court's holding will in fact be quite sweeping if applied
consistently in future cases. The opinions would appear to commit
the courts to striking down restrictions on speech whenever a direct
regulation (i.e., a regulation involving no restriction on speech
regarding lawful activity at all) would be an equally effective method
of dampening demand by legal users. But it would seem that directly
banning a product (or rationing it, taxing it, controlling its price, or
otherwise restricting its sale in specific ways) would virtually always
be at least as effective in discouraging consumption as merely
restricting advertising regarding the product would be, and thus
virtually all restrictions with such a purpose would fail the fourth
prong of the Central Hudson test. This would be so even if the direct
regulation is, in one sense, more restrictive of conduct generally. In
this case, for example, adoption of minimum prices or taxes will
mean that those who, under the current legal system, would have
happened across cheap liquor or would have sought it out, will be
forced to pay more. Similarly, a State seeking to discourage liquor
sales would have to ban sales by convenience stores rather than
banning convenience store liquor advertising; it would have to ban
liquor sales after midnight, rather than banning advertising by late-
night liquor sellers; and so on.

The upshot of the application of the fourth prong in the opinions of
JUSTICE STEVENS and of JUSTICE O'CONNOR seems to be that
the government may not, for the purpose of keeping would-be
consumers ignorant and thus decreasing demand, restrict advertising
regarding commercial transactions-or at least that it may not restrict
advertising regarding commercial transactions except to the extent
that it outlaws or otherwise directly restricts the same transactions
within its own borders.7   I welcome this outcome; but, rather than
"applying" the fourth prong of Central Hudson to reach the inevitable
result that all or most such advertising restrictions must be struck
down, I would adhere to the doctrine adopted in Virginia Pharmacy
Bd. and in Justice Blackmun's Central Hudson concurrence, that all
attempts to dissuade legal choices by citizens by keeping them
ignorant are impermissible.


Although the Court took a sudden turn away from Virginia Pharmacy
Bd. in Central Hudson, it has never explained why manipulating the
choices of consumers by keeping them ignorant is more legitimate
when the ignorance is maintained through suppression of
"commercial" speech than when the same ignorance is maintained
through suppression of "noncommercial" speech. The courts,
including this Court, have found the Central Hudson "test" to be, as
a general matter, very difficult to apply with any uniformity.8   This
may result in part from the inherently nondeterminative nature of a
case-by-case balancing "test" unaccompanied by any categorical
rules, and the consequent likelihood that individual judicial
preferences will govern application of the test.9 Moreover, the
second prong of Central Hudson, as applied to the facts of that case
and to those here, apparently requires judges to delineate those
situations in which citizens cannot be trusted with information, and
invites judges to decide whether they themselves think that
consumption of a product is harmful enough that it should be
discouraged.10   In my view, the Central Hudson test asks the courts
to weigh incommensurables- the value of knowledge versus the value
of ignorance-and to apply contradictory premises-that informed
adults are the best judges of their own interests, and that they are not.
Rather than continuing to apply a test that makes no sense to me
when the asserted state interest is of the type involved here, I would
return to the reasoning and holding of Virginia Pharmacy Bd. Under
that decision, these restrictions fall.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES


No. 94-1140


44 LIQUORMART, INC. AND PEOPLES SUPER LIQUOR
STORES, INC., PETITIONERS

v.

RHODE ISLAND AND RHODE ISLAND
LIQUOR STORES ASSOCIATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

[May 13, 1996]

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in the
judgment.

Rhode Island prohibits advertisement of the retail price of alcoholic
beverages, except at the place of sale. The State's only asserted
justification for this ban is that it promotes temperance by increasing
the cost of alcoholic beverages. Brief for Respondent State of Rhode
Island 22. I agree with the Court that Rhode Island's price-
advertising ban is invalid. I would resolve this case more narrowly,
however, by applying our established Central Hudson test to
determine whether this commercial-speech regulation survives First
Amendment scrutiny.

Under that test, we first determine whether the speech at issue
concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, and whether the
asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both these conditions
are met, we must decide whether the regulation "directly advances the
governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive
than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566
(1980).

Given the means by which this regulation purportedly serves the
State's interest, our conclusion is plain: Rhode Island's regulation
fails First Amendment scrutiny.

Both parties agree that the first two prongs of the Central Hudson test
are met. Even if we assume arguendo that Rhode Island's regulation
also satisfies the requirement that it directly advance the governmental
interest, Rhode Island's regulation fails the final prong; that is, its
ban is more extensive than necessary to serve the State's interest.

As we have explained, in order for a speech restriction to pass muster
under the final prong, there must be a fit between the legislature's
goal and method, "a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable;
that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one
whose scope is in proportion to the interest served." Board of
Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989)
(internal quotation marks omitted). While the State need not employ
the least restrictive means to accomplish its goal, the fit between
means and ends must be "narrowly tailored."  Id., at 480. The scope
of the restriction on speech must be reasonably, though it need not be
perfectly, targeted to address the harm intended to be regulated. See
Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip
op., at 14-16). The State's regulation must indicate a "carefu[l]
calculat[ion of] the costs and benefits associated with the burden on
speech imposed by its prohibition."  Cincinnati v. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417 (1993) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The availability of less burdensome alternatives to reach
the stated goal signals that the fit between the legislature's ends and
the means chosen to accomplish those ends may be too imprecise to
withstand First Amendment scrutiny. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing
Co., 514 U. S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., 13-15); Cincinnati, supra,
at 417, n. 13. If alternative channels permit communication of the
restricted speech, the regulation is more likely to be considered
reasonable. See Florida Bar, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 14-17).

Rhode Island offers one, and only one, justification for its ban on
price advertising. Rhode Island says that the ban is intended to keep
alcohol prices high as a way to keep consumption low. By
preventing sellers from informing customers of prices, the regulation
prevents competition from driving prices down and requires
consumers to spend more time to find the best price for alcohol.
Brief for Respondent State of Rhode Island 22. The higher cost of
obtaining alcohol, Rhode Island argues, will lead to reduced
consumption.

The fit between Rhode Island's method and this particular goal is not
reasonable. If the target is simply higher prices generally to
discourage consumption, the regulation imposes too great, and
unnecessary, a prohibition on speech in order to achieve it. The State
has other methods at its disposal-methods that would more directly
accomplish this stated goal without intruding on sellers' ability to
provide truthful, nonmisleading information to customers. Indeed,
Rhode Island's own expert conceded that "`the objective of lowering
consumption of alcohol by banning price advertising could be
accomplished by establishing minimum prices and/or by increasing
sales taxes on alcoholic beverages.'"  39 F. 3d 5, 7 (CA1 1994). A
tax, for example, is not normally very difficult to administer and
would have a far more certain and direct effect on prices, without any
restriction on speech. The principal opinion suggests further
alternatives, such as limiting per capita purchases or conducting an
educational campaign about the dangers of alcohol consumption.
Ante, at 21. The ready availability of such alternatives-at least some
of which would far more effectively achieve Rhode Island's only
professed goal, at comparatively small additional administrative cost-
demonstrates that the fit between ends and means is not narrowly
tailored. Too, this regulation prevents sellers of alcohol from
communicating price information anywhere but at the point of
purchase. No channels exist at all to permit them to publicize the
price of their products.

Respondents point for support to Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), where, applying the
Central Hudson test, we upheld the constitutionality of a Puerto Rico
law that prohibited the advertising of casino gambling aimed at
residents of Puerto Rico, but permitted such advertising aimed at
tourists.

The Court there accepted as reasonable the legislature's belief that the
regulation would be effective, and concluded that, because the
restriction affected only advertising of casino gambling aimed at
residents of Puerto Rico, not that aimed at tourists, the restriction
was narrowly tailored to serve Puerto Rico's interest. 478 U. S., at
341-344. The Court accepted without question Puerto Rico's
account of the effectiveness and reasonableness of its speech
restriction. Respondents ask us to make a similar presumption here
to uphold the validity of Rhode Island's law.

It is true that Posadas accepted as reasonable, without further
inquiry, Puerto Rico's assertions that the regulations furthered the
government's interest and were no more extensive than necessary to
serve that interest. Since Posadas, however, this Court has examined
more searchingly the State's professed goal, and the speech
restriction put into place to further it, before accepting a State's claim
that the speech restriction satisfies First Amendment scrutiny. See,
e.g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. ___; Rubin v.
Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. ___ (1995);  Ibanez v. Florida Dept.
of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512
U. S. ___ (1994);  Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993);
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410 (1993).     In
each of these cases we declined to accept at face value the proffered
justification for the State's regulation, but examined carefully the
relationship between the asserted goal and the speech restriction used
to reach that goal. The closer look that we have required since
Posadas comports better with the purpose of the analysis set out in
Central Hudson, by requiring the State to show that the speech
restriction directly advances its interest and is narrowly tailored.
Under such a closer look, Rhode Island's price-advertising ban
clearly fails to pass muster.

Because Rhode Island's regulation fails even the less stringent
standard set out in Central Hudson, nothing here requires adoption of
a new analysis for the evaluation of commercial speech regulation.
The principal opinion acknowledges that "even under the less than
strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the
State has failed to establish a reasonable fit between its abridgement
of speech and its temperance goal."  Ante, at 21 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Because we need go no further, I would not here
undertake the question whether the test we have employed since
Central Hudson should be displaced.

Respondents argue that an additional factor, the Twenty-first
Amendment, tips the First Amendment analysis in Rhode Island's
favor.

The Twenty-first Amendment repealed the prohibition on the
manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors that had
been established by the 18th Amendment. Section 2 of the Twenty-
first Amendment created an exception to the normal operation of the
Commerce Clause, to permit States to prohibit commerce in, or the
use of, alcoholic beverages. Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 206
(1976).

In its examination of Rhode Island's statute, the Court of Appeals
erroneously concluded that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an
"added presumption in favor of the validity of the state regulation."
39 F. 3d 7-9 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Twenty-first
Amendment cannot save an otherwise invalid restriction on speech.

Nothing in the Amendment's text or history justifies its use to alter
the application of the First Amendment. "[O]ur prior cases have made
clear that the [Twenty-first] Amendment does not license the States to
ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution."
Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984). See
also Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982)
("The State may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first
Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment");  Craig, supra, at 206 ("Neither the text nor
the history of the Twenty-first Amendment suggests that it qualifies
individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth
Amendment where the sale or use of liquor is concerned" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). The Twenty-first Amendment does not
trump First Amendment rights or add a presumption of validity to a
regulation that cannot otherwise satisfy First Amendment
requirements.


The Court of Appeals relied on California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109,
118-119 (1972), for its determination that the Twenty-first
Amendment provided an "added presumption" of the regulation's
validity. There, this Court upheld a State's regulations prohibiting
establishments licensed to sell liquor by the drink from offering
explicitly sexual entertainment. As we recently explained in Coors,
"LaRue did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead
concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol
was served."  514 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at 5, n. 2). The
cases following LaRue similarly involved the regulation of nude or
nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve alcohol.
New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981)
(per curiam);  Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986) (per
curiam). Nothing in LaRue suggested that the Twenty-first
Amendment would permit a State to prohibit the kind of speech at
issue here, and as discussed above, the text and history of the
Twenty-first Amendment clearly indicate that the Amendment was
not intended to supplant the general application of constitutional
provisions, except for its limited exception to the Commerce Clause's
normal operation. Indeed, LaRue notes that prior decisions "did not
go so far as to hold or say that the Twenty-first Amendment
supersedes all other provisions of the United States Constitution in
the area of liquor regulations," 409 U. S., at 115, and LaRue
certainly does not stand for that proposition. The Court of Appeals'
reliance on LaRue was misplaced.

Rhode Island's prohibition on alcohol-price advertising, as a means
to keep alcohol prices high and consumption low, cannot survive
First Amendment scrutiny. The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save
this otherwise invalid regulation. While I agree with the Court's
finding that the regulation is invalid, I would decide that issue on
narrower grounds. I therefore concur in the judgment.


ENDNOTES for opinion

1 Although the text of the First Amendment states that "Congress
shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press," the Amendment applies to the States under the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Board of Ed., Island
Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 855,
n. 1 (1982); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 244
(1936); Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925).

2 Rhode Island Gen. Laws Section 3-8-7 (1987) provides:

"Advertising price of malt beverages, cordials, wine or distilled
liquor.-No manufacturer, wholesaler, or shipper from without this
state and no holder of a license issued under the provisions of this
title and chapter shall cause or permit the advertising in any manner
whatsoever of the price of any malt beverage, cordials, wine or
distilled liquor offered for sale in this state; provided, however, that
the provisions of this section shall not apply to price signs or tags
attached to or placed on merchandise for sale within the licensed
premises in accordance with rules and regulations of the department."

Regulation 32 of the Rules and Regulations of the Liquor Control
Administrator provides that no placard or sign that is visible from the
exterior of a package store may make any reference to the price of
any alcoholic beverage. App. 2 to Brief for Petitioners.

3 Rhode Island Gen. Laws Section 3-8-8.1 (1987) provides:

"Price advertising by media or advertising companies unlawful.-No
newspaper, periodical, radio or television broadcaster or
broadcasting company or any other person, firm or corporation with
a principal place of business in the state of Rhode Island which is
engaged in the business of advertising or selling advertising time or
space shall accept, publish, or broadcast any advertisement in this
state of the price or make reference to the price of any alcoholic
beverages. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . ."  The statute
authorizes the liquor control administrator to exempt trade journals
from its coverage. Ibid.

4 "We also have little difficulty in finding that the asserted
governmental interests, herein described as the promotion of
temperance and the reasonable control of the traffic in alcoholic
beverages, are substantial. We note, parenthetically, that the word
`temperance' is oftentimes mistaken as a synonym for `abstinence.'
It is not. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961)
defines `temperance' as `moderation in or abstinence from the use of
intoxicating drink.'  The Rhode Island Legislature has the authority,
derived from the state's inherent police power, to enact a variety of
laws designed to suppress intemperance or to minimize the
acknowledged evils of liquor traffic. Thus, there can be no question
that these asserted interests are indeed substantial. Oklahoma
Telecasters Association v. Crisp, 699 F. 2d at 500."  S&S Liquor
Mart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d, at 733-734.

In her dissent in Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call
Pub. Co., 497 A. 2d 331 (R. I. 1985), Justice Murray suggested that
the advertising ban was motivated, at least in part, by an interest in
protecting small retailers from price competition. Id., at 342, n. 10.
This suggestion is consistent with the position taken by respondent
Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association in this case. We, however,
accept the State Supreme Court's identification of the relevant state
interest served by the legislation.

5 The plaintiff in that case is a respondent in this case and has filed
other actions enforcing the price advertising ban. See id., at 333.

6 In Dunagin v. Oxford, 718 F. 2d 738 (CA5 1983), the Fifth
Circuit distinguished our summary action in Queensgate in
considering the constitutionality of a sweeping state restriction on
outdoor liquor advertising. The Court explained that Queensgate did
not control because it involved a far narrower alcohol advertising
regulation. Id., at 745-746. By contrast, in Oklahoma Telecasters
Assn. v. Crisp, 699 F. 2d 490, 495-497 (CA10 1983), rev'd on
other grounds sub nom., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.
S. 691, 697 (1984), the Tenth Circuit relied on Queensgate in
considering a prohibition against broadcasting alcohol
advertisements. The Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate
stood for the proposition that the Twenty-first Amendment gives the
State greater authority to regulate liquor advertising than the First
Amendment would otherwise allow. 699 F. 2d, at 495-497.

Other than the two Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions upholding
the constitutionality of the statutes at issue in this case, only one
published state court opinion has considered our summary action in
Queensgate in passing on a liquor advertising restriction. See
Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142
Mich. App. 294, 370 N. W. 2d 328 (1985). There, the Michigan
Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate did not control because
it involved a far narrower restriction on liquor advertising than the
one that Michigan had imposed. 142 Mich. App., at 304-305, 370
N. W. 2d, at 333-335.

7 By contrast, the First Amendment does not protect commercial
speech about unlawful activities. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v.
Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).

8 See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 355 (1977) (ban
on lawyer advertising); Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S.
678, 700 (1977) (ban on contraceptive advertising); Linmark
Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 92-94 (1977) (ban on
`For Sale' signs); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976) (ban on prescription
drug prices); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 825 (1975) (ban
on abortion advertising). Although Linmark involved a prohibition
against a particular means of advertising the sale of one's home, we
treated the restriction as if it were a complete ban because it did not
leave open "satisfactory" alternative channels of communication. 431
U. S., at 92-94.

9 In other words, the regulation failed the fourth step in the four-part
inquiry that the majority announced in its opinion. It wrote:

"In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has
developed. At the outset, we must determine whether the expression
is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come
within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not
be misleading. Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental
interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we
must determine whether the regulation directly advances the
governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive
than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson, 447 U. S.,
at 566.

10 The Justices concurring in the judgment adopted a somewhat
broader view. They expressed "doubt whether suppression of
information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered
product is ever a permissible way for the State to `dampen' the
demand for or use of the product."  Id., at 574. Indeed, Justice
Blackmun believed that even "though `commercial' speech is
involved, such a regulation strikes at the heart of the First
Amendment." Ibid.

11 "Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and
radio as well as in newspapers and other media. They may rent
space on billboards. They may send untargeted letters to the general
population, or to discrete segments thereof. There are, of course,
pages upon pages devoted to lawyers in the Yellow Pages of Florida
telephone directories. These listings are organized alphabetically and
by area of specialty. See generally Rule 4-7.2(a), Rules Regulating
The Florida Bar (`[A] lawyer may advertise services through public
media, such as a telephone directory, legal directory, newspaper or
other periodical, billboards, and other signs, radio, television, and
recorded messages the public may access by dialing a telephone
number, or through written communication not involving solicitation
as defined in rule 4-7.4'); The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend the
Rules Regulating The Florida Bar-Advertising Issues, 571 So 2d, at
461."  Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 15-16).

12 In Discovery Network, we held that the city's categorical ban on
commercial newsracks attached too much importance to the
distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech. After
concluding that the aesthetic and safety interests served by the
newsrack ban bore no relationship whatsoever to the prevention of
commercial harms, we rejected the State's attempt to justify its ban
on the sole ground that it targeted commercial speech. See 507 U.
S., at 428.

13 This case bears out the point. Rhode Island seeks to reduce
alcohol consumption by increasing alcohol price; yet its means of
achieving that goal deprives the public of their chief source of
information about the reigning price level of alcohol. As a result, the
State's price advertising ban keeps the public ignorant of the key
barometer of the ban's effectiveness: The alcohol beverages' prices.

14 Before the District Court, the State argued that it sought to reduce
consumption among irresponsible drinkers. App. 67. In its brief to
this Court, it equates its interest in promoting temperance with an
interest in reducing alcohol consumption among all drinkers. See,
e.g., Brief for Respondents 28. The Rhode Island Supreme Court
has characterized the State's interest in "promoting temperance" as
both "the state's interest in reducing the consumption of liquor,"
S&S Liquormart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d 729, 734 (1985), and
the State's interest in discouraging "excessive consumption of
alcoholic beverages."  Id. at 735. A state statute declares the ban's
purpose to be "the promotion of temperance and for the reasonable
control of the traffic in alcoholic beverages."  R. I. Gen. Laws
Section  3-1-5 (1987).

15 See, e.g., Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.,
485 U. S. 717, 735 (1988) (considering restriction on price
advertising as evidence of Sherman Act violation); United States v.
Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 355 (1967) (same); Blackburn v.
Sweeney, 53 F. 3d 825, 828 (CA7 1995) (considering restrictions
on the location of advertising as evidence of Sherman Act violation).

16 The appellants' stipulation that they each expect to realize a
$100,000 benefit per year if the ban is lifted is not to the contrary.
App. 47. The stipulation shows only that the appellants believe they
will be able to compete more effectively for existing alcohol
consumers if there is no ban on price advertising. It does not show
that they believe either the number of alcohol consumers, or the
number of purchases by those consumers, will increase in the ban's
absence. Indeed, the State's own expert conceded that "plaintiffs'
expectation of realizing additional profits through price advertising
has no necessary relationship to increased overall consumption."
829 F. Supp., at 549.

Moreover, we attach little significance to the fact that some studies
suggest that people budget the amount of money that they will spend
on alcohol. 39 F. 3d 5, 7 (CA1 1994). These studies show only
that, in a competitive market, people will tend to search for the
cheapest product in order to meet their budgets. The studies do not
suggest that the amount of money budgeted for alcohol consumption
will remain fixed in the face of a market-wide price increase.

17 Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulation
directly advanced the State's interest, it did not dispute the District
Court's conclusion that the evidence suggested that, at most, a price
advertising ban would have a marginal impact on overall alcohol
consumption. Id., at 7-8; cf. Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers
Assn. v. Attorney General, 142 Mich. App., at 311, 370 N. W. 2d,
at 336 (explaining that "any additional impact on the level of
consumption attributable to the absence of price advertisements
would be negligible").

18 Outside the First Amendment context, we have refused to uphold
alcohol advertising bans premised on similarly speculative assertions
about their impact on consumption. See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v.
Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 715-716 (1984) (holding ban pre-empted by
Federal Communications Commission regulations); California Retail
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97
(1980) (holding ban violated the Sherman Act). It would be
anomalous if the First Amendment were more tolerant of speech bans
than federal regulations and statutes.

19 "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to
fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."  The International Thesaurus
of Quotations 646 (compiled by R. Tripp 1970).

20 It is also no answer to say that it would be "strange" if the First
Amendment tolerated a seemingly "greater" regulatory measure while
forbidding a "lesser" one. We recently held that although the
government had the power to proscribe an entire category of speech,
such as obscenity or so-called fighting words, it could not limit the
scope of its ban to obscene or fighting words that expressed a point
of view with which the government disagrees. R. A. V. v. St. Paul,
505 U. S. 377 (1992). Similarly, in Cincinnati v. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410 (1993), we assumed that States could
prevent all newsracks from being placed on public sidewalks, but
nevertheless concluded that they could not ban only those newsracks
that contained certain commercial publications. Id., at 428.

21 "Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State,
Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use
therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is
hereby prohibited."  U. S. Const., Amdt. 21, Section 2.

22 The State also relies on two per curiam opinions that followed the
21st Amendment analysis set forth in Larue. See New York State
Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981), and Newport
v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986).

3 The Court found that although the total effect of the advertising ban
would be to decrease consumption, the advertising ban
impermissibly extended to some advertising that itself might not
increase consumption. Central Hudson, supra, at 569-571.

4 As noted above, the asserted rationales for differentiating
"commercial" speech from other speech are (1) that the truth of
"commercial" speech is supposedly more verifiable, and (2) that
"commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest" is
supposedly a "hardy breed of expression that is not particularly
susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation."  Central
Hudson, supra, at 564, n. 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
degree to which these rationales truly justify treating "commercial"
speech differently from other speech (or indeed, whether the requisite
distinction can even be drawn) is open to question, in my view. See
Kozinski & Banner, Who's Afraid of Commercial Speech, 76 Va. L.
Rev. 627, 634-638 (1990) (questioning basis for drawing
distinction); id., at 638-650 (questioning coherence of distinction).
In any event, neither of these rationales provides any basis for
permitting government to keep citizens ignorant as a means of
manipulating their choices in the commercial or political marketplace.

5 In other words, I do not believe that a Central Hudson-type
balancing test should apply when the asserted purpose is like the one
put forth by the government in Central Hudson itself. Whether some
type of balancing test is warranted when the asserted state interest is
of a different kind is a question that I do not consider here.

6 E.g., Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 417, n. 13
(commercial speech restrictions impermissible if alternatives are
"numerous" and obvious).

7 The two most obvious situations in which no equally effective
direct regulation will be available for discouraging consumption (and
thus, the two situations in which the Court and I might differ on the
outcome) are: (1) When a law directly regulating conduct would
violate the Constitution (e.g., because the item is constitutionally
protected), or (2) when the sale is to occur outside the State's
borders.

As to the first situation: Although the Court's application of the
fourth prong today does not specifically foreclose regulations or bans
of advertising regarding items that cannot constitutionally be banned,
it would seem strange to hold that the government's power to
interfere with transmission of information regarding these items, in
order to dampen demand for them, is more extensive than its power
to restrict, for the same purpose, advertising of items that are not
constitutionally protected. Cf. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809,
822 (1975).

As to the second situation: When a State seeks to dampen
consumption by its citizens of products or services outside its
borders, it does not have the option of direct regulation. Here,
respondent correctly points out that alternatives such as taxes will not
be effective in discouraging sales to Rhode Island residents of lower
priced alcohol outside the State, see Brief for Respondent Rhode
Island Liquor Stores Association 27; yet the Court strikes down the
ban against price advertising even as applied to out-of-state liquor
sellers such as petitioner Peoples Super Liquor Stores. Perhaps
JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR would distinguish
a situation in which a State had actually banned sales of lower priced
alcohol within the State and had then, through a ban of advertising by
out-of-state sellers, sought to keep residents ignorant of the fact that
lower priced alcohol was legally available in other States. Cf. Edge,
supra. See ante, at 22-23.

The outcome in Edge may well be in conflict with the principles
espoused in Virginia Pharmacy Bd. and ratified by me today. See
Edge, 509 U. S., at 436-439 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). (In Edge,
respondent did not put forth the broader principles adopted in
Virginia Pharmacy Bd., but rather argued that the advertising
restriction did not have a sufficiently close fit under Central Hudson.)
Because the issue of restrictions on advertising of products or
services to be purchased legally outside a State that has itself banned
or regulated the same purchases within the State is not squarely
presented in this case, I will not address here whether the decision in
Edge can be reconciled with the position I take today.

8 See, e.g., Kozinski & Banner, 76 Va. L. Rev., at 630-631 (citing
cases); Wright, Freedom and Culture: Why We Should Not Buy
Commercial Speech, 72 Denv. U. L. Rev. 137, 162-166 (1994)
(citing cases); Kaskove, New York State Association of Realtors,

Clauses: A Framework and an Agenda, 65 Conn. Bar J. 437, 440,
n. 20 (1991) (citing cases).

9 The third prong of Central Hudson is far from a mechanical one.
In Posadas, Edge, and other cases, the Court has presumed that
advertising bans decrease consumption. Here, by contrast, the
principal opinion demands proof of a "significant" decrease in
consumption, and finds it lacking. But petitioners' own expert
testified at one point that, taking into account disposable income,
price was a "potent" influence on alcohol consumption, see App. 79;
and the American Medical Association had apparently concluded that
advertising of alcohol in general increased total alcohol consumption
sufficiently to make a ban on advertising worthwhile, see 44 Liquor
Mart, Inc. v. Racine, 829 F. Supp. 543, 548 (DRI 1993). A court
more inclined to uphold the ban here could have pointed to these facts
in support.

The courts have also had difficulty applying the fourth prong because
the outcome has depended upon the level of generality with which the
interest was described. See Faille, supra, at 58, 60. If today's strict
application of the fourth prong survives, it will clarify the prong's
application in a large number of cases, since, as noted above, it will
simply invalidate most restrictions in which the government attempts
to manipulate consumption through enforced ignorance rather than
through direct regulation.

products would be difficult to define).

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

WILLIAM J. JANKLOW, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH
DAKOTA ET AL. v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD,
SIOUX FALLS CLINIC ET AL.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE
UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 95-856.

Decided April 29, 1996

The motion of National Right to Life Committee, Inc.,
for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae is granted. The
petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. Memorandum
of  JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of the
petition for certiorari. The Court's opinion in United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), correctly
summarized a long established principle of our
jurisprudence: "The fact that [a legislative] Act might
operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of
circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid."
Id., at 745. Unfortunately, the preceding sentence in the
Salerno opinion went well beyond that principle. That
sentence opens Part II of the opinion with a rhetorical
flourish, stating that a facial challenge must fail unless
there is "no set of circumstances" in which the statute
could be validly applied. Ibid.; post, at 3. That
statement was unsupported by citation or precedent. It
was also unnecessary to the holding in the case, for the
Court effectively held that the statute at issue would be
constitutional as applied in a large fraction of cases. See
481 U. S., at 749-750. While a facial challenge may be
more difficult to mount than an as-applied challenge, the
dicta in Salerno "does not accurately characterize the
standard for deciding facial challenges," and "neither
accurately reflects the Court's practice with respect to
facial challenges, nor is it consistent with a wide array of
legal principles." Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and
Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 236, 238 (1994).
For these reasons, Salerno's rigid and unwise dictum has
been properly ignored in subsequent cases even outside
the abortion context.1  Accordingly, there is no need for
this Court affirmatively to disavow that unfortunate
language, in the abortion context or otherwise, until it is
clear that a federal court has ignored the appropriate
principle and applied the draconian "no circumstance"
dictum to deny relief in a case in which a facial challenge
would otherwise be successful.2 I thus concur in the
denial of this petition. 1 See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 895 (1992)
(statute facially invalid as "substantial obstacle" to
exercise of right in "large fraction" of cases); id., at 972-
973 (REHNQUIST, C. J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part) (arguing that "no circumstance"
dictum should have led to different result); Kraft Gen.
Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance, 505
U. S. 71, 82 (1992) (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting)
(arguing that tax statute was facially valid because it
would be constitutional under certain facts); INS v.
National Center for Immigrants' Rights, 502 U. S. 183,
188 (1991) (applying appropriate rule: "That the
regulation may be invalid as applied in [some] cases, . .
Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602 (1988) (statute
facially invalid under Establishment Clause only if, inter
alia, law's "primary effect" is advancement of religion,
or if it requires "excessive entanglement" between
church and state); id., at 627, n. 1 (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting) (pointing out and agreeing with majority's
failure to apply "no circumstance" dictum); Schaffer v.
Heitner, 433 U. S. 186 (1977) (examining facial validity
of state statute permitting exercise of personal
jurisdiction over defendant without reference to whether
statute was constitutional as applied to petitioner). These
cases, along with other decisions and the holding in
Salerno itself (that the challenged Act was constitutional
in most circumstances, not merely one), should have
braced the dissent against the minor risk of whiplash
from the "head-snapping" observation, post, at 5, that
our "doctrinal pattern is somewhat more complex" than
Salerno's "no circumstance" language suggests, Fallon,
Making Sense of Overbreadth, 100 Yale L. J. 853, 859,
n. 29 (1991) (citing cases). 2 In all likelihood, the
decision of the Fifth Circuit applying the "no
circumstance" test would have been decided the same
way even if that court had utilized the "large fraction"
test applied by the Eighth Circuit in this case. See Barnes
v. Moore, 970 F. 2d 12, 14 (CA5 1992) (noting that the
provisions at issue were "substantially identical" to
provisions upheld in Casey). Furthermore, it is not at all
clear to me, given intervening statements by Members of
this Court, see Fargo Women's Health Organization v.
Schafer, 507 U. S. 1013, 1014 (1993), that subsequent
Fifth Circuit panels would follow Barnes' application of
the "no circumstance" test, providing yet another reason
to deny the petition in this case.


JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting. In this case, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
declared unconstitutional a South Dakota law which
requires a physician to notify a pregnant minor's parent
of an impending abortion 48 hours before the abortion is
to be performed.1.

The court's basis for the invalidation was that "a large
fraction of minors seeking pre-viability abortions would
be unduly burdened by [the] statute, despite its abuse
exception,"2  Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v.
Miller, 63 F. 3d 1452, 1463 (1995) (emphasis added).
This decision is questionable enough that we should,
since the invalidation of state law is at issue, accord
review. Among other things, it rested upon the court's
belief that "it seems, South Dakota's abuse exception will
sometimes result in parental notification, even if after-
the-fact."  Id., at 1461. That reasoning is inconsistent
with our holding in Ohio v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990), another
case involving a parental notification provision, that
"[t]he Court of Appeals should not have invalidated the
Ohio statute on a facial challenge based upon a worst-
case analysis that may never occur."  The Eighth
Circuit's holding is also dependent on the questionable
conclusions (1) that "parental-notice provisions, like
parental-consent provisions, are unconstitutional without
a Bellotti-type bypass," 63 F. 3d, at 1460, see Bellotti v.
Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979), and (2) that the South
Dakota law's exception for abused and neglected minors
did not satisfy the need for a bypass procedure, 63 F. 3d,
at 1460-1463. Beyond these issues, however (or, more
accurately, preceding them), is another question that
virtually cries out for our review. In United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), summarizing a long
established principle of our jurisprudence, we observed:
"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the
most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the
challenger must establish that no set of circumstances
exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that
[a legislative Act] might operate unconstitutionally under
some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to
render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an
`overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the
First Amendment."  Id., at 745.

It has become questionable whether, for some reason,
this clear principle does not apply in abortion cases. As I
observed three Terms ago in a case very similar to this
one, we have sent mixed signals on the question --
seemingly employing an overbreadth approach in Roe v.
Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), but explicitly rejecting that
approach in such later abortion cases as Ohio v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514
(1990), and Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 183
(1991).3   In dissenting from denial of certiorari in Ada
v. Guam Soc. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 506 U.
S. 1011, 1013 (1992) I expressed my view that "[t]he
Court did not purport to change this well-established rule
. . . in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,
505 U. S. 833 (1992)."  Since then, two Members of the
Casey majority have expressed their view that Salerno is
"inconsistent with Casey."  See Fargo Women's Health
Organization v. Schafer, 507 U. S. 1013, 1014 (1993)
(O'CONNOR, J., joined by SOUTER, J., concurring). In
this case, after reviewing the incompatible
pronouncements of the Court's opinions on this subject,
and remarking that "even the Justices of the Supreme
Court dispute Casey's effect," 63 F. 3d, at 1457, the
Court of Appeals concluded, in effect, that Salerno had
been chewed up by the "ad hoc nullification machine"
which is our abortion jurisprudence, Madsen v. Women's
Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op.,
at 2) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The court decided that
Casey, without so much as alluding to the facial-
challenge rule, "effectively overruled Salerno for facial
challenges to abortion statutes," 63 F. 3d, at 1458. This
holding conflicts head-on with a post-Casey decision of
the Fifth Circuit. In Barnes v. Moore, 970 F. 2d 12, cert.
denied, 506 U. S. 1021 (1992), the Fifth Circuit rejected
a facial challenge to the Mississippi Informed Consent to
Abortion Act. In the process, it said that "[b]ecause the
plaintiffs are challenging the facial validity of the
Mississippi Act, they must establish that no set of
circumstances exists under which the Act would be
valid,'" 970 F. 2d, at 14, adding that "we do not interpret
Casey as having overruled, sub silentio, longstanding
Supreme Court precedent governing challenges to the
facial constitutionality of statutes," id., at 14, n. 2. The
split between the Fifth and Eighth Circuits is
unmistakably clear. The Third Circuit has also weighed
in on this question (albeit in dictum), siding with the
Eighth Circuit. See Casey v. Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa., 14 F. 3d 848, 863, n. 21 (1994). The
Salerno question could not be more squarely presented.
The Court of Appeals explained that "[t]he critical issue
in this case is . . . what is the standard for a challenge to
the facial constitutionality of an abortion law?"  63 F. 3d,
at 1456 (emphasis added). It specifically acknowledged
that "Planned Parenthood cannot meet the Salerno test."
Id., at 1457. Had the Court of Appeals not concluded
that the Salerno rule has been selectively (and sub
silentio) nullified in abortion cases, respondents' facial
challenge quite simply would have failed. JUSTICE
STEVENS' memorandum in support of the denial of this
petition provides even stronger reasons than I have why
it should be granted. JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that
Casey could not possibly have been contrary to the "no
set of circumstances" rule because, contrary to the
repeated statement of our cases, that rule never existed.
For that head-snapping proposition, he relies upon no
less weighty authority than a law-review article by
Michael C. Dorf. According to that author, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE'S statement on behalf of the Court in Salerno
was not only "wrong" but "draconian."  Dorf, Facial
Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev.
235, 238, 239 (1994); see ante, at 2. But if that is so, if
Salerno is a dead letter even outside of the abortion
context, all the more reason to grant certiorari and make
that clear.4   For the courts of appeals regularly enforce
that supposed dead letter, often in cases in which its
"draconian" character prevents the facial challenge from
succeeding. See, e.g., Chemical Waste Management, Inc.
v. United States Environmental Protecton Agency, 56 F.
3d 1434, 1437 (CADC 1995) ("We discern at least one
scenario where the off-site rule would be procedurally
valid. . . . While this hypothetical scenario may not be
common, it is sufficient to establish that petitioners'
facial challenge must fail"); United States v. Mena, 863
F. 2d 1522, 1527 (CA11 1989) ("[T]he defendants have
simply failed even to suggest `that no set of
circumstances exists under which the Act would be
valid.'  Such is the defendant's burden in a case
challenging the facial validity of a congressional
enactment on other than first-amendment grounds");
Roulette v. Seattle, ___ F. 3d ___, ___ (CA9 1996)
("Plaintiffs have conceded that `the city may prevent
individuals or groups of people from sitting or lying
across a sidewalk in such a way as to prevent others from
passing.'  The Seattle ordinance plainly may be applied to
such cases, and plaintiffs' facial substantive due process
challenge therefore fails") (citation omitted);
Government Suppliers Consolidating Servs., Inc. v.
Bayh, 975 F. 2d 1267, 1283 (CA7 1992); Dean v.
McWherter, 70 F. 3d 43, 45 (CA6 1995); National
Treasury Employees Union v. Bush, 891 F. 2d 99, 101
(CA5 1989) ("[B]ecause not every application of the
Order would be invalid, the Order is facially valid");
Jordan v. Jackson, 15 F. 3d 333, 343-344 (CA4 1994);
Giusto v. INS, 9 F. 3d 8, 10 (CA2 1993). Finally, I
cannot let pass without comment JUSTICE STEVENS'
suggestion that Fifth Circuit panels might, in future
abortion cases, ignore the clear language of Salerno, and
the Fifth Circuit's own decision in Barnes, "given
intervening statements by Members of this Court"_by
which he means the memorandum of JUSTICE
O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring
in the Court's Order of April 2, 1993, denying (without
opinion) the application for stay and injunction pending
appeal in Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Shafer,
507 U. S. 1013 (1993). See ante, at 2, n. 2. That the
Fifth Circuit might give such authoritative effect to this
two-Justice concurrence is certainly true; courts of
appeals, no less than practitioners, sometimes count votes
instead of following cases. But I am surprised to find
that practice endorsed by JUSTICE STEVENS, who has
hitherto taken a dim view of separate writings appended
to discretionary (and unexplained) denials, calling "all
opinions dissenting from the denial of certiorari" "totally
unnecessary" and "examples of the purest form of dicta."
Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 944-945
(1978) (STEVENS, J., respecting the denial of
certiorari). More fundamentally, I find it hard to
understand why one who believes that Salerno's "no set
of circumstances" rule is nothing more than unwise,
rigid and inaccurate dictum, ante, at 1-2, would not seize
upon this opportunity "affirmatively to disavow" it, ante,
at 2, instead of hoping that the courts of appeals will be
induced to abandon it by reading the tea leaves of
concurring opinions. Today's denial serves only one
rational purpose: it makes our abortion ad hoc
nullification machine as stealthful as possible.

For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the Court's
denial of the petition for certiorari.

END NOTES

1 South Dakota Codified Laws 34-23A-7 (1994 rev.)
provides, in relevant part: "No abortion may be
performed upon an unemancipated minor or upon a
female for whom a guardian has been appointed because
of a finding of incompetency, until at least forty-eight
hours after written notice of the pending operation has
been delivered in the manner specified in this section.
The notice shall be addressed to the parent at the usual
place of abode of the parent and shall be delivered
personally to the parent by the physician or an agent. In
lieu of such delivery, notice may be made by certified
mail addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode
of the parent with return receipt requested and restricted
delivery to the addressee, which means a postal employee
can only deliver the mail to the authorized addressee. If
notice is made by certified mail, the time of delivery
shall be deemed to occur at twelve o'clock noon on the
next day on which regular mail delivery takes place,
subsequent to mailing."

2 South Dakota Codified Laws 34-23A-7 (1994 rev.)
sets forth the following exceptions to its notice
requirement: "No notice is required under this section if:
"(1) The attending physician certifies in the pregnant
minor's medical record that, on the basis of the
physician's good faith clinical judgment, a medical
emergency exists that so complicates the medical
condition of a pregnant female as to necessitate the
immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death
or for which a delay will create serious risk of
substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
function and there is insufficient time to provide the
required notice; or "(2) The person who is entitled to
notice certifies in writing that he has been notified; or
"(3) The pregnant minor declares, or provides
information that indicates, that she is an abused or
neglected child as defined in 26-8A-2 and the attending
physician has reported the alleged or suspected abuse or
neglect as required in accordance with [state law]. In
such circumstances, the department of social services, the
state's attorney and law enforcement officers to whom
the report is made or referred for investigation or
litigation shall maintain the confidentiality of the fact that
she has sought or obtained an abortion and shall take all
necessary steps to ensure that this information is not
revealed to her parents."

3 See also Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492
U. S. 490, 524 (1989) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) ("[S]ome quite
straightforward applications of the Missouri ban on the
use of public facilities for performing abortions would
be constitutional and that is enough to defeat appellees'
assertion that the ban is facially unconstitutional").
JUSTICE STEVENS' memorandum in support of the
denial of certiorari says that the Salerno rule "has been
properly ignored in subsequent cases even outside the
abortion context."  Ante, at 2. If he means by this that
the rule has consistently been ignored, the statement is
proved false by the cases cited here in text, where the
rule was both recited and followed. (And there are other
post-Salerno cases reciting and applying the rule outside
the abortion context, see, e.g., Anderson v. Edwards,
514 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (1995) (slip op., at 11, n.6), and
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301, 309 (1993).) If, on
the other hand, JUSTICE STEVENS merely means that
the Salerno rule has sometimes "been ignored," though it
has other times been applied, then he makes a good case
for granting rather than denying certiorari.

4 While we are in the process of adopting Prof. Dorf's
revisionist view of Salerno, we could also embrace his
modest proposal for what ought to replace the rule
described in that case. His proposal is not, curiously
enough, the regime that JUSTICE STEVENS suggests,
but rather total elimination of the distinction between
facial and as-applied challenges. Dorf, supra, at 294.

Argued October 3, 1995

Decided November 7, 1995

SYLLABUS

During petitioner Libretti's trial on federal drug and related
charges, he entered into a plea agreement with the Government,
whereby, among other things, he pleaded guilty to engaging in a
continuing criminal enterprise under 21 U.S.C. 848; agreed to
surrender numerous items of his property to the Government under
853, which provides for criminal forfeiture of drug-tainted
property; and waived his constitutional right to a jury trial. At
the colloquy on the plea agreement, the trial judge explained the
consequences of Libretti's waiver of the latter right, but did not
expressly advise him as to the existence and scope of his right
under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e) to a jury
determination of forfeitability. After sentencing Libretti to
imprisonment and other penalties, the judge entered a forfeiture
order as to the property in question despite Libretti's objection
to what he saw as a failure to find any factual basis for the
entire forfeiture. The Court of Appeals rejected both of
Libretti's challenges to the forfeiture order, ruling that Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) does not require a district court
to ascertain a factual basis for a stipulated forfeiture of assets
and that Libretti had waived his Rule 31(e) right to a jury
determination of forfeitability.

Held:

1. Rule 11(f)-which forbids a court to enter judgment upon ''a
plea of guilty'' without assuring that there is ''a factual
basis'' for the plea-does not require a district court to inquire
into the factual basis for a stipulated forfeiture of assets
embodied in a plea agreement. Pp. 7-19.

(a) The Rule's plain language precludes its application to a
forfeiture provision contained in a plea agreement. The Rule
applies only to ''a plea of guilty,'' which refers to a
defendant's admission of guilt of a substantive criminal offense
as charged in an indictment and his waiver of the right to a jury
determination on that charge. See, e.g., United States v. Broce,
488 U.S. 563, 570. In contrast, forfeiture is an element of the
sentence imposed following a plea of guilty, and thus falls
outside Rule 11(f)'s scope. That forfeiture operates as punishment
for criminal conduct, not as a separate substantive offense, is
demonstrated by the text of the relevant statutory provisions,
see, e.g.,  848(a) and 853(a), by legislative history, and by
this Court's precedents, see, e.g., Alexander v. United States,
509 U.S. ___, ___. Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States,
491 U.S. 617, 628, n. 5, distinguished. In light of such weighty
authority, the Court is not persuaded by Libretti's insistence
that the forfeiture for which  853 provides is, in essence, a
hybrid that shares elements of both a substantive charge and a
criminal punishment. Pp. 8-11.

(b) Libretti's policy arguments for construing Rule 11(f) to reach
asset forfeiture provisions of plea agreements-that the Rule's
factual basis inquiry (1) is essential to ensuring that a
forfeiture agreement is knowing and voluntary, (2) will protect
against government overreaching, and (3) is necessary to ensure
that the rights of third-party claimants are fully protected-are
rejected. Pp. 12-14.

(c) The District Court did not rest its forfeiture order solely on
the stipulation contained in the plea agreement. There is ample
evidence that the District Judge both understood the statutory
requisites for criminal forfeiture and concluded that they were
satisfied on the facts at the time the sentence was imposed. Pp.
15-19.

2. On the facts of this case, Libretti's waiver of a jury
determination as to the forfeitability of his property under Rule
31(e)-which provides that, "[i]f the indictment . . . alleges that
verdict shall be returned as to the extent of the . . .
property"-was plainly adequate. That waiver was accomplished by
the plea agreement, in which Libretti agreed to forfeiture and
waived his right to a jury trial, together with the plea colloquy,
which made it abundantly clear that the plea agreement would end
any proceedings before the jury and would lead directly to
sentencing by the court. Accordingly, Libretti cannot now complain
that he did not receive the Rule 31(e) special verdict. The Court
rejects his argument that the Rule 31(e) right to a jury
determination of forfeitability has both a constitutional and a
statutory foundation, and cannot be waived absent specific advice
from the district court as to the existence and scope of this
right and an express, written waiver. Given that the right, as an
aspect of sentencing, does not fall within the Sixth Amendment
right to a jury determination of guilt or innocence, see, e.g.,
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 93, but is merely statutory
in origin, the plea agreement need not make specific reference to
Rule 31(e). Nor must the district court specifically advise a
defendant that a guilty plea will result in waiver of the Rule
31(e) right, since that right is not among the information that
must be communicated to a defendant under Rule 11(c) in order to
ensure that a guilty plea is valid. Pp. 19-22.

OPINION

JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
[FOOTNOTE *]

Petitioner Joseph Libretti pleaded guilty to engaging in a
continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 84 Stat. 1265, 21
U.S.C. section 848 (1988 ed. and Supp. V), and agreed to forfeit
numerous items of his property to the Government. We must decide
whether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) requires the
District Court to determine whether a factual basis exists for a
stipulated asset forfeiture embodied in a plea agreement, and
whether the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e) right to a
special jury verdict on forfeiture can only be waived following
specific advice from the District Court as to the existence and
scope of this right and an express, written waiver.

I

In May 1992, Joseph Libretti was charged in a multicount
superseding indictment with violations of various federal drug,
firearms, and money-laundering laws. Included in the indictment
was a count alleging that Libretti engaged in a continuing
criminal enterprise (CCE), in violation of 21 U.S.C. section 848,
by operating a cocaine and marijuana distribution organization in
Wyoming and Colorado from 1984 to 1992. Conviction under
section 848 subjects a defendant to, among other penalties, "the
forfeiture prescribed in section 853."[FOOTNOTE 1] 21 U.S.C.
section 848(a). Accordingly, the indictment further alleged that
the Government was entitled to forfeiture of property that was
obtained from or used to facilitate Libretti's drug offenses,
including but not limited to various assets specified in the
indictment. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 7(c)(2) ("No judgment of
forfeiture may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the
indictment or the information shall allege the extent of the
interest or property subject to forfeiture").

Trial began in September 1992. The Government presented
testimony from 18 witnesses, including several individuals who had
purchased cocaine or marijuana from Libretti, to establish Libretti's
involvement in the possession and distribution of considerable
amounts of narcotics. The testimony also reflected Libretti's
purchase of a home, an automobile, and dozens of automatic and
semiautomatic weapons during a time when he had only modest
sources of legitimate income. Finally, the testimony revealed that
Libretti stored large amounts of money and drugs in safety deposit
boxes and storage facilities away from his home.

Following four days of testimony, Libretti and the Government
entered into a plea agreement, by the terms of which Libretti
agreed to plead guilty to the CCE count of the indictment (count
6). The Government in return agreed not to pursue additional
charges against Libretti and to recommend that he be sentenced to
the mandatory minimum of 20 years' imprisonment. Paragraph 10 of
the plea agreement provided that Libretti would

"transfer his right, title, and interest in all of his assets to
the Division of Criminal Investigation of the Wyoming Attorney
General including, but not limited to: all real estate; all
personal property, including guns, the computer, and every other
item now in the possession of the United States; all bank
accounts, investments, retirement accounts, cash, cashier's
checks, travelers checks and funds of any kind."

Two other paragraphs of the plea agreement also made reference to
the contemplated forfeiture. Paragraph 2 described the maximum
statutory penalty for the offense to which Libretti agreed to
plead guilty, which included "forfeiture of all known assets as
prescribed in 21 U.S.C. section 853 and assets which are
discovered at any later time up to $1,500,000." In paragraph 9,
Libretti agreed to "identify all assets that were used to
facilitate his criminal activity" and to "provide complete
financial disclosure forms requiring the listing of assets and
financial interests." Finally, Libretti acknowledged in the
agreement "that by pleading guilty to Count Six of the Indictment,
he waive[d] various constitutional rights, including the right to
a jury trial." It is beyond dispute that Libretti received a
favorable plea agreement. The Government recommended that
Libretti receive the minimum sentence for conviction under section
848, and agreed to drop all other counts in the indictment. One of those
counts charged Libretti with use of a firearm equipped with a
silencer during the commission of a drug offense, which mandates a
30-year sentence consecutive to the term of imprisonment on the
underlying drug offense. 18 U.S.C. section 924(c)(1). Libretti
also faced a potential fine of up to $2 million. 21 U.S.C.
sections 848(a), 853(a).

At the subsequent hearing on the plea agreement, the trial judge
advised Libretti of his rights, including his right to a jury
trial. The court also clarified the consequences of Libretti's
plea, including the facts that a plea of guilty would mean "the
end of this trial," that "the jury [would] not . . . decide
whether [he's] guilty or not," and that "all the property that's
described in . . . Count 6 could be forfeited to the United
States." App. 87, 88. Libretti was then placed under oath. He
admitted that his plea was voluntary and indicated that he had
read and understood the significance of the indictment and the
plea agreement, including the fact that "all of [his] property
could be forfeited, the property that is owned by [him] by reason
of any drug transaction." Id., at 100. Libretti's only question
about the plea agreement pertained to paragraph 2, which provided
for future forfeiture of assets up to $1,500,000. The District
Court assured Libretti that future forfeiture would be limited to
subsequently discovered drug-tainted assets, and that his future
legitimate income would not be forfeited. Id., at 88-89. After a
lengthy exchange, in which the court reviewed each subparagraph
describing the violations that composed the CCE charge and
Libretti acknowledged each factual allegation, the District Court
found that the guilty plea was voluntary and factually based. Id.,
at 121.

Following preparation of a presentence report, the District Court
held a sentencing hearing, at which Libretti was sentenced to 20
years' imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years of supervised
release, and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine as well as a mandatory
$50 assessment and to perform 500 hours of community service.
The Government filed a motion for forfeiture of Libretti's assets, in
keeping with the plea agreement. Libretti's counsel offered no
objection at the sentencing hearing, declaring that the forfeiture
statute was "a harsh law" and "a bitter pill dealt by Congress,"
but conceding that it was "a pill we must swallow." Id., at 149.
At the conclusion of the hearing, however, Libretti stated on the
record that he "would just like to object to what [he saw] as a
failure to find any factual basis for the whole forfeiture." Id.,
at 154. The District Judge noted the objection, but replied that
"the evidence that I heard before me in the two [sic] days of
trial I think is sufficient to warrant the granting of forfeiture.
I think I have no alternative." Ibid. On December 23, 1992, the
District Court entered an order of forfeiture pursuant to 21
U.S.C. section 853. The order listed specific property to be
forfeited, including a parcel of real property in Wyoming, two
condominiums, two automobiles, a mobile home, a diamond ring,
various firearms, cash, several bank accounts, and a number of
cashier's and traveler's checks. App. 155-164. One check was
forfeited as a substitute asset. Id., at 162. Libretti filed an
appeal from the order of forfeiture.

While this appeal was pending, the District Court entertained
third-party claims to some of the property ordered forfeited. See
21 U.S.C. section 853(n). Following a March 1993 hearing, the
court amended its forfeiture order to return certain property to
the third-party claimants. The court also modified its order with
respect to Libretti, stating that "it may be unjust to enforce the
specific forfeiture provisions in the plea agreement" and
reasoning that Libretti's concession to forfeiture in the plea
agreement provided insufficient basis for the order of forfeiture.
App. 309. The court ordered a magistrate to conduct a hearing at
which Libretti would be given the opportunity to show, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that any portion of his property
was not subject to forfeiture. Upon motion by the Government, the
District Court stayed the proceedings before the Magistrate Judge
pending resolution of Libretti's appeal.

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected both of
Libretti's challenges to the forfeiture order. 38 F.3d 523 (1994).
The court ruled first that the District Court lacked jurisdiction
to consider Libretti's claims to the property ordered forfeited at
the third-party hearing, because Libretti had filed a notice of
appeal. After noting the divergence in the Courts of Appeals
regarding the applicability of Rule 11(f) to forfeiture provisions
in plea agreements, the court rejected Libretti's contention that
Rule 11(f) requires a district court to ascertain a factual basis
for a stipulated forfeiture of assets. This conclusion, the Court
of Appeals reasoned, follows from the fact that forfeiture "is a
part of the sentence, not a part of the substantive offense." Id.,
at 528. The Court of Appeals also determined that Libretti had
waived his Rule 31(e) right to a jury determination of
forfeitability, despite the fact that the District Court did not
expressly advise Libretti of the existence and scope of that right
during his plea colloquy. Id., at 530-531. We granted certiorari
to resolve disagreement among the Circuits as to the applicability
of Rule 11(f) to asset forfeiture provisions contained in plea
agreements[FOOTNOTE 2] and the requisites for waiver of the right
to a jury determination of forfeitability under Rule
31(e).[FOOTNOTE 3] 514 U.S. ___ (1995).

II

Libretti insists that the District Court's forfeiture order must
be set aside (or at least modified), because the court neglected
to establish a "factual basis" for forfeiture of the property
covered by the order under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
11(f). Absent such a finding, Libretti argues, even his concession
to forfeiture in the plea agreement cannot authorize the
forfeiture.

A

Libretti's first claim is that the Rule by its very terms applies
to a forfeiture provision contained in a plea agreement.
Accordingly, our analysis must begin with the text of Rule 11(f):

"Determining Accuracy of Plea. Notwithstanding the acceptance of a
plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such
plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is
a factual basis for the plea."

By its plain terms, the Rule applies only to a "plea of guilty."
Our precedent makes clear that this language refers to a
defendant's admission of guilt of a substantive criminal offense
as charged in an indictment and his waiver of the right to a jury
determination on that charge. See, e.g., United States v. Broce,
488 U.S. 563, 570 (1989) ("By entering a plea of guilty, the
accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts
described in the indictment; he is admitting guilt of a
substantive crime"); North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 32
(1970); Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969); McCarthy
v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466 (1969). With this definition in
mind, we have held that a district judge satisfies the
requirements of Rule 11(f) when he "determine[s] 'that the conduct
which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the
indictment or information or an offense included therein to which
the defendant has pleaded guilty.'" Id., at 467 (quoting Advisory
Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U.S.C. App.,
p.730).

A forfeiture provision embodied in a plea agreement is of an
entirely different nature. Forfeiture is an element of the
sentence imposed following conviction or, as here, a plea of
guilty, and thus falls outside the scope of Rule 11(f). The text
of the relevant statutory provisions makes clear that Congress
conceived of forfeiture as punishment for the commission of
various drug and racketeering crimes. A person convicted of
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise "shall be sentenced .
section 848(a) (emphasis added). Forfeiture is imposed "in
addition to any other sentence." 21 U.S.C. section 853(a)
(emphasis added). See also 18 U.S.C. section 1963 (forfeiture is
imposed "in addition to any other sentence" for a violation of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)). The
legislative history of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of
1984, Pub. L. 98-473, Tit. II, 98 Stat. 1976, also characterizes
criminal forfeiture as punishment. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 98-225,
p. 193 (1983) (criminal forfeiture "is imposed as a sanction
against the defendant upon his conviction"). Congress plainly
intended forfeiture of assets to operate as punishment for
criminal conduct in violation of the federal drug and racketeering
laws, not as a separate substantive offense.

Our precedents have likewise characterized criminal forfeiture as
an aspect of punishment imposed following conviction of a
substantive criminal offense. In Alexander v. United States, 509
U.S. ___ (1993), we observed that the criminal forfeiture
authorized by the RICO forfeiture statute "is clearly a form of
monetary punishment no different, for Eighth Amendment purposes,
from a traditional 'fine.'" Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).
Similarly, in United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S. 555 (1983), we
recognized that a "criminal proceeding . . . may often include
forfeiture as part of the sentence." Id., at 567. And in Austin v.
United States, 509 U.S. ___ (1993), we concluded that even the in
rem civil forfeiture authorized by 21 U.S.C. sections 881(a)(4)
and (a)(7) is punitive in nature, so that forfeiture imposed under
those subsections is subject to the limitations of the Eighth
Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. 509 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at
16-20). Libretti himself conceded below that criminal forfeiture
"is a part of the sentence, not a part of the substantive
offense." 38 F.3d, at 528.

It is true, as Libretti points out, that we said in Caplin &
Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617 (1989), that
"forfeiture is a substantive charge in the indictment against a
defendant." Id., at 628, n. 5. That statement responded to the
defendant's claim that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel "for
his defense" could be transformed into a defense to a forfeiture
count in the indictment. We intended only to suggest that a
defendant cannot escape an otherwise appropriate forfeiture
sanction by pointing to his need for counsel to represent him on
the underlying charges. Elsewhere in that opinion we recognized
that forfeiture is a "criminal sanction," id., at 634, and is
imposed as a sentence under section 853, id., at 620, n. 1.

Libretti nonetheless insists that the criminal forfeiture for
which section 853 provides is not "simply" an aspect of
sentencing, but is, in essence, a hybrid that shares elements of
both a substantive charge and a punishment imposed for criminal
activity. In support of this contention, Libretti points to three
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that, according to him, treat
forfeiture as a substantive criminal charge. Rule 7(c)(2) provides
that "[n]o judgment of forfeiture may be entered in a criminal
proceeding unless the indictment or the information shall allege
the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture." If
the indictment or information alleges that a defendant's property
is subject to forfeiture, "a special verdict shall be returned as
to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture,
if any." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 31(e). And a finding of
forfeitability must be embodied in a judgment. Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 32(d)(2) ("[w]hen a verdict contains a finding of criminal
forfeiture, the judgment must authorize the Attorney General to
seize the interest or property subject to forfeiture on terms that
the court considers proper").

Although the procedural safeguards generated by these Rules are
unique in the realm of sentencing, they do not change the
fundamental nature of criminal forfeiture. The fact that the Rules
attach heightened procedural protections to imposition of criminal
forfeiture as punishment for certain types of criminal conduct
cannot alter the simple fact that forfeiture is precisely that:
punishment. The Advisory Committee's "assumption" that "the
amount of the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture is an
element of the offense to be alleged and proved," Advisory
Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim Proc. 31, 18 U.S.C. App.,
p. 786, does not persuade us otherwise. The Committee's assumption
runs counter to the weighty authority discussed above, all of
which indicates that criminal forfeiture is an element of the
sentence imposed for a violation of certain drug and racketeering
laws. Moreover, even supposing that the Committee's assumption is
authoritative evidence with respect to the amendments to Rules 7,
31, and 32, it has no bearing on the proper construction of Rule
11. Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. ___ (1995), is not to the
contrary. The Tome plurality treated the Advisory Committee's
Notes on Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) as relevant
evidence of the drafters' intent as to the meaning of that Rule.
513 U.S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 9-12). In contrast, Libretti
seeks to use the Note appended to Rule 31 to elucidate the meaning
of an entirely distinct Rule. We cannot agree that the Advisory
Committee's Notes on the 1972 amendment to Rule 31(e) shed any
particular light on the meaning of the language of Rule 11(f),
which was added by amendment to Rule 11 in 1966.

B

Libretti next advances three policy arguments for construing Rule
11(f) to reach asset forfeiture provisions of plea agreements.
First, he claims, Rule 11(f)'s factual basis inquiry is essential
to ensuring that a forfeiture agreement is knowing and voluntary.
Next, Libretti declares that a Rule 11(f) inquiry will protect
against government overreaching. And lastly, Libretti insists that
a factual basis inquiry is necessary to ensure that the rights of
third-party claimants are fully protected. We consider these
contentions in turn.

We are unpersuaded that the Rule 11(f) inquiry is necessary to
guarantee that a forfeiture agreement is knowing and voluntary.
Whether a stipulated asset forfeiture is "factually based" is a
distinct inquiry from the question whether the defendant entered
an agreement to forfeit assets knowingly and voluntarily. Libretti
correctly points out that Rule 11(f) is intended to ensure that a
defendant's "plea of guilty" is knowing and voluntary. McCarthy,
394 U.S., at 472 (the Rule 11 inquiry is "designed to facilitate a
more accurate determination of the voluntariness of [a] plea");
Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18
U.S.C. App., p. 730. (Rule 11(f) protects defendants who do not
"realiz[e] that [their] conduct does not actually fall within the
charge"). But a "plea of guilty" and a forfeiture provision
contained in a plea agreement are different matters altogether.
Forfeiture, as we have said, is a part of the sentence. If the
voluntariness of a defendant's concession to imposition of a
particular sentence is questionable, the relevant inquiry is
whether the sentencing stipulation was informed and uncoerced on
the part of the defendant, not whether it is factually sound.

Libretti's second argument-that a Rule 11(f) factual basis inquiry
is necessary to prevent prosecutorial overreaching-proves equally
unavailing. As Libretti properly observes, section 853 limits
forfeiture by establishing a factual nexus requirement: Only
drug-tainted assets may be forfeited. Libretti suggests that
failure to ensure, by means of a Rule 11(f) inquiry, that this
factual nexus exists will open the door to voluntary forfeiture
agreements that exceed the forfeiture authorized by statute,
particularly in light of the government's direct financial
interest in forfeiture as a source of revenue and the disparity in
bargaining power between the government and a defendant. We
recognized in Caplin & Drysdale that the broad forfeiture
provisions carry the potential for government abuse and "can be
devastating when used unjustly." 491 U.S., at 634. Nonetheless, we
con-cluded that "[c]ases involving particular abuses can be dealt
with individually by the lower courts, when (and if) any such
cases arise." Id., at 635. However valid Libretti's concern about
prosecutorial overreaching may be, Rule 11(f) simply does not, on
its face, address it.

We do not mean to suggest that a district court must simply accept
a defendant's agreement to forfeit property, particularly when
that agreement is not accompanied by a stipulation of facts
supporting forfeiture, or when the trial judge for other reasons
finds the agreement problematic. In this regard, we note that the
Department of Justice recently issued a Revised Policy Regarding
Forfeiture by Settlement and Plea Bargaining in Civil and Criminal
Actions, Directive 94-7 (Nov. 1994), to instruct that, among the
procedures necessary to ensure a valid forfeiture agreement,
"[t]he settlement to forfeit property must be in writing and the
defendant must concede facts supporting the forfeiture." Id., at
13. In this case, however, we need not determine the precise scope
of a district court's independent obligation, if any, to inquire
into the propriety of a stipulated asset forfeiture embodied in a
plea agreement. We note that the Sentencing Guidelines direct only
that a district court "may" accept an agreement reached by the
parties as to a specific, appropriate sentence, as long as the
sentence is within the applicable guideline range or departs from
that range "for justifiable reasons." United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual section 6B1.2(c)(2) (Nov. 1993).
Libretti's plea agreement correctly recognized that the District
Court was not bound by the parties' agreement as to the
appropriate sentence: "[T]he sentencing judge is neither a party
to nor bound by this plea agreement and is free to impose whatever
sentence he feels is justified." App. 81, para.11.

Libretti finally argues that a Rule 11(f) factual basis inquiry is
essential to preserving third-party claimants' rights. A defendant
who has no interest in particular assets, the argument goes, will
have little if any incentive to resist forfeiture of those assets,
even if there is no statutory basis for their forfeiture. Once the
government has secured a stipulation as to forfeitability,
third-party claimants can establish their entitlement to return of
the assets only by means of the hearing afforded under 21 U.S.C.
section 853(n). This hearing, Libretti claims, is inadequate to
safeguard third-party rights, since the entry of a forfeiture
order deprives third-party claimants of the right to a jury trial
and reverses the burden of proof. He concludes that insisting on a
factual basis inquiry before entry of the forfeiture order will
lessen the need for third-party hearings following a broad-ranging
forfeiture agreement, and may even result in the conservation of
scarce judicial resources. Whatever the merits of this argument as
a matter of policy, Congress has determined that section 853(n),
rather than Rule 11(f), provides the means by which third-party
rights must be vindicated. Third-party claimants are not party to
Rule 11(f) proceedings, and Libretti's assertion that their
interests are best protected therein fits poorly within our
adversary system of justice.

C

Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, post, at 4, the
District Court did not rest its forfeiture order on nothing more
than Libretti's stipulation that certain assets were forfeitable.
In fact, there is ample evidence that the District Court both
understood the statutory requisites for criminal forfeiture and
concluded that they were satisfied on the facts of this case at
the time the sentence was imposed. First, the District Judge
correctly recognized the factual nexus requirement established by
section 853. App. 89 (change-of-plea hearing) ("[I]t has to be the
product of a drug transaction to be forfeited"). Count 6 of the
indictment specified numerous items of property alleged to be
subject to forfeiture under that statute, including a parcel of
real property in Wyoming; two automobiles; over $100,000 in cash
proceeds from drug transactions; $12,000 in cash that Libretti had
stored inside a paint can at his home; a diamond ring; "[a]ll
United States currency and travelers checks" recovered from
Libretti's storage lockers, safes, home, and person; a mobile
home; a computer system; four bank accounts; two GNMA
investment certificates; bonds; three cashier's checks; and the contents
of two safe deposit boxes. Additional property was identified in a
bill of particulars and a restraining order issued, and
subsequently amended, by the District Court pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
section 853(e) ("[u]pon application of the United States, the
court may enter a restraining order . . . to preserve the
availability of property described in subsection (a) of this
section for forfeiture under this section"). After one week of
trial, the parties submitted to the court an agreement which set
out, in detail, specific items of property to be forfeited
following Libretti's plea of guilty, including "all real estate;
all personal property, including guns, the computer, and every
other item now in the possession of the United States; all bank
accounts, investments, retirement accounts, cash,cashier's checks,
travelers checks and funds of any kind." App. 81. The plea
agreement also explained that the maximum penalty for the offense
to which Libretti agreed to plead guilty included "forfeiture of
all known assets as prescribed in 21 U.S.C. section 853 and assets
which are discovered at any later time up to $1,500,000." App. 79.

Before issuing the order of forfeiture, the trial judge listened
to four days of testimony, in which government witnesses detailed
numerous drug transactions with Libretti. See, e.g., 2 Tr.
124-126, 137-139; 3 id., at 271-272; 4 id., at 495-501; 5 id., at
946-949. One witness recounted Libretti's purchase of a home in
1985 with a $100,000 down payment, at a time during which he was
earning an annual salary of approximately $20,000. 2 id., at
179-180, 210-216; App. 123 (Presentence Report, Prosecutor's
Statement para.6); Presentence Report para.37. Another told of
Libretti's purchase of a sports car with a check for $19,114. 5
Tr. 907-913. Other witnesses described Libretti's possession, in
his capacity as a federal firearms dealer, of numerous automatic
and semiautomatic firearms, later determined to be worth at least
$243,000. See, e.g., 2 id., at 140-141, 156-162; 5 id., at
844-853; App. 123 (Presentence Report, Prosecutor's Statement
para.9). One witness testified that Libretti admitted having
"quite a bit of money stashed away" in safe deposit boxes, 5 Tr.
834, and on at least one occasion had "a couple thousand" dollars
in cash "sitting around." Id., at 835. Other witnesses established
that Libretti often stored cash and drugs in safe deposit boxes
and storage facilities away from his home. See, e.g., 2 id., at
155-156; 4 id., at 718-720, 738-743. One of Libretti's drug
customers testified that he broke into a storage facility at which
Libretti had rented a storage locker and discovered a briefcase
containing a large amount of cash (later estimated in the
presentence report to be approximately $150,000), a large block of
cocaine, and five large trash bags, at least one of which was
filled with marijuana. Id., at 558-566, 588-589.

Prior to sentencing, the court received the presentence
investigation report, which contained, among other things, a
summary of Libretti's legitimate income during the relevant time
periods. During 1985 and 1986, Libretti worked as a restaurant and
grocery store manager, earning approximately $20,000 per year. In
early 1987, he was employed as a temporary stock broker and was
paid on commission only. Later that year, he managed a Tenneco
thrift store. In 1989, Libretti reported an income of
approximately $50,000 from his firearms business. During 1988 and
1989, Libretti also owned a partnership interest in two
condominiums; he reported that the rental income did not meet his
expenses and thus he did not earn a profit. Between June 1989 and
his arrest in December 1991, Libretti worked as a full-time
accounting supervisor, earning a salary of approximately $40,000
per year. Presentence Report para.para.35-37.

Included in the presentence report was a Prosecutor's Statement
detailing the amounts of cocaine and marijuana involved in
Libretti's drug operation and various sums of money Libretti
earned from his drug dealing. App. 122-135. The Statement
described Libretti's substantial expenditures, including the
$100,000 cash deposit on a house in 1985 ($72,000 of which was
derived from Libretti's sale of drugs) and the purchase of a
$20,000 mortgage in 1986 (again, allegedly with proceeds from his
distribution of drugs). Id., at 123. Paragraph 12 reported that
Libretti had opened a safe deposit box in 1987 in which he placed
$48,000 in cash. On another occasion, Libretti placed
approximately $10,000 into an account bearing his brother's name.
Id., at 124-125. The Statement described Libretti's practice of
storing large amounts of cash and drugs in safes, storage lockers,
and safe deposit boxes. Id., at 124, 129. Libretti also stored
drugs, a weapon, and a cashier's check for $65,000 in his personal
locker at his place of employment. Id., at 129. The Statement
related Libretti's investment of at least $243,000 in numerous
firearms. Id., at 123-124. These funds again reportedly derived
from Libretti's drug distribution activities; the Statement
indicated that "Libretti's gun business was used to launder drug
proceeds" and served as a means by which Libretti could "justify
his income since [he] was not working at times during the
conspiracy and, when he was working, was not bringing in the
money that would pay for the Lakewood house and other
investments."
Id., at 127. Finally, the Statement suggested that substantial sums of
cash derived from Libretti's drug activities were never recovered
by law enforcement authorities. Id., at 134. Defense counsel
conceded at the sentencing hearing that "the [presentence] report
of Mr. Libretti's background, education, financial circumstances
are [sic] accurate." Id., at 138. In light of these facts, defense
counsel acknowledged that "the forfeiture is going to take regular
money and illegal money under the substitute assets" provision of
section 853. Id., at 149.

In view of the plea agreement, the indictment, and the amended
restraining order, the trial judge issued an order forfeiting to
the government the Wyoming lot, both condominiums, both
automobiles, $8,000 in cash proceeds of Libretti's drug
transactions, the diamond ring, the mobile home, all firearms, an
IRA account, three bank accounts, bonds, two GNMA certificates,
and several cashier's and traveler's checks. One check was ordered
forfeited as a substitute asset "for assets dissipated and
otherwise expended by Libretti." Id., at 162.

It is not, as Libretti maintains, implausible that the court
concluded on the record before it that the forfeiture order was
appropriate. Following Libretti's objection to the forfeiture
order for lack of factual foundation, the trial judge replied that
"the evidence that I heard before me in the two [sic] days of
trial I think is sufficient to warrant the granting of
forfeiture." Id., at 154. We cannot say that the District Judge,
despite his subsequent uncertainty, erred in issuing the
forfeiture order on the facts before him.

III

Libretti also challenges the adequacy of his waiver of a jury
determination as to the forfeitability of his property under
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e). The right, he argues,
has both a constitutional and a statutory foundation, and cannot
be waived absent specific advice from the district court as to the
nature and scope of this right and an express, written agreementto
forgo the jury determination on forfeitability. We disagree.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e) provides that, "[i]f the
indictment or the information alleges that an interest or property
is subject to criminal forfeiture, a special verdict shall be
returned as to the extent of the interest or property subject to
forfeiture, if any." Libretti would have us equate this statutory
right to a jury determination of forfeitability with the familiar
Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of guilt or
innocence. See, e.g., United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. ___, ___
(1995) (slip op., at 5) ("The Constitution gives a criminal
defendant the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all
the elements of the crime with which he is charged"). Without
disparaging the importance of the right provided by Rule 31(e),
our analysis of the nature of criminal forfeiture as an aspect of
sentencing compels the conclusion that the right to a jury verdict
on forfeitability does not fall within the Sixth Amendment's
constitutional protection. Our cases have made abundantly clear
that a defendant does not enjoy a constitutional right to a jury
determination as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. See,
e.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 93 (1986) ("[T]here
is no Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing, even where the
sentence turns on specific findings of fact"); Cabana v. Bullock,
474 U.S. 376, 385 (1986) ("The decision whether a particular
punishment . . . is appropriate in any given case is not one that
we have ever required to be made by a jury"); Spaziano v. Florida,
468 U.S. 447, 459 (1984) (no right to a jury determination as to
the imposition of the death penalty).

Given that the right to a jury determination of forfeitability is
merely statutory in origin, we do not accept Libretti's suggestion
that the plea agreement must make specific reference to Rule
31(e). Nor must the district court specifically advise a defendant
that a plea of guilty will result in waiver of the Rule 31(e)
right. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c) details the
information a district court must communicate to a defendant in
order to ensure that a guilty plea is valid. Advisory Committee's
Notes on 1974 Amendment of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c), 18
U.S.C. App., p. 731 (the Rule "codifies . . . the requirements of
Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274
(1969), which held that a defendant must be apprised of the fact that
he relinquishes certain constitutional rights by pleading guilty")
(emphasis added). Specific advice regarding the Rule 31(e) ly
objected to resolution of forfeiture issues by the court without a
jury. See, e.g., id., at 150, 154.

In addition, Libretti was represented by counsel at all stages of
trial and sentencing. Apart from the small class of rights that
require specific advice from the court under Rule 11(c), it is the
responsibility of defense counsel to inform a defendant of the
advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement and the attendant
statutory and constitutional rights that a guilty plea would
forgo. Libretti has made no claim of ineffectiveness of counsel
before this Court. As we noted in Broce, "[a] failure by counsel
to provide advice may form the basis of a claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel, but absent such a claim it cannot serve as
the predicate for setting aside a valid plea." Broce, 488 U.S., at
574.

Of course, a district judge must not mislead a defendant regarding
the procedures to be followed in determining whether the
forfeiture contemplated in a plea agreement will be imposed, nor
should the court permit a defendant's obvious confusion about
those procedures to stand uncorrected. On this record, however, we
find no hint that Libretti labored under any misapprehension.
Although the District Judge did not spell out for Libretti that,
had he declined to enter a plea of guilty, and had the trial gone
forward, the jury would eventually have been required to determine
which of Libretti's assets were forfeitable, when viewed in its
entirety, the plea colloquy made it abundantly clear that the plea
agreement would end any proceedings before the jury and would
lead directly to sentencing by the court. As the Court of Appeals
observed, "there is no evidence at [the change-of-plea] hearing
that [Libretti] wanted a jury trial on the forfeiture issue, or
thought he was going to have one." 38 F.3d, at 531. Taken
together, the plea agreement and the plea colloquy waived
Libretti's right to insist on a jury determination of
forfeitability under Rule 31(e).

IV

For these reasons, we reject Libretti's challenges to the District
Court's forfeiture order. Under the plain language of Rule 11(f),
the District Court is not obliged to inquire into the factual
basis for a stipulated forfeiture of assets embodied in a plea
agreement. And because Libretti agreed to this forfeiture and
waived his "right to a jury trial," he cannot now complain that he
did not receive the special jury verdict on forfeitability for
which Rule 31(e) provides. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.

I join in the judgment and Parts I and II of the Court's opinion.
I would not reach the question of a Sixth Amendment right to trial
by jury on the scope of forfeiture or whether the Constitution
obliges a trial court to advise a defendant of whatever jury trial
right he may have. In cases like this one, any such right to
instruction will be satisfied by the court's obligatory advice to
the defendant of the right to jury trial generally. See Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3) ("Before accepting a plea of guilty . . . the
court must address the defendant personally in open court and
inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant
understands . . . that the defendant has . . . the right to be
tried by a jury"). It is reasonable to understand the scope of the
right as covering all matters charged in the indictment, which
under Rule 7(c)(2) will include the forfeiture claim. Since a
defendant will have been provided a copy of the indictment, see
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 10 ("The defendant shall be given a copy of
the indictment or information before being called upon to plead"),
and will have heard it read or summarized, see ibid. ("Arraignment
shall be conducted in open court and shall consist of reading the
indictment or information to the defendant or stating to the
defendant the substance of the charge"), he will naturally
understand that his right to jury trial covers a verdict on the
forfeiture claim.

If, in speaking to the defendant or in other statements within his
hearing, the court should affirmatively say or suggest that the
right to jury trial would not extend to the forfeiture, that would
be error under the current law, whatever the constitutional status
of that right may be. While there is some reason to argue that the
court's colloquy with the defendant in this case was misleading,
see App. 87 ("if you plead guilty . . . . the jury is not going to
decide whether you're guilty or not"), I think Justice Ginsburg is
right to conclude otherwise, for the reasons given in her separate
opinion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment and in Parts I
and II of the opinion.

Rule 11(f), I agree for reasons the Court states, does not impose
on district courts an obligation to find a "factual basis" for
asset forfeitures stipulated in a plea agreement. But the
jury-trial right for which Rule 31(e) provides, as I see it, must
be known in order to be given up voluntarily. I therefore set out
briefly my view of the second issue the Court decides.

At the plea hearing, the District Court carefully and
comprehensively informed Libretti that his guilty plea would waive
his right to jury trial on the crimes charged in the indictment.
The court did not then refer to the unusual jury-trial right on
criminal forfeiture provided by Rule 31(e) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure:

"If the indictment or the information alleges that an interest or
property is subject to criminal forfeiture, a special verdict
shall be returned as to the extent of the interest or property
subject to forfeiture, if any."

See also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 7(c)(2) ("No judgment of forfeiture
may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or
the information shall allege the extent of the interest or
property subject to forfeiture"); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)
(court must address defendant personally in open court and inform
him of "the nature of the charge" when plea of guilty is offered).

Just as intelligent waiver of trial by jury on the underlying
offense requires that the defendant be advised of the right, so
waiver of the extraordinary jury-trial right on forfeiture should
turn on the defendant's awareness of the right his plea will
override. That right, uncommon as it is, may not be brought home
to a defendant through a bare reading of the forfeiture clause in
the indictment. Clarity, however, is easily achieved. In cases
like Libretti's, trial judges can readily avoid unknowing
relinquishment of the procedural right to a jury verdict on
forfeiture by routinely apprising defendants, at plea hearings, of
Rule 31(e)'s atypical special-verdict requirement.

Failure to mention Rule 31(e) at Libretti's plea hearing is not
cause for revisiting the forfeiture of his property, however,
because at least two pretrial references were made to Rule 31(e)'s
requirement. First, there was a brief exchange between court and
counsel on the need for a special-verdict form. 1 Tr. 8. Second,
and more informative, the trial judge explained to the jurors
during voir dire that the indictment included

"a provision for a forfeiture of all property of any kind
constituting or derived from proceeds that Mr. Libretti received
directly or indirectly from engaging in said continuing criminal
enterprise. And that's a subject matter on which the jury will be
required at the end of the case to answer a specific question
relating to it." Id., at 188.

In view of this statement to the lay triers-telling them in
Libretti's presence that they would be called upon specifically to
decide the matter of forfeiture-Libretti cannot persuasively plead
ignorance of the special-verdict right Rule 31(e) prescribes.

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

While I agree with the Court's conclusions (1) that Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 11(f) does not create a duty to determine
that there is a factual basis for a forfeiture of assets pursuant
to 21 U.S.C. section 853 and (2) that the record in this case does
establish a factual basis for forfeiting the assets described in
Count 6 of the indictment, I believe it important to emphasize the
underlying proposition that the law-rather than any agreement
between the parties-defines the limits on the district court's
authority to forfeit a defendant's property. Moreover, entirely
apart from Rule 11(f), the district court has a legal obligation
to determine that there is a factual basis for the judgment
entered upon a guilty plea. For that reason, the Court of Appeals
was plainly wrong in holding that simply because the defendant
unequivocally agreed to "'forfeit all property,'" the law
authorized the forfeiture of all of his assets. 38 F.3d 523, 526
(CA10 1994).

The facts of this case well illustrate the particular need for the
district court to determine independently that a factual basis
supports forfeiture judgments that it enters pursuant to plea
agreements. As the Court correctly notes, this defendant received
a favorable plea agreement. The record demonstrates that the facts
would have supported a much longer term of imprisonment than was
actually imposed. In such circumstance, it is not unthinkable that
a wealthy defendant might bargain for a light sentence by
voluntarily "forfeiting" property to which the government had no
statutory entitlement. This, of course, is not the law. No matter
what a defendant may be willing to pay for a favorable sentence,
the law defines the outer boundaries of a permissible forfeiture.
A court is not free to exceed those boundaries solely because a
defendant has agreed to permit it to do so. As Judge Cudahy aptly
put it, "[t]he mere fact that the defendant has agreed that an
item is forfeitable, in a plea agreement, does not make it so."
United States v. Roberts, 749 F.2d 404, 409 (CA7 1984).

The proposition that the law alone defines the limits of a court's
power to enter a judgment can be traced to this Court's early
precedents. In Bigelow v. Forrest, the Court explained that a
court "transcend[s] its jurisdiction" when it orders the
forfeiture of property beyond that authorized by statute. 9 Wall.
339, 351 (1870). In a similar vein, Ex parte Lange concluded that
a judgment imposing punishment in excess of statutory
authorization is not merely voidable, but "void." 18 Wall. 163,
178 (1874). Precisely because extrastatutory punishments implicate
the very power of a court to act, the district court must,
entirely apart from the specific procedure mandated by Rule 11(f),
satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for any judgment
entered pursuant to a guilty plea that threatens to exceed
statutory bounds.[FOOTNOTE 1] Were a court to do otherwise, it
would permit the parties to define the limits of its power.

In sum, Rule 11(f) does not create a substantive right. Instead,
it prescribes a procedure that is intended to protect every
defendant's pre-existing right not to receive any sentence beyond
statutorily prescribed limits. Rule 11(f) states that if there is
no factual basis for the guilty plea, the court has no power to
"enter a judgment upon such plea . . . ." In so stating, the Rule
does not impliedly authorize courts to impose sentences upon a
plea of guilty greater than the maximum prescribed for the
admitted offense. The pre-existing substantive limits on the
court's power to impose a judgment upon a plea of guilty, which
apply to the forfeiture aspect of the judgment as well as to the
finding of guilt, preclude such a result. Nothing in the Rule
suggests otherwise.

Because the foregoing thoughts are implicit in this Court's
independent examination of the record to assure itself that there
is indeed a factual basis for the forfeiture of the property
described in Count 6, and for the further conclusion that the
forfeiture order does not extend beyond the line that the law has
drawn, I endorse almost all of the Court's opinion. Nevertheless,
I do not agree with the Court's disposition of the case because I
believe the opinion of the Court of Appeals can fairly be read to
approve of the forfeiture of all petitioner's property, rather
than just the assets described in Count 6.[FOOTNOTE 2]

Although the majority marshals ample support for much of the
forfeiture authorized here, the record simply does not provide a
factual basis for the whole of it. For example, nothing in the
Court's opinion provides a basis for concluding that the small
bank account that petitioner opened while a young boy, and which
had not been augmented since 1975, should be subject to
forfeiture. Nor can all of his assets necessarily be deemed
subject to forfeiture as "substitute assets." As the Court
recognizes, the District Court determined that only one check was
subject to forfeiture on that basis. Ante, at 18.

The sole basis for the wholesale forfeiture affirmed here stems
from one paragraph in the defendant's plea agreement which states
his willingness to "transfer his right, title, and interest in all
of his assets to the Division of Criminal Investigation of the
Wyoming Attorney General."[FOOTNOTE 3] App. 81. As I have
explained, however, a defendant's bare stipulation does not
determine what property a court may forfeit. The district court
must independently make that determination. Here, the record
reveals that the District Court had not determined that a factual
basis existed for the sweeping forfeiture it ordered. Indeed, the
District Court subsequently sought to hold a hearing for the very
purpose of determining whether a factual basis existed. The
District Court was precluded from undertaking that necessary
inquiry only because this pro se petitioner filed an early notice
of appeal that divested the court of jurisdiction. However, that
jurisdictional bar did not, and could not, relieve the District
Court of its prior duty to find a factual basis for its forfeiture
judgment.

Because the District Court had not assured itself that its
judgment fell within the bounds established by law, and because
the record does not support the conclusion that it did, I would
vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

FN* JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE THOMAS join all but Parts
II-B and II-C of this opinion. JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE
GINSBURG join only Parts I and II.

FN1. Section 853(a) provides for criminal forfeiture of
drug-tainted property:

"(a) Property subject to criminal forfeiture. Any person convicted
of a violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year shall forfeit to
the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law-

"(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the
person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of
suchviolation;

"(2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in
any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of,
such violation; and

"(3) in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise in violation of section 848 of this title, the
person shall forfeit, in addition to any property described in
paragraph (1) or (2), any of his interest in, claims against, and
property or contractual rights affording a source of control over,
the continuing criminal enterprise.

"The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter
or subchapter II of this chapter, that the person forfeit to the
United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu
of a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a defendant who
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not
more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds."

In addition, section 853(p) provides that, when property subject
to forfeiture under subsection (a) cannot be recovered for various
reasons, "the court shall order the forfeiture of any other
property of the defendant up to the value of" the forfeitable but
unrecoverable assets.

FN2. Compare United States v. Reckmeyer, 786 F.2d 1216, 1222
(CA4) (Rule 11(f) applies to forfeiture provisions in plea agreements),
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 850 (1986), and United States v. Roberts,
749 F.2d 404, 409 (CA7 1984) (same), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1058
(1985), with United States v. Boatner, 966 F.2d 1575, 1581 (CA11
1992) (Rule 11(f) does not apply to stipulated forfeiture
provisions in plea agreements), United States v. Bachynsky, 949
F.2d 722, 730-731 (CA5 1991) (Rule 11(f) does not apply to
forfeiture provisions, but a forfeiture order will be upheld only
if the record provides a factual basis for forfeiture), cert.
denied, 506 U.S. 850 (1992), and 38 F.3d 523, 528 (CA10 1994)
(case below).

FN3. Compare, e.g., id., at 38 F.3d, at 531 ("specific reference
to" the Rule 31(e) right to a special jury verdict is not required
when a defendant's "unambiguous plea agreement" and "knowing
and voluntary plea" establish waiver); United States v. Robinson, 8
F.3d 418, 421 (CA7 1993) ("a defendant's waiver of his statutory
right [under Rule 31(e)] to have a jury determine which portion of
his property is subject to forfeiture is only valid if knowingly
and voluntarily made"); United States v. Garrett, 727 F.2d 1003,
1012 (CA11 1984) (a defendant has a constitutional right to a jury
trial to determine forfeitability; waiver of that right must be in
writing), aff'd on other grounds, 471 U.S. 773 (1985); United
States v. Zang, 703 F.2d 1186, 1194-1195 (CA10 1982) ("[t]he
parties can waive their right to a special verdict [under Rule
31(e)] by not making a timely request"), cert. denied, 464 U.S.
828 (1983).

FN1. Of course, the court's power to act is not similarly
implicated when it imposes a sentence that is arguably erroneous
but nonetheless within the range authorized by statute.

FN2. Moreover, I agree with Justice Ginsburg that the jury trial
right which Rule 31(e) provides must be known in order to be given
up voluntarily.

FN3. The record does not make clear why the property would be
transferred to state, rather than federal, law enforcement
authorities.

Argued April 26, 1995
Decided June 29, 1995

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYLLABUS
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Ohio law makes Capitol Square, the Statehouse plaza in Columbus, a
forum for discussion of public questions and for public
activities, and gives petitioner Capitol Square Review and
Advisory Board responsibility for regulating access to the square.
To use the square, a group must simply fill out an official
application form and meet several speech-neutral criteria. After
the Board denied, on Establishment Clause grounds, the application
of respondent Ku Klux Klan to place an unattended cross on the
square during the 1993 Christmas season, the Klan filed this suit.
The District Court entered an injunction requiring issuance of the
requested permit, and the Board permitted the Klan to erect its
cross. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment, adding to a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a private,
unattended display of a religious symbol in a public forum
violates the Establishment Clause.
Held: The judgment is affirmed.
30 F. 3d 675, affirmed.
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III, concluding that:
1. Because the courts below addressed only the Establishment
Clause issue and that is the sole question upon which certiorari
was granted, this Court will not consider respondents' contention
that the State's disapproval of the Klan's political views, rather
than its desire to distance itself from sectarian religion, was
the genuine reason for disallowing the cross display. P. 4.
2. The display was private religious speech that is as fully
protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private
expression. See, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U.S. ___. Because Capitol Square is a
traditional public forum, the Board may regulate the content of
the Klan's expression there only if such a restriction is
necessary, and narrowly drawn, to serve a compelling state
interest. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460
U.S. 37, 45. Pp. 4-6.
3. Compliance with the Establishment Clause may be a state
interest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based
restrictions on speech, see, e.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at
___, but the conclusion that that interest is not implicated in
this case is strongly suggested by the presence here of the
factors the Court considered determinative in striking down state
restrictions on religious content in Lamb's Chapel, id., at ___,
and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274. As in those cases, the
State did not sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was
made on government property that had been opened to the public for
speech, and permission was requested through the same application
process and on the same terms required of other private groups.
Pp. 6-7.
Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and
Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IV that petitioners' attempt to
distinguish this case from Lamb's Chapel and Widmar is unavailing.
Petitioners' argument that, because the forum's proximity to the
seat of government may cause the misperception that the cross
bears the State's approval, their content-based restriction is
constitutional under the so-called "endorsement test" of, e.g.,
Allegheny County v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, and Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S.
668, is rejected. Their version of the test, which would attribute
private religious expression to a neutrally behaving government,
has no antecedent in this Court's Establishment Clause
jurisprudence, which has consistently upheld neutral government
policies that happen to benefit religion. Where the Court has
tested for endorsement, the subject of the test was either
expression by the government itself, Lynch, supra, or else
government action alleged to discriminate in favor of private
religious expression or activity, see, e.g., Allegheny County,
supra. The difference between forbidden government speech
endorsing religion and protected private speech that does so is
what distinguishes Allegheny County and Lynch from Widmar and
Lamb's Chapel. The distinction does not disappear when the private
speech is conducted close to the symbols of government. Given a
traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and
open to all on equal terms, as well as purely private sponsorship
of religious expression, erroneous conclusions of state
endorsement do not count. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ___, and
Widmar, supra, at 274. Nothing prevents Ohio from requiring all
private displays in the square to be identified as such, but it
may not, on the claim of misperception of official endorsement,
ban all private religious speech from the square, or discriminate
against it by requiring religious speech alone to disclaim public
sponsorship. Pp. 7-14.
Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Breyer,
concluded that the State has not presented a compelling
justification for denying respondents' permit. Pp. 1-13.
(a) The endorsement test supplies an appropriate standard for
determining whether governmental practices relating to speech on
religious topics violate the Establishment Clause, even where a
neutral state policy toward private religious speech in a public
forum is at issue. Cf., e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___, ___. There is no necessity
to carve out, as does the plurality opinion, an exception to the
test for the public forum context. Pp. 2-8.
(b) On the facts of this case, the reasonable observer would not
fairly interpret the State's tolerance of the Klan's religious
display as an endorsement of religion. See, e.g., Lamb's Chapel,
supra, at ___. In this context, the "reasonable observer" is the
personification of a community ideal of reasonable behavior,
determined by the collective social judgment, whose knowledge is
not limited to information gleaned from viewing the challenged
display, but extends to the general history of the place in which
the display appears. In this case, therefore, such an observer may
properly be held, not simply to knowledge that the cross is purely
a religious symbol, that Capitol Square is owned by the State, and
that the seat of state government is nearby, but also to an
awareness that the square is a public space in which a
multiplicity of secular and religious groups engage in expressive
conduct, as well as to an ability to read and understand the
disclaimer that the Klan offered to include in its display. Pp.
8-12.
Justice Souter, joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer,
concluded that, given the available alternatives, the Board cannot
claim that its denial of the Klan's application was a narrowly
tailored response necessary to ensure that the State did not
appear to take a position on questions of religious belief. Pp.
1-13.
(a) The plurality's per se rule would be an exception to the
endorsement test, not previously recognized and out of square with
this Court's precedents. As the plurality admits, there are some
circumstances in which an intelligent observer would reasonably
perceive private religious expression in a public forum to imply
the government's endorsement of religion. Such perceptions should
be attributed to the reasonable observer of Establishment Clause
analysis under the Court's decisions, see, e.g., Allegheny County
v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492
U.S. 573, 630, 635-636 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), which have looked to the specific
circumstances of the private religious speech and the public forum
to determine whether there is any realistic danger that such an
observer would think that the government was endorsing religion,
see, e.g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 692, 694 (O'Connor,
J., concurring). The plurality's per se rule would, in all but a
handful of cases, make the endorsement test meaningless. Pp. 2-10.
(b) Notwithstanding that there was nothing else on the Statehouse
lawn suggesting a forum open to any and all private, unattended
religious displays, a flat denial of the Klan's application was
not the Board's only option to protect against an appearance of
endorsement. Either of two possibilities would have been better
suited to the requirement that the Board find its most "narrowly
drawn" alternative. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators'
Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45. First, the Board could have required a
disclaimer sufficiently large and clear to preclude any reasonable
inference that the cross demonstrated governmental endorsement. In
the alternative, the Board could have instituted a policy of
restricting all private, unattended displays to one area of the
square, with a permanent sign marking the area as a forum for
private speech carrying no state endorsement. Pp. 10-13.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: OPINION
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

JUSTICE SCALIA announced the judgment of the Court and delivered
the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, and
an opinion with respect to Part IV, in which the CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE THOMAS join.
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made binding upon
the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that
government "shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion." The question in this case is whether a State violates
the Establishment Clause when, pursuant to a religiously neutral
state policy, it permits a private party to display an unattended
religious symbol in a traditional public forum located next to its
seat of government.
I
Capitol Square is a 10-acre, state-owned plaza surrounding the
Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. For over a century the square has
been used for public speeches, gatherings, and festivals
advocating and celebrating a variety of causes, both secular and
religious. Ohio Admin. Code Ann.   128-4-02(A) (1994) makes the
square available "for use by the public . . . for free discussion
of public questions, or for activities of a broad public purpose,"
and Ohio Rev. Code Ann.   105.41 (1994), gives the Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Board responsibility for regulating public
access. To use the square, a group must simply fill out an
official application form and meet several criteria, which concern
primarily safety, sanitation, and non-interference with other uses
of the square, and which are neutral as to the speech content of
the proposed event. App. 107- 110; Ohio Admin. Code   128-4-02
(1994).
It has been the Board's policy "to allow a broad range of speakers
and other gatherings of people to conduct events on the Capitol
Square." Brief for Petitioner 3-4. Such diverse groups as
homosexual rights organizations, the Ku Klux Klan and the United
Way have held rallies. The Board has also permitted a variety of
unattended displays on Capitol Square: a State-sponsored lighted
tree during the Christmas season, a privately-sponsored menorah
during Chanukah, a display showing the progress of a United Way
fundraising campaign, and booths and exhibits during an arts
festival. Although there was some dispute in this litigation
regarding the frequency of unattended displays, the District Court
found, with ample justification, that there was no policy against
them. 844 F.Supp. 1182, 1184 (SD Ohio 1993).
In November 1993, after reversing an initial decision to ban
unattended holiday displays from the square during December 1993,
the Board authorized the State to put up its annual Christmas
tree. On November 29, 1993, the Board granted a rabbi's
application to erect a menorah. That same day, the Board received
an application from respondent Donnie Carr, an officer of the Ohio
Ku Klux Klan, to place a cross on the square from December 8,
1993, to December 24, 1993. The Board denied that application on
December 3, informing the Klan by letter that the decision to deny
"was made upon the advice of counsel, in a good faith attempt to
comply with the Ohio and United States Constitutions, as they have
been interpreted in relevant decisions by the Federal and State
Courts." App. 47.
Two weeks later, having been unsuccessful in its effort to obtain
administrative relief from the Board's decision, the Ohio Klan,
through its leader Vincent Pinette, filed the present suit in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
seeking an injunction requiring the Board to issue the requested
permit. The Board defended on the ground that the permit would
violate the Establishment Clause. The District Court determined
that Capitol Square was a traditional public forum open to all
without any policy against free-standing displays; that the Klan's
cross was entirely private expression entitled to full First
Amendment protection; and that the Board had failed to show that
the display of the cross could reasonably be construed as
endorsement of Christianity by the State. The District Court
issued the injunction and, after the Board's application for an
emergency stay was denied, 510 U.S. ___ (1993) (Stevens, J., in
chambers), the Board permitted the Klan to erect its cross. The
Board then received, and granted, several additional applications
to erect crosses on Capitol Square during December 1993 and
January 1994.
On appeal by the Board, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. 30 F.3d 675
(1994). That decision agrees with a ruling by the Eleventh
Circuit, Chabad-Lubavitch v. Miller, 5 F.3d 1383 (1993), but
disagrees with decisions of the Second and Fourth Circuits,
Chabad-Lubavitch v. Burlington, 936 F.2d 109 (CA2 1991), cert.
denied, 505 U.S. 1218 (1992), Kaplan v. Burlington, 891 F.2d 1024
(CA2 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 926 (1990), Smith v. County of
Albemarle, 895 F.2d 953 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 823 (1990).
We granted certiorari. 513 U.S. ___ (1995).
II
First, a preliminary matter: Respondents contend that we should
treat this as a case in which freedom of speech (the Klan's right
to present the message of the cross display) was denied because of
the State's disagreement with that message's political content,
rather than because of the State's desire to distance itself from
sectarian religion. They suggest in their merits brief and in
their oral argument that Ohio's genuine reason for disallowing the
display was disapproval of the political views of the Ku Klux
Klan. Whatever the fact may be, the case was not presented and
decided that way. The record facts before us and the opinions
below address only the Establishment Clause issue;[FOOTNOTE 1]
that is the question upon which we granted certiorari; and that is
the sole question before us to decide.
Respondents' religious display in Capitol Square was private
expression. Our precedent establishes that private religious
speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, is as fully
protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private
expression. Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School
Dist., 508 U.S. ___ (1993); Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990); Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981); Heffron v. International Soc. for
Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981). Indeed, in
Anglo-American history, at least, government suppression of speech
has so commonly been directed precisely at religious speech that a
free-speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without the
prince. Accordingly, we have not excluded from free-speech
protections religious proselytizing, Heffron, supra, at 647, or
even acts of worship, Widmar, supra, at 269, n.6. Petitioners do
not dispute that respondents, in displaying their cross, were
engaging in constitutionally protected expression. They do contend
that the constitutional protection does not extend to the length
of permitting that expression to be made on Capitol Square.
It is undeniable, of course, that speech which is constitutionally
protected against state suppression is not thereby accorded a
guaranteed forum on all property owned by the State. Postal
Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S. 114, 129
(1981); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 44 (1983). The right to use government property for one's
private expression depends upon whether the property has by law or
tradition been given the status of a public forum, or rather has
been reserved for specific official uses. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 802-803 (1985). If the
former, a State's right to limit protected expressive activity is
sharply circumscribed: it may impose reasonable, content-neutral
time, place and manner restrictions (a ban on all unattended
displays, which did not exist here, might be one such), but it may
regulate expressive content only if such a restriction is
necessary, and narrowly drawn, to serve a compelling state
interest. Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 45. These strict standards
apply here, since the District Court and the Court of Appeals
found that Capitol Square was a traditional public forum. 844
F.Supp., at 1184; 30 F.3d, at 678.
Petitioners do not claim that their denial of respondents'
application was based upon a content-neutral time, place, or
manner restriction. To the contrary, they concede-indeed it is the
essence of their case-that the Board rejected the display
precisely because its content was religious. Petitioners advance a
single justification for closing Capitol Square to respondents'
cross: the State's interest in avoiding official endorsement of
Christianity, as required by the Establishment Clause.
III
There is no doubt that compliance with the Establishment Clause is
a state interest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based
restrictions on speech. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 10-11); Widmar, supra, at 271. Whether that interest is
implicated here, however, is a different question. And we do not
write on a blank slate in answering it. We have twice previously
addressed the combination of private religious expression, a forum
available for public use, content-based regulation, and a State's
interest in complying with the Establishment Clause. Both times,
we have struck down the restriction on religious content. Lamb's
Chapel, supra; Widmar, supra.
In Lamb's Chapel, a school district allowed private groups to use
school facilities during off-hours for a variety of civic, social
and recreational purposes, excluding, however, religious purposes.
We held that even if school property during off-hours was not a
public forum, the school district violated an applicant's
free-speech rights by denying it use of the facilities solely
because of the religious viewpoint of the program it wished to
present. 508 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 6-11). We rejected the
district's compelling-state-interest Establishment Clause defense
(the same made here) because the school property was open to a
wide variety of uses, the district was not directly sponsoring the
religious group's activity, and "any benefit to religion or to the
Church would have been no more than incidental." Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 10). The Lamb's Chapel reasoning applies a fortiori here,
where the property at issue is not a school but a full-fledged
public forum.
Lamb's Chapel followed naturally from our decision in Widmar, in
which we examined a public university's exclusion of student
religious groups from facilities available to other student
groups. There also we addressed official discrimination against
groups who wished to use a "generally open forum" for religious
speech. 454 U.S., at 269. And there also the State claimed that
its compelling interest in complying with the Establishment Clause
justified the content-based restriction. We rejected the defense
because the forum created by the State was open to a broad
spectrum of groups and would provide only incidental benefit to
religion. Id., at 274. We stated categorically that "an open forum
in a public university does not confer any imprimatur of state
approval on religious sects or practices." Ibid.
Quite obviously, the factors that we considered determinative in
Lamb's Chapel and Widmar exist here as well. The State did not
sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was made on
government property that had been opened to the public for speech,
and permission was requested through the same application process
and on the same terms required of other private groups.
IV
Petitioners argue that one feature of the present case
distinguishes it from Lamb's Chapel and Widmar: the forum's
proximity to the seat of government, which, they contend, may
produce the perception that the cross bears the State's approval.
They urge us to apply the so-called "endorsement test," see, e.g.,
Allegheny County v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573 (1989); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465
U.S. 668 (1984), and to find that, because an observer might
mistake private expression for officially endorsed religious
expression, the State's content-based restriction is
constitutional.
We must note, to begin with, that it is not really an "endorsement
test" of any sort, much less the "endorsement test" which appears
in our more recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence, that
petitioners urge upon us. "Endorsement" connotes an expression or
demonstration of approval or support. The New Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary 818 (1993); Webster's New Dictionary 845 (2d
ed. 1950). Our cases have accordingly equated "endorsement" with
"promotion" or "favoritism." Allegheny County, supra, at 593
(citing cases). We find it peculiar to say that government
"promotes" or "favors" a religious display by giving it the same
access to a public forum that all other displays enjoy. And as a
matter of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we have consistently
held that it is no violation for government to enact neutral
policies that happen to benefit religion. See, e.g., Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 608 (1988); Witters v. Washington Dept. of
Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 486-489 (1986); Mueller v.
Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420
(1961). Where we have tested for endorsement of religion, the
subject of the test was either expression by the government
itself, Lynch, supra, or else government action alleged to
discriminate in favor of private religious expression or activity,
Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512
U.S. ___ (slip op., at 18-20) (1994), Allegheny County, supra. The
test petitioners propose, which would attribute to a neutrally
behaving government private religious expression, has no
antecedent in our jurisprudence, and would better be called a
"transferred endorsement" test.
Petitioners rely heavily on Allegheny County and Lynch, but each
is easily distinguished. In Allegheny County we held that the
display of a privately-sponsored crche on the "Grand Staircase"
of the Allegheny County Courthouse violated the Establishment
Clause. That staircase was not, however, open to all on an equal
basis, so the County was favoring sectarian religious expression.
492 U.S., at 599-600, and n. 50 ("[t]he Grand Staircase does not
appear to be the kind of location in which all were free to place
their displays"). We expressly distinguished that site from the
kind of public forum at issue here, and made clear that if the
staircase were available to all on the same terms, "the presence
of the crche in that location for over six weeks would then not
serve to associate the government with the crche." Ibid.
(emphasis added). In Lynch we held that a city's display of a
crche did not violate the Establishment Clause because, in
context, the display did not endorse religion. 465 U.S., at
685-687. The opinion does assume, as petitioners contend, that the
government's use of religious symbols is unconstitutional if it
effectively endorses sectarian religious belief. But the case
neither holds nor even remotely assumes that the government's
neutral treatment of private religious expression can be
unconstitutional.
Petitioners argue that absence of perceived endorsement was
material in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. We did state in Lamb's
Chapel that there was "no realistic danger that the community
would think that the District was endorsing religion or any
particular creed," 508 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). But that
conclusion was not the result of empirical investigation; it
followed directly, we thought, from the fact that the forum was
open and the religious activity privately sponsored. See ibid. It
is significant that we referred only to what would be thought by
"the community"-not by outsiders or individual members of the
community uninformed about the school's practice. Surely some of
the latter, hearing of religious ceremonies on school premises,
and not knowing of the premises' availability and use for all
sorts of other private activities, might leap to the erroneous
conclusion of state endorsement. But, we in effect said, given an
open forum and private sponsorship, erroneous conclusions do not
count. So also in Widmar. Once we determined that the benefit to
religious groups from the public forum was incidental and shared
by other groups, we categorically rejected the State's
Establishment Clause defense. 454 U.S., at 274.
What distinguishes Allegheny County and the dictum in Lynch from
Widmar and Lamb's Chapel is the difference between government
speech and private speech. "[T]here is a crucial difference
between government speech endorsing religion, which the
Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses
protect." Mergens, 496 U.S., at 250 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring).[FOOTNOTE 2] Petitioners assert, in effect, that that
distinction disappears when the private speech is conducted too
close to the symbols of government. But that, of course, must be
merely a subpart of a more general principle: that the distinction
disappears whenever private speech can be mistaken for government
speech. That proposition cannot be accepted, at least where, as
here, the government has not fostered or encouraged the mistake.
Of course, giving sectarian religious speech preferential access
to a forum close to the seat of government (or anywhere else for
that matter) would violate the Establishment Clause (as well as
the Free Speech Clause, since it would involve content
discrimination). And one can conceive of a case in which a
governmental entity manipulates its administration of a public
forum close to the seat of government (or within a government
building) in such a manner that only certain religious groups take
advantage of it, creating an impression of endorsement that is in
fact accurate. But those situations, which involve governmental
favoritism, do not exist here. Capitol Square is a genuinely
public forum, is known to be a public forum, and has been widely
used as a public forum for many, many years. Private religious
speech cannot be subject to veto by those who see favoritism where
there is none.
The contrary view, most strongly espoused by Justice Stevens,
post, at 11-12, but endorsed by Justice Souter and Justice
O'Connor as well, exiles private religious speech to a realm of
less-protected expression heretofore inhabited only by sexually
explicit displays and commercial speech. Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 61, 70-71 (1976); Central Hudson Gas
& Electric Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557
(1980). It will be a sad day when this Court casts piety in with
pornography, and finds the First Amendment more hospitable to
private expletives, see Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 26
(1971), than to private prayers. This would be merely bizarre were
religious speech simply as protected by the Constitution as other
forms of private speech; but it is outright perverse when one
considers that private religious expression receives preferential
treatment under the Free Exercise Clause. It is no answer to say
that the Establishment Clause tempers religious speech. By its
terms that Clause applies only to the words and acts of
government. It was never meant, and has never been read by this
Court, to serve as an impediment to purely private religious
speech connected to the State only through its occurrence in a
public forum.
Since petitioners'"transferred endorsement" principle cannot
possibly be restricted to squares in front of state capitols, the
Establishment Clause regime that it would usher in is most
unappealing. To require (and permit) access by a religious group
in Lamb's Chapel, it was sufficient that the group's activity was
not in fact government sponsored, that the event was open to the
public, and that the benefit of the facilities was shared by
various organizations. Petitioners' rule would require school
districts adopting similar policies in the future to guess whether
some undetermined critical mass of the community might nonetheless
perceive the district to be advocating a religious viewpoint.
Similarly, state universities would be forced to reassess our
statement that "an open forum in a public university does not
confer any imprimatur of state approval on religious sects or
practices." Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274. Whether it does would
henceforth depend upon immediate appearances. Policy makers would
find themselves in a vise between the Establishment Clause on one
side and the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses on the other.
Every proposed act of private, religious expression in a public
forum would force officials to weigh a host of imponderables. How
close to government is too close? What kind of building, and in
what context, symbolizes state authority? If the State guessed
wrong in one direction, it would be guilty of an Establishment
Clause violation; if in the other, it would be liable for
suppressing free exercise or free speech (a risk not run when the
State restrains only its own expression).
The "transferred endorsement" test would also disrupt the settled
principle that policies providing incidental benefits to religion
do not contravene the Establishment Clause. That principle is the
basis for the constitutionality of a broad range of laws, not
merely those that implicate free-speech issues, see, e.g.,
Witters, supra; Mueller, supra. It has radical implications for
our public policy to suggest that neutral laws are invalid
whenever hypothetical observers may-even reasonably-confuse an
incidental benefit to religion with state endorsement.[FOOTNOTE 3]

If Ohio is concerned about misperceptions, nothing prevents it
from requiring all private displays in the Square to be identified
as such. That would be a content-neutral "manner" restriction
which is assuredly constitutional. See Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984). But the State may
not, on the claim of misperception of official endorsement, ban
all private religious speech from the public square, or
discriminate against it by requiring religious speech alone to
disclaim public sponsorship.[FOOTNOTE 4]
* * *
Religious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where
it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or
designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on
equal terms. Those conditions are satisfied here, and therefore
the State may not bar respondents' cross from Capitol Square.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
I join the Court's conclusion that petitioner's exclusion of the
Ku Klux Klan's cross cannot be justified on Establishment Clause
grounds. But the fact that the legal issue before us involves the
Establishment Clause should not lead anyone to think that a cross
erected by the Ku Klux Klan is a purely religious symbol. The
erection of such a cross is a political act, not a Christian one.
There is little doubt that the Klan's main objective is to
establish a racist white government in the United States. In Klan
ceremony, the cross is a symbol of white supremacy and a tool for
the intimidation and harassment of racial minorities, Catholics,
Jews, Communists, and any other groups hated by the Klan. The
cross is associated with the Klan not because of religious
worship, but because of the Klan's practice of cross-burning.
Cross-burning was entirely unknown to the early Ku Klux Klan,
which emerged in some Southern States during Reconstruction. W.
Wade, The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America 146 (1987). The
practice appears to have been the product of Thomas Dixon, whose
book The Clansman formed the story for the movie, The Birth of a
Nation. See M. Newton & J. Newton, The Ku Klux Klan: An
Encyclopedia 145-146 (1991). In the book, cross-burning is
borrowed from an "old Scottish rite" (Dixon apparently believed
that the members of the Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan were the
"reincarnated souls of the Clansmen of Old Scotland") that the
Klan uses to celebrate the execution of a former slave. T. Dixon,
The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan 324-326
(1905). Although the cross took on some religious significance in
the 1920's when the Klan became connected with certain southern
white clergy, by the postwar period it had reverted to its
original function as an instrument of intimidation. Wade, supra,
at 185, 279.
To be sure, the cross appears to serve as a religious symbol of
Christianity for some Klan members. The hymn "The Old Rugged
Cross" is sometimes played during cross-burnings. See W. Moore, A
Sheet and a Cross: A Symbolic Analysis of the Ku Klux Klan 287-288
(Ph.D. dissertation, Tulane University, 1975). But to the extent
that the Klan had a message to communicate in Capitol Square, it
was primarily a political one. During his testimony before the
District Court, the leader of the local Klan testified that the
cross was seen "as a symbol of freedom, as a symbol of trying to
unite our people." App. 150. The Klan chapter wished to erect the
cross because it was also "a symbol of freedom from tyranny," and
because it "was also incorporated in the confederate battle flag."
Ibid. Of course, the cross also had some religious connotation;
the Klan leader linked the cross to what he claimed was one of the
central purposes of the Klan: "to establish a Christian government
in America." Id., at 142-145. But surely this message was both
political and religious in nature.
Although the Klan might have sought to convey a message with some
religious component, I think that the Klan had a primarily
nonreligious purpose in erecting the cross. The Klan simply has
appropriated one of the most sacred of religious symbols as a
symbol of hate. In my mind, this suggests that this case may not
have truly involved the Establishment Clause, although I agree
with the Court's disposition because of the manner in which the
case has come before us. In the end, there may be much less here
than meets the eye.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE BREYER
join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion and concur in
the judgment. Despite the messages of bigotry and racism that may
be conveyed along with religious connotations by the display of a
Ku Klux Klan cross, see ante, at 2 (Thomas, J., concurring), at
bottom this case must be understood as it has been presented to
us-as a case about private religious expression and whether the
State's relationship to it violates the Establishment Clause. In
my view, "the endorsement test asks the right question about
governmental practices challenged on Establishment Clause grounds,
including challenged practices involving the display of religious
symbols," Allegheny County v. American Civil Liberties Union,
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 628 (1989) (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), even where a
neutral state policy toward private religious speech in a public
forum is at issue. Accordingly, I see no necessity to carve out,
as the plurality opinion would today, an exception to the
endorsement test for the public forum context.
For the reasons given by Justice Souter, whose opinion I also
join, I conclude on the facts of this case that there is "no
realistic danger that the community would think that the [State]
was endorsing religion or any particular creed," Lamb's Chapel v.
Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___, ___ (1993)
(slip op., at 10), by granting respondents a permit to erect their
temporary cross on Capitol Square. I write separately, however, to
emphasize that, because it seeks to identify those situations in
which government makes "'adherence to a religion relevant . . . to
a person's standing in the political community,'" Allegheny,
supra, at 594 (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)
(O'Connor, J., concurring), the endorsement test necessarily
focuses upon the perception of a reasonable, informed observer.
I
"In recent years, we have paid particularly close attention [in
Establishment Clause cases] to whether the challenged governmental
practice either has the purpose or effect of 'endorsing' religion,
a concern that has long had a place in our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence." Allegheny, supra, at 592. See also Lamb's Chapel,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v.
Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 390 (1985) (asking "whether the symbolic union
of church and state effected by the challenged governmental action
is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the
controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the
nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious
choices"). A government statement "'that religion or a particular
religious belief is favored or preferred,'" Allegheny, supra, at
593 (quoting Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 70 (1985) (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment), violates the prohibition against
establishment of religion because such "[e]ndorsement sends a
message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members
of the political community, and an accompanying message to
adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community," Lynch, supra, at 688 (O'Connor, J., concurring). See
also Allegheny, supra, at 628 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); Wallace, supra, at 69 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment). Although "[e]xperience proves that the
Establishment Clause . . . cannot easily be reduced to a single
test," Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet,
512 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 10) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), the endorsement
inquiry captures the fundamental requirement of the Establishment
Clause when courts are called upon to evaluate the
constitutionality of religious symbols on public property. See
Allegheny, supra, at 593-594.
While the plurality would limit application of the endorsement
test to "expression by the government itself, . . . or else
government action alleged to discriminate in favor of private
religious expression or activity," ante, at 8, I believe that an
impermissible message of endorsement can be sent in a variety of
contexts, not all of which involve direct government speech or
outright favoritism. See infra, at 6-7. It is true that neither
Allegheny nor Lynch, our two prior religious display cases,
involved the same combination of private religious speech and a
public forum that we have before us today. Nonetheless, as Justice
Souter aptly demonstrates, post, at 4-10, we have on several
occasions employed an endorsement perspective in Establishment
Clause cases where private religious conduct has intersected with
a neutral governmental policy providing some benefit in a manner
that parallels the instant case. Thus, while I join the discussion
of Lamb's Chapel and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in
Part III of the Court's opinion, I do so with full recognition
that the factors the Court properly identifies ultimately led in
each case to the conclusion that there was no endorsement of
religion by the State. Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
10); Widmar, supra, at 274. See also post, at 8-9 (Souter, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
There is, as the plurality notes, ante, at 10, "a crucial
difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the
Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses
protect." Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.
Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250 (1990) (plurality opinion). But the
quoted statement was made while applying the endorsement test
itself; indeed, the sentence upon which the plurality relies was
followed immediately by the conclusion that "secondary school
students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a
school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely
permits on a nondiscriminatory basis." Ibid. Thus, as I read the
decisions Justice Souter carefully surveys, our prior cases do not
imply that the endorsement test has no place where private
religious speech in a public forum is at issue. Moreover, numerous
lower courts (including the Court of Appeals in this case) have
applied the endorsement test in precisely the context before us
today. See, e.g., Chabad-Lubavitch of Georgia v. Miller, 5 F.3d
1383 (CA11 1993) (en banc); Kreisner v. San Diego, 1 F.3d 775,
782-787 (CA9 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. ___ (1994); Americans
United for Separation of Church and State v. Grand Rapids, 980
F.2d 1538 (CA6 1992) (en banc); Doe v. Small, 964 F.2d 611 (CA7
1992) (en banc); cf. Smith v. County of Albemarle, 895 F.2d 953
(CA4 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 823 (1990); Kaplan v.
Burlington, 891 F.2d 1024 (CA2 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 926
(1990). Given this background, I see no necessity to draw new
lines where "[r]eligious expression . . . (1) is purely private
and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum," ante,
at 14.
None of this is to suggest that I would be likely to come to a
different result from the plurality where truly private speech is
allowed on equal terms in a vigorous public forum that the
government has administered properly. That the religious display
at issue here was erected by a private group in a public square
available "for use by the public . . . for free discussion of
public questions, or for activities of a broad public purpose,"
Ohio Admin. Code Ann.   128-4-02(A) (1994), certainly informs the
Establishment Clause inquiry under the endorsement test. Indeed,
many of the factors the plurality identifies are some of those I
would consider important in deciding cases like this one where
religious speakers seek access to public spaces: "The State did
not sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was made on
government property that had been opened to the public for speech,
and permission was requested through the same application process
and on the same terms required of other groups." Ante, at 7. And,
as I read the plurality opinion, a case is not governed by its
proposed per se rule where such circumstances are otherwise-that
is, where preferential placement of a religious symbol in a public
space or government manipulation of the forum is involved. See
ante, at 11.
To the plurality's consideration of the open nature of the forum
and the private ownership of the display, however, I would add the
presence of a sign disclaiming government sponsorship or
endorsement on the Klan cross, which would make the State's role
clear to the community. This factor is important because, as
Justice Souter makes clear, post, at 3-4, certain aspects of the
cross display in this case arguably intimate government approval
of respondents' private religious message-particularly that the
cross is an especially potent sectarian symbol which stood
unattended in close proximity to official government buildings. In
context, a disclaimer helps remove doubt about State approval of
respondents' religious message. Cf. Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274, n.
14 ("In light of the large number of groups meeting on campus,
however, we doubt students could draw any reasonable inference of
University support from the mere fact of a campus meeting place.
The University's student handbook already notes that the
University's name will not 'be identified in any way with the
aims, policies, programs, products, or opinions of any
organization or its members'"). On these facts, then, "the message
[of inclusion] is one of neutrality rather than endorsement."
Mergens, 496 U.S., at 248 (plurality opinion).
Our agreement as to the outcome of this case, however, cannot mask
the fact that I part company with the plurality on a fundamental
point: I disagree that "[i]t has radical implications for our
public policy to suggest that neutral laws are invalid whenever
hypothetical observers may-even reasonably--confuse an incidental
benefit to religion with State endorsement." Ante, at 13. On the
contrary, when the reasonable observer would view a government
practice as endorsing religion, I believe that it is our duty to
hold the practice invalid. The plurality today takes an
exceedingly narrow view of the Establishment Clause that is out of
step both with the Court's prior cases and with well-established
notions of what the Constitution requires. The Clause is more than
a negative prohibition against certain narrowly defined forms of
government favoritism, see ante, at 11; it also imposes
affirmative obligations that may require a State, in some
situations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as supporting
or endorsing a private religious message. That is, the
Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the
application of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously
oblivious to the effects of its actions. Governmental intent
cannot control, and not all state policies are permissible under
the Religion Clauses simply because they are neutral in form.
Where the government's operation of a public forum has the effect
of endorsing religion, even if the governmental actor neither
intends nor actively encourages that result, see Lynch, 465 U.S.,
at 690 (O'Connor, J., concurring), the Establishment Clause is
violated. This is so not because of "'transferred endorsement,'"
ante, at 8, or mistaken attribution of private speech to the
State, but because the State's own actions (operating the forum in
a particular manner and permitting the religious expression to
take place therein), and their relationship to the private speech
at issue, actually convey a message of endorsement. At some point,
for example, a private religious group may so dominate a public
forum that a formal policy of equal access is transformed into a
demonstration of approval. Cf. Mergens, 454 U.S., at 275
(concluding that there was no danger of an Establishment Clause
violation in a public university's allowing access by student
religious groups to facilities available to others "[a]t least in
the absence of empirical evidence that religious groups will
dominate [the school's] open forum"). Other circumstances may
produce the same effect-whether because of the fortuity of
geography, the nature of the particular public space, or the
character of the religious speech at issue, among others. Our
Establishment Clause jurisprudence should remain flexible enough
to handle such situations when they arise.
In the end, I would recognize that the Establishment Clause
inquiry cannot be distilled into a fixed, per se rule. Thus,
"[e]very government practice must be judged in its unique
circumstances to determine whether it constitutes an endorsement
or disapproval of religion." Lynch, 465 U.S., at 694 (O'Connor,
J., concurring). And this question cannot be answered in the
abstract, but instead requires courts to examine the history and
administration of a particular practice to determine whether it
operates as such an endorsement. I continue to believe that
government practices relating to speech on religious topics "must
be subjected to careful judicial scrutiny," ibid., and that the
endorsement test supplies an appropriate standard for that
inquiry.
II
Conducting the review of government action required by the
Establishment Clause is always a sensitive matter. Unfortunately,
as I noted in Allegheny, "even the development of articulable
standards and guidelines has not always resulted in agreement
among the Members of this Court on the results in individual
cases." 492 U.S., at 623. Today, Justice Stevens reaches a
different conclusion regarding whether the Board's decision to
allow respondents' display on Capitol Square constituted an
impermissible endorsement of the cross' religious message. Yet I
believe it is important to note that we have not simply arrived at
divergent results after conducting the same analysis. Our
fundamental point of departure, it appears, concerns the knowledge
that is properly attributed to the test's "reasonable observer
[who] evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice conveys
a message of endorsement of religion." Id., at 630 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, proper
application of the endorsement test requires that the reasonable
observer be deemed more informed than the casual passerby
postulated by the dissent.
Because an Establishment Clause violation must be moored in
government action of some sort, and because our concern is with
the political community writ large, see Allegheny, supra, at 627
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
Lynch, 465 U.S., at 690, the endorsement inquiry is not about the
perceptions of particular individuals or saving isolated
non-adherents from the discomfort of viewing symbols of a faith to
which they do not subscribe. Indeed, to avoid "entirely sweep[ing]
away all government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of
religion in the lives of our citizens," Allegheny, supra, at 623
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), our
Establishment Clause jurisprudence must seek to identify the point
at which the government becomes responsible, whether due to
favoritism toward or disregard for the evident effect of religious
speech, for the injection of religion into the political life of
the citizenry.
I therefore disagree that the endorsement test should focus on the
actual perception of individual observers, who naturally have
differing degrees of knowledge. Under such an approach, a
religious display is necessarily precluded so long as some
passersby would perceive a governmental endorsement thereof. In my
view, however, the endorsement test creates a more collective
standard to gauge "the 'objective' meaning of the [government's]
statement in the community," Lynch, supra, at 690 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). In this respect, the applicable observer is similar
to the "reasonable person" in tort law, who "is not to be
identified with any ordinary individual, who might occasionally do
unreasonable things" but is "rather a personification of a
community ideal of reasonable behavior, determined by the
[collective] social judgment." W. Keeton et al., Prosser and
Keeton on The Law of Torts 175 (5th ed. 1984). Thus, "we do not
ask whether there is any person who could find an endorsement of
religion, whether some people may be offended by the display, or
whether some reasonable person might think [the State] endorses
religion." Americans United, 980 F.2d, at 1544. Saying that the
endorsement inquiry should be conducted from the perspective of a
hypothetical observer who is presumed to possess a certain level
of information that all citizens might not share neither chooses
the perceptions of the majority over those of a "reasonable
non-adherent," cf. L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1293 (2d
ed. 1988), nor invites disregard for the values the Establishment
Clause was intended to protect. It simply recognizes the
fundamental difficulty inherent in focusing on actual people:
there is always someone who, with a particular quantum of
knowledge, reasonably might perceive a particular action as an
endorsement of religion. A State has not made religion relevant to
standing in the political community simply because a particular
viewer of a display might feel uncomfortable.
It is for this reason that the reasonable observer in the
endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history and
context of the community and forum in which the religious display
appears. As I explained in Allegheny, "the 'history and ubiquity'
of a practice is relevant because it provides part of the context
in which a reasonable observer evaluates whether a challenged
governmental practice conveys a message of endorsement of
religion." 492 U.S., at 630. Nor can the knowledge attributed to
the reasonable observer be limited to the information gleaned
simply from viewing the challenged display. Today's proponents of
the endorsement test all agree that we should attribute to the
observer knowledge that the cross is a religious symbol, that
Capitol Square is owned by the State, and that the large building
nearby is the seat of state government. See post, at 10-11
(Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); post,
at 11 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In my view, our hypothetical
observer also should know the general history of the place in
which the cross is displayed. Indeed, the fact that Capitol Square
is a public park that has been used over time by private speakers
of various types is as much a part of the display's context as its
proximity to the Ohio Statehouse. Cf. Allegheny, 492 U.S., at 600,
n. 50 (noting that "[t]he Grand Staircase does not appear to be
the kind of location in which all were free to place their
displays for weeks at a time . . ."). This approach does not
require us to assume an "'ultra-reasonable observer' who
understands the vagaries of this Court's First Amendment
jurisprudence," post, at 12 (Stevens, J., dissenting). An informed
member of the community will know how the public space in question
has been used in the past-and it is that fact, not that the space
may meet the legal definition of a public forum, which is relevant
to the endorsement inquiry.
The dissent's property-based argument fails to give sufficient
weight to the fact that the cross at issue here was displayed in a
forum traditionally open to the public. "The very fact that a sign
is installed on public property," the dissent suggests, "implies
official approval of its message."  Post, at 6. While this may be
the case where a government building and its immediate curtilage
are involved, it is not necessarily so with respect to those
"places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been
devoted to assembly and debate, . . . [particularly] streets and
parks which 'have immemorially been held in trust for the use of
the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of
assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing
public questions.'" Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators'
Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983) (quoting Hague v. Committee for
Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939)). To the extent
there is a presumption that "structures on government
property-and, in particular, in front of buildings plainly
identified with the State-imply state approval of their message,"
post, at 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting), that presumption can be
rebutted where the property at issue is a forum historically
available for private expression. The reasonable observer would
recognize the distinction between speech the government supports
and speech that it merely allows in a place that traditionally has
been open to a range of private speakers accompanied, if
necessary, by an appropriate disclaimer.
In this case, I believe, the reasonable observer would view the
Klan's cross display fully aware that Capitol Square is a public
space in which a multiplicity of groups, both secular and
religious, engage in expressive conduct. It is precisely this type
of knowledge that we presumed in Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ___
(slip op., at 10), and in Mergens, 496 U.S., at 250 (plurality
opinion). Moreover, this observer would certainly be able to read
and understand an adequate disclaimer, which the Klan had informed
the State it would include in the display at the time it applied
for the permit, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A-15 to A-16; post, at
11, n. 1 (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment), and the content of which the Board could have defined
as it deemed necessary as a condition of granting the Klan's
application. Cf. American Civil Liberties Union v. Wilkinson, 895
F.2d 1098, 1104-1106 (CA6 1990). On the facts of this case,
therefore, I conclude that the reasonable observer would not
interpret the State's tolerance of the Klan's private religious
display in Capitol Square as an endorsement of religion.
III
"To be sure, the endorsement test depends on a sensitivity to the
unique circumstances and context of a particular challenged
practice and, like any test that is sensitive to context, it may
not always yield results with unanimous agreement at the margins."
Allegheny, 492 U.S., at 629 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). In my view, however, this flexibility is
a virtue and not a vice; "courts must keep in mind both the
fundamental place held by the Establishment Clause in our
constitutional scheme and the myriad, subtle ways in which
Establishment Clause values can be eroded," Lynch, 465 U.S., at
694 (O'Connor, J., concurring).
I agree that "compliance with the Establishment Clause is a state
interest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based
restrictions on speech." Ante, at 6. The Establishment Clause
"prohibits government from appearing to take a position on
questions of religious belief or from 'making adherence to a
religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the
political community.'" Allegheny, supra, at 593-594 (quoting
Lynch, supra, at 687 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). Because I
believe that, under the circumstances at issue here, allowing the
Klan cross, along with an adequate disclaimer, to be displayed on
Capitol Square presents no danger of doing so, I conclude that the
State has not presented a compelling justification for denying
respondents their permit.
JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE BREYER
join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion. I also
want to note specifically my agreement with the Court's suggestion
that the State of Ohio could ban all unattended private displays
in Capitol Square if it so desired. See ante, at 5-6; see also
post, at 7-8 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The fact that the Capitol
lawn has been the site of public protests and gatherings, and is
the location of any number of the government's own unattended
displays, such as statues, does not disable the State from closing
the square to all privately owned, unattended structures. A
government entity may ban posters on publicly owned utility poles
to eliminate visual clutter, City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808 (1984), and may bar
camping as part of a demonstration in certain public parks, Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288 (1984). It
may similarly adopt a content-neutral policy prohibiting private
individuals and groups from erecting unattended displays in forums
around public buildings. See also Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491
U.S. 781, 791 (1989) ("[E]ven in a public forum the government may
impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of
protected speech, provided [that] the restrictions 'are justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that
they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental
interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for
communication of the information,'" quoting Clark, supra, at 293).
Otherwise, however, I limit my concurrence to the judgment.
Although I agree in the end that, in the circumstances of this
case, petitioners erred in denying the Klan's application for a
permit to erect a cross on Capitol Square, my analysis of the
Establishment Clause issue differs from Justice Scalia's, and I
vote to affirm in large part because of the possibility of
affixing a sign to the cross adequately disclaiming any government
sponsorship or endorsement of it.
The plurality's opinion declines to apply the endorsement test to
the Board's action, in favor of a per se rule: religious
expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is
private and (2) occurs in a public forum, even if a reasonable
observer would see the expression as indicating state endorsement.
Ante, at 14. This per se rule would be an exception to the
endorsement test, not previously recognized and out of square with
our precedents.
I
My disagreement with the plurality on the law may receive some
focus from attention to a matter of straight fact that we see
alike: in some circumstances an intelligent observer may mistake
private, unattended religious displays in a public forum for
government speech endorsing religion. See ante, at 13
(acknowledging that "hypothetical observers may-even
reasonably-confuse an incidental benefit to religion with state
endorsement") (emphasis in original); see also ante, at 14, n. 4
(noting that an observer might be "misled" by the presence of the
cross in Capitol Square if the disclaimer was of insufficient size
or if the observer failed to enquire whether the State had
sponsored the cross). The Klan concedes this possibility as well,
saying that, in its view, "on a different set of facts, the
government might be found guilty of violating the endorsement test
by permitting a private religious display in a public forum."
Brief for Respondents 43.
An observer need not be "obtuse," Doe v. Small, 964 F.2d 611, 630
(CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J., concurring), to presume that an
unattended display on government land in a place of prominence in
front of a government building either belongs to the government,
represents government speech, or enjoys its location because of
government endorsement of its message. Capitol Square, for
example, is the site of a number of unattended displays owned or
sponsored by the government, some permanent (statues), some
temporary (such as the Christmas tree and a "Seasons Greetings"
banner), and some in between (flags, which are, presumably, taken
down and put up from time to time). See App. 59, 64-65 (photos);
Appendices A & B to this opinion, infra. Given the domination of
the square by the government's own displays, one would not be a
dimwit as a matter of law to think that an unattended religious
display there was endorsed by the government, even though the
square has also been the site of three privately sponsored,
unattended displays over the years (a menorah, a United Way
"thermometer," and some artisans' booths left overnight during an
arts festival), ante, at 2, cf. Allegheny County v. American Civil
Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 600, n.
50 (1989) ("Even if the Grand Staircase occasionally was used for
displays other than the crche . . . it remains true that any
display located there fairly may be understood to express views
that receive the support and endorsement of the government"), and
even though the square meets the legal definition of a public
forum and has been used "[f]or over a century" as the site of
"speeches, gatherings, and festivals," ante, at 1. When an
individual speaks in a public forum, it is reasonable for an
observer to attribute the speech, first and foremost, to the
speaker, while an unattended display (and any message it conveys)
can naturally be viewed as belonging to the owner of the land on
which it stands.
In sum, I do not understand that I am at odds with the plurality
when I assume that in some circumstances an intelligent observer
would reasonably perceive private religious expression in a public
forum to imply the government's endorsement of religion. My
disagreement with the plurality is simply that I would attribute
these perceptions of the intelligent observer to the reasonable
observer of Establishment Clause analysis under our precedents,
where I believe that such reasonable perceptions matter.
II
In Allegheny County, the Court alluded to two elements of the
analytical framework supplied by Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602
(1971), by asking "whether the challenged governmental practice
either has the purpose or effect of 'endorsing' religion." 492
U.S., at 592. We said that "the prohibition against governmental
endorsement of religion 'preclude[s] government from conveying or
attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular
religious belief is favored or preferred,'" id., at 593, quoting
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 70 (1985) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment) (emphasis omitted), and held that "[t]he
Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from
appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief,"
492 U.S., at 593-594.
Allegheny County's endorsement test cannot be dismissed, as
Justice Scalia suggests, as applying only to situations in which
there is an allegation that the Establishment Clause has been
violated through "expression by the government itself" or
"government action . . . discriminat[ing] in favor of private
religious expression." Ante, at 8. (emphasis omitted). Such a
distinction would, in all but a handful of cases, make meaningless
the "effect-of-endorsing" part of Allegheny County's test. Effects
matter to the Establishment Clause, and one, principal way that we
assess them is by asking whether the practice in question creates
the appearance of endorsement to the reasonable observer. See
Allegheny County, supra, at 630, 635-636 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment); Witters v. Washington Dept.
of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 493 (1986) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Allegheny
County, supra, at 593-594, 599-600 (majority opinion); Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 690 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). If
a reasonable observer would perceive a religious display in a
government forum as government speech endorsing religion, then the
display has made "religion relevant, in . . . public perception,
to status in the political community." Id., at 692 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). Unless we are to retreat entirely to government
intent and abandon consideration of effects, it makes no sense to
recognize a public perception of endorsement as a harm only in
that subclass of cases in which the government owns the display.
Indeed, the Court stated in Allegheny County that "once the
judgment has been made that a particular proclamation of Christian
belief, when disseminated from a particular location on government
property, has the effect of demonstrating the government's
endorsement of Christian faith, then it necessarily follows that
the practice must be enjoined." 492 U.S., at 612. Notably, we did
not say that it was only a "particular government proclamation"
that could have such an unconstitutional effect, nor does the
passage imply anything of the kind.
The significance of the fact that the Court in Allegheny County
did not intend to lay down a per se rule in the way suggested by
the plurality today has been confirmed by subsequent cases. In
Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,
496 U.S. 226 (1990), six Justices applied the endorsement test to
decide whether the Establishment Clause would be violated by a
public high school's application of the Equal Access Act, Pub. L.
98-377, 98 Stat. 1302, 20 U.S.C.    4071-4074, to allow students
to form a religious club having the same access to meeting
facilities as other "noncurricular" groups organized by students.
A plurality of four Justices concluded that such an equal access
policy "does not convey a message of state approval or endorsement
of the particular religion" espoused by the student religious
group. 496 U.S., at 252 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,
and White and Blackmun, JJ.). Two others concurred in the judgment
in order "to emphasize the steps [the school] must take to avoid
appearing to endorse the [religious] club's goals." Id., at 263
(opinion of Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J.); see also id., at
264 ("If public schools are perceived as conferring the imprimatur
of the State on religious doctrine or practice as a result of such
a policy, the nominally 'neutral' character of the policy will not
save it from running afoul of the Establishment Clause") (emphasis
in original).
What is important is that, even though Mergens involved private
religious speech in a nondiscriminatory "'limited open forum,'"
id., at 233, 247, a majority of the Court reached the conclusion
in the case not by applying an irrebuttable presumption, as the
plurality does today, but by making a contextual judgment taking
account of the circumstances of the specific case. See id., at
250-252 (plurality opinion); id., at 264-270 (opinion of Marshall,
J., joined by Brennan, J.); cf. Allegheny County, supra, at 629
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
("[T]he endorsement test depends on a sensitivity to the unique
circumstances and context of a particular challenged practice");
Lynch, supra, at 694 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("Every government
practice must be judged in its unique circumstances to determine
whether it constitutes an endorsement or disapproval of
religion"). The Mergens plurality considered the nature of the
likely audience, 496 U.S., at 250 ("[S]econdary school students
are mature enough . . . to understand that a school does not
endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a
nondiscriminatory basis"); the details of the particular forum,
id., at 252 (noting "the broad spectrum of officially recognized
student clubs" at the school, and the students' freedom "to
initiate and organize additional student clubs"); the
presumptively secular nature of most student organizations, ibid.
("'[I]n the absence of empirical evidence that religious groups
will dominate [the] . . . open forum, . . . the advancement of
religion would not be the forum's "primary effect,"'" quoting
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 275 (1981)); and the school's
specific action or inaction that would disassociate itself from
any religious message, 496 U.S., at 251 ("[N]o school officials
actively participate" in the religious group's activities). The
plurality, moreover, expressly relied on the fact that the school
could issue a disclaimer specific to the religious group,
concluding that "[t]o the extent a school makes clear that its
recognition of [a religious student group] is not an endorsement .
of the club evinces neutrality toward, rather than endorsement of,
religious speech." Ibid.; see also id., at 270 (Marshall, J.,
concurring in judgment) (noting importance of schools "taking
whatever further steps are necessary to make clear that their
recognition of a religious club does not reflect their endorsement
of the views of the club's participants").
Similarly, in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School
Dist., 508 U.S. ___ (1993), we held that an evangelical church,
wanting to use public school property to show a series of films
about child-rearing with a religious perspective, could not be
refused access to the premises under a policy that would open the
school to other groups showing similar films from a non-religious
perspective. In reaching this conclusion, we expressly concluded
that the policy would "not have the principal or primary effect of
advancing or inhibiting religion." 508 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at
10). Again we looked to the specific circumstances of the private
religious speech and the public forum: the film would not be shown
during school hours or be sponsored by the school, it would be
open to the public, and the forum had been used "repeatedly" by "a
wide variety" of other private speakers. Ibid. "Under these
circumstances," we concluded, "there would have been no realistic
danger that the community would think that the [school] was
endorsing religion." Ibid. We thus expressly looked to the
endorsement effects of the private religious speech at issue,
notwithstanding the fact that there was no allegation that the
Establishment Clause had been violated through active "expression
by the government itself" or affirmative "government action . . .
discriminat[ing] in favor of private religious expression." Ante,
at 8-9 (emphasis omitted). Indeed, the issue of whether the
private religious speech in a government forum had the effect of
advancing religion was central, rather than irrelevant, to our
Establishment Clause enquiry. This is why I agree with the Court
that "[t]he Lamb's Chapel reasoning applies a fortiori here,"
ante, at 7.
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), is not to the contrary.
Although Widmar was decided before our adoption of the endorsement
test in Allegheny County, its reasoning fits with such a test and
not with the per se rule announced today. There, in determining
whether it would violate the Establishment Clause to allow private
religious speech in a "generally open forum" at a university, 454
U.S., at 269, the Court looked to the Lemon test, 454 U.S., at
271, and focused on the "effects" prong, id., at 272, in reaching
a contextual judgment. It was relevant that university students
"should be able to appreciate that the University's policy is one
of neutrality toward religion," that students were unlikely, as a
matter of fact, to "draw any reasonable inference of University
support from the mere fact of a campus meeting place," and that
the University's student handbook carried a disclaimer that the
University should not "'be identified in any way with the . . .
opinions of any [student] organization.'" Id., at 274 n. 14. "In
this context," id., at 273, and in the "absence of empirical
evidence that religious groups [would] dominate [the] open forum,"
id., at 275, the Court found that the forum at issue did not
"confer any imprimatur of state approval on religious sects or
practices," id., at 274.
Even if precedent and practice were otherwise, however, and there
were an open question about applying the endorsement test to
private speech in public forums, I would apply it in preference to
the plurality's view, which creates a serious loophole in the
protection provided by the endorsement test. In Justice Scalia's
view, as I understand it, the Establishment Clause is violated in
a public forum only when the government itself intentionally
endorses religion or willfully "foster[s]" a misperception of
endorsement in the forum, ante, at 11, or when it "manipulates"
the public forum "in such a manner that only certain religious
groups take advantage of it," ibid. If the list of forbidden acts
is truly this short, then governmental bodies and officials are
left with generous scope to encourage a multiplicity of religious
speakers to erect displays in public forums. As long as the
governmental entity does not "manipulat[e]" the forum in such a
way as to exclude all other speech, the plurality's opinion would
seem to invite such government encouragement, even when the result
will be the domination of the forum by religious displays and
religious speakers. By allowing government to encourage what it
can not do on its own, the proposed per se rule would tempt a
public body to contract out its establishment of religion, by
encouraging the private enterprise of the religious to exhibit
what the government could not display itself.
Something of the sort, in fact, may have happened here.
Immediately after the District Court issued the injunction
ordering petitioners to grant the Klan's permit, a local church
council applied for a permit, apparently for the purpose of
overwhelming the Klan's cross with other crosses. The council
proposed to invite all local churches to erect crosses, and the
Board granted "blanket permission" for "all churches friendly to
or affiliated with" the council to do so. See Brief in Opposition
RA24-RA26. The end result was that a part of the square was strewn
with crosses, see Appendices A & B to this opinion, infra, at
14-15, and while the effect in this case may have provided more
embarrassment than suspicion of endorsement, the opportunity for
the latter is clear.
III
As for the specifics of this case, one must admit that a number of
facts known to the Board, or reasonably anticipated, weighed in
favor of upholding its denial of the permit. For example, the
Latin cross the Klan sought to erect is the principal symbol of
Christianity around the world, and display of the cross alone
could not reasonably be taken to have any secular point. It was
displayed immediately in front of the Ohio Statehouse, with the
government's flags flying nearby, and the government's statues
close at hand. For much of the time the cross was supposed to
stand on the square, it would have been the only private display
on the public plot (the menorah's permit expired several days
before the cross actually went up). See Pet. for Cert. A15-A16,
A31; 30 F.3d, at 677. There was nothing else on the Statehouse
lawn that would have suggested a forum open to any and all
private, unattended religious displays.
Based on these and other factors, the Board was understandably
concerned about a possible Establishment Clause violation if it
had granted the permit. But a flat denial of the Klan's
application was not the Board's only option to protect against an
appearance of endorsement, and the Board was required to find its
most "narrowly drawn" alternative. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983), see also ante, at 6.
Either of two possibilities would have been better suited to this
situation. In support of the Klan's application, its
representative stated in a letter to the Board that the cross
would be accompanied by a disclaimer, legible "from a distance,"
explaining that the cross was erected by private individuals
"without government support." App. 118. The letter said that "the
contents of the sign" were "open to negotiation." Ibid.[FOOTNOTE
1] The Board, then, could have granted the application subject to
the condition that the Klan attach a disclaimer sufficiently large
and clear to preclude any reasonable inference that the cross was
there to "demonstrat[e] the government's allegiance to, or
endorsement of, Christian faith." Allegheny County, 492 U.S., at
612.[FOOTNOTE 2] In the alternative, the Board could have
instituted a policy of restricting all private, unattended
displays to one area of the square, with a permanent sign marking
the area as a forum for private speech carrying no endorsement
from the State.
With such alternatives available, the Board cannot claim that its
flat denial was a narrowly tailored response to the Klan's permit
application and thus cannot rely on that denial as necessary to
ensure that the State did not "appea[r] to take a position on
questions of religious belief." Id., at 594. For these reasons, I
concur in the judgment.
APPENDIX A (Not available in electronic version)
APPENDIX B (Not available in electronic version)
JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
The Establishment Clause should be construed to create a strong
presumption against the installation of unattended religious
symbols on public property. Although the State of Ohio has allowed
Capitol Square, the area around the seat of its government, to be
used as a public forum, and although it has occasionally allowed
private groups to erect other sectarian displays there, neither
fact provides a sufficient basis for rebutting that presumption.
On the contrary, the sequence of sectarian displays disclosed by
the record in this case illustrates the importance of rebuilding
the "wall of separation between church and State" that Jefferson
envisioned.[FOOTNOTE 1]
I
At issue in this case is an unadorned Latin cross, which the Ku
Klux Klan placed, and left unattended, on the lawn in front of the
Ohio State Capitol. The Court decides this case on the assumption
that the cross was a religious symbol. I agree with that
assumption notwithstanding the hybrid character of this particular
object. The record indicates that the "Grand Titan of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan for the Realm of Ohio" applied for a permit to
place a cross in front of the State Capitol because "the Jews"
were placing a "symbol for the Jewish belief" in the Square. App.
173.[FOOTNOTE 2] Some observers, unaware of who had sponsored the
cross, or unfamiliar with the history of the Klan and its reaction
to the menorah, might interpret the Klan's cross as an
inspirational symbol of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus
Christ. More knowledgeable observers might regard it, given the
context, as an anti-semitic symbol of bigotry and disrespect for a
particular religious sect. Under the first interpretation, the
cross is plainly a religious symbol.[FOOTNOTE 3] Under the second,
an icon of intolerance expressing an anti-clerical message should
also be treated as a religious symbol because the Establishment
Clause must prohibit official sponsorship of irreligious as well
as religious messages. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 52
(1985). This principle is no less binding if the anti-religious
message is also a bigoted message. See United States v. Ballard,
322 U.S. 78, 86-89 (1944) (government lacks power to judge truth
of religious beliefs); Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 728 (1872)
("The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no
dogma, the establishment of no sect").
Thus, while this unattended, freestanding wooden cross was
unquestionably a religious symbol, observers may well have
received completely different messages from that symbol. Some
might have perceived it as a message of love, others as a message
of hate, still others as a message of exclusion-a Statehouse sign
calling powerfully to mind their outsider status. In any event, it
was a message that the State of Ohio may not communicate to its
citizens without violating the Establishment Clause.
II
The plurality does not disagree with the proposition that the
State may not espouse a religious message. Ante, at 10. It
concludes, however, that the State has not sent such a message; it
has merely allowed others to do so on its property. Thus, the
State has provided an "incidental benefit" to religion by allowing
private parties access to a traditional public forum. See ante, at
10. In my judgment, neither precedent nor respect for the values
protected by the Establishment Clause justifies that conclusion.
The Establishment Clause, "at the very least, prohibits government
from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief
or from 'making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a
person's standing in the political community.'" County of
Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 593-594 (1989), quoting Lynch v. Donnelly,
465 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). At least when
religious symbols are involved, the question of whether the state
is "appearing to take a position" is best judged from the
standpoint of a "reasonable observer."[FOOTNOTE 4] It is
especially important to take account of the perspective of a
reasonable observer who may not share the particular religious
belief it expresses. A paramount purpose of the Establishment
Clause is to protect such a person from being made to feel like an
outsider in matters of faith, and a stranger in the political
community. Ibid. If a reasonable person could perceive a
government endorsement of religion from a private display, then
the State may not allow its property to be used as a forum for
that display. No less stringent rule can adequately protect
non-adherents from a well-grounded perception that their sovereign
supports a faith to which they do not subscribe.[FOOTNOTE 5]
In determining whether the State's maintenance of the Klan's cross
in front of the Statehouse conveyed a forbidden message of
endorsement, we should be mindful of the power of a symbol
standing alone and unexplained. Even on private property, signs
and symbols are generally understood to express the owner's views.
The location of the sign is a significant component of the message
it conveys.
"Displaying a sign from one's own residence often carries a
message quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace else,
or conveying the same text or picture by other means. Precisely
because of their location, such signs provide information about
the identity of the 'speaker.' As an early and eminent student of
rhetoric observed, the identity of the speaker is an important
component of many attempts to persuade. A sign advocating 'Peace
in the Gulf' in the front lawn of a retired general or decorated
war veteran may provoke a different reaction than the same sign in
a 10-year-old child's bedroom window or the same message on a
bumper sticker of a passing automobile. An espousal of socialism
may carry different implications when displayed on the grounds of
a stately mansion than when pasted on a factory wall or an
ambulatory sandwich board." City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. ___,
___ (1994) (slip op., at 13-14) (footnote omitted).
Like other speakers, a person who places a sign on her own
property has the autonomy to choose the content of her own
message. Cf. McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. ___, ___
(1995) (slip op., at 7). Thus, the location of a stationary,
unattended sign generally is both a component of its message and
an implicit endorsement of that message by the party with the
power to decide whether it may be conveyed from that
location.[FOOTNOTE 6]
So it is with signs and symbols left to speak for themselves on
public property. The very fact that a sign is installed on public
property implies official recognition and reinforcement of its
message. That implication is especially strong when the sign
stands in front of the seat of the government itself. The
"reasonable observer" of any symbol placed unattended in front of
any capitol in the world will normally assume that the
sovereign-which is not only the owner of that parcel of real
estate but also the lawgiver for the surrounding territory-has
sponsored and facilitated its message.
That the State may have granted a variety of groups permission to
engage in uncensored expressive activities in front of the capitol
building does not, in my opinion, qualify or contradict the normal
inference of endorsement that the reasonable observer would draw
from the unattended, freestanding sign or symbol. Indeed, parades
and demonstrations at or near the seat of government are often
exercises of the right of the people to petition their government
for a redress of grievances-exercises in which the government is
the recipient of the message rather than the messenger. Even when
a demonstration or parade is not directed against government
policy, but merely has made use of a particularly visible forum in
order to reach as wide an audience as possible, there usually can
be no mistake about the identity of the messengers as persons
other than the State. But when a statue or some other
free-standing, silent, unattended, immoveable structure-regardless
of its particular message-appears on the lawn of the Capitol
building, the reasonable observer must identify the State either
as the messenger, or, at the very least, as one who has endorsed
the message. Contrast, in this light, the image of the cross
standing alone and unattended, see infra, at 22, and the image the
observer would take away were a hooded Klansman holding, or
standing next to, the very same cross.
This Court has never held that a private party has a right to
place an unattended object in a public forum.[FOOTNOTE 7] Today
the Court correctly recognizes that a State may impose a ban on
all private unattended displays in such a forum, ante, at 5-6.
This is true despite the fact that our cases have condemned a
number of laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression, even
in places where free speech is otherwise allowed.[FOOTNOTE 8] The
First Amendment affords protection to a basic liberty: "the
freedom of speech" that an individual may exercise when using the
public streets and parks. Hague v. Committee for Industrial
Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts,
J.). The Amendment, however, does not destroy all property rights.
In particular, it does not empower individuals to erect structures
of any kind on public property. City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 814 (1984);[FOOTNOTE 9] see
also Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288
(1984). Thus our cases protecting the individual's freedom to
engage in communicative conduct on public property (whether by
speaking, parading, handbilling, waving a flag, or carrying a
banner), e.g., Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 (1938), or to send
messages from her own property by placing a sign in the window of
her home, City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S., at ___, do not
establish the right to implant a physical structure (whether a
campaign poster, a burning cross, or a statue of Elvis Presley) on
public property. I think the latter "right," which creates a far
greater intrusion on government property and interferes with the
Government's ability to differentiate its own message from those
of public individuals, does not exist.[FOOTNOTE 10]
Because structures on government property-and, in particular, in
front of buildings plainly identified with the state-imply state
approval of their message, the Government must have considerable
leeway, outside of the religious arena, to choose what kinds of
displays it will allow and what kinds it will not. Although the
First Amendment requires the Government to allow leafletting or
demonstrating outside its buildings, the state has greater power
to exclude unattended symbols when they convey a type of message
with which the state does not wish to be identified. I think it
obvious, for example, that Ohio could prohibit certain categories
of signs or symbols in Capitol Square-erotic exhibits, commercial
advertising, and perhaps campaign posters as well-without
violating the Free Speech Clause.[FOOTNOTE 11] Moreover, our
"public forum" cases do not foreclose public entities from
enforcing prohibitions against all unattended displays in public
parks, or possibly even limiting the use of such displays to the
communication of non-controversial messages.[FOOTNOTE 12] Such a
limitation would not inhibit any of the traditional forms of
expression that have been given full constitutional protection in
public fora.
The State's general power to restrict the types of unattended
displays does not alone suffice to decide this case, because Ohio
did not profess to be exercising any such authority. Instead, the
Capitol Square Review Board denied a permit for the cross because
it believed the Establishment Clause required as much, and we
cannot know whether the Board would have denied the permit on
other grounds. App. 91-92, 169. Accordingly, we must evaluate the
State's rationale on its own terms. But in this case, the
endorsement inquiry under the Establishment Clause follows from
the State's power to exclude unattended private displays from
public property. Just as the Constitution recognizes the State's
interest in preventing its property from being used as a conduit
for ideas it does not wish to give the appearance of ratifying,
the Establishment Clause prohibits government from allowing, and
thus endorsing, unattended displays that take a position on a
religious issue. If the State allows such stationary displays in
front of its seat of government, viewers will reasonably assume
that it approves of them. As the picture appended to this opinion
demonstrates, infra, at 22, a reasonable observer would likely
infer endorsement from the location of the cross erected by the
Klan in this case. Even if the disclaimer at the foot of the cross
(which stated that the cross was placed there by a private
organization) were legible, that inference would remain, because a
property owner's decision to allow a third party to place a sign
on her property conveys the same message of endorsement as if she
had erected it herself.[FOOTNOTE 13]
When the message is religious in character, it is a message the
state can neither send nor reinforce without violating the
Establishment Clause. Accordingly, I would hold that the
Constitution generally forbids the placement of a symbol of a
religious character in, on, or before a seat of government.
III
The Court correctly acknowledges that the state's duty to avoid a
violation of the Establishment Clause can justify a content-based
restriction on speech or expression, even when that restriction
would otherwise be prohibited by the Free Speech Clause. Ante, at
6; ante, at 13 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The plurality asserts,
however, that government cannot be perceived to be endorsing a
religious display when it merely accords that display "the same
access to a public forum that all other displays enjoy." Ante, at
8. I find this argument unpersuasive.
The existence of a "public forum" in itself cannot dispel the
message of endorsement. A contrary argument would assume an
"ultra-reasonable observer" who understands the vagaries of this
Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. I think it presumptuous to
consider such knowledge a precondition of Establishment Clause
protection. Many (probably most) reasonable people do not know the
difference between a "public forum," a "limited public forum," and
a "non-public forum." They do know the difference between a state
capitol and a church. Reasonable people have differing degrees of
knowledge; that does not make them "'obtuse,'" see 30 F.3d 675,
679 (CA6 1994) (quoting Doe v. Small, 964 F.2d 611, 630 (CA7 1992)
(Easterbrook, J., concurring)); nor does it make them unworthy of
constitutional protection. It merely makes them human. For a
religious display to violate the Establishment Clause, I think it
is enough that some reasonable observers would attribute a
religious message to the State.
The plurality appears to rely on the history of this particular
public forum-specifically, it emphasizes that Ohio has in the past
allowed three other private unattended displays. Even if the State
could not reasonably have been understood to endorse the prior
displays, I would not find this argument convincing, because it
assumes that all reasonable viewers know all about the history of
Capitol Square-a highly unlikely supposition.[FOOTNOTE 14] But the
plurality's argument fails on its own terms, because each of the
three previous displays conveyed the same message of approval and
endorsement that this one does.
Most significant, of course, is the menorah that stood in Capitol
Square during Chanukah. The display of that religious symbol
should be governed by the same rule as the display of the
cross.[FOOTNOTE 15] In my opinion, both displays are equally
objectionable. Moreover, the fact that the State has placed its
stamp of approval on two different religions instead of one only
compounds the constitutional violation. The Establishment Clause
does not merely prohibit the State from favoring one religious
sect over others. It also proscribes state action supporting the
establishment of a number of religions,[FOOTNOTE 16] as well as
the official endorsement of religion in preference to nonreligion.
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S., at 52-55. The State's prior approval
of the pro-religious message conveyed by the menorah is fully
consistent with its endorsement of one of the messages conveyed by
the cross: "The State of Ohio favors religion over irreligion."
This message is incompatible with the principles embodied by our
Establishment Clause.
The record identifies two other examples of free-standing displays
that the State previously permitted in Capitol Square: a "United
Way Campaign 'thermometer,'" and "craftsmen's booths and displays
erected during an Arts Festival."[FOOTNOTE 17] App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-16. Both of those examples confirm the proposition that a
reasonable observer should infer official approval of the message
conveyed by a structure erected in front of the Statehouse. Surely
the thermometer suggested that the State was encouraging passersby
to contribute to the United Way. It seems equally clear that the
State was endorsing the creativity of artisans and craftsmen by
permitting their booths to occupy a part of the Square. Nothing
about either of those freestanding displays contradicts the normal
inference that the State has endorsed whatever message might be
conveyed by permitting an unattended symbol to adorn the Capitol
grounds.[FOOTNOTE 18] Accordingly, the fact that the menorah, and
later the cross, stood in an area available "'for free discussion
of public questions, or for activities of a broad public
purpose,'" Ohio Rev. Code Ann.   105.41 (1994), quoted ante, at
1-2, is fully consistent with the conclusion that the State
sponsored those religious symbols. They, like the thermometer and
the booths, were displayed in a context that connotes state
approval.
This case is therefore readily distinguishable from Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___ (1993). In both of those
cases, as we made perfectly clear, there was no danger of
incorrect identification of the speakers and no basis for
inferring that their messages had been endorsed by any public
entity. As we explained in the later case:
"Under these circumstances, as in Widmar, there would have been no
realistic danger that the community would think that the District
was endorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit to
religion or to the Church would have been no more than incidental.
As in Widmar, supra, at 271-272, permitting District property to
be used to exhibit the film involved in this case would not have
been an establishment of religion under the three-part test
articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971): The
challenged governmental action has a secular purpose, does not
have the principal or primary effect of advancing or inhibiting
religion, and does not foster an excessive entanglement with
religion." Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (footnote omitted).
In contrast, the installation of the religious symbols in Capitol
Square quite obviously did "have the principal or primary effect
of advancing or inhibiting religion"; indeed, no other effect is
even suggested by the record. The primary difference is that in
this case we are dealing with a visual display-a symbol readily
associated with a religion, in a venue readily associated with the
State. This clear image of endorsement was lacking in Widmar and
Lamb's Chapel, in which the issue was access to government
facilities. Moreover, there was no question in those cases of an
unattended display; private speakers, who could be distinguished
from the state, were present. See supra, at 6-7. Endorsement might
still be present in an access case if, for example, the religious
group sought the use of the roof of a public building for an
obviously religious ceremony, where many onlookers might witness
that ceremony and connect it to the State. But no such facts were
alleged in Widmar or Lamb's Chapel. The religious practices in
those cases were simply less obtrusive, and less likely to send a
message of endorsement, than the eye-catching symbolism at issue
in this case.
The battle over the Klan cross underscores the power of such
symbolism. The menorah prompted the Klan to seek permission to
erect an anti-semitic symbol, which in turn not only prompted
vandalism but also motivated other sects to seek permission to
place their own symbols in the Square. These facts illustrate the
potential for insidious entanglement that flows from
state-endorsed proselytizing. There is no reason to believe that a
menorah placed in front of a synagogue would have motivated any
reaction from the Klan, or that a Klan cross placed on a
Klansman's front lawn would have produced the same reaction as one
that enjoyed the apparent imprimatur of the State of Ohio. Nor is
there any reason to believe the placement of the displays in
Capitol Square had any purpose other than to connect the
State-though perhaps against its will-to the religious or
anti-religious beliefs of those who placed them there. The cause
of the conflict is the State's apparent approval of a religious or
anti-religious message.[FOOTNOTE 19] Our Constitution wisely seeks
to minimize such strife by forbidding state-endorsed religious
activity.
IV
Conspicuously absent from the plurality's opinion is any mention
of the values served by the Establishment Clause. It therefore
seems appropriate to repeat a portion of a Court opinion authored
by Justice Black who, more than any other Justice in the Court's
history, espoused a literal interpretation of constitutional text:
"A large proportion of the early settlers of this country came
here from Europe to escape the bondage of laws which compelled
them to support and attend government-favored churches. The
centuries immediately before and contemporaneous with the
colonization of America had been filled with turmoil, civil
strife, and persecutions, generated in large part by established
sects determined to maintain their absolute political and
religious supremacy. With the power of government supporting them,
at various times and places, Catholics had persecuted Protestants,
Protestants had persecuted Catholics, Protestant sects had
persecuted other Protestant sects, Catholics of one shade of
belief had persecuted Catholics of another shade of belief, and
all of these had from time to time persecuted Jews. In efforts to
force loyalty to whatever religious group happened to be on top
and in league with the government of a particular time and place,
men and women had been fined, cast in jail, cruelly tortured, and
killed. Among the offenses for which these punishments had been
inflicted were such things as speaking disrespectfully of the
views of ministers of government-established churches,
non-attendance at those churches, expressions of non-belief in
their doctrines, and failure to pay taxes and tithes to support
them.
"These practices of the old world were transplanted to and began
to thrive in the soil of the new America. The very charters
granted by the English Crown to the individuals and companies
designated to make the laws which would control the destinies of
the colonials authorized these individuals and companies to erect
religious establishments which all, whether believers or
non-believers, would be required to support and attend. An
exercise of this authority was accompanied by a repetition of many
of the old-world practices and persecutions. Catholics found
themselves hounded and proscribed because of their faith; Quakers
who followed their conscience went to jail; Baptists were
peculiarly obnoxious to certain dominant Protestant sects; men and
women of varied faiths who happened to be in a minority in a
particular locality were persecuted because they steadfastly
persisted in worshipping God only as their own consciences
dictated. And all of these dissenters were compelled to pay tithes
and taxes to support government-sponsored churches whose ministers
preached inflammatory sermons designed to strengthen and
consolidate the established faith by generating a burning hatred
against dissenters.

"The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment
means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government
can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion,
aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither
can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from
church against his will or force him to profess a belief or
disbelief in any religion. . . . Neither a state nor the Federal
Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of
any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words
of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law
was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and
State.'" Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 8-10, 15,
16 (1947) (footnotes and citation omitted).
In his eloquent dissent in that same case, Justice Jackson
succinctly explained-
"that the effect of the religious freedom Amendment to our
Constitution was to take every form of propagation of religion out
of the realm of things which could directly or indirectly be made
public business . . . . It was intended not only to keep the
states' hands out of religion, but to keep religion's hands off
the state, and, above all, to keep bitter religious controversy
out of public life . . . ." Id., at 26-27.
The wrestling over the Klan cross in Capitol Square is far removed
from the persecution that motivated William Penn to set sail for
America, and the issue resolved in Everson is quite different from
the controversy over symbols that gave rise to this
litigation.[FOOTNOTE 20] Nevertheless the views expressed by both
the majority and the dissenters in that landmark case counsel
caution before approving the order of a federal judge commanding a
State to authorize the placement of free-standing religious
symbols in front of the seat of its government. The Court's
decision today is unprecedented. It entangles two sovereigns in
the propagation of religion, and it disserves the principle of
tolerance that underlies the prohibition against state action
"respecting an establishment of religion."[FOOTNOTE 21]
I respectfully dissent.
APPENDIX (Not available in electronic version)
JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.
We confront here, as Justices O'Connor and Souter point out, a
large Latin cross that stood alone and unattended in close
proximity to Ohio's Statehouse. See ante, at 5-6 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at 10-11
(Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Near
the stationary cross were the government's flags and the
government's statues. No human speaker was present to disassociate
the religious symbol from the State. No other private display was
in sight. No plainly visible sign informed the public that the
cross belonged to the Klan and that Ohio's government did not
endorse the display's message.
If the aim of the Establishment Clause is genuinely to uncouple
government from church, see Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330
U.S. 1, 16 (1947), a State may not permit, and a court may not
order, a display of this character. Cf. Sullivan, Religion and
Liberal Democracy, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 195, 197-214 (1992)
(negative bar against establishment of religion implies
affirmative establishment of secular public order). Justice
Souter, in the final paragraphs of his opinion, suggests two
arrangements that might have distanced the State from "the
principal symbol of Christianity around the world," see ante, at
10: a sufficiently large and clear disclaimer, ante, at
11-12;[FOOTNOTE 1] or an area reserved for unattended displays
carrying no endorsement from the State, a space plainly and
permanently so marked. Ante, at 12-13. Neither arrangement is even
arguably present in this case. The District Court's order did not
mandate a disclaimer. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A26 ("Plaintiffs
are entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to issue a
permit to erect a cross on Capitol Square"). And the disclaimer
the Klan appended to the foot of the cross[FOOTNOTE 2] was
unsturdy: it did not identify the Klan as sponsor; it failed to
state unequivocally that Ohio did not endorse the display's
message; and it was not shown to be legible from a distance. The
relief ordered by the District Court thus violated the
Establishment Clause.
Whether a court order allowing display of a cross, but demanding a
sturdier disclaimer, could withstand Establishment Clause analysis
is a question more difficult than the one this case poses. I would
reserve that question for another day and case. But I would not
let the prospect of what might have been permissible control
today's decision on the constitutionality of the display the
District Court's order in fact authorized. See ante, at 21
(appendix to dissent of Stevens, J.) (photograph of display).
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FOOTNOTES
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
FN1. Respondents claim that the Sixth Circuit's statement that
"[z]ealots have First Amendment rights too" even if their views
are unpopular, shows that the case is actually about
discrimination against political speech. That conclusion is
possible only if the statement is ripped from its context, which
was this: "The potency of religious speech is not a constitutional
infirmity; the most fervently devotional and blatantly sectarian
speech is protected when it is private speech in a public forum.
Zealots have First Amendment rights too." 30 F.3d 675, 680 (CA6
1994). The court was obviously addressing zealous (and unpopular)
religious speech.
FN2. This statement in Justice O'Connor's Mergens concurrence is
followed by the observation: "We think that secondary school
students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a
school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely
permits on a nondiscriminatory basis." 496 U.S., at 250. Justice
O'Connor today says this observation means that, even when we
recognize private speech to be at issue, we must apply the
endorsement test. Post, at 4. But that would cause the second
sentence to contradict the first, saying in effect that the
"difference between government speech . . . and private speech" is
not "crucial."
FN3. If it is true, as Justice O'Connor suggests, post, at 5, that
she would not "be likely to come to a different result from the
plurality where truly private speech is allowed on equal terms in
a public forum that the government has administered properly,"
then she is extending the "endorsement test" to private speech to
cover an eventuality that is "not likely" to occur. Before doing
that, it would seem desirable to explore the precise degree of the
unlikelihood (is it perhaps 100%?)-for as we point out in text,
the extension to private speech has considerable costs. Contrary
to what Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and Justice Stevens
argue, the endorsement test does not supply an appropriate
standard for the inquiry before us. It supplies no standard
whatsoever. The lower federal courts that the concurrence
identifies as having "applied the endorsement test in precisely
the context before us today," post, at 4, have reached precisely
differing results-which is what led the Court to take this case.
And if further proof of the invited chaos is required, one need
only follow the debate between the concurrence and Justice
Stevens' dissent as to whether the hypothetical beholder who will
be the determinant of "endorsement" should be any beholder (no
matter how unknowledgeable), or the average beholder, or (what
Justice Stevens accuses the concurrence of favoring) the
"ultra-reasonable" beholder. See post, at 8-12 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment); post, at 12-13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
And of course even when one achieves agreement upon that question,
it will be unrealistic to expect different judges (or should it be
juries?) to reach consistent answers as to what any beholder, the
average beholder, or the ultra-reasonable beholder (as the case
may be) would think. It is irresponsible to make the Nation's
legislators walk this minefield.
FN4. For this reason, among others, we do not inquire into the
adequacy of the identification which was attached to the cross
ultimately erected in this case. The difficulties posed by such an
inquiry, however, are yet another reason to reject the principle
of "transferred endorsement." The only principled line for
adequacy of identification would be identification that is legible
at whatever distance the cross is visible. Otherwise, the
uninformed viewer who does not have time or inclination to come
closer to read the sign might be misled, just as (under current
law) the uninformed viewer who does not have time or inclination
to inquire whether speech in Capitol Square is publicly endorsed
speech might be misled. Needless to say, such a rule would place
considerable constraint upon religious speech, not to mention that
it would be ridiculous. But if one rejects that criterion, courts
would have to decide (on what basis we cannot imagine) how large
an identifying sign is large enough. Our Religion Clause
jurisprudence is complex enough without the addition of this
highly litigable feature.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONCURRING FOOTNOTES
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
FN1. This description of the disclaimer, as well as the agreement
to negotiate, also appeared in the Klan's District Court
complaint, App. 26, and in stipulations of fact jointly filed in
the District Court by both parties, id., at 100,  32. The Klan
conceded before the District Court that "the state could have
required . . . a disclaimer" like the one proposed, Memorandum in
Support of Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction
in No. C2-93-1162 (SD Ohio), p. 5, and the State assumed
throughout the litigation that the display would include the
disclaimer, see, e.g., Memorandum of Defendants in Opposition to
Plaintiffs's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for
Preliminary Injunction in No. C2-93-1162 (SD Ohio), p. 6, 21. Both
parties considered the disclaimer as an integral part of the
display that the Klan desired to place on Capitol Square. Thus the
District Court's order, which did not expressly require the
disclaimer in awarding the injunction, see Pet. for Cert. A26
("Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction requiring the
defendants to issue a permit to erect a cross on Capitol Square"),
cannot reasonably be read to mean that the disclaimer was
unnecessary. Indeed, in both its findings of fact and conclusions
of law, the District Court discussed the presence and importance
of the disclaimer, see id., at A15-A16 (findings of fact), A20,
A22-A23 (conclusions of law), and the Klan itself understood that
the District Court's order was based on the assumption that a
disclaimer would accompany the cross, since the cross the Klan put
up on the basis of the District Court's command in fact carried a
disclaimer, see App. 63 (photo); Appendix to Opinion of Stevens,
J., post, at 21. Since the litigation preceded the appearance of
the cross and the sign, the adequacy of the sign actually produced
was not considered. The adequacy of a disclaimer, in size as well
as content, is, of course, a proper subject of judicial scrutiny
when placed in issue. Whether the flimsy cardboard sign attached
by the Klan to the base of the cross functioned as an adequate
disclaimer in this case is a question not before us.
FN2. Of course the presence of a disclaimer does not always remove
the possibility that a private religious display "convey[s] or
attempt[s] to convey a message that religion or a particular
religious belief is favored or preferred," Allegheny County, 492
U.S., at 593 (emphasis, internal quotation marks, and citation
omitted), when other indicia of endorsement (e.g., objective
indications that the government in fact invited the display or
otherwise intended to further a religious purpose) outweigh the
mitigating effect of the disclaimer, or when the disclaimer itself
does not sufficiently disclaim government support. See, e.g.,
Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 41 (1980); Allegheny County, supra,
at 600-601; cf. ante, at 14, n. 4. In this case, however, there is
no reason to presume that an adequate disclaimer could not have
been drafted. Cf. Parish, Private Religious Displays in Public
Fora, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 253, 285-287 (1994).
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONCURRING FOOTNOTES

FN1. See Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 164 (1879).
FN2. The "Grand Titan" apparently was referring to a menorah that
a private group placed in the Square during the season of
Chanukah. App. 98; see infra, at 13-14. The Klan found the menorah
offensive. The Klan's cross, in turn, offended a number of
observers. It was vandalized the day after it was erected, and a
local church group applied for, and was granted, permission to
display its own crosses around the Klan's to protest the latter's
presence. See Record 31.
FN3. Indeed, the Latin cross is identifiable as a symbol of a
particular religion, that of Christianity; and, further, as a
symbol of particular denominations within Christianity. See
American Civil Liberties Union v. St. Charles, 794 F.2d 265, 271
(CA7 1986) ("Such a display is not only religious but also
sectarian. This is not just because some religious Americans are
not Christians. Some Protestant sects still do not display the
cross . . . . The Greek Orthodox church uses as its symbol the
Greek (equilateral) cross, not the Latin cross. . . . [T]he more
sectarian the display, the closer it is to the original targets of
the [establishment] clause, so the more strictly is the clause
applied").
FN4. In Allegheny, five Justices found the likely reaction of a
"'reasonable observer'" relevant for purposes of determining
whether an endorsement was present. 492 U.S., at 620 (opinion of
Blackmun, J.); id., at 635-636 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); id., at
642-643 (opinion of Brennan, J., joined by Marshall and Stevens,
JJ.).
FN5. Justice O'Connor agrees that an "endorsement test" is
appropriate and that we should judge endorsement from the
standpoint of a reasonable observer. Ante, at 8-9. But her
reasonable observer is a legal fiction, "'a personification of a
community ideal of reasonable behavior, determined by the
[collective] social judgment.'" Ante, at 9. The ideal human
Justice O'Connor describes knows and understands much more than
meets the eye. Her "reasonable person" comes off as a
well-schooled jurist, a being finer than the tort-law model. With
respect, I think this enhanced tort-law standard is singularly out
of place in the Establishment Clause context. It strips of
constitutional protection every reasonable person whose knowledge
happens to fall below some "'ideal'" standard. Instead of
protecting only the "'ideal'" observer, then, I would extend
protection to the universe of reasonable persons and ask whether
some viewers of the religious display would be likely to perceive
a government endorsement.
Justice O'Connor's argument that "there is always someone" who
will feel excluded by any particular governmental action, ante, at
10, ignores the requirement that such an apprehension be
objectively reasonable. A person who views an exotic cow at the
zoo as a symbol of the Government's approval of the Hindu religion
cannot survive this test.
FN6. I recognize there may be exceptions to this general rule. A
commercial message displayed on a billboard, for example, usually
will not be taken to represent the views of the billboard's owner
because every reasonable observer is aware that billboards are
rented as advertising space. On the other hand, the observer may
reasonably infer that the owner of the billboard is not
inalterably opposed to the message presented thereon; for the
owner has the right to exclude messages with which he disagrees,
and he might be expected to exercise that right if his
disagreement is sufficiently profound.
FN7. Despite the absence of any holding on this point, Justice
O'Connor assumes that a reasonable observer would not impute the
content of an unattended display to the Government because that
observer would know that the State is required to allow all such
displays on Capitol Square. Ante, at 10-12. Justice O'Connor thus
presumes a reasonable observer so prescient as to understand legal
doctrines that this Court has not yet adopted.
FN8. "Our prior decisions have voiced particular concern with laws
that foreclose an entire medium of expression. Thus, we have held
invalid ordinances that completely banned the distribution of
pamphlets within the municipality, Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S.
444, 451-452 (1938); handbills on the public streets, Jamison v.
Texas, 318 U.S. 413, 416 (1943); the door-to-door distribution of
literature, Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 145-149 (1943);
Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164-165 (1939), and live
entertainment, Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 75-76 (1981).
See also Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 486 (1988) (picketing
focused upon individual residence is 'fundamentally different from
more generally directed means of communication that may not be
completely banned in residential areas'). Although prohibitions
foreclosing entire media may be completely free of content or
viewpoint discrimination, the danger they pose to the freedom of
speech is readily apparent-by eliminating a common means of
speaking, such measures can suppress too much speech." City of
Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 12)
(footnote omitted).
FN9. In Vincent, we stated:
"Appellees' reliance on the public forum doctrine is misplaced.
They fail to demonstrate the existence of a traditional right of
access respecting such items as utility poles for purposes of
their communication comparable to that recognized for public
streets and parks, and it is clear that 'the First Amendment does
not guarantee access to government property simply because it is
owned or controlled by the government.' United States Postal
Service v. Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S. 114, 129 (1981).
Rather, the 'existence of a right of access to public property and
the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be
evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at
issue.' Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460
U.S. 37, 44 (1983)." 466 U.S., at 814.
FN10. At least, it does not exist as a general matter. I recognize
there may be cases of viewpoint discrimination (say, if the State
were to allow campaign signs supporting an incumbent governor but
not signs supporting his opponent) in which access cannot be
discriminatorily denied.
FN11. The plurality incorrectly assumes that a decision to exclude
a category of speech from an inappropriate forum must rest on a
judgment about the value of that speech. See ante, at 11-12. Yet,
we have upheld the exclusion of all political signs from public
vehicles, Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974),
though political expression is at the heart of the protection
afforded by the First Amendment. McIntyre, 514 U.S., at ___ (slip
op., at 12-13). A view that "private prayers," ante, at 11, are
most appropriate in private settings is neither novel nor
disrespectful to religious speech.
FN12. Several scholars have commented on the malleability of our
public-forum precedents.
"As [an] overview of the cases strongly suggests, whether or not a
given place is deemed a 'public forum' is ordinarily less
significant than the nature of the speech restriction-despite the
Court's rhetoric. Indeed, even the rhetoric at times reveals as
much.

"Beyond confusing the issues, an excessive focus on the public
character of some forums, coupled with inadequate attention to the
precise details of the restrictions on expression, can leave
speech inadequately protected in some cases, while unduly
hampering state and local authorities in others." L. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law 992-993 (2d ed. 1988) (footnotes
omitted).
See also Farber & Nowak, The Misleading Nature of Public Forum
Analysis: Content and Context in First Amendment Adjudication, 70
Va. L. Rev. 1219, 1221-1222 (1984).
FN13. Indeed, I do not think any disclaimer could dispel the
message of endorsement in this case. Capitol Square's location in
downtown Columbus, Ohio, makes it inevitable that countless
motorists and pedestrians would immediately perceive the proximity
of the cross to the Capitol without necessarily noticing any
disclaimer of public sponsorship. The plurality thus correctly
abjures inquiry into the possible adequacy or significance of a
legend identifying the owner of the cross. See ante, at 14, n. 4.
Justice Souter is of the view that an adequate disclaimer is
constitutionally required, ante, at 11-12, but he does not suggest
that the attachment to the Klan's cross in this case was adequate.
FN14. Justice O'Connor apparently would not extend Establishment
Clause protection to passers by who are unaware of Capitol
Square's history. See ante, at 10-12. Thus, she sees no reason to
distinguish an intimate knowledge of the Square's history from the
knowledge that a cross is a religious symbol or that the
Statehouse is the Statehouse. Ante, at 10-11. But passers by,
including schoolchildren, traveling salesmen, and tourists as much
as those who live next to the Statehouse, are members of the body
politic, and they are equally entitled to be free from government
endorsement of religion.
FN15. A fragmented Court reached a different conclusion in County
of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, 492 U.S. 573 (1989). In that case, a majority of this
Court decided that a crche placed by a private group inside a
public building violated the Establishment Clause, id., at
598-602, but that a menorah placed alongside a Christmas tree and
a "sign saluting liberty" outside that same building did not. Id.,
at 613-621 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 632-637 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.); id., at 663-667 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by
Rehnquist, C. J., White and Scalia, JJ.). The two Justices who
provided the decisive votes to distinguish these situations relied
on the presence of the tree and the sign to find that the menorah,
in context, was not a religious but a secular symbol of liberty.
Id., at 613-621 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 632-637
(opinion of O'Connor, J.). It was apparently in reliance on the
outcome of the Allegheny case that Ohio believed it could provide
a forum for the menorah (which appeared in Capitol Square with a
state-owned Christmas tree and a banner reading, "Season's
Greetings") and yet could not provide one for the cross. See App.
169. Given the state of the law at the time, Ohio's decision was
hardly unreasonable; but I cannot support a view of the
Establishment Clause that permits a State effectively to endorse
some kinds of religious symbols but not others. I would find that
the State is powerless to place, or allow to be placed, any
religious symbol-including a menorah or a cross-in front of its
seat of government.
FN16. See Allegheny, 492 U.S., at 647-649 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).
FN17. The booths were attended during the festival itself, but
were left standing overnight during the pendency of the event.
App. 159.
FN18. Of course, neither of these endorsements was religious in
nature, and thus neither was forbidden by the Constitution.
FN19. As I stated in Allegheny,
"There is always a risk that such symbols will offend nonmembers
of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider
the particular advertisement disrespectful. Some devout Christians
believe that the crche should be placed only in reverential
settings, such as a church or perhaps a private home; they do not
countenance its use as an aid to commercialization of Christ's
birthday. In this very suit, members of the Jewish faith firmly
opposed the use to which the menorah was put by the particular
sect that sponsored the display at Pittsburgh's City-County
Building. Even though '[p]assersby who disagree with the message
conveyed by these displays are free to ignore them, or even to
turn their backs,' displays of this kind inevitably have a greater
tendency to emphasize sincere and deeply felt differences among
individuals than to achieve an ecumenical goal. The Establishment
Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement."
492 U.S., at 650-651 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part) (citations omitted), quoting id., at 664 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
In the words of Clarence Darrow:
"'The realm of religion . . . is where knowledge leaves off, and
where faith begins, and it never has needed the arm of the State
for support, and wherever it has received it, it has harmed both
the public and the religion that it would pretend to serve.'" Tr.
of Oral Arg. 7, Scopes v. State, 154 Tenn. 105, 289 S. W. 363
(1927), quoted in Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229, 264 (1977)
(opinion of Stevens, J.).
FN20. Everson held that a school district could, as part of a
larger program of reimbursing students for their transportation to
and from school, also reimburse students attending Catholic
schools. 330 U.S. 1 (1947).
FN21. The words, "respecting an establishment of religion," were
selected to emphasize the breadth and richer meaning of this
fundamental command. See Allegheny, 492 U.S., at 647-649 (Stevens,
J., dissenting).

UNITED STATES, Petitioner
        v.
ALFONSO LOPEZ, Jr.

No. 93-1260
In the Supreme Court of the United States
On writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit. 2 F.3d 1342, affirmed.
Rehnquist, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J.,
filed a concurring opinion, in which O'Connor, J., joined.
Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Stevens, J., and Souter,
J., filed dissenting opinions. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting
opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.
Argued November 8, 1994
Decided April 26, 1995

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYLLABUS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::

        After respondent, then a 12th-grade student, carried a
concealed handgun into his high school, he was charged with
violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which forbids
"any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that
[he] knows . . . is a school zone," 18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A).
The District Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment,
concluding that  922(q) is a constitutional exercise of
Congress' power to regulate activities in and affecting
commerce. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that, in light
of what it characterized as insufficient congressional findings
and legislative history,  922(q) is invalid as beyond Congress'
power under the Commerce Clause.
        Held: The Act exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause
authority. First, although this Court has upheld a wide variety
of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity
that substantially affected interstate commerce, the possession
of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic
activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, have such a
substantial effect on interstate commerce. Section 922(q) is a
criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with
"commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly
those terms are defined. Nor is it an essential part of a larger
regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme
could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.
It cannot, therefore, be sustained under the Court's cases
upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are
connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the
aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. Second, 
922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which would ensure,
through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearms possession in
question has the requisite nexus with interstate commerce.
Respondent was a local student at a local school; there is no
indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce,
and there is no requirement that his possession of the firearm
have any concrete tie to interstate commerce. To uphold the
Government's contention that  922(q) is justified because
firearms possession in a local school zone does indeed
substantially affect interstate commerce would require this
Court to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would
bid fair to convert congressional Commerce Clause authority to a
general police power of the sort held only by the States. Pp. 2
-19.
        2 F. 3d 1342, affirmed.
        Rehnquist, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in
which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.

joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Stevens, J., and
Souter, J., filed dissenting opinions. Breyer, J., filed a

joined.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: OPINION :::::::::::::::::::::::::::

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
        In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress made
it a federal offense "for any individual knowingly to possess a
firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable
cause to believe, is a school zone." 18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)
(1988 ed., Supp. V). The Act neither regulates a commercial
activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be
connected in any way to interstate commerce. We hold that the
Act exceeds the authority of Congress "[t]o regulate Commerce .
cl. 3.
        On March 10, 1992, respondent, who was then a 12th-grade
student, arrived at Edison High School in San Antonio, Texas,
carrying a concealed .38 caliber handgun and five bullets.
Acting upon an anonymous tip, school authorities confronted
respondent, who admitted that he was carrying the weapon. He was
arrested and charged under Texas law with firearm possession on
school premises. See Tex. Penal Code Ann.  46.03(a)(1) (Supp.
1994). The next day, the state charges were dismissed after
federal agents charged respondent by complaint with violating
the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. 18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)
(1988 ed., Supp. V).[FOOTNOTE 1]
        A federal grand jury indicted respondent on one count of
knowing possession of a firearm at a school zone, in violation
of  922(q). Respondent moved to dismiss his federal indictment
on the ground that  922(q) "is unconstitutional as it is beyond
the power of Congress to legislate control over our public
schools." The District Court denied the motion, concluding that
 922(q) "is a constitutional exercise of Congress' well-defined
power to regulate activities in and affecting commerce, and the
'business' of elementary, middle and high schools . . . affects
interstate commerce." App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. Respondent
waived his right to a jury trial. The District Court conducted a
bench trial, found him guilty of violating  922(q), and
sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and two years'
supervised release.
        On appeal, respondent challenged his conviction based on
his claim that  922(q) exceeded Congress' power to legislate
under the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit agreed and reversed respondent's conviction. It held
that, in light of what it characterized as insufficient
congressional findings and legislative history, "section 922(q),
in the full reach of its terms, is invalid as beyond the power
of Congress under the Commerce Clause." 2 F.3d 1342, 1367-1368
(1993). Because of the importance of the issue, we granted
certiorari, 511 U.S. ___ (1994), and we now affirm.
        We start with first principles. The Constitution creates
a Federal Government of enumerated powers. See U.S. Const., Art.
I,  8. As James Madison wrote, "[t]he powers delegated by the
proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and
defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are
numerous and indefinite." The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961). This constitutionally mandated division of
authority "was adopted by the Framers to ensure protection of
our fundamental liberties." Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452,
458 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Just as the
separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the
Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of
excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power
between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the
risk of tyranny and abuse from either front." Ibid.
        The Constitution delegates to Congress the power "[t]o
regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several
States, and with the Indian Tribes." U.S. Const., Art. I,  8,
cl. 3. The Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, first defined
the nature of Congress' commerce power in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 189-190 (1824):
        "Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is something
more: it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse
between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches, and
is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that
intercourse."
        The commerce power "is the power to regulate; that is, to
prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This
power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in
itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges
no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution."
Id., at 196. The Gibbons Court, however, acknowledged that
limitations on the commerce power are inherent in the very
language of the Commerce Clause.
        "It is not intended to say that these words comprehend
that commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on
between man and man in a State, or between different parts of
the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other
States. Such a power would be inconvenient, and is certainly
unnecessary.
        "Comprehensive as the word 'among' is, it may very
properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more
States than one. . . . The enumeration presupposes something not
enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the
subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal
commerce of a State." Id., at 194-195.
        For nearly a century thereafter, the Court's Commerce
Clause decisions dealt but rarely with the extent of Congress'
power, and almost entirely with the Commerce Clause as a limit
on state legislation that discriminated against interstate
commerce. See, e.g., Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568, 573-575 (1853)
(upholding a state-created steamboat monopoly because it
involved regulation of wholly internal commerce); Kidd v.
Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 17, 20-22 (1888) (upholding a state
prohibition on the manufacture of intoxicating liquor because
the commerce power "does not comprehend the purely domestic
commerce of a State which is carried on between man and man
within a State or between different parts of the same State");
see also L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 306 (2d ed.
1988). Under this line of precedent, the Court held that certain
categories of activity such as "production," "manufacturing,"
and "mining" were within the province of state governments, and
thus were beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce
Clause. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 121 (1942)
(describing development of Commerce Clause jurisprudence).
        In 1887, Congress enacted the Interstate Commerce Act, 24
Stat. 379, and in 1890, Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust
Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1 et seq. These laws
ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce
power. When cases involving these laws first reached this Court,
we imported from our negative Commerce Clause cases the approach
that Congress could not regulate activities such as
"production," "manufacturing," and "mining." See, e.g., United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 12 (1895) ("Commerce
succeeds to manufacture, and is not part of it"); Carter v.
Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 304 (1936) ("Mining brings the
subject matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of
it"). Simultaneously, however, the Court held that, where the
interstate and intrastate aspects of commerce were so mingled
together that full regulation of interstate commerce required
incidental regulation of intrastate commerce, the Commerce
Clause authorized such regulation. See, e.g., Houston, E. & W.
T. R. Co. v. United States, 234 U.S. 342 (1914) (Shreveport Rate
Cases).
        In A. L. A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295
U.S. 495, 550 (1935), the Court struck down regulations that
fixed the hours and wages of individuals employed by an
intrastate business because the activity being regulated related
to interstate commerce only indirectly. In doing so, the Court
characterized the distinction between direct and indirect
effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce as
"a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our
constitutional system." Id., at 548. Activities that affected
interstate commerce directly were within Congress' power;
activities that affected interstate commerce indirectly were
beyond Congress' reach. Id., at 546. The justification for this
formal distinction was rooted in the fear that otherwise "there
would be virtually no limit to the federal power and for all
practical purposes we should have a completely centralized
government." Id., at 548.
        Two years later, in the watershed case of NLRB v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), the Court upheld the
National Labor Relations Act against a Commerce Clause
challenge, and in the process, departed from the distinction
between "direct" and "indirect" effects on interstate commerce.
Id., at 36-38 ("The question [of the scope of Congress' power]
is necessarily one of degree"). The Court held that intrastate
activities that "have such a close and substantial relation to
interstate commerce that their control is essential or
appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and
obstructions" are within Congress' power to regulate. Id., at
37.
        In United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941), the Court
upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, stating:
        "The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not
confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It
extends to those activities intrastate which so affect
interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress
over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the
attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted
power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce." Id., at 118.
        See also United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S.
110, 119 (1942) (the commerce power "extends to those intrastate
activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct
the exercise of the granted power").
        In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court upheld the application
of amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to the
production and consumption of home-grown wheat. 317 U.S., at
128-129. The Wickard Court explicitly rejected earlier
distinctions between direct and indirect effects on interstate
commerce, stating:
        "[E]ven if appellee's activity be local and though it may
not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature,
be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic
effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether
such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined
as 'direct' or 'indirect.'" Id., at 125.
        The Wickard Court emphasized that although Filburn's own
contribution to the demand for wheat may have been trivial by
itself, that was not "enough to remove him from the scope of
federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken
together with that of many others similarly situated, is far
from trivial." Id., at 127-128.
        Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, and Wickard ushered in an
era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that greatly expanded the
previously defined authority of Congress under that Clause. In
part, this was a recognition of the great changes that had
occurred in the way business was carried on in this country.
Enterprises that had once been local or at most regional in
nature had become national in scope. But the doctrinal change
also reflected a view that earlier Commerce Clause cases
artificially had constrained the authority of Congress to
regulate interstate commerce.
        But even these modern-era precedents which have expanded
congressional power under the Commerce Clause confirm that this
power is subject to outer limits. In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the
Court warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power
"must be considered in the light of our dual system of
government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon
interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them,
in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the
distinction between what is national and what is local and
create a completely centralized government." 301 U.S., at 37;
see also Darby, supra, at 119-120 (Congress may regulate
intrastate activity that has a "substantial effect" on
interstate commerce); Wickard, supra, at 125 (Congress may
regulate activity that "exerts a substantial economic effect on
interstate commerce"). Since that time, the Court has heeded
that warning and undertaken to decide whether a rational basis
existed for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently
affected interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hodel v. Virginia
Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276-280
(1981); Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 155-156 (1971);
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 299-301 (1964); Heart of
Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 252-253
(1964).[FOOTNOTE 2]
        Similarly, in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183 (1968), the
Court reaffirmed that "the power to regulate commerce, though
broad indeed, has limits" that "[t]he Court has ample power" to
enforce. Id., at 196, overruled on other grounds, National
League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), overruled by
Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S.
528 (1985). In response to the dissent's warnings that the Court
was powerless to enforce the limitations on Congress' commerce
powers because "[a]ll activities affecting commerce, even in the
minutest degree, [Wickard], may be regulated and controlled by
Congress," 392 U.S., at 204 (Douglas, J., dissenting), the Wirtz
Court replied that the dissent had misread precedent as
"[n]either here nor in Wickard has the Court declared that
Congress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an
excuse for broad general regulation of state or private
activities," id., at 197, n. 27. Rather, "[t]he Court has said
only that where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial
relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual
instances arising under that statute is of no consequence."
Ibid. (first emphasis added).
        Consistent with this structure, we have identified three
broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under
its commerce power. Perez v. United States, supra, at 150; see
also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
supra, at 276-277. First, Congress may regulate the use of the
channels of interstate commerce. See, e.g., Darby, 312 U.S., at
114; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 ("'[T]he authority of
Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from
immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and is
no longer open to question.'" (quoting Caminetti v. United
States, 242 U.S. 470, 491 (1917)). Second, Congress is empowered
to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even
though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. See,
e.g., Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 342 (1914); Southern R.
Co. v. United States, 222 U.S. 20 (1911) (upholding amendments
to Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in
intrastate commerce); Perez, supra, at 150 ("[F]or example, the
destruction of an aircraft (18 U.S.C.  32), or . . . thefts
from interstate shipments (18 U.S.C.  659)"). Finally,
Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate
those activities having a substantial relation to interstate
commerce, Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U.S., at 37, i.e., those
activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Wirtz,
supra, at 196, n. 27.
        Within this final category, admittedly, our case law has
not been clear whether an activity must "affect" or
"substantially affect" interstate commerce in order to be within
Congress' power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause.
Compare Preseault v. ICC, 494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990), with Wirtz,
supra, at 196, n. 27 (the Court has never declared that
"Congress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an
excuse for broad general regulation of state or private
activities"). We conclude, consistent with the great weight of
our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of
whether the regulated activity "substantially affects"
interstate commerce.
        We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in the
light of this framework, to enact  922(q). The first two
categories of authority may be quickly disposed of:  922(q) is
not a regulation of the use of the channels of interstate
commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate
transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce;
nor can  922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress
has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstate commerce
or a thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if  922(q) is to be
sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation
of an activity that substantially affects interstatecommerce.
        First, we have upheld a wide variety of congressional
Acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have
concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate
commerce. Examples include the regulation of intrastate coal
mining; Hodel, supra, intrastate extortionate credit
transactions, Perez, supra, restaurants utilizing substantial
interstate supplies, McClung, supra, inns and hotels catering to
interstate guests, Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, and production
and consumption of home-grown wheat, Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U.S. 111 (1942). These examples are by no means exhaustive, but
the pattern is clear. Where economic activity substantially
affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that
activity will be sustained.
        Even Wickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching
example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,
involved economic activity in a way that the possession of a gun
in a school zone does not. Roscoe Filburn operated a small farm
in Ohio, on which, in the year involved, he raised 23 acres of
wheat. It was his practice to sow winter wheat in the fall, and
after harvesting it in July to sell a portion of the crop, to
feed part of it to poultry and livestock on the farm, to use
some in making flour for home consumption, and to keep the
remainder for seeding future crops. The Secretary of Agriculture
assessed a penalty against him under the Agricultural Adjustment
Act of 1938 because he harvested about 12 acres more wheat than
his allotment under the Act permitted. The Act was designed to
regulate the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign
commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages, and
concomitant fluctuation in wheat prices, which had previously
obtained. The Court said, in an opinion sustaining the
application of the Act to Filburn's activity:
        "One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was
to increase the market price of wheat and to that end to limit
the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly
be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home
-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and
market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable
condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by
rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price
increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it
supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be
reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in
this sense competes with wheat in commerce." 317 U.S., at 128.
        Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms
has nothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economic
enterprise, however broadly one might define those
terms.[FOOTNOTE 3] Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a
larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory
scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were
regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases
upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are
connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the
aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.
        Second,  922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which
would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm
possession in question affects interstate commerce. For example,
in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), the Court
interpreted former 18 U.S.C.  1202(a), which made it a crime
for a felon to "receiv[e], posses[s], or transpor[t] in commerce
or affecting commerce . . . any firearm." 404 U.S., at 337. The
Court interpreted the possession component of  1202(a) to
require an additional nexus to interstate commerce both because
the statute was ambiguous and because "unless Congress conveys
its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly
changed the federal-state balance." Id., at 349. The Bass Court
set aside the conviction because although the Government had
demonstrated that Bass had possessed a firearm, it had failed
"to show the requisite nexus with interstate commerce." Id., at
347. The Court thus interpreted the statute to reserve the
constitutional question whether Congress could regulate, without
more, the "mere possession" of firearms. See id., at 339, n. 4;
see also United States v. Five Gambling Devices, 346 U.S. 441,
448 (1953) (plurality opinion) ("The principle is old and deeply
imbedded in our jurisprudence that this Court will construe a
statute in a manner that requires decision of serious
constitutional questions only if the statutory language leaves
no reasonable alternative"). Unlike the statute in Bass, 
922(q) has no express jurisdictional element which might limit
its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that
additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on
interstate commerce.
        Although as part of our independent evaluation of
constitutionality under the Commerce Clause we of course
consider legislative findings, and indeed even congressional
committee findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce,
see, e.g., Preseault v. ICC, 494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990), the
Government concedes that "[n]either the statute nor its
legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings
regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession
in a school zone." Brief for United States 5-6. We agree with
the Government that Congress normally is not required to make
formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity
has on interstate commerce. See McClung, 379 U.S., at 304; see
also Perez, 402 U.S., at 156 ("Congress need [not] make
particularized findings in order to legislate"). But to the
extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate
the legislative judgment that the activity in question
substantially affected interstate commerce, even though no such
substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they are
lacking here.[FOOTNOTE 4]
        The Government argues that Congress has accumulated
institutional expertise regarding the regulation of firearms
through previous enactments. Cf. Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448
U.S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring). We agree,
however, with the Fifth Circuit that importation of previous
findings to justify  922(q) is especially inappropriate here
because the "prior federal enactments or Congressional findings
[do not] speak to the subject matter of section 922(q) or its
relationship to interstate commerce. Indeed, section 922(q)
plows thoroughly new ground and represents a sharp break with
the long-standing pattern of federal firearms legislation." 2
F.3d, at 1366.
        The Government's essential contention, in fine, is that
we may determine here that  922(q) is valid because possession
of a firearm in a local school zone does indeed substantially
affect interstate commerce. Brief for United States 17. The
Government argues that possession of a firearm in a school zone
may result in violent crime and that violent crime can be
expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in
two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial,
and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread
throughout the population. See United States v. Evans, 928 F.2d
858, 862 (CA9 1991). Second, violent crime reduces the
willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country
that are perceived to be unsafe. Cf. Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379
U.S., at 253. The Government also argues that the presence of
guns in schools poses a substantial threat to the educational
process by threatening the learning environment. A handicapped
educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive
citizenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the
Nation's economic well-being. As a result, the Government argues
that Congress could rationally have concluded that  922(q)
substantially affects interstate commerce.
        We pause to consider the implications of the Government's
arguments. The Government admits, under its "costs of crime"
reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all violent
crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime,
regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. Similarly, under the Government's
"national productivity" reasoning, Congress could regulate any
activity that it found was related to the economic productivity
of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce,
and child custody), for example. Under the theories that the
Government presents in support of  922(q), it is difficult to
perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as
criminal law enforcement or education where States historically
have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government's
arguments, we are hard-pressed to posit any activity by an
individual that Congress is without power to regulate.
        Although Justice Breyer argues that acceptance of the
Government's rationales would not authorize a general federal
police power, he is unable to identify any activity that the
States may regulate but Congress may not. Justice Breyer posits
that there might be some limitations on Congress' commerce power
such as family law or certain aspects of education. Post, at 10
-11. These suggested limitations, when viewed in light of the
dissent's expansive analysis, are devoid of substance.
        Justice Breyer focuses, for the most part, on the threat
that firearm possession in and near schools poses to the
educational process and the potential economic consequences
flowing from that threat. Post, at 5-9. Specifically, the
dissent reasons that (1) gun-related violence is a serious
problem; (2) that problem, in turn, has an adverse effect on
classroom learning; and (3) that adverse effect on classroom
learning, in turn, represents a substantial threat to trade and
commerce. Post, at 9. This analysis would be equally applicable,
if not more so, to subjects such as family law and direct
regulation of education.
        For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its Commerce
Clause power, regulate activities that adversely affect the
learning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulate the
educational process directly. Congress could determine that a
school's curriculum has a "significant" effect on the extent of
classroom learning. As a result, Congress could mandate a
federal curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools
because what is taught in local schools has a significant
"effect on classroom learning," cf. post, at 9, and that, in
turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
        Justice Breyer rejects our reading of precedent and
argues that "Congress . . . could rationally conclude that
schools fall on the commercial side of the line." Post, at 16.
Again, Justice Breyer's rationale lacks any real limits because,
depending on the level of generality, any activity can be looked
upon as commercial. Under the dissent's rationale, Congress
could just as easily look at child rearing as "fall[ing] on the
commercial side of the line" because it provides a "valuable
service-namely, to equip [children] with the skills they need to
survive in life and, more specifically, in the workplace." Ibid.
We do not doubt that Congress has authority under the Commerce
Clause to regulate numerous commercial activities that
substantially affect interstate commerce and also affect the
educational process. That authority, though broad, does not
include the authority to regulate each and every aspect of local
schools.
        Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate
activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result
in legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress' authority is
limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so
long as those enu-merated powers are interpreted as having
judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation
under the Commerce Clause always will engender "legal
uncertainty." Post, at 17. As Chief Justice Marshall stated in
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819):
        "The [federal] government is acknowledged by all to be
one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it can exercise
only the powers granted to it . . . is now universally admitted.
But the question respecting the extent of the powers actually
granted, is perpetually arising, and will probably continue to
arise, as long as our system shall exist." Id., at 405.
        See also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 195 ("The
enumeration presupposes something not enumerated"). The
Constitution mandates this uncertainty by withholding from
Congress a plenary police power that would authorize enactment
of every type of legislation. See U.S. Const., Art. I,  8.
Congress has operated within this framework of legal uncertainty
ever since this Court determined that it was the judiciary's
duty "to say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch.
137, 177 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Any possible benefit from
eliminating this "legal uncertainty" would be at the expense of
the Constitution's system of enumerated powers.
        In Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U.S., at 37, we held that
the question of congressional power under the Commerce Clause
"is necessarily one of degree." To the same effect is the
concurring opinion of Justice Cardozo in Schecter Poultry:
        "There is a view of causation that would obliterate the
distinction of what is national and what is local in the
activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim is communicated
perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the
center. A society such as ours 'is an elastic medium which
transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only
question is of their size.'" 295 U.S., at 554 (quoting United
States v. A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp, 76 F.2d 617, 624 (CA2
1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).
        These are not precise formulations, and in the nature of
things they cannot be. But we think they point the way to a
correct decision of this case. The possession of a gun in a
local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that
might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any
sort of interstate commerce. Respondent was a local student at a
local school; there is no indication that he had recently moved
in interstate commerce, and there is no requirement that his
possession of the firearm have any concrete tie to interstate
commerce.
        To uphold the Government's contentions here, we would
have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid
fair to convert congressional authority under the Commerce
Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the
States. Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long
steps down that road, giving great deference to congressional
action. See supra, at 8. The broad language in these opinions
has suggested the possibility of additional expansion, but we
decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require us
to conclude that the Constitution's enumeration of powers does
not presuppose something not enumerated, cf. Gibbons v. Ogden,
supra, at 195, and that there never will be a distinction
between what is truly national and what is truly local, cf.
Jones & Laughlin Steel, supra, at 30. This we are unwilling to
do.
        For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is
        Affirmed.
      
      
        JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,
concurring.
        The history of the judicial struggle to interpret the
Commerce Clause during the transition from the economic system
the Founders knew to the single, national market still emergent
in our own era counsels great restraint before the Court
determines that the Clause is insufficient to support an
exercise of the national power. That history gives me some pause
about today's decision, but I join the Court's opinion with
these observations on what I conceive to be its necessary though
limited holding.
        Chief Justice Marshall announced that the national
authority reaches "that commerce which concerns more States than
one" and that the commerce power "is complete in itself, may be
exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations,
other than are prescribed in the constitution." Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194, 196 (1824). His statements can be
understood now as an early and authoritative recognition that
the Commerce Clause grants Congress extensive power and ample
discretion to determine its appropriate exercise. The
progression of our Commerce Clause cases from Gibbons to the
present was not marked, however, by a coherent or consistent
course of interpretation; for neither the course of
technological advance nor the foundational principles for the
jurisprudence itself were self-evident to the courts that sought
to resolve contemporary disputes by enduring principles.
        Furthermore, for almost a century after the adoption of
the Constitution, the Court's Commerce Clause decisions did not
concern the authority of Congress to legislate. Rather, the
Court faced the related but quite distinct question of the
authority of the States to regulate matters that would be within
the commerce power had Congress chosen to act. The simple fact
was that in the early years of the Republic, Congress seldom
perceived the necessity to exercise its power in circumstances
where its authority would be called into question. The Court's
initial task, therefore, was to elaborate the theories that
would permit the States to act where Congress had not done so.
Not the least part of the problem was the unresolved question
whether the congressional power was exclusive, a question
reserved by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, supra,
at 209-210.
        At the midpoint of the 19th century, the Court embraced
the principle that the States and the National Government both
have authority to regulate certain matters absent the
congressional determination to displace local law or the
necessity for the Court to invalidate local law because of the
dormant national power. Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of
Philadelphia, 12 How. 299, 318-321 (1852). But the utility of
that solution was not at once apparent, see generally F.
Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause under Marshall, Taney and Waite
(1937) (hereinafter Frankfurter), and difficulties of
application persisted, see Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100, 122
-125 (1890).
        One approach the Court used to inquire into the
lawfulness of state authority was to draw content-based or
subject-matter distinctions, thus defining by semantic or
formalistic categories those activities that were commerce and
those that were not. For instance, in deciding that a State
could prohibit the in-state manufacture of liquor intended for
out-of-state shipment, it distinguished between manufacture and
commerce. "No distinction is more popular to the common mind, or
more clearly expressed in economic and political literature,
than that between manufactur[e] and commerce. Manufacture is
transformation-the fashioning of raw materials into a change of
form for use. The functions of commerce are different." Kidd v.
Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 20 (1888). Though that approach likely
would not have survived even if confined to the question of a
State's authority to enact legislation, it was not at all
propitious when applied to the quite different question of what
subjects were within the reach of the national power when
Congress chose to exercise it.
        This became evident when the Court began to confront
federal economic regulation enacted in response to the rapid
industrial development in the late 19th century. Thus, it relied
upon the manufacture-commerce dichotomy in United States v. E.
C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895), where a manufacturers'
combination controlling some 98% of the Nation's domestic sugar
refining capacity was held to be outside the reach of the
Sherman Act. Conspiracies to control manufacture, agriculture,
mining, production, wages, or prices, the Court explained, had
too "indirect" an effect on interstate commerce. Id., at 16. And
in Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908), the Court
rejected the view that the commerce power might extend to
activities that, although local in the sense of having
originated within a single state, nevertheless had a practical
effect on interstate commercial activity. The Court concluded
that there was not a "legal or logical connection . . . between
an employ's membership in a labor organization and the carrying
on of interstate commerce," id., at 178, and struck down a
federal statute forbidding the discharge of an employee because
of his membership in a labor organization. See also The
Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U.S. 463, 497 (1908)
(invalidating statute creating negligence action against common
carriers for personal injuries of employees sustained in the
course of employment, because the statute "regulates the persons
because they engage in interstate commerce and does not alone
regulate the business of interstate commerce").
        Even before the Court committed itself to sustaining
federal legislation on broad principles of economic
practicality, it found it necessary to depart from these
decisions. The Court disavowed E. C. Knight's reliance on the
manufacturing-commerce distinction in Standard Oil Co. of New
Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 68-69 (1911), declaring
that approach "unsound." The Court likewise rejected the
rationale of Adair when it decided, in Texas & New Orleans R.
Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 570-571 (1930), that
Congress had the power to regulate matters pertaining to the
organization of railroad workers.
        In another line of cases, the Court addressed Congress'
efforts to impede local activities it considered undesirable by
prohibiting the interstate movement of some essential element.
In the Lottery Case, 188 U.S. 321 (1903), the Court rejected the
argument that Congress lacked power to prohibit the interstate
movement of lottery tickets because it had power only to
regulate, not to prohibit. See also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United
States, 220 U.S. 45 (1911); Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308
(1913). In Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251 (1918), however,
the Court insisted that the power to regulate commerce "is
directly the contrary of the assumed right to forbid commerce
from moving," id., at 269-270, and struck down a prohibition on
the interstate transportation of goods manufactured in violation
of child labor laws.
        Even while it was experiencing difficulties in finding
satisfactory principles in these cases, the Court was pursuing a
more sustainable and practical approach in other lines of
decisions, particularly those involving the regulation of
railroad rates. In the Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U.S. 352
(1913), the Court upheld a state rate order, but observed that
Congress might be empowered to regulate in this area if "by
reason of the interblending of the interstate and intrastate
operations of interstate carriers" the regulation of interstate
rates could not be maintained without restrictions on
"intrastate rates which substantially affect the former." Id.,
at 432-433. And in the Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 342
(1914), the Court upheld an ICC order fixing railroad rates with
the explanation that congressional authority, "extending to
these interstate carriers as instruments of interstate commerce,
necessarily embraces the right to control their operations in
all matters having such a close and substantial relation to
interstate traffic that the control is essential or appropriate
to the security of that traffic, to the efficiency of the
interstate service, and to the maintenance of conditions under
which interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms and
without molestation or hindrance." Id., at 351.
        Even the most confined interpretation of "commerce" would
embrace transportation between the States, so the rate cases
posed much less difficulty for the Court than cases involving
manufacture or production. Nevertheless, the Court's recognition
of the importance of a practical conception of the commerce
power was not altogether confined to the rate cases. In Swift &
Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375 (1905), the Court upheld the
application of federal antitrust law to a combination of meat
dealers that occurred in one State but that restrained trade in
cattle "sent for sale from a place in one State, with the
expectation that they will end their transit . . . in another."
Id., at 398. The Court explained that "commerce among the States
is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn
from the course of business." Id., at 398. Chief Justice Taft
followed the same approach in upholding federal regulation of
stockyards in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495 (1922). Speaking
for the Court, he rejected a "nice and technical inquiry," id.,
at 519, when the local transactions at issue could not "be
separated from the movement to which they contribute," id., at
516.
        Reluctance of the Court to adopt that approach in all of
its cases caused inconsistencies in doctrine to persist,
however. In addressing New Deal legislation the Court
resuscitated the abandoned abstract distinction between direct
and indirect effects on interstate commerce. See Carter v.
Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 309 (1936) (Act regulating price
of coal and wages and hours for miners held to have only
"secondary and indirect" effect on interstate commerce);
Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, 368
(1935) (compulsory retirement and pension plan for railroad
carrier employees too "remote from any regulation of commerce as
such"); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295
U.S. 495, 548 (1935) (wage and hour law provision of National
Industrial Recovery Act had "no direct relation to interstate
commerce").
        The case that seems to mark the Court's definitive
commitment to the practical conception of the commerce power is
NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), where
the Court sustained labor laws that applied to manufacturing
facilities, making no real attempt to distinguish Carter, supra,
and Schechter, supra. 301 U.S., at 40-41. The deference given to
Congress has since been confirmed. United States v. Darby, 312
U.S. 100, 116-117 (1941), overruled Hammer v. Dagenhart, supra.
And in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), the Court
disapproved E. C. Knight and the entire line of direct-indirect
and manufacture-production cases, explaining that "broader
interpretations of the Commerce Clause [were] destined to
supersede the earlier ones," id., at 122, and "whatever
terminology is used, the criterion is necessarily one of degree
and must be so defined. This does not satisfy those who seek
mathematical or rigid formulas. But such formulas are not
provided by the great concepts of the Constitution," id., at
123, n. 24. Later examples of the exercise of federal power
where commercial transactions were the subject of regulation
include Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S.
241 (1964), Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), and
Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971). These and like
authorities are within the fair ambit of the Court's practical
conception of commercial regulation and are not called in
question by our decision today.
        The history of our Commerce Clause decisions contains at
least two lessons of relevance to this case. The first, as
stated at the outset, is the imprecision of content-based
boundaries used without more to define the limits of the
Commerce Clause. The second, related to the first but of even
greater consequence, is that the Court as an institution and the
legal system as a whole have an immense stake in the stability
of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as it has evolved to this
point. Stare decisis operates with great force in counseling us
not to call in question the essential principles now in place
respecting the congressional power to regulate transactions of a
commercial nature. That fundamental restraint on our power
forecloses us from reverting to an understanding of commerce
that would serve only an 18th-century economy, dependent then
upon production and trading practices that had changed but
little over the preceding centuries; it also mandates against
returning to the time when congressional authority to regulate
undoubted commercial activities was limited by a judicial
determination that those matters had an insufficient connection
to an interstate system. Congress can regulate in the commercial
sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a
unified purpose to build a stable national economy.
        In referring to the whole subject of the federal and
state balance, we said this just three Terms ago:
        "This framework has been sufficiently flexible over the
past two centuries to allow for enormous changes in the nature
of government. The Federal Government undertakes activities
today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in two
senses: first, because the Framers would not have conceived that
any government would conduct such activities; and second,
because the Framers would not have believed that the Federal
Government, rather than the States, would assume such
responsibilities. Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal
Government by the Constitution were phrased in language broad
enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal Government's
role." New York v. United States, 505 U.S. ___, ___ (1992) (slip
op., at 9-10) (emphasis omitted).
        It does not follow, however, that in every instance the
Court lacks the authority and responsibility to review
congressional attempts to alter the federal balance. This case
requires us to consider our place in the design of the
Government and to appreciate the significance of federalism in
the whole structure of the Constitution.
        Of the various structural elements in the Constitution,
separation of powers, checks and balances, judicial review, and
federalism, only concerning the last does there seem to be much
uncertainty respecting the existence, and the content, of
standards that allow the judiciary to play a significant role in
maintaining the design contemplated by the Framers. Although the
resolution of specific cases has proved difficult, we have
derived from the Constitution workable standards to assist in
preserving separation of powers and checks and balances. See,
e.g., Prize Cases, 2 Black 635 (1863); Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); United States v. Nixon, 418
U.S. 683 (1974); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976); INS v.
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714
(1986); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, ___ U.S. ___ (1995). These
standards are by now well accepted. Judicial review is also
established beyond question, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137
(1803), and though we may differ when applying its principles,
see, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.
Casey, 505 U.S. ___ (1992), its legitimacy is undoubted. Our
role in preserving the federal balance seems more tenuous.
        There is irony in this, because of the four structural
elements in the Constitution just mentioned, federalism was the
unique contribution of the Framers to political science and
political theory. See Friendly, Federalism: A Forward, 86 Yale
L. J. 1019 (1977); G. Wood, The Creation of the American
Republic, 1776-1787, pp. 524-532, 564 (1969). Though on the
surface the idea may seem counterintuitive, it was the insight
of the Framers that freedom was enhanced by the creation of two
governments, not one. "In the compound republic of America, the
power surrendered by the people is first divided between two
distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each
subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a
double security arises to the rights of the people. The
different governments will control each other, at the same time
that each will be controlled by itself." The Federalist No. 51,
p. 323 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). See also Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 458-459 (1991) ("Just as the separation
and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal
Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive power
in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the States
and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and
abuse from either front. . . . In the tension between federal
and state power lies the promise of liberty"); New York v.
United States, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 34) ("[T]he
Constitution divides authority between federal and state
governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty
is not just an end in itself: 'Rather, federalism secures to
citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of
sovereign power'") (quoting Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722,
759 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting)).
        The theory that two governments accord more liberty than
one requires for its realization two distinct and discernable
lines of political accountability: one between the citizens and
the Federal Government; the second between the citizens and the
States. If, as Madison expected, the federal and state
governments are to control each other, see The Federalist No.
51, and hold each other in check by competing for the affections
of the people, see The Federalist No. 46, those citizens must
have some means of knowing which of the two governments to hold
accountable for the failure to perform a given function.
"Federalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to
obscure it." FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 636
(1992). Were the Federal Government to take over the regulation
of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having
nothing to do with the regulation of commercial activities, the
boundaries between the spheres of federal and state authority
would blur and political responsibility would become illusory.
See New York v. United States, supra, at ___; FERC v.
Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 787 (1982) (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The resultant
inability to hold either branch of the government answerable to
the citizens is more dangerous even than devolving too much
authority to the remote central power.
        To be sure, one conclusion that could be drawn from The
Federalist Papers is that the balance between national and state
power is entrusted in its entirety to the political process.
Madison's observation that "the people ought not surely to be
precluded from giving most of their confidence where they may
discover it to be most due," The Federalist No. 46, p. 295 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961), can be interpreted to say that the essence
of responsibility for a shift in power from the State to the
Federal Government rests upon a political judgment, though he
added assurance that "the State governments could have little to
apprehend, because it is only within a certain sphere that the
federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageously
administered," ibid. Whatever the judicial role, it is axiomatic
that Congress does have substantial discretion and control over
the federal balance.
        For these reasons, it would be mistaken and mischievous
for the political branches to forget that the sworn obligation
to preserve and protect the Constitution in maintaining the
federal balance is their own in the first and primary instance.
In the Webster-Hayne Debates, see The Great Speeches and
Orations of Daniel Webster 227-272 (E. Whipple ed. 1879), and
the debates over the Civil Rights Acts, see Hearings on S. 1732
before the Senate Committee on Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st Sess.,
pts. 1-3 (1963), some Congresses have accepted responsibility to
confront the great questions of the proper federal balance in
terms of lasting consequences for the constitutional design. The
political branches of the Government must fulfill this grave
constitutional obligation if democratic liberty and the
federalism that secures it are to endure.
        At the same time, the absence of structural mechanisms to
require those officials to undertake this principled task, and
the momentary political convenience often attendant upon their
failure to do so, argue against a complete renunciation of the
judicial role. Although it is the obligation of all officers of
the Government to respect the constitutional design, see Public
Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 466 (1989);
Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981), the federal balance
is too essential a part of our constitutional structure and
plays too vital a role in securing freedom for us to admit
inability to intervene when one or the other level of Government
has tipped the scales too far.
        In the past this Court has participated in maintaining
the federal balance through judicial exposition of doctrines
such as abstention, see, e.g., Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37
(1971); Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496
(1941); Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), the rules
for determining the primacy of state law, see, e.g., Erie R. Co.
v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the doctrine of adequate and
independent state grounds, see, e.g., Murdock v. City of
Memphis, 87 U.S. 590 (1875); Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032
(1983), the whole jurisprudence of pre-emption, see, e.g., Rice
v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218 (1947); Cipollone v.
Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. ___ (1992), and many of the rules
governing our habeas jurisprudence, see, e.g., Coleman v.
Thompson, supra; McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467 (1991); Teague
v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509
(1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977).
        Our ability to preserve this principle under the Commerce
Clause has presented a much greater challenge. See supra, at 1
-7. "This clause has throughout the Court's history been the
chief source of its adjudications regarding federalism," and "no
other body of opinions affords a fairer or more revealing test of
judicial qualities." Frankfurter 66-67. But as the branch whose
distinctive duty it is to declare "what the law is," Marbury v.
Madison, 1 Cranch, at 177, we are often called upon to resolve
questions of constitutional law not susceptible to the
mechanical application of bright and clear lines. The
substantial element of political judgment in Commerce Clause
matters leaves our institutional capacity to intervene more in
doubt than when we decide cases, for instance, under the Bill of
Rights even though clear and bright lines are often absent in
the latter class of disputes. See County of Allegheny v.
American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492
U.S. 573, 630 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) ("We cannot avoid the obligation to draw
lines, often close and difficult lines" in adjudicating
constitutional rights). But our cases do not teach that we have
no role at all in determining the meaning of the Commerce
Clause.
        Our position in enforcing the dormant Commerce Clause is
instructive. The Court's doctrinal approach in that area has
likewise "taken some turns." Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson
Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 4). Yet in
contrast to the prevailing skepticism that surrounds our ability
to give meaning to the explicit text of the Commerce Clause,
there is widespread acceptance of our authority to enforce the
dormant Commerce Clause, which we have but inferred from the
constitutional structure as a limitation on the power of the
States. One element of our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence
has been the principle that the States may not impose
regulations that place an undue burden on interstate commerce,
even where those regulations do not discriminate between in
-state and out-of-state businesses. See Brown-Forman Distillers
Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573, 579
(1986) (citing Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142
(1970)). Distinguishing between regulations that do place an
undue burden on interstate commerce and regulations that do not
depends upon delicate judgments. True, if we invalidate a state
law, Congress can in effect overturn our judgment, whereas in a
case announcing that Congress has transgressed its authority,
the decision is more consequential, for its stands unless
Congress can revise its law to demonstrate its commercial
character. This difference no doubt informs the circumspection
with which we invalidate an Act of Congress, but it does not
mitigate our duty to recognize meaningful limits on the commerce
power of Congress.
        The statute before us upsets the federal balance to a
degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the
commerce power, and our intervention is required. As the Chief
Justice explains, unlike the earlier cases to come before the
Court here neither the actors nor their conduct have a
commercial character, and neither the purposes nor the design of
the statute have an evident commercial nexus. See ante, at 10
-12. The statute makes the simple possession of a gun within
1,000 feet of the grounds of the school a criminal offense. In a
sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an
ultimate commercial origin or consequence, but we have not yet
said the commerce power may reach so far. If Congress attempts
that extension, then at the least we must inquire whether the
exercise of national power seeks to intrude upon an area of
traditional state concern.
        An interference of these dimensions occurs here, for it
is well established that education is a traditional concern of
the States. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 741-742 (1974);
Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968). The proximity to
schools, including of course schools owned and operated by the
States or their subdivisions, is the very premise for making the
conduct criminal. In these circumstances, we have a particular
duty to insure that the federal-state balance is not destroyed.
Cf. Rice, supra, at 230 ("[W]e start with the assumption that
the historic police powers of the States" are not displaced by a
federal statute "unless that was the clear and manifest purpose
of Congress"); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373
U.S. 132, 146 (1963).
        While it is doubtful that any State, or indeed any
reasonable person, would argue that it is wise policy to allow
students to carry guns on school premises, considerable
disagreement exists about how best to accomplish that goal. In
this circumstance, the theory and utility of our federalism are
revealed, for the States may perform their role as laboratories
for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best
solution is far from clear. See San Antonio Independent School
Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 49-50 (1973); New State Ice Co.
v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting)).
        If a State or municipality determines that harsh criminal
sanctions are necessary and wise to deter students from carrying
guns on school premises, the reserved powers of the States are
sufficient to enact those measures. Indeed, over 40 States
already have criminal laws outlawing the possession of firearms
on or near school grounds. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. Ann. 
11.61.195(a)(2)(A), 11.61.220(a)(4)(A) (Supp. 1994); Cal. Penal
Code Ann.  626.9 (West Supp. 1994); Mass. Gen. Laws  269:10(j)
(1992); N. J. Stat. Ann.  2C:39-5(e) (West Supp. 1994); Va.
Code Ann.  18.2-308.1 (1988); Wis. Stat.  948.605 (1991-1992).
        Other, more practicable means to rid the schools of guns
may be thought by the citizens of some States to be preferable
for the safety and welfare of the schools those States are
charged with maintaining. See Brief for National Conference of
State Legislatures et al., as Amici Curiae 26-30 (injection of
federal officials into local problems causes friction and
diminishes political accountability of state and local
governments). These might include inducements to inform on
violators where the information leads to arrests or confiscation
of the guns, see C. Lima, Schools May Launch Weapons Hot Line,

Tips on Guns in Tucson Schools, The Arizona Republic, Jan. 7,

see J. Martin, Legislators Poised to Take Harsher Stand on Guns
in Schools, The Seattle Times, Feb. 1, 1995, p. B1 (automatic
-year-long expulsion for students with guns and intense semester
-long reentry program).
        The statute now before us forecloses the States from
experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area to
which States lay claim by right of history and expertise, and it
does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce
in the ordinary and usual sense of that term. The tendency of
this statute to displace state regulation in areas of
traditional state concern is evident from its territorial
operation. There are over 100,000 elementary and secondary
schools in the United States. See U.S. Dept. of Education,
National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education
Statistics 73, 104 (NCES 94-115, 1994) (Tables 63, 94). Each of
these now has an invisible federal zone extending 1,000 feet
beyond the (often irregular) boundaries of the school property.
In some communities no doubt it would be difficult to navigate
without infringing on those zones. Yet throughout these areas,
school officials would find their own programs for the
prohibition of guns in danger of displacement by the federal
authority unless the State chooses to enact a parallel rule.
        This is not a case where the etiquette of federalism has
been violated by a formal command from the National Government
directing the State to enact a certain policy, cf. New York v.
United States, 505 U.S. ___ (1992), or to organize its
governmental functions in a certain way, cf. FERC v.
Mississippi, 456 U.S., at 781 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part). While the intrusion on
state sovereignty may not be as severe in this instance as in
some of our recent Tenth Amendment cases, the intrusion is
nonetheless significant. Absent a stronger connection or
identification with commercial concerns that are central to the
Commerce Clause, that interference contradicts the federal
balance the Framers designed and that this Court is obliged to
enforce.
        For these reasons, I join in the opinion and judgment of
the Court.
      
      
        JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
        The Court today properly concludes that the Commerce
Clause does not grant Congress the authority to prohibit gun
possession within 1,000 feet of a school, as it attempted to do
in the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 104
Stat. 4844. Although I join the majority, I write separately to
observe that our case law has drifted far from the original
understanding of the Commerce Clause. In a future case, we ought
to temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence in a manner that
both makes sense of our more recent case law and is more
faithful to the original understanding of that Clause.
        We have said that Congress may regulate not only
"Commerce . . . among the several states," U.S. Const., Art. I,
 8, cl. 3, but also anything that has a "substantial effect" on
such commerce. This test, if taken to its logical extreme, would
give Congress a "police power" over all aspects of American
life. Unfortunately, we have never come to grips with this
implication of our substantial effects formula. Although we have
supposedly applied the substantial effects test for the past 60
years, we always have rejected readings of the Commerce Clause
and the scope of federal power that would permit Congress to
exercise a police power; our cases are quite clear that there
are real limits to federal power. See New York v. United States,
505 U.S. ___, ___ (1992) (slip op., at 7) ("[N]o one disputes
the proposition that '[t]he Constitution created a Federal
Government of limited powers'") (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft,
501 U.S. 452, 457 (1991); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 196
(1968); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37
(1937). Cf. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 435 (1793)
(Iredell, J.) ("Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all
the powers reserved. It must necessarily be so, because the
United States have no claim to any authority but such as the
States have surrendered to them"). Indeed, on this crucial
point, the majority and Justice Breyer agree in principle: the
Federal Government has nothing approaching a police power.
Compare ante, at 7-9 with post, at 10-11.
        While the principal dissent concedes that there are
limits to federal power, the sweeping nature of our current test
enables the dissent to argue that Congress can regulate gun
possession. But it seems to me that the power to regulate
"commerce" can by no means encompass authority over mere gun
possession, any more than it empowers the Federal Government to
regulate marriage, littering, or cruelty to animals, throughout
the 50 States. Our Constitution quite properly leaves such
matters to the individual States, notwithstanding these
activities' effects on interstate commerce. Any interpretation
of the Commerce Clause that even suggests that Congress could
regulate such matters is in need of reexamination.
        In an appropriate case, I believe that we must further
reconsider our "substantial effects" test with an eye toward
constructing a standard that reflects the text and history of
the Commerce Clause without totally rejecting our more recent
Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
        Today, however, I merely support the Court's conclusion
with a discussion of the text, structure, and history of the
Commerce Clause and an analysis of our early case law. My goal
is simply to show how far we have departed from the original
understanding and to demonstrate that the result we reach today
is by no means "radical," see post, at 1 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting). I also want to point out the necessity of
refashioning a coherent test that does not tend to "obliterate
the distinction between what is national and what is local and
create a completely centralized government." Jones & Laughlin
Steel Corp, supra, at 37.
        I
        At the time the original Constitution was ratified,
"commerce" consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well
as transporting for these purposes. See 1 S. Johnson, A
Dictionary of the English Language 361 (4th ed. 1773) (defining
commerce as "Intercour[s]e; exchange of one thing for another;
interchange of any thing; trade; traffick"); N. Bailey, An
Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed. 1789)
("trade or traffic"); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the
English Language (6th ed. 1796) ("Exchange of one thing for
another; trade, traffick"). This understanding finds support in
the etymology of the word, which literally means "with
merchandise." See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 552 (2d ed. 1989)
(com-"with"; merci-"merchandise"). In fact, when Federalists and
Anti-Federalists discussed the Commerce Clause during the
ratification period, they often used trade (in its
selling/bartering sense) and commerce interchangeably. See The
Federalist No. 4, p. 22 (J. Jay) (asserting that countries will
cultivate our friendship when our "trade" is prudently regulated
by Federal Government);[FOOTNOTE 5] id., No. 7, at 39-40 (A.
Hamilton) (discussing "competitions of commerce" between States
resulting from state "regulations of trade"); id., No. 40, at
262 (J. Madison) (asserting that it was an "acknowledged object
of the Convention . . . that the regulation of trade should be
submitted to the general government"); Lee, Letters of a Federal
Farmer No. 5, in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United
States 319 (P. Ford ed. 1888); Smith, An Address to the People
of the State of New-York, in id., at 107.
        As one would expect, the term "commerce" was used in
contradistinction to productive activities such as manufacturing
and agriculture. Alexander Hamilton, for example, repeatedly
treated commerce, agriculture, and manufacturing as three
separate endeavors. See, e.g., The Federalist No. 36, at 224
(referring to "agriculture, commerce, manufactures"); id., No.
21, at 133 (distinguishing commerce, arts, and industry); id.,
No. 12, at 74 (asserting that commerce and agriculture have
shared interests). The same distinctions were made in the state
ratification conventions. See e.g., 2 Debates in the Several
State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 57
(J. Elliot ed. 1836) (hereinafter Debates) (T. Dawes at
Massachusetts convention); id., at 336 (M. Smith at New York
convention).
        Moreover, interjecting a modern sense of commerce into
the Constitution generates significant textual and structural
problems. For example, one cannot replace "commerce" with a
different type of enterprise, such as manufacturing. When a
manufacturer produces a car, assembly cannot take place "with a
foreign nation" or "with the Indian Tribes." Parts may come from
different States or other nations and hence may have been in the
flow of commerce at one time, but manufacturing takes place at a
discrete site. Agriculture and manufacturing involve the
production of goods; commerce encompasses traffic in such
articles.
        The Port Preference Clause also suggests that the term
"commerce" denoted sale and/or transport rather than business
generally. According to that Clause, "[n]o Preference shall be
given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of
one State over those of another." U.S. Const., Art. I,  9, cl.
6. Although it is possible to conceive of regulations of
manufacturing or farming that prefer one port over another, the
more natural reading is that the Clause prohibits Congress from
using its commerce power to channel commerce through certain
favored ports.
        The Constitution not only uses the word "commerce" in a
narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not
support the proposition that Congress has authority over all
activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce. The
Commerce Clause[FOOTNOTE 6] does not state that Congress may
"regulate matters that substantially affect commerce with
foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the
Indian Tribes." In contrast, the Constitution itself temporarily
prohibited amendments that would "affect" Congress' lack of
authority to prohibit or restrict the slave trade or to enact
unproportioned direct taxation. U.S. Const., Art. V. Clearly,
the Framers could have drafted a Constitution that contained a
"substantially affects interstate commerce" clause had that been
their objective.
        In addition to its powers under the Commerce Clause,
Congress has the authority to enact such laws as are "necessary
and proper" to carry into execution its power to regulate
commerce among the several States. U.S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl.
18. But on this Court's understanding of congressional power
under these two Clauses, many of Congress' other enumerated
powers under Art. I,  8 are wholly superfluous. After all, if
Congress may regulate all matters that substantially affect
commerce, there is no need for the Constitution to specify that
Congress may enact bankruptcy laws, cl. 4, or coin money and fix
the standard of weights and measures, cl. 5, or punish
counterfeiters of United States coin and securities, cl. 6.
Likewise, Congress would not need the separate authority to
establish post offices and post roads, cl. 7, or to grant
patents and copyrights, cl. 8, or to "punish Piracies and
Felonies committed on the high Seas," cl. 10. It might not even
need the power to raise and support an Army and Navy, cls. 12
and 13, for fewer people would engage in commercial shipping if
they thought that a foreign power could expropriate their
property with ease. Indeed, if Congress could regulate matters
that substantially affect interstate commerce, there would have
been no need to specify that Congress can regulate international
trade and commerce with the Indians. As the Framers surely
understood, these other branches of trade substantially affect
interstate commerce.
        Put simply, much if not all of Art. I,  8 (including
portions of the Commerce Clause itself) would be surplusage if
Congress had been given authority over matters that
substantially affect interstate commerce. An interpretation of
cl. 3 that makes the rest of  8 superfluous simply cannot be
correct. Yet this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence has
endorsed just such an interpretation: the power we have accorded
Congress has swallowed Art. I,  8.[FOOTNOTE 7]
        Indeed, if a "substantial effects" test can be appended
to the Commerce Clause, why not to every other power of the
Federal Government? There is no reason for singling out the
Commerce Clause for special treatment. Accordingly, Congress
could regulate all matters that "substantially affect" the Army
and Navy, bankruptcies, tax collection, expenditures, and so on.
In that case, the clauses of  8 all mutually overlap, something
we can assume the Founding Fathers never intended.
        Our construction of the scope of congressional authority
has the additional problem of coming close to turning the Tenth
Amendment on its head. Our case law could be read to reserve to
the United States all powers not expressly prohibited by the
Constitution. Taken together, these fundamental textual problems
should, at the very least, convince us that the "substantial
effects" test should be reexamined.
        II
        The exchanges during the ratification campaign reveal the
relatively limited reach of the Commerce Clause and of federal
power generally. The Founding Fathers confirmed that most areas
of life (even many matters that would have substantial effects
on commerce) would remain outside the reach of the Federal
Government. Such affairs would continue to be under the
exclusive control of the States.
        Early Americans understood that commerce, manufacturing,
and agriculture, while distinct activities, were intimately
related and dependent on each other-that each "substantially
affected" the others. After all, items produced by farmers and
manufacturers were the primary articles of commerce at the time.
If commerce was more robust as a result of federal
superintendence, farmers and manufacturers could benefit. Thus,
Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut attempted to convince farmers of
the benefits of regulating commerce. "Your property and riches
depend on a ready demand and generous price for the produce you
can annually spare," he wrote, and these conditions exist "where
trade flourishes and when the merchant can freely export the
produce of the country" to nations that will pay the highest
price. A Landholder No. 1, Connecticut Courant, Nov. 5, 1787, in
3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution
399 (M. Jensen ed. 1978) (hereinafter Documentary History). See
also The Federalist No. 35, at 219 (A. Hamilton) ("[D]iscerning
citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts
furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and industry.
Many of them indeed are immediately connected with the
operations of commerce. They know that the merchant is their
natural patron and friend"); id., at 221 ("Will not the merchant
mechanic and manufacturing arts to which his commerce is so
nearly allied?"); A Jerseyman: To the Citizens of New Jersey,
Trenton Mercury, Nov. 6, 1787, in 3 Documentary History 147
(noting that agriculture will serve as a "source of commerce");
Marcus, The New Jersey Journal, Nov. 14, 1787, id., at 152 (both
the mechanic and the farmer benefit from the prosperity of
commerce). William Davie, a delegate to the North Carolina
Convention, illustrated the close link best: "Commerce, sir, is
the nurse of [agriculture and manufacturing]. The merchant
furnishes the planter with such articles as he cannot
manufacture himself, and finds him a market for his produce.
Agriculture cannot flourish if commerce languishes; they are
mutually dependent on each other." 4 Debates 20.
        Yet, despite being well aware that agriculture,
manufacturing, and other matters substantially affected
commerce, the founding generation did not cede authority over
all these activities to Congress. Hamilton, for instance,
acknowledged that the Federal Government could not regulate
agriculture and like concerns:
        "The administration of private justice between the
citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture and
of other concerns of a similar nature, all those things in short
which are proper to be provided for by local legislation, can
never be desirable cares of a general jurisdiction." The
Federalist No. 17, at 106.
        In the unlikely event that the Federal Government would
attempt to exercise authority over such matters, its effort
"would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory."
Ibid.[FOOTNOTE 8]
        The comments of Hamilton and others about federal power
reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would
have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the
Constitution. See, e.g., 2 Debates 267-268 (A. Hamilton at New
York convention) (noting that there would be just cause for
rejecting the Constitution if it would enable the Federal
Government to "alter, or abrogate . . . [a state's] civil and
criminal institutions [or] penetrate the recesses of domestic
life, and control, in all respects, the private conduct of
individuals"); The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison); 3
Debates 259 (J. Madison) (Virginia convention); R. Sherman & O.
Ellsworth, Letter to Governor Huntington, Sept. 26, 1787, in 3
Documentary History 352; J. Wilson, Speech in the State House
Yard, Oct. 6, 1787, in 2 id., at 167-168. Agriculture and
manufacture, since they were not surrendered to the Federal
Government, were state concerns. See The Federalist No. 34, at
212-213 (A. Hamilton) (observing that the "internal
encouragement of agriculture and manufactures" was an object of
state expenditure). Even before the passage of the Tenth
Amendment, it was apparent that Congress would possess only
those powers "herein granted" by the rest of the Constitution.
U.S. Const., Art. I,  1.
        Where the Constitution was meant to grant federal
authority over an activity substantially affecting interstate
commerce, the Constitution contains an enumerated power over
that particular activity. Indeed, the Framers knew that many of
the other enumerated powers in  8 dealt with matters that
substantially affected interstate commerce. Madison, for
instance, spoke of the bankruptcy power as being "intimately
connected with the regulation of commerce." The Federalist No.
42, at 287. Likewise, Hamilton urged that "[i]f we mean to be a
commercial people or even to be secure on our Atlantic side, we
must endeavour as soon as possible to have a navy." Id., No. 24,
at 157 (A. Hamilton).
        In short, the Founding Fathers were well aware of what
the principal dissent calls "'economic . . . realities.'" See
post, at 11-12 (Breyer, J.) (citing North American Co. v. SEC,
327 U.S. 686, 705 (1946)). Even though the boundary between
commerce and other matters may ignore "economic reality" and
thus seem arbitrary or artificial to some, we must nevertheless
respect a constitutional line that does not grant Congress power
over all that substantially affects interstate commerce.
        III
        If the principal dissent's understanding of our early
case law were correct, there might be some reason to doubt this
view of the original understanding of the Constitution.
According to that dissent, Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824) established that Congress
may control all local activities that "significantly affect
interstate commerce," post, at 1. And, "with the exception of
one wrong turn subsequently corrected," this has been the
"traditiona[l]" method of interpreting the Commerce Clause.
Post, at 18 (citing Gibbons and United States v. Darby, 312 U.S.
100, 116-117 (1941)).
        In my view, the dissent is wrong about the holding and
reasoning of Gibbons. Because this error leads the dissent to
characterize the first 150 years of this Court's case law as a
"wrong turn," I feel compelled to put the last 50 years in
proper perspective.
        A
        In Gibbons, the Court examined whether a federal law that
licensed ships to engage in the "coasting trade" pre-empted a
New York law granting a 30-year monopoly to Robert Livingston
and Robert Fulton to navigate the State's waterways by
steamship. In concluding that it did, the Court noted that
Congress could regulate "navigation" because "[a]ll America . .
navigation. It was so understood, and must have been so
understood, when the constitution was framed." 9 Wheat., at 190.
The Court also observed that federal power over commerce "among
the several States" meant that Congress could regulate commerce
conducted partly within a State. Because a portion of interstate
commerce and foreign commerce would almost always take place
within one or more States, federal power over interstate and
foreign commerce necessarily would extend into the States. Id.,
at 194-196.
        At the same time, the Court took great pains to make
clear that Congress could not regulate commerce "which is
completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in
a State, or between different parts of the same State, and which
does not extend to or affect other States." Id., at 194.
Moreover, while suggesting that the Constitution might not
permit States to regulate interstate or foreign commerce, the
Court observed that "[i]nspection laws, quarantine laws, health
laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the
internal commerce of a State" were but a small part "of that
immense mass of legislation . . . not surrendered to a general
government." Id., at 203. From an early moment, the Court
rejected the notion that Congress can regulate everything that
affects interstate commerce. That the internal commerce of the
States and the numerous state inspection, quarantine, and health
laws had substantial effects on interstate commerce cannot be
doubted. Nevertheless, they were not "surrendered to the general
government."
        Of course, the principal dissent is not the first to
misconstrue Gibbons. For instance, the Court has stated that
Gibbons "described the federal commerce power with a breadth
never yet exceeded." Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 120
(1942). See also Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 151
(1971) (claiming that with Darby and Wickard, "the broader view
of the Commerce Clause announced by Chief Justice Marshall had
been restored"). I believe that this misreading stems from two
statements in Gibbons.
        First, the Court made the uncontroversial claim that
federal power does not encompass "commerce" that "does not
extend to or affect other States." 9 Wheat., at 194 (emphasis
added). From this statement, the principal dissent infers that
whenever an activity affects interstate commerce, it necessarily
follows that Congress can regulate such activities. Of course,
Chief Justice Marshall said no such thing and the inference the
dissent makes cannot be drawn.
        There is a much better interpretation of the "affect[s]"
language: because the Court had earlier noted that the commerce
power did not extend to wholly intrastate commerce, the Court
was acknowledging that although the line between intrastate and
interstate/foreign commerce would be difficult to draw, federal
authority could not be construed to cover purely intrastate
commerce. Commerce that did not affect another State could never
be said to be commerce "among the several States."
        But even if one were to adopt the dissent's reading, the
"affect[s]" language, at most, permits Congress to regulate only
intrastate commerce that substantially affects interstate and
foreign commerce. There is no reason to believe that Chief
Justice Marshall was asserting that Congress could regulate all
activities that affect interstate commerce. See Ibid.
        The second source of confusion stems from the Court's
praise for the Constitution's division of power between the
States and the Federal Government:
        "The genius and character of the whole government seem to
be, that its action is to be applied to all the external
concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which
affect the States generally; but not to those which are
completely within a particular State, which do not affect other
States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere, for the
purpose of executing some of the general powers of the
government." Id., at 195.
        In this passage, the Court merely was making the well
understood point that the Constitution commits matters of
"national" concern to Congress and leaves "local" matters to the
States. The Court was not saying that whatever Congress believes
is a national matter becomes an object of federal control. The
matters of national concern are enumerated in the Constitution:
war, taxes, patents, and copyrights, uniform rules of
naturalization and bankruptcy, types of commerce, and so on. See
generally U.S. Const., Art. I,  8. Gibbons' emphatic statements
that Congress could not regulate many matters that affect
commerce confirm that the Court did not read the Commerce Clause
as granting Congress control over matters that "affect the
States generally."[FOOTNOTE 9] Gibbons simply cannot be
construed as the principal dissent would have it.
        B
        I am aware of no cases prior to the New Deal that
characterized the power flowing from the Commerce Clause as
sweepingly as does our substantial effects test. My review of
the case law indicates that the substantial effects test is but
an innovation of the 20th century.
        Even before Gibbons, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for
the Court in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821), noted that
Congress had "no general right to punish murder committed within
any of the States," id., at 426, and that it was "clear that
congress cannot punish felonies generally," id., at 428. The
Court's only qualification was that Congress could enact such
laws for places where it enjoyed plenary powers-for instance,
over the District of Columbia. Id., at 426. Thus, whatever
effect ordinary murders, or robbery, or gun possession might
have on interstate commerce (or on any other subject of federal
concern) was irrelevant to the question of congressional
power.[FOOTNOTE 10]
        United States v. Dewitt, 9 Wall. 41 (1870), marked the
first time the Court struck down a federal law as exceeding the
power conveyed by the Commerce Clause. In a two-page opinion,
the Court invalidated a nationwide law prohibiting all sales of
naphtha and illuminating oils. In so doing, the Court remarked
that the Commerce Clause "has always been understood as limited
by its terms; and as a virtual denial of any power to interfere
with the internal trade and business of the separate States."
Id., at 44. The law in question was "plainly a regulation of
police," which could have constitutional application only where
Congress had exclusive authority, such as the territories. Id.,
at 44-45. See also License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 470-471
(1867) (Congress cannot interfere with the internal commerce and
business of a State); Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879)
(Congress cannot regulate internal com-merce and thus may not
establish national trademark registration).
        In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895),
this Court held that mere attempts to monopolize the manufacture
of sugar could not be regulated pursuant to the Commerce Clause.
Raising echoes of the discussions of the Framers regarding the
intimate relationship between commerce and manufacturing, the
Court declared that "[c]ommerce succeeds to manufacture, and is
not a part of it." Id., at 12. The Court also approvingly quoted
from Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 20 (1888):
        "'No distinction is more popular to the common mind, or
more clearly expressed in economic and political literature,
than that between manufacture and commerce . . . . If it be held
that the term [commerce] includes the regulation of all such
manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial
transactions in the future, it is impossible to deny that it
would also include all productive industries that contemplate
the same thing. The result would be that Congress would be
invested . . . with the power to regulate, not only
manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising,
domestic fisheries, mining-in short, every branch of human
industry.'" E. C. Knight, 156 U.S., at 14.
        If federal power extended to these types of production
"comparatively little of business operations and affairs would
be left for state control." Id., at 16. See also Newberry v.
United States, 256 U.S. 232, 257 (1921) ("It is settled . . .
that the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce does
not reach whatever is essential thereto. Without agriculture,
manufacturing, mining, etc., commerce could not exist, but this
fact does not suffice to subject them to the control of
Congress"). Whether or not manufacturing, agriculture, or other
matters substantially affected interstate commerce was
irrelevant.
        As recently as 1936, the Court continued to insist that
the Commerce Clause did not reach the wholly internal business
of the States. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 308
(1936) (Congress may not regulate mine labor because "[t]he
relation of employer and employee is a local relation"); see
also A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S.
495, 543-550 (1935) (holding that Congress may not regulate
intrastate sales of sick chickens or the labor of employees
involved in intrastate poultry sales). The Federal Government
simply could not reach such subjects regardless of their effects
on interstate commerce.
        These cases all establish a simple point: from the time
of the ratification of the Constitution to the mid-1930's, it
was widely understood that the Constitution granted Congress
only limited powers, notwithstanding the Commerce
Clause.[FOOTNOTE 11] Moreover, there was no question that
activities wholly separated from business, such as gun
possession, were beyond the reach of the commerce power. If
anything, the "wrong turn" was the Court's dramatic departure in
the 1930's from a century and a half of precedent.
        IV
        Apart from its recent vintage and its corresponding lack
of any grounding in the original understanding of the
Constitution, the substantial effects test suffers from the
further flaw that it appears to grant Congress a police power
over the Nation. When asked at oral argument if there were any
limits to the Commerce Clause, the Government was at a loss for
words. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. Likewise, the principal dissent
insists that there are limits, but it cannot muster even one
example. Post, at 10-11. Indeed, the dissent implicitly concedes
that its reading has no limits when it criticizes the Court for
"threaten[ing] legal uncertainty in an area of law that . . .
seemed reasonably well settled." Post, at 17-18. The one
advantage of the dissent's standard is certainty: it is certain
that under its analysis everything may be regulated under the
guise of the Commerce Clause.
        The substantial effects test suffers from this flaw, in
part, because of its "aggregation principle." Under so-called
"class of activities" statutes, Congress can regulate whole
categories of activities that are not themselves either
"interstate" or "commerce." In applying the effects test, we ask
whether the class of activities as a whole substantially affects
interstate commerce, not whether any specific activity within
the class has such effects when considered in isolation. See
Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S., at 192-193 (if class of activities
is "'within the reach of federal power,'" courts may not excise
individual applications as trivial) (quoting Darby, 312 U.S., at
120-121).
        The aggregation principle is clever, but has no stopping
point. Suppose all would agree that gun possession within 1,000
feet of a school does not substantially affect commerce, but
that possession of weapons generally (knives, brass knuckles,
nunchakus, etc.) does. Under our substantial effects doctrine,
even though Congress cannot single out gun possession, it can
prohibit weapon possession generally. But one always can draw
the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken
in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce.
Under our jurisprudence, if Congress passed an omnibus
"substantially affects interstate commerce" statute, purporting
to regulate every aspect of human existence, the Act apparently
would be constitutional. Even though particular sections may
govern only trivial activities, the statute in the aggregate
regulates matters that substantially affect commerce.
        V
        This extended discussion of the original understanding
and our first century and a half of case law does not
necessarily require a wholesale abandonment of our more recent
opinions.[FOOTNOTE 12] It simply reveals that our substantial
effects test is far removed from both the Constitution and from
our early case law and that the Court's opinion should not be
viewed as "radical" or another "wrong turn" that must be
corrected in the future.[FOOTNOTE 13] The analysis also suggests
that we ought to temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
        Unless the dissenting Justices are willing to repudiate
our long-held understanding of the limited nature of federal
power, I would think that they too must be willing to reconsider
the substantial effects test in a future case. If we wish to be
true to a Constitution that does not cede a police power to the
Federal Government, our Commerce Clause's boundaries simply
cannot be "defined" as being "'commensurate with the national
needs'" or self-consciously intended to let the Federal
Government "'defend itself against economic forces that Congress
decrees inimical or destructive of the national economy.'" See
post, at 12-13 )Breyer, J., dissenting) (quoting North American
Co. v. SEC, 327 U.S. 686, 705 (1946)). Such a formulation of
federal power is no test at all: it is a blank check.
        At an appropriate juncture, I think we must modify our
Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Today, it is easy enough to say
that the Clause certainly does not empower Congress to ban gun
possession within 1,000 feet of a school.
      
      
        JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
        The welfare of our future "Commerce with foreign Nations,
and among the several States," U.S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 3,
is vitally dependent on the character of the education of our
children. I therefore agree entirely with Justice Breyer's
explanation of why Congress has ample power to prohibit the
possession of firearms in or near schools-just as it may protect
the school environment from harms posed by controlled substances
such as asbestos or alcohol. I also agree with Justice Souter's
exposition of the radical character of the Court's holding and
its kinship with the discredited, pre-Depression version of
substantive due process. Cf. Dolan v. Tigard, 512 U.S. ___, ___
(1994) (slip op., at 10-15) (Stevens, J., dissenting). I
believe, however, that the Court's extraordinary decision merits
this additional comment.
        Guns are both articles of commerce and articles that can
be used to restrain commerce. Their possession is the
consequence, either directly or indirectly, of commercial
activity. In my judgment, Congress' power to regulate commerce
in firearms includes the power to prohibit possession of guns at
any location because of their potentially harmful use; it
necessarily follows that Congress may also prohibit their
possession in particular markets. The market for the possession
of handguns by school-age children is, distressingly,
substantial.[FOOTNOTE *] Whether or not the national interest in
eliminating that market would have justified federal legislation
in 1789, it surely does today.
      
      
        JUSTICE SOUTER, dissenting.
        In reviewing congressional legislation under the Commerce
Clause, we defer to what is often a merely implicit
congressional judgment that its regulation addresses a subject
substantially affecting interstate commerce "if there is any
rational basis for such a finding." Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981);
Preseault v. ICC, 494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990); see Maryland v. Wirtz,
392 U.S. 183, 190 (1968), quoting Katzenbach v. McClung, 379
U.S. 294, 303-304 (1964). If that congressional determination is
within the realm of reason, "the only remaining question for
judicial inquiry is whether 'the means chosen by Congress [are]
reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.'"
Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.,
supra, at 276, quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United
States, 379 U.S. 241, 262 (1964); see also Preseault v. ICC,
supra, at 17.[FOOTNOTE 14]
        The practice of deferring to rationally based legislative
judgments "is a paradigm of judicial restraint." FCC v. Beach
Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. ___, ___ (1993) (slip op., at 6).
In judicial review under the Commerce Clause, it reflects our
respect for the institutional competence of the Congress on a
subject expressly assigned to it by the Constitution and our
appreciation of the legitimacy that comes from Congress's
political accountability in dealing with matters open to a wide
range of possible choices. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5-8);
Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.,
supra, at 276; United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S.
144, 147, 151-154 (1938); cf. Williamson v. Lee Optical of
Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 488 (1955).
        It was not ever thus, however, as even a brief overview
of Commerce Clause history during the past century reminds us.
The modern respect for the competence and primacy of Congress in
matters affecting commerce developed only after one of this
Court's most chastening experiences, when it perforce repudiated
an earlier and untenably expansive conception of judicial review
in derogation of congressional commerce power. A look at
history's sequence will serve to show how today's decision tugs
the Court off course, leading it to suggest opportunities for
further developments that would be at odds with the rule of
restraint to which the Court still wisely states adherence.
        I
        Notwithstanding the Court's recognition of a broad
commerce power in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196-197 (1824)
(Marshall, C. J.), Congress saw few occasions to exercise that
power prior to Reconstruction, see generally 2 C. Warren, The
Supreme Court in United States History 729-739 (rev. ed. 1935),
and it was really the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act of
1887 that opened a new age of congressional reliance on the
Commerce Clause for authority to exercise general police powers
at the national level, see id., at 729-730. Although the Court
upheld a fair amount of the ensuing legislation as being within
the commerce power, see, e.g., Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495
(1922) (upholding an Act regulating trade practices in the meat
packing industry); The Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 342
(1914) (upholding ICC order to equalize inter- and intrastate
rail rates); see generally Warren, supra, at 729-739, the period
from the turn of the century to 1937 is better noted for a
series of cases applying highly formalistic notions of
"commerce" to invalidate federal social and economic
legislation, see, e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238,
303-304 (1936) (striking Act prohibiting unfair labor practices
in coal industry as regulation of "mining" and "production," not
"commerce"); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,
295 U.S. 495, 545-548 (1935) (striking congressional regulation
of activities affecting interstate commerce only "indirectly");
Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251 (1918) (striking Act
prohibiting shipment in interstate commerce of goods
manufactured at factories using child labor because the Act
regulated "manufacturing," not "commerce"); Adair v. United
States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908) (striking protection of labor union
membership as outside "commerce").
        These restrictive views of commerce subject to
congressional power complemented the Court's activism in
limiting the enforceable scope of state economic regulation. It
is most familiar history that during this same period the Court
routinely invalidated state social and economic legislation
under an expansive conception of Fourteenth Amendment
substantive due process. See, e.g., Louis K. Liggett Co. v.
Baldridge, 278 U.S. 105 (1928) (striking state law requiring
pharmacy owners to be licensed as pharmacists); Coppage v.
Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915) (striking state law prohibiting
employers from requiring their employees to agree not to join
labor organizations); Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905)
(striking state law establishing maximum working hours for
bakers). See generally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law
568-574 (2d ed. 1988). The fulcrums of judicial review in these
cases were the notions of liberty and property characteristic of
laissez-faire economics, whereas the Commerce Clause cases
turned on what was ostensibly a structural limit of federal
power, but under each conception of judicial review the Court's
character for the first third of the century showed itself in
exacting judicial scrutiny of a legislature's choice of economic
ends and of the legislative means selected to reach them.
        It was not merely coincidental, then, that sea changes in
the Court's conceptions of its authority under the Due Process
and Commerce Clauses occurred virtually together, in 1937, with
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 and NLRB v. Jones
& Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1. See Stern, The Commerce
Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, 59 Harv. L. Rev.
645, 674-682 (1946). In West Coast Hotel, the Court's rejection
of a due process challenge to a state law fixing minimum wages
for women and children marked the abandonment of its expansive
protection of contractual freedom. Two weeks later, Jones &
Laughlin affirmed congressional commerce power to authorize NLRB
injunctions against unfair labor practices. The Court's finding
that the regulated activity had a direct enough effect on
commerce has since been seen as beginning the abandonment, for
practical purposes, of the formalistic distinction between
direct and indirect effects.
        In the years following these decisions, deference to
legislative policy judgments on commercial regulation became the
powerful theme under both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses,
see United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S., at 147
-148, 152; United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 119-121 (1941);
United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 118-119
(1942), and in due course that deference became articulate in
the standard of rationality review. In due process litigation,
the Court's statement of a rational basis test came quickly. See
United States v. Carolene Products Co., supra, at 152; see also
Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S., at 489-490. The
parallel formulation of the Commerce Clause test came later,
only because complete elimination of the direct/indirect effects
dichotomy and acceptance of the cumulative effects doctrine,
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 125, 127-129 (1942); United
States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., supra, at 124-126, so far
settled the pressing issues of congressional power over commerce
as to leave the Court for years without any need to phrase a
test explicitly deferring to rational legislative judgments. The
moment came, however, with the challenge to congressional
Commerce Clause authority to prohibit racial discrimination in
places of public accommodation, when the Court simply made
explicit what the earlier cases had implied: "where we find that
the legislators, in light of the facts and testimony before
them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory
scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our
investigation is at an end." Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S.
294, 303-304 (1964), discussing United States v. Darby, supra;
see Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241,
258-259 (1964). Thus, under commerce, as under due process,
adoption of rational basis review expressed the recognition that
the Court had no sustainable basis for subjecting economic
regulation as such to judicial policy judgments, and for the
past half-century the Court has no more turned back in the
direction of formalistic Commerce Clause review (as in deciding
whether regulation of commerce was sufficiently direct) than it
has inclined toward reasserting the substantive authority of
Lochner due process (as in the inflated protection of
contractual autonomy). See, e.g., Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S.,
at 190, 198; Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 151-157
(1971); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 452 U.S., at 276, 277.
        II
        There is today, however, a backward glance at both the
old pitfalls, as the Court treats deference under the
rationality rule as subject to gradation according to the
commercial or noncommercial nature of the immediate subject of
the challenged regulation. See ante, at 10-13. The distinction
between what is patently commercial and what is not looks much
like the old distinction between what directly affects commerce
and what touches it only indirectly. And the act of calibrating
the level of deference by drawing a line between what is
patently commercial and what is less purely so will probably
resemble the process of deciding how much interference with
contractual freedom was fatal. Thus, it seems fair to ask
whether the step taken by the Court today does anything but
portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the
Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago. The answer is not
reassuring. To be sure, the occasion for today's decision
reflects the century's end, not its beginning. But if it seems
anomalous that the Congress of the United States has taken to
regulating school yards, the act in question is still probably
no more remarkable than state regulation of bake shops 90 years
ago. In any event, there is no reason to hope that the Court's
qualification of rational basis review will be any more
successful than the efforts at substantive economic review made
by our predecessors as the century began. Taking the Court's
opinion on its own terms, Justice Breyer has explained both the
hopeless porosity of "commercial" character as a ground of
Commerce Clause distinction in America's highly connected
economy, and the inconsistency of this categorization with our
rational basis precedents from the last 50 years.
        Further glosses on rationality review, moreover, may be
in the offing. Although this case turns on commercial character,
the Court gestures toward two other considerations that it might
sometime entertain in applying rational basis scrutiny (apart
from a statutory obligation to supply independent proof of a
jurisdictional element): does the congressional statute deal
with subjects of traditional state regulation, and does the
statute contain explicit factual findings supporting the
otherwise implicit determination that the regulated activity
substantially affects interstate commerce? Once again, any
appeal these considerations may have depends on ignoring the
painful lesson learned in 1937, for neither of the Court's
suggestions would square with rational basis scrutiny.
        A
        The Court observes that the Gun-Free School Zones Act
operates in two areas traditionally subject to legislation by
the States, education and enforcement of criminal law. The
suggestion is either that a connection between commerce and
these subjects is remote, or that the commerce power is simply
weaker when it touches subjects on which the States have
historically been the primary legislators. Neither suggestion is
tenable. As for remoteness, it may or may not be wise for the
National Government to deal with education, but Justice Breyer
has surely demonstrated that the commercial prospects of an
illiterate State or Nation are not rosy, and no argument should
be needed to show that hijacking interstate shipments of
cigarettes can affect commerce substantially, even though the
States have traditionally prosecuted robbery. And as for the
notion that the commerce power diminishes the closer it gets to
customary state concerns, that idea has been flatly rejected,
and not long ago. The commerce power, we have often observed, is
plenary. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 312 U.S., at 276; United States v. Darby, supra, at 114;
see Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469
U.S. 528, 549-550 (1985); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 196
-197. Justice Harlan put it this way in speaking for the Court in
Maryland v. Wirtz:
        "There is no general doctrine implied in the Federal
Constitution that the two governments, national and state, are
each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free
and full exercise of the powers of the other. . . . [I]t is
clear that the Federal Government, when acting within a
delegated power, may override countervailing state interests . .
that state concerns might constitutionally 'outweigh' the
importance of an otherwise valid federal statute regulating
commerce." 392 U.S., at 195-196 (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted).
        See also United States v. Darby, supra, at 114; Gregory
v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991); United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U.S., at 147.
        Nor is there any contrary authority in the reasoning of
our cases imposing clear statement rules in some instances of
legislation that would significantly alter the state-national
balance. In the absence of a clear statement of congressional
design, for example, we have refused to interpret ambiguous
federal statutes to limit fundamental state legislative
prerogatives, Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 460-464, our
understanding being that such prerogatives, through which "a
State defines itself as a sovereign," are "powers with which
Congress does not readily interfere," 501 U.S., at 460, 461.
Likewise, when faced with two plausible interpretations of a
federal criminal statute, we generally will take the alternative
that does not force us to impute an intention to Congress to use
its full commerce power to regulate conduct traditionally and
ably regulated by the States. See United States v. Enmons, 410
U.S. 396, 411-412 (1973); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336,
349-350 (1971); Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812
(1971).
        These clear statement rules, however, are merely rules of
statutory interpretation, to be relied upon only when the terms
of a statute allow, United States v. Culbert, 435 U.S. 371, 379
-380 (1978); see Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 470; United
States v. Bass, supra, at 346-347, and in cases implicating
Congress's historical reluctance to trench on state legislative
prerogatives or to enter into spheres already occupied by the
States, Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 461; United States v.
Bass, supra, at 349; see Rewis v. United States, supra, at 811
-812. They are rules for determining intent when legislation
leaves intent subject to question. But our hesitance to presume
that Congress has acted to alter the state-federal status quo
(when presented with a plausible alternative) has no relevance
whatever to the enquiry whether it has the commerce power to do
so or to the standard of judicial review when Congress has
definitely meant to exercise that power. Indeed, to allow our
hesitance to affect the standard of review would inevitably
degenerate into the sort of substantive policy review that the
Court found indefensible 60 years ago. The Court does not assert
(and could not plausibly maintain) that the commerce power is
wholly devoid of congressional authority to speak on any subject
of traditional state concern; but if congressional action is not
forbidden absolutely when it touches such a subject, it will
stand or fall depending on the Court's view of the strength of
the legislation's commercial justification. And here once again
history raises its objections that the Court's previous essays
in overriding congressional policy choices under the Commerce
Clause were ultimately seen to suffer two fatal weaknesses: when
dealing with Acts of Congress (as distinct from state
legislation subject to review under the theory of dormant
commerce power) nothing in the Clause compelled the judicial
activism, and nothing about the judiciary as an institution made
it a superior source of policy on the subject Congress dealt
with. There is no reason to expect the lesson would be different
another time.
        B
        There remain questions about legislative findings. The
Court of Appeals expressed the view, 2 F.3d 1342, 1363-1368
(1993), that the result in this case might well have been
different if Congress had made explicit findings that guns in
schools have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and
the Court today does not repudiate that position, see ante, at
13-14. Might a court aided by such findings have subjected this
legislation to less exacting scrutiny (or, put another way,
should a court have deferred to such findings if Congress had
made them)?[FOOTNOTE 15] The answer to either question must be
no, although as a general matter findings are important and to
be hoped for in the difficult cases.
        It is only natural to look for help with a hard job, and
reviewing a claim that Congress has exceeded the commerce power
is much harder in some cases than in others. A challenge to
congressional regulation of interstate garbage hauling would be
easy to resolve; review of congressional regulation of gun
possession in school yards is more difficult, both because the
link to interstate commerce is less obvious and because of our
initial ignorance of the relevant facts. In a case comparable to
this one, we may have to dig hard to make a responsible judgment
about what Congress could reasonably find, because the case may
be close, and because judges tend not to be familiar with the
facts that may or may not make it close. But while the ease of
re-view may vary from case to case, it does not follow that the
standard of review should vary, much less that explicit findings
of fact would even directly address the standard.
        The question for the courts, as all agree, is not whether
as a predicate to legislation Congress in fact found that a
particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce.
The legislation implies such a finding, and there is no reason
to entertain claims that Congress acted ultra vires
intentionally. Nor is the question whether Congress was correct
in so finding. The only question is whether the legislative
judgment is within the realm of reason. See Hodel v. Virginia
Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S., at 276-277;
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S., at 303-304; Railroad Retirement
Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, 391-392 (1935) (Hughes, C.
J., dissenting); cf. FCC v. Beach Communications, 508 U.S., at
___ (slip op., at 7) (in the equal protection context, "those
attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have
the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might
support it; . . . it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional
purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged
distinction actually motivated the legislature") (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted); Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S.
726, 731-733 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S., at
487. Congressional findings do not, however, directly address
the question of reasonableness; they tell us what Congress
actually has found, not what it could rationally find. If,
indeed, the Court were to make the existence of explicit
congressional findings dispositive in some close or difficult
cases something other than rationality review would be afoot.
The resulting congressional obligation to justify its policy
choices on the merits would imply either a judicial authority to
review the justification (and, hence, the wisdom) of those
choices, or authority to require Congress to act with some high
degree of deliberateness, of which express findings would be
evidence. But review for congressional wisdom would just be the
old judicial pretension discredited and abandoned in 1937, and
review for deliberateness would be as patently unconstitutional
as an Act of Congress mandating long opinions from this Court.
Such a legislative process requirement would function merely as
an excuse for covert review of the merits of legislation under
standards never expressed and more or less arbitrarily applied.
Under such a regime, in any case, the rationality standard of
review would be a thing of the past.
        On the other hand, to say that courts applying the
rationality standard may not defer to findings is not, of
course, to say that findings are pointless. They may, in fact,
have great value in telling courts what to look for, in
establishing at least one frame of reference for review, and in
citing to factual authority. The research underlying Justice
Breyer's dissent was necessarily a major undertaking; help is
welcome, and it not incidentally shrinks the risk that judicial
research will miss material scattered across the public domain
or buried under pounds of legislative record. Congressional
findings on a more particular plane than this record illustrates
would accordingly have earned judicial thanks. But thanks do not
carry the day as long as rational possibility is the touchstone,
and I would not allow for the possibility, as the Court's
opinion may, ante, at 14, that the addition of congressional
findings could in principle have affected the fate of the
statute here.
        III
        Because Justice Breyer's opinion demonstrates beyond any
doubt that the Act in question passes the rationality review
that the Court continues to espouse, today's decision may be
seen as only a misstep, its reasoning and its suggestions not
quite in gear with the prevailing standard, but hardly an
epochal case. I would not argue otherwise, but I would raise a
caveat. Not every epochal case has come in epochal trappings.
Jones & Laughlin did not reject the direct-indirect standard in
so many words; it just said the relation of the regulated
subject matter to commerce was direct enough. 301 U.S., at 41
-43. But we know what happened.
        I respectfully dissent.
      
      
        JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.
        The issue in this case is whether the Commerce Clause
authorizes Congress to enact a statute that makes it a crime to
possess a gun in, or near, a school. 18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)
(1988 ed., Supp. V). In my view, the statute falls well within
the scope of the commerce power as this Court has understood
that power over the last half-century.
        I
        In reaching this conclusion, I apply three basic
principles of Commerce Clause interpretation. First, the power
to "regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," U.S.
Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 3, encompasses the power to regulate
local activities insofar as they significantly affect interstate
commerce. See, e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194-195
(1824) (Marshall, C. J.); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 125
(1942). As the majority points out, ante, at 10, the Court, in
describing how much of an effect the Clause requires, sometimes
has used the word "substantial" and sometimes has not. Compare,
e.g., Wickard, supra, at 125 ("substantial economic effect"),
with Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981) ("affects interstate commerce");
see also Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 196, n. 27 (1968)
(cumulative effect must not be "trivial"); NLRB v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37 (1937) (speaking of "close
and substantial relation" between activity and commerce, not of
"substantial effect") (emphasis added); Gibbons, supra, at 194
(words of Commerce Clause do not "comprehend . . . commerce,
which is completely internal . . . and which does not . . .
affect other States"). And, as the majority also recognizes in
quoting Justice Cardozo, the question of degree (how much
effect) requires an estimate of the "size" of the effect that no
verbal formulation can capture with precision. See ante, at 18.
I use the word "significant" because the word "substantial"
implies a somewhat narrower power than recent precedent
suggests. See, e.g., Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 154
(1971); Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 308 (1969). But, to speak
of "substantial effect" rather than "significant effect" would
make no difference in this case.
        Second, in determining whether a local activity will
likely have a significant effect upon interstate commerce, a
court must consider, not the effect of an individual act (a
single instance of gun possession), but rather the cumulative
effect of all similar instances (i.e., the effect of all guns
possessed in or near schools). See, e.g., Wickard, supra, at
127-128. As this Court put the matter almost 50 years ago:
        "[I]t is enough that the individual activity when
multiplied into a general practice . . . contains a threat to
the interstate economy that requires preventative regulation."
Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334
U.S. 219, 236 (1948) (citations omitted).
        Third, the Constitution requires us to judge the
connection between a regulated activity and interstate commerce,
not directly, but at one remove. Courts must give Congress a
degree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant
factual connection between the regulated activity and interstate
commerce-both because the Constitution delegates the commerce
power directly to Congress and because the determination
requires an empirical judgment of a kind that a legislature is
more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional
words "rational basis" capture this leeway. See Hodel, supra, at
276-277. Thus, the specific question before us, as the Court
recognizes, is not whether the "regulated activity sufficiently
affected interstate commerce," but, rather, whether Congress
could have had "a rational basis" for so concluding. Ante, at 8
(emphasis added).
        I recognize that we must judge this matter independently.
"[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular
activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not
necessarily make it so." Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J.,
concurring in judgment). And, I also recognize that Congress did
not write specific "interstate commerce" findings into the law
under which Lopez was convicted. Nonetheless, as I have already
noted, the matter that we review independently (i.e., whether
there is a "rational basis") already has considerable leeway
built into it. And, the absence of findings, at most, deprives a
statute of the benefit of some extra leeway. This extra
deference, in principle, might change the result in a close
case, though, in practice, it has not made a critical legal
difference. See, e.g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 299
(1964) (noting that "no formal findings were made, which of
course are not necessary"); Perez, supra, at 156-157; cf. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ___, ___ (1994)
(opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 42) ("Congress is not
obligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record of the
type that an administrative agency or court does to accommodate
judicial review"); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 503
(1980) (Powell, J., concurring) ("After Congress has legislated
repeatedly in an area of national concern, its Members gain
experience that may reduce the need for fresh hearings or
prolonged debate . . ."). And, it would seem particularly
unfortunate to make the validity of the statute at hand turn on
the presence or absence of findings. Because Congress did make
findings (though not until after Lopez was prosecuted), doing so
would appear to elevate form over substance. See Pub. L. 103
-322,  320904(2)(F), (G), 108 Stat. 2125, 18 U.S.C. A. 
922(q)(1)(F), (G) (Nov. 1994 Supp.).
        In addition, despite the Court of Appeals' suggestion to
the contrary, see 2 F.3d 1342, 1365 (CA5 1993), there is no
special need here for a clear indication of Congress' rationale.
The statute does not interfere with the exercise of state or
local authority. Cf., e.g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 227
-228 (1989) (requiring clear statement for abrogation of Eleventh
Amendment immunity). Moreover, any clear statement rule would
apply only to determine Congress' intended result, not to
clarify the source of its authority or measure the level of
consideration that went into its decision, and here there is no
doubt as to which activities Congress intended to regulate. See
ibid.; id., at 233 (Scalia, J., concurring) (to subject States
to suits for money damages, Congress need only make that intent
clear, and need not refer explicitly to the Eleventh Amendment);
EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 243, n. 18 (1983) (Congress need
not recite the constitutional provision that authorizes its
action).
        II
        Applying these principles to the case at hand, we must
ask whether Congress could have had a rational basis for finding
a significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related
school violence and interstate commerce. Or, to put the question
in the language of the explicit finding that Congress made when
it amended this law in 1994: Could Congress rationally have
found that "violent crime in school zones," through its effect
on the "quality of education," significantly (or substantially)
affects "interstate" or "foreign commerce"? 18 U.S.C. A. 
922(q)(1)(F), (G) (Nov. 1994 Supp.). As long as one views the
commerce connection, not as a "technical legal conception," but
as "a practical one," Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S.
375, 398 (1905) (Holmes, J.), the answer to this question must
be yes. Numerous reports and studies-generated both inside and
outside government-make clear that Congress could reasonably
have found the empirical connection that its law, implicitly or
explicitly, asserts. (See Appendix, infra at 19, for a sample of
the documentation, as well as for complete citations to the
sources referenced below.)
        For one thing, reports, hearings, and other readily
available literature make clear that the problem of guns in and
around schools is widespread and extremely serious. These
materials report, for example, that four percent of American
high school students (and six percent of inner-city high school
students) carry a gun to school at least occasionally, Centers
for Disease Control 2342; Sheley, McGee, & Wright 679; that 12
percent of urban high school students have had guns fired at
them, ibid.; that 20 percent of those students have been
threatened with guns, ibid.; and that, in any 6-month period,
several hundred thousand schoolchildren are victims of violent
crimes in or near their schools, U.S. Dept. of Justice 1 (1989);
House Select Committee Hearing 15 (1989). And, they report that
this widespread violence in schools throughout the Nation
significantly interferes with the quality of education in those
schools. See, e.g., House Judiciary Committee Hearing 44 (1990)
(linking school violence to dropout rate); U.S. Dept. of Health
118-119 (1978) (school-violence victims suffer academically);
compare U.S. Dept. of Justice 1 (1991) (gun violence worst in
inner city schools), with National Center 47 (dropout rates
highest in inner cities). Based on reports such as these,
Congress obviously could have thought that guns and learning are
mutually exclusive. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
Hearing 39 (1993); U.S. Dept. of Health 118, 123-124 (1978).
And, Congress could therefore have found a substantial
educational problem-teachers unable to teach, students unable to
learn-and concluded that guns near schools contribute
substantially to the size and scope of that problem.
        Having found that guns in schools significantly undermine
the quality of education in our Nation's classrooms, Congress
could also have found, given the effect of education upon
interstate and foreign commerce, that gun-related violence in
and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem.
Education, although far more than a matter of economics, has
long been inextricably intertwined with the Nation's economy.
When this Nation began, most workers received their education in
the workplace, typically (like Benjamin Franklin) as
apprentices. See generally Seybolt; Rorabaugh; U.S. Dept. of
Labor (1950). As late as the 1920's, many workers still received
general education directly from their employers-from large
corporations, such as General Electric, Ford, and Goodyear,
which created schools within their firms to help both the worker
and the firm. See Bolino 15-25. (Throughout most of the 19th
century fewer than one percent of all Americans received
secondary education through attending a high school. See id., at
11.) As public school enrollment grew in the early 20th century,
see Becker 218 (1993), the need for industry to teach basic
educational skills diminished. But, the direct economic link
between basic education and industrial productivity remained.
Scholars estimate that nearly a quarter of America's economic
growth in the early years of this century is traceable directly
to increased schooling, see Denison 243; that investment in
"human capital" (through spending on education) exceeded
investment in "physical capital" by a ratio of almost two to
one, see Schultz 26 (1961); and that the economic returns to
this investment in education exceeded the returns to
conventional capital investment, see, e.g., Davis & Morrall 48
-49.
        In recent years the link between secondary education and
business has strengthened, becoming both more direct and more
important. Scholars on the subject report that technological
changes and innovations in management techniques have altered
the nature of the workplace so that more jobs now demand greater
educational skills. See, e.g., MIT 32 (only about one-third of
hand-tool company's 1,000 workers were qualified to work with a
new process that requires high-school-level reading and
mathematical skills); Cyert & Mowery 68 (gap between wages of
high school dropouts and better trained workers increasing);
U.S. Dept. of Labor 41 (1981) (job openings for dropouts
declining over time). There is evidence that "service,
manufacturing or construction jobs are being displaced by
technology that requires a better-educated worker or, more
likely, are being exported overseas," Gordon, Ponticell, &
Morgan 26; that "workers with truly few skills by the year 2000
will find that only one job out of ten will remain," ibid.; and
that
        "[o]ver the long haul the best way to encourage the
growth of high-wage jobs is to upgrade the skills of the work
force. . . . [B]etter-trained workers become more productive
workers, enabling a company to become more competitive and
expand." Henkoff 60.
        Increasing global competition also has made primary and
secondary education economically more important. The portion of
the American economy attributable to international trade nearly
tripled between 1950 and 1980, and more than 70 percent of
American-made goods now compete with imports. Marshall 205;
Marshall & Tucker 33. Yet, lagging worker productivity has
contributed to negative trade balances and to real hourly
compensation that has fallen below wages in 10 other
industrialized nations. See National Center 57; Handbook of
Labor Statistics 561, 576 (1989); Neef & Kask 28, 31. At least
some significant part of this serious productivity problem is
attributable to students who emerge from classrooms without the
reading or mathematical skills necessary to compete with their
European or Asian counterparts, see, e.g., MIT 28, and,
presumably, to high school dropout rates of 20 to 25 percent (up
to 50 percent in inner cities), see, e.g., National Center 47;
Chubb & Hanushek 215. Indeed, Congress has said, when writing
other statutes, that "functionally or technologically
illiterate" Americans in the work force "erod[e]" our economic
"standing in the international marketplace," Pub. L. 100-418, 
6002(a)(3), 102 Stat. 1469, and that "our Nation is . . . paying
the price of scientific and technological illiteracy, with our
productivity declining, our industrial base ailing, and our
global competitiveness dwindling." H. R. Rep. No. 98-6, pt. 1,
p. 19 (1983).
        Finally, there is evidence that, today more than ever,
many firms base their location decisions upon the presence, or
absence, of a work force with a basic education. See MacCormack,
Newman, & Rosenfield 73; Coffee 296. Scholars on the subject
report, for example, that today, "[h]igh speed communication and
transportation make it possible to produce most products and
services anywhere in the world," National Center 38; that
"[m]odern machinery and production methods can therefore be
combined with low wage workers to drive costs down," ibid.; that
managers can perform "'back office functions anywhere in the
world now,'" and say that if they "'can't get enough skilled
workers here'" they will "'move the skilled jobs out of the
country,'" id., at 41; with the consequence that "rich countries
need better education and retraining, to reduce the supply of
unskilled workers and to equip them with the skills they require
for tomorrow's jobs," Survey of Global Economy 37. In light of
this increased importance of education to individual firms, it
is no surprise that half of the Nation's manufacturers have
become involved with setting standards and shaping curricula for
local schools, Maturi 65-68, that 88 percent think this kind of
involvement is important, id., at 68, that more than 20 States
have recently passed educational reforms to attract new
business, Overman 61-62, and that business magazines have begun
to rank cities according to the quality of their schools, see
Boyle 24.
        The economic links I have just sketched seem fairly
obvious. Why then is it not equally obvious, in light of those
links, that a widespread, serious, and substantial physical
threat to teaching and learning also substantially threatens the
commerce to which that teaching and learning is inextricably
tied? That is to say, guns in the hands of six percent of inner
-city high school students and gun-related violence throughout a
city's schools must threaten the trade and commerce that those
schools support. The only question, then, is whether the latter
threat is (to use the majority's terminology) "substantial."
And, the evidence of (1) the extent of the gun-related violence
problem, see supra, at 5, (2) the extent of the resulting
negative effect on classroom learning, see supra, at 5-6, and
(3) the extent of the consequent negative commercial effects,
see supra, at 6-9, when taken together, indicate a threat to
trade and commerce that is "substantial." At the very least,
Congress could rationally have concluded that the links are
"substantial."
        Specifically, Congress could have found that gun-related
violence near the classroom poses a serious economic threat (1)
to consequently inadequately educated workers who must endure
low paying jobs, see, e.g., National Center 29, and (2) to
communities and businesses that might (in today's "information
society") otherwise gain, from a well-educated work force, an
important commercial advantage, see, e.g., Becker 10 (1992), of
a kind that location near a railhead or harbor provided in the
past. Congress might also have found these threats to be no
different in kind from other threats that this Court has found
within the commerce power, such as the threat that loan sharking
poses to the "funds" of "numerous localities," Perez v. United
States, 402 U.S., at 157, and that unfair labor practices pose
to instrumentalities of commerce, see Consolidated Edison Co. v.
NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 221-222 (1938). As I have pointed out,
supra, at 4, Congress has written that "the occurrence of
violent crime in school zones" has brought about a "decline in
the quality of education" that "has an adverse impact on
interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of the United
States." 18 U.S.C. A.  922(q)(1)(F), (G) (Nov. 1994 Supp.).
The violence-related facts, the educational facts, and the
economic facts, taken together, make this conclusion rational.
And, because under our case law, see supra, at 1-2; infra, at
15, the sufficiency of the constitutionally necessary Commerce
Clause link between a crime of violence and interstate commerce
turns simply upon size or degree, those same facts make the
statute constitutional.
        To hold this statute constitutional is not to
"obliterate" the "distinction of what is national and what is
local," ante, at 18 (citation omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted); nor is it to hold that the Commerce Clause permits the
Federal Government to "regulate any activity that it found was
related to the economic productivity of individual citizens," to
regulate "marriage, divorce, and child custody," or to regulate
any and all aspects of education. Ante, at 15-16. For one thing,
this statute is aimed at curbing a particularly acute threat to
the educational process-the possession (and use) of life
-threatening firearms in, or near, the classroom. The empirical
evidence that I have discussed above unmistakably documents the
special way in which guns and education are incompatible. See
supra, at 5-6. This Court has previously recognized the
singularly disruptive potential on interstate commerce that acts
of violence may have. See Perez, supra, at 156-157. For another
thing, the immediacy of the connection between education and the
national economic well-being is documented by scholars and
accepted by society at large in a way and to a degree that may
not hold true for other social institutions. It must surely be
the rare case, then, that a statute strikes at conduct that
(when considered in the abstract) seems so removed from
commerce, but which (practically speaking) has so significant an
impact upon commerce.
        In sum, a holding that the particular statute before us
falls within the commerce power would not expand the scope of
that Clause. Rather, it simply would apply pre-existing law to
changing economic circumstances. See Heart of Atlanta Motel,
Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 251 (1964). It would
recognize that, in today's economic world, gun-related violence
near the classroom makes a significant difference to our
economic, as well as our social, well-being. In accordance with
well-accepted precedent, such a holding would permit Congress
"to act in terms of economic . . . realities," would interpret
the commerce power as "an affirmative power commensurate with
the national needs," and would acknowledge that the "commerce
clause does not operate so as to render the nation powerless to
defend itself against economic forces that Congress decrees
inimical or destructive of the national economy." North American
Co. v. SEC, 327 U.S. 686, 705 (1946) (citing Swift & Co. v.
United States, 196 U.S., at 398 (Holmes, J.)).
        III
        The majority's holding-that  922 falls outside the scope
of the Commerce Clause-creates three serious legal problems.
First, the majority's holding runs contrary to modern Supreme
Court cases that have upheld congressional actions despite
connections to interstate or foreign commerce that are less
significant than the effect of school violence. In Perez v.
United States, supra, the Court held that the Commerce Clause
authorized a federal statute that makes it a crime to engage in
loan sharking ("[e]xtortionate credit transactions") at a local
level. The Court said that Congress may judge that such
transactions, "though purely intrastate, . . . affect interstate
commerce." 402 U.S., at 154 (emphasis added). Presumably,
Congress reasoned that threatening or using force, say with a
gun on a street corner, to collect a debt occurs sufficiently
often so that the activity (by helping organized crime) affects
commerce among the States. But, why then cannot Congress also
reason that the threat or use of force-the frequent consequence
of possessing a gun-in or near a school occurs sufficiently
often so that such activity (by inhibiting basic education)
affects commerce among the States? The negative impact upon the
national economy of an inability to teach basic skills seems no
smaller (nor less significant) than that of organized crime.
        In Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), this Court
upheld, as within the commerce power, a statute prohibiting
racial discrimination at local restaurants, in part because that
discrimination discouraged travel by African Americans and in
part because that discrimination affected purchases of food and
restaurant supplies from other States. See id., at 300; Heart of
Atlanta Motel, supra, at 274 (Black, J., concurring in McClung
and in Heart of Atlanta). In Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298
(1969), this Court found an effect on commerce caused by an
amusement park located several miles down a country road in the
middle of Alabama-because some customers (the Court assumed),
some food, 15 paddleboats, and a juke box had come from out of
State. See id., at 304-305, 308. In both of these cases, the
Court understood that the specific instance of discrimination
(at a local place of accommodation) was part of a general
practice that, considered as a whole, caused not only the most
serious human and social harm, but had nationally significant
economic dimensions as well. See McClung, supra, at 301; Daniel,
supra, at 307, n. 10. It is difficult to distinguish the case
before us, for the same critical elements are present.
Businesses are less likely to locate in communities where
violence plagues the classroom. Families will hesitate to move
to neighborhoods where students carry guns instead of books.
(Congress expressly found in 1994 that "parents may decline to
send their children to school" in certain areas "due to concern
about violent crime and gun violence." 18 U.S.C. A. 
922(q)(1)(E) (Nov. 1994 Supp.)). And (to look at the matter in
the most narrowly commercial manner), interstate publishers
therefore will sell fewer books and other firms will sell fewer
school supplies where the threat of violence disrupts learning.
Most importantly, like the local racial discrimination at issue
in McClung and Daniel, the local instances here, taken together
and considered as a whole, create a problem that causes serious
human and social harm, but also has nationally significant
economic dimensions.
        In Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), this Court
sustained the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of
1938 to wheat that Filburn grew and consumed on his own local
farm because, considered in its totality, (1) home-grown wheat
may be "induced by rising prices" to "flow into the market and
check price increases," and (2) even if it never actually enters
the market, home-grown wheat nonetheless "supplies a need of the
man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases
in the open market" and, in that sense, "competes with wheat in
commerce." Id., at 128. To find both of these effects on
commerce significant in amount, the Court had to give Congress
the benefit of the doubt. Why would the Court, to find a
significant (or "substantial") effect here, have to give
Congress any greater leeway? See also United States v. Women's
Sportswear Manufacturers Assn., 336 U.S. 460, 464 (1949) ("If it
is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter
how local the operation which applies the squeeze"); Mandeville
Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S., at
236 ("[I]t is enough that the individual activity when
multiplied into a general practice . . . contains a threat to
the interstate economy that requires preventative regulation").
        The second legal problem the Court creates comes from its
apparent belief that it can reconcile its holding with earlier
cases by making a critical distinction between "commercial" and
noncommercial "transaction[s]." Ante, at 12-13. That is to say,
the Court believes the Constitution would distinguish between
two local activities, each of which has an identical effect upon
interstate commerce, if one, but not the other, is "commercial"
in nature. As a general matter, this approach fails to heed this
Court's earlier warning not to turn "questions of the power of
Congress" upon "formula[s]" that would give
        "controlling force to nomenclature such as 'production'
and 'indirect' and foreclose consideration of the actual effects
of the activity in question upon interstate commerce." Wickard,
supra, at 120.
        See also United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 116-117
(1941) (overturning the Court's distinction between "production"
and "commerce" in the child labor case, Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247
U.S. 251, 271-272 (1918)); Swift & Co. v. United States, 196
U.S., at 398 (Holmes, J.) ("[C]ommerce among the States is not a
technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the
course of business"). Moreover, the majority's test is not
consistent with what the Court saw as the point of the cases
that the majority now characterizes. Although the majority today
attempts to categorize Perez, McClung, and Wickard as involving
intrastate "economic activity," ante, at 10-11, the Courts that
decided each of those cases did not focus upon the economic
nature of the activity regulated. Rather, they focused upon
whether that activity affected interstate or foreign commerce.
In fact, the Wickard Court expressly held that Wickard's
consumption of home grown wheat, "though it may not be regarded
as commerce," could nevertheless be regulated-"whatever its
nature"-so long as "it exerts a substantial economic effect on
interstate commerce." Wickard, supra, at 125 (emphasis added).
        More importantly, if a distinction between commercial and
noncommercial activities is to be made, this is not the case in
which to make it. The majority clearly cannot intend such a
distinction to focus narrowly on an act of gun possession
standing by itself, for such a reading could not be reconciled
with either the civil rights cases (McClung and Daniel) or
Perez-in each of those cases the specific transaction (the race
-based exclusion, the use of force) was not itself "commercial."
And, if the majority instead means to distinguish generally
among broad categories of activities, differentiating what is
educational from what is commercial, then, as a practical
matter, the line becomes almost impossible to draw. Schools that
teach reading, writing, mathematics, and related basic skills
serve both social and commercial purposes, and one cannot easily
separate the one from the other. American industry itself has
been, and is again, involved in teaching. See supra, at 6, 9.
When, and to what extent, does its involvement make education
commercial? Does the number of vocational classes that train
students directly for jobs make a difference? Does it matter if
the school is public or private, nonprofit or profit-seeking?
Does it matter if a city or State adopts a voucher plan that
pays private firms to run a school? Even if one were to ignore
these practical questions, why should there be a theoretical
distinction between education, when it significantly benefits
commerce, and environmental pollution, when it causes economic
harm? See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 452 U.S. 264 (1981).
        Regardless, if there is a principled distinction that
could work both here and in future cases, Congress (even in the
absence of vocational classes, industry involvement, and private
management) could rationally conclude that schools fall on the
commercial side of the line. In 1990, the year Congress enacted
the statute before us, primary and secondary schools spent $230
billion-that is, nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars-which
accounts for a significant portion of our $5.5 trillion Gross
Domestic Product for that year. See Statistical Abstract 147,
442 (1993). The business of schooling requires expenditure of
these funds on student transportation, food and custodial
services, books, and teachers' salaries. See U.S. Dept. of
Education 4, 7 (1993). And, these expenditures enable schools to
provide a valuable service-namely, to equip students with the
skills they need to survive in life and, more specifically, in
the workplace. Certainly, Congress has often analyzed school
expenditure as if it were a commercial investment, closely
analyzing whether schools are efficient, whether they justify
the significant resources they spend, and whether they can be
restructured to achieve greater returns. See, e.g., S. Rep. No.
100-222, p. 2 (1987) (federal school assistance is "a prudent
investment"); Senate Appropriations Committee Hearing (1994)
(private sector management of public schools); cf. Chubb & Moe
185-229 (school choice); Hanushek 85-122 (performance based
incentives for educators); Gibbs (decision in Hartford, Conn.,
to contract out public school system). Why could Congress, for
Commerce Clause purposes, not consider schools as roughly
analogous to commercial investments from which the Nation
derives the benefit of an educated work force?
        The third legal problem created by the Court's holding is
that it threatens legal uncertainty in an area of law that,
until this case, seemed reasonably well settled. Congress has
enacted many statutes (more than 100 sections of the United
States Code), including criminal statutes (at least 25
sections), that use the words "affecting commerce" to define
their scope, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  844 (destruction of
buildings used in activity affecting interstate commerce), and
other statutes that contain no jurisdictional language at all,
see, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  922(o)(1) (possession of machine guns).
Do these, or similar, statutes regulate noncommercial
activities? If so, would that alter the meaning of "affecting
commerce" in a jurisdictional element? Cf. United States v.
Staszcuk, 517 F.2d 53, 57-58 (CA7 1975) (en banc) (Stevens, J.)
(evaluation of Congress' intent "requires more than a
consideration of the consequences of the particular
transaction"). More importantly, in the absence of a
jurisdictional element, are the courts nevertheless to take
Wickard, 317 U.S., at 127-128, (and later similar cases) as
inapplicable, and to judge the effect of a single noncommercial
activity on interstate commerce without considering similar
instances of the forbidden conduct? However these questions are
eventually resolved, the legal uncertainty now created will
restrict Congress' ability to enact criminal laws aimed at
criminal behavior that, considered problem by problem rather
than instance by instance, seriously threatens the economic, as
well as social, well-being of Americans.
        IV
        In sum, to find this legislation within the scope of the
Commerce Clause would permit "Congress . . . to act in terms of
economic . . . realities." North American Co. v. SEC, 327 U.S.,
at 705 (citing Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S., at 398
(Holmes, J.)). It would interpret the Clause as this Court has
traditionally interpreted it, with the exception of one wrong
turn subsequently corrected. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at
195 (holding that the commerce power extends "to all the
external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns
which affect the States generally"); United States v. Darby, 312
U.S., at 116-117 ("The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v.
Dagenhart [the child labor case], was a departure from the
principles which have prevailed in the interpretation of the
Commerce Clause both before and since the decision . . . . It
should be and now is overruled"). Upholding this legislation
would do no more than simply recognize that Congress had a
"rational basis" for finding a significant connection between
guns in or near schools and (through their effect on education)
the interstate and foreign commerce they threaten. For these
reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Respectfully, I dissent.

distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial
or private school."  921(a)(25).

constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately
a judicial rather than a legislative question, and can be
settled finally only by this Court") (Black, J., concurring).

        FN3. Under our federal system, the "'States possess
primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.'"
Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. ___, ___ (1993) (slip op., at 14)
(quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 128 (1982)); see also
Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 109 (1945) (plurality
opinion) ("Our national government is one of delegated powers
alone. Under our federal system the administration of criminal
justice rests with the States except as Congress, acting within
the scope of those delegated powers, has created offenses
against the United States"). When Congress criminalizes conduct
already denounced as criminal by the States, it effects a
"'change in the sensitive relation between federal and state
criminal jurisdiction.'" United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396,
411-412 (1973) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349
(1971)). The Government acknowledges that  922(q) "displace[s]
state policy choices in . . . that its prohibitions apply even
in States that have chosen not to outlaw the conduct in
question." Brief for United States 29, n. 18; see also Statement
of President George Bush on Signing the Crime Control Act of
1990, 26 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1944, 1945 (Nov. 29, 1990)
("Most egregiously, section [922(q)] inappropriately overrides
legitimate state firearms laws with a new and unnecessary
Federal law. The policies reflected in these provisions could
legitimately be adopted by the States, but they should not be
imposed upon the States by Congress").
      
        FN4. We note that on September 13, 1994, President
Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796.
Section 320904 of that Act, id., at 2125, amends  922(q) to
include congressional findings regarding the effects of firearm
possession in and around schools upon interstate and foreign
commerce. The Government does not rely upon these subsequent
findings as a substitute for the absence of findings in the
first instance. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25 ("[W]e're not relying on
them in the strict sense of the word, but we think that at a
very minimum they indicate that reasons can be identified for
why Congress wanted to regulate this particular activity").
      
        FN5. All references to The Federalist are to the Jacob E.
Cooke 1961 edition.
      
        FN6. Even to speak of "the Commerce Clause" perhaps
obscures the actual scope of that Clause. As an original matter,
Congress did not have authority to regulate all commerce;
Congress could only "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and
among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." U.S.
Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 3. Although the precise line between
interstate/foreign commerce and purely intrastate commerce was
hard to draw, the Court attempted to adhere to such a line for
the first 150 years of our Nation. See infra, at ___.
      
        FN7. There are other powers granted to Congress outside
of Art. I,  8 that may become wholly superfluous as well due to
our distortion of the Commerce Clause. For instance, Congress
has plenary power over the District of Columbia and the
territories. See U.S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 15 and Art. IV, 
3, cl. 2. The grant of comprehensive legislative power over
certain areas of the Nation, when read in conjunction with the
rest of the Constitution, further confirms that Congress was not
ceded plenary authority over the whole Nation.
      
        FN8. Cf. 3 Debates 40 (E. Pendleton at the Virginia
convention) (the proposed Federal Government "does not
intermeddle with the local, particular affairs of the states.
Can Congress legislate for the state of Virginia? Can [it] make
a law altering the form of transferring property, or the rule of
descents, in Virginia?"); id., at 553 (J. Marshall at the
Virginia convention) (denying that Congress could make "laws
affecting the mode of transferring property, or contracts, or
claims, between citizens of the same state"); The Federalist No.
33, at 206 (A. Hamilton) (denying that Congress could change
laws of descent or could pre-empt a land tax); A Native of
Virginia: Observations upon the Proposed Plan of Federal
Government, Apr. 2, 1788, in 9 Documentary History 692 (States
have sole authority over "rules of property").
      
        FN9. None of the other Commerce Clause opinions during
Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, which concerned the "dormant"
Commerce Clause, even suggested that Congress had authority over
all matters substantially affecting commerce. See Brown v.
Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 (1827); Willson v. Black Bird Creek
Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829).
      
        FN10. It is worth noting that Congress, in the first
federal criminal Act, did not establish nationwide prohibitions
against murder and the like. See Act of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1
Stat. 112. To be sure, Congress outlawed murder, manslaughter,
maiming, and larceny, but only when those acts were either
committed on United States territory not part of a State or on
the high seas. Ibid. See U.S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 10
(authorizing Congress to outlaw piracy and felonies on high
seas); Art. IV,  3, cl. 2 (plenary authority over United States
territory and property). When Congress did enact nationwide
criminal laws, it acted pursuant to direct grants of authority
found in the Constitution. Compare Act of April 30, 1790, supra,
 1 and 14 (prohibitions against treason and the counterfeiting
of U.S. securities) with U.S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 6
(counterfeiting); Art. III,  3, cl. 2 (treason).

Notwithstanding any substantial effects that murder, kidnaping,
or gun possession might have had on interstate commerce,
Congress understood that it could not establish nationwide
prohibitions.
        Likewise, there were no laws in the early Congresses that
regulated manufacturing and agriculture. Nor was there any
statute which purported to regulate activities with "substantial
effects" on interstate commerce.
      
        FN11. To be sure, congressional power pursuant to the
Commerce Clause was alternatively described less narrowly or
more narrowly during this 150-year period. Compare United States
v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 78 (1838) (commerce power "extends to
such acts, done on land, which interfere with, obstruct, or
prevent the due exercise of the power to regulate [interstate
and international] commerce" such as stealing goods from a
beached ship) with United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S.
1, 13 (1895) ("Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be
transported among the several States, the transportation and its
instrumentalities . . . may be regulated, but this is because
they form part of interstate trade or commerce"). During this
period, however, this Court never held that Congress could
regulate everything that substantially affects commerce.

        FN12. Although I might be willing to return to the
original understanding, I recognize that many believe that it is
too late in the day to undertake a fundamental reexamination of
the past 60 years. Consideration of stare decisis and reliance
interests may convince us that we cannot wipe the slate clean.
      
        FN13. Nor can the majority's opinion fairly be compared to
Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905). See post, at 1-7
(Souter, J., dissenting). Unlike Lochner and our more recent
"substantive due process" cases, today's decision enforces only
the Constitution and not "judicial policy judgments." See post,
at 5. Notwithstanding Justice Souter's discussion, "'commercial'
character'" is not only a natural but an inevitable "ground of
Commerce Clause distinction." See post, at 6 (emphasis added).
Our invalidation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act therefore
falls comfortably within our proper role in reviewing federal
legislation to determine if it exceeds congressional authority
as defined by the Constitution itself. As John Marshall put it:
"If [Congress] were to make a law not warranted by any of the
powers enumerated, it would be considered by the judges as an
infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard . . . .
They would declare it void." 3 Debates 553 (before the Virginia
ratifying convention); see also The Federalist No. 44, at 305
(James Madison) (asserting that if Congress exercises powers
"not warranted by [the Constitution's] true meaning" the
judiciary will defend the Constitution); id., No. 78, at 526 (A.
Hamilton) (asserting that the "courts of justice are to be
considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against
legislative encroachments"). Where, as here, there is a case or
controversy, there can be no "misstep", post, at 13, in
enforcing the Constitution.
      
        FN14. In this case, no question has been raised about
means and ends; the only issue is about the effect of school
zone guns on commerce.
      
        FN15. Unlike the Court, (perhaps), I would see no reason
not to consider Congress's findings, insofar as they might be
helpful in reviewing the challenge to this statute, even though
adopted in later legislation. See the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322,  320904, 108
Stat. 2125 ("[T]he occurrence of violent crime in school zones
has resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our
country; . . . this decline . . . has an adverse impact on
interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of the United
States; . . . Congress has power, under the interstate commerce
clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact
measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's
schools by enactment of this subsection"). The findings,
however, go no further than expressing what is obviously
implicit in the substantive legislation, at such a conclusory
level of generality as to add virtually nothing to the record.
The Solicitor General certainly exercisedsound judgment in
placing no significant reliance on these particular
afterthoughts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-25.

Argued April 17, 1995
Decided June 29, 1995

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYLLABUS
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As relevant here, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA or Act)
makes it unlawful for any person to "take" endangered or
threatened species,  9(a)(1)(B), and defines "take" to mean to
"harass, harm, pursue," "wound," or "kill,"  3(19). In 50 CFR 
17.3, petitioner Secretary of the Interior further defines "harm"
to include "significant habitat modification or degradation where
it actually kills or injures wildlife." Respondents, persons and
entities dependent on the forest products industries and others,
challenged this regulation on its face, claiming that Congress did
not intend the word "take" to include habitat modification. The
District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but the Court
of Appeals ultimately reversed. Invoking the noscitur a sociis
canon of statutory construction, which holds that a word is known
by the company it keeps, the court concluded that "harm," like the
other words in the definition of "take," should be read as
applying only to the perpetrator's direct application of force
against the animal taken.


Held: The Secretary reasonably construed Congress' intent when he
defined "harm" to include habitat modification. Pp. 7-21.


(a) The Act provides three reasons for preferring the Secretary's
interpretation. First, the ordinary meaning of "harm" naturally
encompasses habitat modification that results in actual injury or
death to members of an endangered or threatened species. Unless
"harm" encompasses indirect as well as direct injuries, the word
has no meaning that does not duplicate that of other words that 
3 uses to define "take." Second, the ESA's broad purpose of
providing comprehensive protection for endangered and threatened
species supports the reasonableness of the Secretary's definition.
Respondents advance strong arguments that activities causing
minimal or unforseeable harm will not violate the Act as construed
in the regulation, but their facial challenge would require that
the Secretary's understanding of harm be invalidated in every
circumstance. Third, the fact that Congress in 1982 authorized the
Secretary to issue permits for takings that  9(a)(1)(B) would
otherwise prohibit, "if such taking is incidental to, and not for
the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity,"
 10(a)(1)(B), strongly suggests that Congress understood  9 to
prohibit indirect as well as deliberate takings. No one could
seriously request an "incidental" take permit to avert  9
liability for direct, deliberate action against a member of an
endangered or threatened species. Pp. 7-13.


(b) The Court of Appeals made three errors in finding that "harm"
must refer to a direct application of force because the words
around it do. First, the court's premise was flawed. Several of
the words accompanying "harm" in  3's definition of "take" refer
to actions or effects that do not require direct applications of
force. Second, to the extent that it read an intent or purpose
requirement into the definition of "take," it ignored  9's
express provision that a "knowing" action is enough to violate the
Act. Third, the court employed noscitur a sociis to give "harm"
essentially the same function as other words in the definition,
thereby denying it independent meaning. Pp. 13-14.


(c) The Act's inclusion of land acquisition authority,  5, and a
directive to federal agencies to avoid destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat,  7, does not alter the
conclusion reached in this case. Respondents' argument that the
Government lacks any incentive to purchase land under  5 when it
can simply prohibit takings under  9 ignores the practical
considerations that purchasing habitat lands may be less expensive
than pursuing criminal or civil penalties and that  5 allows for
protection of habitat before any endangered animal has been
harmed, whereas  9 cannot be enforced until a killing or injury
has occurred. Section 7's directive applies only to the Federal
Government, whereas  9 applies to "any person." Pp. 14-15.


(d) The conclusion reached here gains further support from the
statute's legislative history. Pp. 16-20.


17 F. 3d 1463, reversed.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: OPINION
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.


The Endangered Species Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 884, 16 U.S.C.   1531
(1988 ed. and Supp. V) (ESA or Act), contains a variety of
protections designed to save from extinction species that the
Secretary of the Interior designates as endangered or threatened.
Section 9 of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to "take"
any endangered or threatened species. The Secretary has
promulgated a regulation that defines the statute's prohibition on
takings to include "significant habitat modification or
degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife." This
case presents the question whether the Secretary exceeded his
authority under the Act by promulgating that regulation.


I


Section 9(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act provides the
following protection for endangered species:[FOOTNOTE 1]


"Except as provided in sections 1535(g)(2) and 1539 of this title,
with respect to any endangered species of fish or wildlife listed
pursuant to section 1533 of this title it is unlawful for any
person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to-




"(B) take any such species within the United States or the
territorial sea of the United States[.]" 16 U.S.C.   1538(a)(1).


Section 3(19) of the Act defines the statutory term "take":


"The term 'take' means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot,
wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in
any such conduct." 16 U.S.C.   1532(19).


The Act does not further define the terms it uses to define
"take." The Interior Department regulations that implement the
statute, however, define the statutory term "harm":


"Harm in the definition of 'take' in the Act means an act which
actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include
significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually
kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential
behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering."
50 CFR   17.3 (1994).


This regulation has been in place since 1975.[FOOTNOTE 2]


A limitation on the   9 "take" prohibition appears in 
10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, which Congress added by amendment in 1982.
That section authorizes the Secretary to grant a permit for any
taking otherwise prohibited by   9(a)(1)(B) "if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an
otherwise lawful activity." 16 U.S.C.   1539(a)(1)(B).


In addition to the prohibition on takings, the Act provides
several other protections for endangered species. Section 4, 16
U.S.C.   1533, commands the Secretary to identify species of fish
or wildlife that are in danger of extinction and to publish from
time to time lists of all species he determines to be endangered
or threatened. Section 5, 16 U.S.C.   1534, authorizes the
Secretary, in cooperation with the States, see 16 U.S.C.   1535,
to acquire land to aid in preserving such species. Section 7
requires federal agencies to ensure that none of their activities,
including the granting of licenses and permits, will jeopardize
the continued existence of endangered species "or result in the
destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species
which is determined by the Secretary . . . to be critical." 16
U.S.C.   1536(a)(2).


Respondents in this action are small landowners, logging
companies, and families dependent on the forest products
industries in the Pacific Northwest and in the Southeast, and
organizations that represent their interests. They brought this
declaratory judgment action against petitioners, the Secretary of
the Interior and the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, in
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to
challenge the statutory validity of the Secretary's regulation
defining "harm," particularly the inclusion of habitat
modification and degradation in the definition.[FOOTNOTE 3]
Respondents challenged the regulation on its face. Their complaint
alleged that application of the "harm" regulation to the
red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species,[FOOTNOTE 4] and
the northern spotted owl, a threatened species,[FOOTNOTE 5] had
injured them economically. App. 17-23.


Respondents advanced three arguments to support their submission
that Congress did not intend the word "take" in   9 to include
habitat modification, as the Secretary's "harm" regulation
provides. First, they correctly noted that language in the
Senate's original version of the ESA would have defined "take" to
include "destruction, modification, or curtailment of [the]
habitat or range" of fish or wildlife,[FOOTNOTE 6] but the Senate
deleted that language from the bill before enacting it. Second,
respondents argued that Congress intended the Act's express
authorization for the Federal Government to buy private land in
order to prevent habitat degradation in   5 to be the exclusive
check against habitat modification on private property. Third,
because the Senate added the term "harm" to the definition of
"take" in a floor amendment without debate, respondents argued
that the court should not interpret the term so expansively as to
include habitat modification.


The District Court considered and rejected each of respondents'
arguments, finding "that Congress intended an expansive
interpretation of the word 'take,' an interpretation that
encompasses habitat modification." 806 F.Supp. 279, 285 (1992).
The court noted that in 1982, when Congress was aware of a
judicial decision that had applied the Secretary's regulation, see
Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, 639 F.2d 495
(CA9 1981) (Palila I), it amended the Act without using the
opportunity to change the definition of "take." 806 F.Supp., at
284. The court stated that, even had it found the ESA "'silent or
ambiguous'" as to the authority for the Secretary's definition of
"harm," it would nevertheless have upheld the regulation as a
reasonable interpretation of the statute. Id., at 285 (quoting
Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)). The District Court therefore entered
summary judgment for petitioners and dismissed respondents'
complaint.


A divided panel of the Court of Appeals initially affirmed the
judgment of the District Court. 1 F.3d 1 (CADC 1993). After
granting a petition for rehearing, however, the panel reversed. 17
F.3d 1463 (CADC 1994). Although acknowledging that "[t]he
potential breadth of the word 'harm' is indisputable," id., at
1464, the majority concluded that the immediate statutory context
in which "harm" appeared counseled against a broad reading; like
the other words in the definition of "take," the word "harm"
should be read as applying only to "the perpetrator's direct
application of force against the animal taken . . . . The
forbidden acts fit, in ordinary language, the basic model 'A hit
B.'" Id., at 1465. The majority based its reasoning on a canon of
statutory construction called noscitur a sociis, which holds that
a word is known by the company it keeps. See Neal v. Clark, 95
U.S. 704, 708-709 (1878).


The majority claimed support for its construction from a decision
of the Ninth Circuit that narrowly construed the word "harass" in
the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C.   1372(a)(2)(A), see
United States v. Hayashi, 5 F.3d 1278, 1282 (1993); from the
legislative history of the ESA;[FOOTNOTE 7] from its view that
Congress must not have intended the purportedly broad curtailment
of private property rights that the Secretary's interpretation
permitted; and from the ESA's land acquisition provision in   5
and restriction on federal agencies' activities regarding habitat
in   7, both of which the court saw as evidence that Congress had
not intended the   9 "take" prohibition to reach habitat
modification. Most prominently, the court performed a lengthy
analysis of the 1982 amendment to   10 that provided for
"incidental take permits" and concluded that the amendment did not
change the meaning of the term "take" as defined in the 1973
statute.[FOOTNOTE 8]


Chief Judge Mikva, who had announced the panel's original
decision, dissented. See 17 F.3d, at 1473. In his view, a proper
application of Chevron indicated that the Secretary had reasonably
defined "harm," because respondents had failed to show that
Congress unambiguously manifested its intent to exclude habitat
modification from the ambit of "take." Chief Judge Mikva found the
majority's reliance on noscitur a sociis inappropriate in light of
the statutory language and unnecessary in light of the strong
support in the legislative history for the Secretary's
interpretation. He did not find the 1982 "incidental take permit"
amendment alone sufficient to vindicate the Secretary's definition
of "harm," but he believed the amendment provided additional
support for that definition because it reflected Congress' view in
1982 that the definition was reasonable.


The Court of Appeals' decision created a square conflict with a
1988 decision of the Ninth Circuit that had upheld the Secretary's
definition of "harm." See Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land and
Natural Resources, 852 F.2d 1106 (1988) (Palila II). The Court of
Appeals neither cited nor distinguished Palila II, despite the
stark contrast between the Ninth Circuit's holding and its own. We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 513 U.S. ___ (1995).
Our consideration of the text and structure of the Act, its
legislative history, and the significance of the 1982 amendment
persuades us that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be
reversed.


II


Because this case was decided on motions for summary judgment, we
may appropriately make certain factual assumptions in order to
frame the legal issue. First, we assume respondents have no desire
to harm either the red-cockaded woodpecker or the spotted owl;
they merely wish to continue logging activities that would be
entirely proper if not prohibited by the ESA. On the other hand,
we must assume arguendo that those activities will have the
effect, even though unintended, of detrimentally changing the
natural habitat of both listed species and that, as a consequence,
members of those species will be killed or injured. Under
respondents' view of the law, the Secretary's only means of
forestalling that grave result-even when the actor knows it is
certain to occur[FOOTNOTE 9]-is to use his   5 authority to
purchase the lands on which the survival of the species depends.
The Secretary, on the other hand, submits that the   9 prohibition
on takings, which Congress defined to include "harm," places on
respondents a duty to avoid harm that habitat alteration will
cause the birds unless respondents first obtain a permit pursuant
to   10.


The text of the Act provides three reasons for concluding that the
Secretary's interpretation is reasonable. First, an ordinary
understanding of the word "harm" supports it. The dictionary
definition of the verb form of "harm" is "to cause hurt or damage
to: injure." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1034
(1966). In the context of the ESA, that definition naturally
encompasses habitat modification that results in actual injury or
death to members of an endangered or threatened species.


Respondents argue that the Secretary should have limited the
purview of "harm" to direct applications of force against
protected species, but the dictionary definition does not include
the word "directly" or suggest in any way that only direct or
willful action that leads to injury constitutes "harm."[FOOTNOTE
10] Moreover, unless the statutory term "harm" encompasses
indirect as well as direct injuries, the word has no meaning that
does not duplicate the meaning of other words that   3 uses to
define "take." A reluctance to treat statutory terms as surplusage
supports the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation.
See, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486
U.S. 825, 837, and n. 11 (1988).[FOOTNOTE 11]


Second, the broad purpose of the ESA supports the Secretary's
decision to extend protection against activities that cause the
precise harms Congress enacted the statute to avoid. In TVA v.
Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), we described the Act as "the most
comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered
species ever enacted by any nation." Id., at 180. Whereas
predecessor statutes enacted in 1966 and 1969 had not contained
any sweeping prohibition against the taking of endangered species
except on federal lands, see id., at 175, the 1973 Act applied to
all land in the United States and to the Nation's territorial
seas. As stated in   2 of the Act, among its central purposes is
"to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered
species and threatened species depend may be conserved . . . ." 16
U.S.C.   1531(b).


In Hill, we construed   7 as precluding the completion of the
Tellico Dam because of its predicted impact on the survival of the
snail darter. See 437 U.S., at 193. Both our holding and the
language in our opinion stressed the importance of the statutory
policy. "The plain intent of Congress in enacting this statute,"
we recognized, "was to halt and reverse the trend toward species
extinction, whatever the cost. This is reflected not only in the
stated policies of the Act, but in literally every section of the
statute." Id., at 184 Several of the words that accompany "harm"
in the   3 definition of "take," especially "harass," "pursue,"
"wound," and "kill," refer to actions or effects that do not
require direct applications of force. Second, to the extent the
court read a requirement of intent or purpose into the words used
to define "take," it ignored   9's express provision that a
"knowing" action is enough to violate the Act. Third, the court
employed noscitur a sociis to give "harm" essentially the same
function as other words in the definition, thereby denying it
independent meaning. The canon, to the contrary, counsels that a
word "gathers meaning from the words around it." Jarecki v. G. D.
Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961). The statutory context of
"harm" suggests that Congress meant that term to serve a
particular function in the ESA, consistent with but distinct from
the functions of the other verbs used to define "take." The
Secretary's interpretation of "harm" to include indirectly
injuring endangered animals through habitat modification
permissibly interprets "harm" to have "a character of its own not
to be submerged by its association." Russell Motor Car Co. v.
United States, 261 U.S. 514, 519 (1923).[FOOTNOTE 16]


Nor does the Act's inclusion of the   5 land acquisition authority
and the   7 directive to federal agencies to avoid destruction or
adverse modification of critical habitat alter our conclusion.
Respondents' argument that the Government lacks any incentive to
purchase land under   5 when it can simply prohibit takings under
 9 ignores the practical considerations that attend enforcement of
the ESA. Purchasing habitat lands may well cost the Government
less in many circumstances than pursuing civil or criminal
penalties. In addition, the   5 procedure allows for protection of
habitat before the seller's activity has harmed any endangered
animal, whereas the Government cannot enforce the   9 prohibition
until an animal has actually been killed or injured. The Secretary
may also find the   5 authority useful for preventing modification
of land that is not yet but may in the future become habitat for
an endangered or threatened species. The   7 directive applies
only to the Federal Government, whereas the   9 prohibition
applies to "any person." Section 7 imposes a broad, affirmative
duty to avoid adverse habitat modifications that   9 does not
replicate, and   7 does not limit its admonition to habitat
modification that "actually kills or injures wildlife."
Conversely,   7 contains limitations that   9 does not, applying
only to actions "likely to jeopardize the continued existence of
any endangered species or threatened species," 16 U.S.C. 
1536(a)(2), and to modifications of habitat that has been
designated "critical" pursuant to   4, 16 U.S.C. 
1533(b)(2).[FOOTNOTE 17] Any overlap that   5 or   7 may have with
  9 in particular cases is unexceptional, see, e.g., Russello v.
United States, 464 U.S. 16, 24, and n. 2 (1983), and simply
reflects the broad purpose of the Act set out in   2 and
acknowledged in TVA v. Hill.


We need not decide whether the statutory definition of "take"
compels the Secretary's interpretation of "harm," because our
conclusions that Congress did not unambiguously manifest its
intent to adopt respondents' view and that the Secretary's
interpretation is reasonable suffice to decide this case. See
generally Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The latitude the ESA gives the
Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of
regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes
that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretary's reasonable
interpretation. See Breyer, Judicial Review of Questions of Law
and Policy, 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363, 373 (1986).[FOOTNOTE 18]


III


Our conclusion that the Secretary's definition of "harm" rests on
a permissible construction of the ESA gains further support from
the legislative history of the statute. The Committee Reports
accompanying the bills that became the ESA do not specifically
discuss the meaning of "harm," but they make clear that Congress
intended "take" to apply broadly to cover indirect as well as
purposeful actions. The Senate Report stressed that "'[t]ake' is
defined . . . in the broadest possible manner to include every
conceivable way in which a person can 'take' or attempt to 'take'
any fish or wildlife." S. Rep. No. 93-307, p. 7 (1973). The House
Report stated that "the broadest possible terms" were used to
define restrictions on takings. H. R. Rep. No. 93-412, p. 15
(1973). The House Report underscored the breadth of the "take"
definition by noting that it included "harassment, whether
intentional or not." Id., at 11 (emphasis added). The Report
explained that the definition "would allow, for example, the
Secretary to regulate or prohibit the activities of birdwatchers
where the effect of those activities might disturb the birds and
make it difficult for them to hatch or raise their young." Ibid.
These comments, ignored in the dissent's welcome but selective
foray into legislative history, see post, at 14-16, support the
Secretary's interpretation that the term "take" in   9 reached far
more than the deliberate actions of hunters and trappers.


Two endangered species bills, S. 1592 and S. 1983, were introduced
in the Senate and referred to the Commerce Committee. Neither bill
included the word "harm" in its definition of "take," although the
definitions otherwise closely resembled the one that appeared in
the bill as ultimately enacted. See Hearings on S. 1592 and S.
1983 before the Subcommittee on Environment of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7, 27 (1973)
(hereinafter Hearings). Senator Tunney, the floor manager of the
bill in the Senate, subsequently introduced a floor amendment that
added "harm" to the definition, noting that this and accompanying
amendments would "help to achieve the purposes of the bill." 119
Cong. Rec. 25683 (July 24, 1973). Respondents argue that the lack
of debate about the amendment that added "harm" counsels in favor
of a narrow interpretation. We disagree. An obviously broad word
that the Senate went out of its way to add to an important
statutory definition is precisely the sort of provision that
deserves a respectful reading.


The definition of "take" that originally appeared in S. 1983
differed from the definition as ultimately enacted in one other
significant respect: It included "the destruction, modification,
or curtailment of [the] habitat or range" of fish and wildlife.
Hearings, at 27. Respondents make much of the fact that the
Commerce Committee removed this phrase from the "take" definition
before S. 1983 went to the floor. See 119 Cong. Rec. 25663 (1973).
We do not find that fact especially significant. The legislative
materials contain no indication why the habitat protection
provision was deleted. That provision differed greatly from the
regulation at issue today. Most notably, the habitat protection in
S. 1983 would have applied far more broadly than the regulation
does because it made adverse habitat modification a categorical
violation of the "take" prohibition, unbounded by the regulation's
limitation to habitat modifications that actually kill or injure
wildlife. The S. 1983 language also failed to qualify
"modification" with the regulation's limiting adjective
"significant." We do not believe the Senate's unelaborated
disavowal of the provision in S. 1983 undermines the
reasonableness of the more moderate habitat protection in the
Secretary's "harm" regulation.[FOOTNOTE 19]


The history of the 1982 amendment that gave the Secretary
authority to grant permits for "incidental" takings provides
further support for his reading of the Act. The House Report
expressly states that "[b]y use of the word 'incidental' the
Committee intends to cover situations in which it is known that a
taking will occur if the other activity is engaged in but such
taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the activity." H.
R. Rep. No. 97-567, p. 31 (1982). This reference to the
foreseeability of incidental takings undermines respondents'
argument that the 1982 amendment covered only accidental killings
of endangered and threatened animals that might occur in the
course of hunting or trapping other animals. Indeed, Congress had
habitat modification directly in mind: both the Senate Report and
the House Conference Report identified as the model for the permit
process a cooperative state-federal response to a case in
California where a development project threatened incidental harm
to a species of endangered butterfly by modification of its
habitat. See S. Rep. No. 97-418, p. 10 (1982); H. R. Conf. Rep.
No. 97-835, pp. 30-32 (1982). Thus, Congress in 1982 focused
squarely on the aspect of the "harm" regulation at issue in this
litigation. Congress' implementation of a permit program is
consistent with the Secretary's interpretation of the term "harm."


IV


When it enacted the ESA, Congress delegated broad administrative
and interpretive power to the Secretary. See 16 U.S.C.    1533,
1540(f). The task of defining and listing endangered and
threatened species requires an expertise and attention to detail
that exceeds the normal province of Congress. Fashioning
appropriate standards for issuing permits under   10 for takings
that would otherwise violate   9 necessarily requires the exercise
of broad discretion. The proper interpretation of a term such as
"harm" involves a complex policy choice. When Congress has
entrusted the Secretary with broad discretion, we are especially
reluctant to substitute our views of wise policy for his. See
Chevron, 467 U.S., at 865-866. In this case, that reluctance
accords with our conclusion, based on the text, structure, and
legislative history of the ESA, that the Secretary reasonably
construed the intent of Congress when he defined "harm" to include
"significant habitat modification or degradation that actually
kills or injures wildlife."


In the elaboration and enforcement of the ESA, the Secretary and
all persons who must comply with the law will confront difficult
questions of proximity and degree; for, as all recognize, the Act
encompasses a vast range of economic and social enterprises and
endeavors. These questions must be addressed in the usual course
of the law, through case-by-case resolution and adjudication.


The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.


It is so ordered.








JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring.


My agreement with the Court is founded on two understandings.
First, the challenged regulation is limited to significant habitat
modification that causes actual, as opposed to hypothetical or
speculative, death or injury to identifiable protected animals.
Second, even setting aside difficult questions of scienter, the
regulation's application is limited by ordinary principles of
proximate causation, which introduce notions of foreseeability.
These limitations, in my view, call into question Palila v. Hawaii
Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, 852 F.2d 1106 (CA9 1988)
(Palila II), and with it, many of the applications derided by the
dissent. Because there is no need to strike a regulation on a
facial challenge out of concern that it is susceptible of
erroneous application, however, and because there are many
habitat-related circumstances in which the regulation might
validly apply, I join the opinion of the Court.


In my view, the regulation is limited by its terms to actions that
actually kill or injure individual animals. Justice Scalia
disagrees, arguing that the harm regulation "encompasses injury
inflicted, not only upon individual animals, but upon populations
of the protected species." Post, at 4-5. At one level, I could not
reasonably quarrel with this observation; death to an individual
animal always reduces the size of the population in which it
lives, and in that sense, "injures" that population. But by its
insight, the dissent means something else. Building upon the
regulation's use of the word "breeding," Justice Scalia suggests
that the regulation facially bars significant habitat modification
that actually kills or injures hypothetical animals (or, perhaps
more aptly, causes potential additions to the population not to
come into being). Because "[i]mpairment of breeding does not
'injure' living creatures," Justice Scalia reasons, the regulation
must contemplate application to "a population of animals which
would otherwise have maintained or increased its numbers." Post,
at 5, 22.


I disagree. As an initial matter, I do not find it as easy as
Justice Scalia does to dismiss the notion that significant
impairment of breeding injures living creatures. To raze the last
remaining ground on which the piping plover currently breeds,
thereby making it impossible for any piping plovers to reproduce,
would obviously injure the population (causing the species'
extinction in a generation). But by completely preventing
breeding, it would also injure the individual living bird, in the
same way that sterilizing the creature injures the individual
living bird. To "injure" is, among other things, "to impair."
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 623 (1983). One need not
subscribe to theories of "psychic harm," cf. post, at 22, n. 5, to
recognize that to make it impossible for an animal to reproduce is
to impair its most essential physical functions and to render that
animal, and its genetic material, biologically obsolete. This, in
my view, is actual injury.


In any event, even if impairing an animal's ability to breed were
not, in and of itself, an injury to that animal, interference with
breeding can cause an animal to suffer other, perhaps more
obvious, kinds of injury. The regulation has clear application,
for example, to significant habitat modification that kills or
physically injures animals which, because they are in a vulnerable
breeding state, do not or cannot flee or defend themselves, or to
environmental pollutants that cause an animal to suffer physical
complications during gestation. Breeding, feeding, and sheltering
are what animals do. If significant habitat modification, by
interfering with these essential behaviors, actually kills or
injures an animal protected by the Act, it causes "harm" within
the meaning of the regulation. In contrast to Justice Scalia, I do
not read the regulation's "breeding" reference to vitiate or
somehow to qualify the clear actual death or injury requirement,
or to suggest that the regulation contemplates extension to
nonexistent animals.


There is no inconsistency, I should add, between this
interpretation and the commentary that accompanied the amendment
of the regulation to include the actual death or injury
requirement. See 46 Fed. Reg. atter how long the chain of
causality between modification and injury." Post, at 3-4; see also
post, at 10. Even if   1540(1) does create a strict liability
regime (a question we need not decide at this juncture), I see no
indication that Congress, in enacting that section, intended to
dispense with ordinary principles of proximate causation. Strict
liability means liability without regard to fault; it does not
normally mean liability for every consequence, however remote, of
one's conduct. See generally W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.
Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 559-560 (5th ed. 1984)
(describing "practical necessity for the restriction of liability
within some reasonable bounds" in the strict liability context). I
would not lightly assume that Congress, in enacting a strict
liability statute that is silent on the causation question, has
dispensed with this well-entrenched principle. In the absence of
congressional abrogation of traditional principles of causation,
then, private parties should be held liable under   1540(1) only
if their habitat-modifying actions proximately cause death or
injury to protected animals. Cf. Benefiel v. Exxon Corp., 959 F.2d
805, 807-808 (CA9 1992) (in enacting the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
Authorization Act, which provides for strict liability for damages
that are the result of discharges, Congress did not intend to
abrogate common-law principles of proximate cause to reach "remote
and derivative" consequences); New York v. Shore Realty Corp., 759
F.2d 1032, 1044, and n. 17 (CA2 1985) (noting that "[t]raditional
tort law has often imposed strict liability while recognizing a
causation defense," but that, in enacting CERCLA, Congress
"specifically rejected including a causation requirement"). The
regulation, of course, does not contradict the presumption or
notion that ordinary principles of causation apply here. Indeed,
by use of the word "actually," the regulation clearly rejects
speculative or conjectural effects, and thus itself invokes
principles of proximate causation.


Proximate causation is not a concept susceptible of precise
definition. See Keeton, supra, at 280-281. It is easy enough, of
course, to identify the extremes. The farmer whose fertilizer is
lifted by tornado from tilled fields and deposited miles away in a
wildlife refuge cannot, by any stretch of the term, be considered
the proximate cause of death or injury to protected species
occasioned thereby. At the same time, the landowner who drains a
pond on his property, killing endangered fish in the process,
would likely satisfy any formulation of the principle. We have
recently said that proximate causation "normally eliminates the
bizarre," Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock
Co., 513 U.S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 9), and have noted its
"functionally equivalent" alternative characterizations in terms
of foreseeability, see Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94
U.S. 469, 475 (1877) ("natural and probable consequence"), and
duty, see Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E.
99 (1928). Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. ___, ___
(1994) (slip op., at 13). Proximate causation depends to a great
extent on considerations of the fairness of imposing liability for
remote consequences. The task of determining whether proximate
causation exists in the limitless fact patterns sure to arise is
best left to lower courts. But I note, at the least, that
proximate cause principles inject a foreseeability element into
the statute, and hence, the regulation, that would appear to
alleviate some of the problems noted by the dissent. See, e. g.,
post, at 8 (describing "a farmer who tills his field and causes
erosion that makes silt run into a nearby river which depletes
oxygen and thereby [injures] protected fish").


In my view, then, the "harm" regulation applies where significant
habitat modification, by impairing essential behaviors,
proximately (foreseeably) causes actual death or injury to
identifiable animals that are protected under the Endangered
Species Act. Pursuant to my interpretation, Palila II--under which
the Court of Appeals held that a state agency committed a "taking"
by permitting feral sheep to eat mamane-naio seedlings that, when
full-grown, might have fed and sheltered endangered palila-was
wrongly decided according to the regulation's own terms.
Destruction of the seedlings did not proximately cause actual
death or injury to identifiable birds; it merely prevented the
regeneration of forest land not currently inhabited by actual
birds.


This case, of course, comes to us as a facial challenge. We are
charged with deciding whether the regulation on its face exceeds
the agency's statutory mandate. I have identified at least one
application of the regulation (Palila II) that is, in my view,
inconsistent with the regulation's own limitations. That
misapplication does not, however, call into question the validity
of the regulation itself. One can doubtless imagine questionable
applications of the regulation that test the limits of the
agency's authority. However, it seems to me clear that the
regulation does not on its terms exceed the agency's mandate, and
that the regulation has innumerable valid habitat-related
applications. Congress may, of course, see fit to revisit this
issue. And nothing the Court says today prevents the agency itself
from narrowing the scope of its regulation at a later date.


With this understanding, I join the Court's opinion.








JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS
join, dissenting.


I think it unmistakably clear that the legislation at issue here
(1) forbade the hunting and killing of endangered animals, and (2)
provided federal lands and federal funds for the acquisition of
private lands, to preserve the habitat of endangered animals. The
Court's holding that the hunting and killing prohibition
incidentally preserves habitat on private lands imposes unfairness
to the point of financial ruin-not just upon the rich, but upon
the simplest farmer who finds his land conscripted to national
zoological use. I respectfully dissent.


I


The Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C.   1531 et seq. (1988
ed. and Supp. V) (Act), provides that "it is unlawful for any
person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take
any [protected] species within the United States." 
1538(a)(1)(B). The term "take" is defined as "to harass, harm,
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to
attempt to engage in any such conduct."   1532(19) (emphasis
added). The challenged regulation defines "harm" thus:


"'Harm' in the definition of 'take' in the Act means an act which
actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include
significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually
kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential
behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering."
50 CFR   17.3 (1994).


In my view petitioners must lose-the regulation must fall-even
under the test of Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984), so I shall assume
that the Court is correct to apply Chevron. See ante, at 15-16,
and n. 18.


The regulation has three features which, for reasons I shall
discuss at length below, do not comport with the statute. First,
it interprets the statute to prohibit habitat modification that is
no more than the cause-in-fact of death or injury to wildlife. Any
"significant habitat modification" that in fact produces that
result by "impairing essential behavioral patterns" is made
unlawful, regardless of whether that result is intended or even
foreseeable, and no matter how long the chain of causality between
modification and injury. See, e.g., Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land
and Natural Resources (Palila II), 852 F.2d 1106, 1108-1109 (CA9
1988) (sheep grazing constituted "taking" of palila birds, since
although sheep do not destroy full-grown mamane trees, they do
destroy mamane seedlings, which will not grow to full-grown trees,
on which the palila feeds and nests). See also Davison, Alteration
of Wildlife Habitat as a Prohibited Taking under the Endangered
Species Act, 10 J. Land Use & Envtl. L. 155, 190 (1995)
(regulation requires only causation-in-fact).


Second, the regulation does not require an "act": the Secretary's
officially stated position is that an omission will do. The
previous version of the regulation made this explicit. See 40 Fed.
Reg. 44412, 44416 (1975) ("'Harm' in the definition of 'take' in
the Act means an act or omission which actually kills or injures
wildlife . . ."). When the regulation was modified in 1981 the
phrase "or omission" was taken out, but only because (as the final
publication of the rule advised) "the [Fish and Wildlife] Service
feels that 'act' is inclusive of either commissions or omissions
which would be prohibited by section [1538(a)(1)(B)]." 46 Fed.
Reg. 54748, 54750 (1981). In its brief here the Government agrees
that the regulation covers omissions, see Brief for Petitioners 47
(although it argues that "[a]n 'omission' constitutes an 'act' . .


The third and most important unlawful feature of the regulation is
that it encompasses injury inflicted, not only upon individual
animals, but upon populations of the protected species. "Injury"
in the regulation includes "significantly impairing essential
behavioral patterns, including breeding," 50 CFR   17.3 (1994)
(emphasis added). Impairment of breeding does not "injure" living
creatures; it prevents them from propagating, thus "injuring" a
population of animals which would otherwise have maintained or
increased its numbers. What the face of the regulation shows, the
Secretary's official pronouncements confirm. The Final
Redefinition of "Harm" accompanying publication of the regulation
said that "harm" is not limited to "direct physical injury to an
individual member of the wildlife species," 46 Fed. Reg. 54748
(1981), and refers to "injury to a population," id., at 54749
(emphasis added). See also Palila II, 852 F.2d, at 1108; Davison,
supra, at 190, and n. 177, 195; M. Bean, The Evolution of National
Wildlife Law 344 (1983).[FOOTNOTE 1]


None of these three features of the regulation can be found in the
statutory provisions supposed to authorize it. The term "harm" in
 1532(19) has no legal force of its own. An indictment or civil
complaint that charged the defendant with "harming" an animal
protected under the Act would be dismissed as defective, for the
only operative term in the statute is to "take." If "take" were
not elsewhere defined in the Act, none could dispute what it
means, for the term is as old as the law itself. To "take," when
applied to wild animals, means to reduce those animals, by killing
or capturing, to human control. See, e.g., 11 Oxford English
Dictionary (1933) ("Take . . . To catch, capture (a wild beast,
bird, fish, etc.)"); Webster's New International Dictionary of the
English Language (2d ed. 1949) (take defined as "to catch or
capture by trapping, snaring, etc., or as prey"); Geer v.
Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519, 523 (1896) ("[A]ll the animals which
can be taken upon the earth, in the sea, or in the air, that is to
say, wild animals, belong to those who take them") (quoting the
Digest of Justinian); 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 411 (1766)
("Every man . . . has an equal right of pursuing and taking to his
own use all such creatures as are ferae naturae"). This is just
the sense in which "take" is used elsewhere in federal legislation
and treaty. See, e.g., Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C.   703
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (no person may "pursue, hunt, take, capture,
kill, [or] attempt to take, capture, or kill" any migratory bird);
Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, Nov. 15, 1973, Art.
I, 27 U.S. T. 3918, 3921, T. I. A. S. No. 8409 (defining "taking"
as "hunting, killing and capturing"). And that meaning fits neatly
with the rest of   1538(a)(1), which makes it unlawful not only to
take protected species, but also to import or export them (
1538(a)(1)(A)); to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or
ship any taken species (  1538(a)(1)(D)); and to transport, sell,
or offer to sell them in interstate or foreign commerce ( 
1538(a)(1)(E), (F). The taking prohibition, in other words, is
only part of the regulatory plan of   1538(a)(1), which covers all
the stages of the process by which protected wildlife is reduced
to man's dominion and made the object of profit. It is obvious
that "take" in this sense-a term of art deeply embedded in the
statutory and common law concerning wildlife-describes a class of
acts (not omissions) done directly and intentionally (not
indirectly and by accident) to particular animals (not populations
of animals).


The Act's definition of "take" does expand the word slightly (and
not unusually), so as to make clear that it includes not just a
completed taking, but the process of taking, and all of the acts
that are customarily identified with or accompany that process
("to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,
capture, or collect"); and so as to include attempts.   1532(19).
The tempting fallacy-which the Court commits with abandon, see
ante, at 9, n. 10-is to assume that once defined, "take" loses any
significance, and it is only the definition that matters. The
Court treats the statute as though Congress had directly enacted
the   1532(19) definition as a self-executing prohibition, and had
not enacted   1538(a)(1)(B) at all. But   1538(a)(1)(B) is there,
and if the terms contained in the definitional section are
susceptible of two readings, one of which comports with the
standard meaning of "take" as used in application to wildlife, and
one of which does not, an agency regulation that adopts the latter
reading is necessarily unreasonable, for it reads the defined term
"take"-the only operative term-out of the statute
altogether.[FOOTNOTE 2]


That is what has occurred here. The verb "harm" has a range of
meaning: "to cause injury" at its broadest, "to do hurt or damage"
in a narrower and more direct sense. See, e.g., 1 N. Webster, An
American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) ("Harm, v.t. To
hurt; to injure; to damage; to impair soundness of body, either
animal or vegetable") (emphasis added); American College
Dictionary 551 (1970) ("harm . . . n. injury; damage; hurt: to do
him bodily harm"). In fact the more directed sense of "harm" is a
somewhat more common and preferred usage; "harm has in it a little
of the idea of specially focused hurt or injury, as if a personal
injury has been anticipated and intended." J. Opdycke, Mark My
Words: A Guide to Modern Usage and Expression 330 (1949). See also
American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1981)
("Injure has the widest range. . . . Harm and hurt refer
principally to what causes physical or mental distress to living
things"). To define "harm" as an act or omission that, however
remotely, "actually kills or injures" a population of wildlife
through habitat modification, is to choose a meaning that makes
nonsense of the word that "harm" defines-requiring us to accept
that a farmer who tills his field and causes erosion that makes
silt run into a nearby river which depletes oxygen and thereby
"impairs [the] breeding" of protected fish, has "taken" or
"attempted to take" the fish. It should take the strongest
evidence to make us believe that Congress has defined a term in a
manner repugnant to its ordinary and traditional sense.


Here the evidence shows the opposite. "Harm" is merely one of 10
prohibitory words in   1532(19), and the other 9 fit the ordinary
meaning of "take" perfectly. To "harass, pursue, hunt, shoot,
wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" are all affirmative acts
(the provision itself describes them as "conduct," see   1532(19))
which are directed immediately and intentionally against a
particular animal-not acts or omissions that indirectly and
accidentally cause injury to a population of animals. The Court
points out that several of the words ("harass," "pursue," "wound,"
and "kill") "refer to actions or effects that do not require
direct applications of force." Ante, at 13 (emphasis added). That
is true enough, but force is not the point. Even "taking"
activities in the narrowest sense, activities traditionally
engaged in by hunters and trappers, do not all consist of direct
applications of force; pursuit and harassment are part of the
business of "taking" the prey even before it has been touched.
What the nine other words in   1532(19) have in common-and share
with the narrower meaning of "harm" described above, but not with
the Secretary's ruthless dilation of the word-is the sense of
affirmative conduct intentionally directed against a particular
animal or animals.


I am not the first to notice this fact, or to draw the conclusion
that it compels. In 1981 the Solicitor of the Fish and Wildlife
Service delivered a legal opinion on   1532(19) that is in
complete agreement with my reading:


"The Act's definition of 'take' contains a list of actions that
illustrate the intended scope of the term . . . . With the
possible exception of 'harm,' these terms all represent forms of
conduct that are directed against and likely to injure or kill
individual wildlife. Under the principle of statutory
construction, ejusdem generis, . . . the term 'harm' should be
interpreted to include only those actions that are directed
against, and likely to injure or kill, individual wildlife."
Memorandum of April 17, 1981, reprinted in 46 Fed. Reg. 29490,
29491 (emphasis in original).


I would call it noscitur a sociis, but the principle is much the
same: the fact that "several items in a list share an attribute
counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing
that attribute as well," Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. ___,
___ (1994) (slip op., at 3). The Court contends that the canon
cannot be applied to deprive a word of all its "independent
meaning," ante, at 14. That proposition is questionable to begin
with, especially as applied to long lawyers' listings such as
this. If it were true, we ought to give theusly injure protected
wildlife, no matter how remote the chain of causation and no
matter how difficult to foresee (or to disprove) the "injury" may
be (e.g., an "impairment" of breeding). The Court says that "[the
strict-liability provision] is potentially sweeping, but it would
be so with or without the Secretary's 'harm' regulation." Ante, at
8, n. 9. That is not correct. Without the regulation, the routine
"habitat modifying" activities that people conduct to make a daily
living would not carry exposure to strict penalties; only acts
directed at animals, like those described by the other words in 
1532(19), would risk liability.


The Court says that "[to] read a requirement of intent or purpose
into the words used to define 'take' . . . ignore[s] [  1540's]
express provision that a 'knowing' action is enough to violate the
Act." Ante, at 13. This presumably means that because the reading
of   1532(19) advanced here ascribes an element of purposeful
injury to the prohibited acts, it makes superfluous (or
inexplicable) the more severe penalties provided for a "knowing"
violation. That conclusion does not follow, for it is quite
possible to take protected wildlife purposefully without doing so
knowingly. A requirement that a violation be "knowing" means that
the defendant must "know the facts that make his conduct illegal,"
Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at
6). The hunter who shoots an elk in the mistaken belief that it is
a mule deer has not knowingly violated   1538(a)(1)(B)-not because
he does not know that elk are legally protected (that would be
knowledge of the law, which is not a requirement, see ante, at 8,
n. 9), but because he does not know what sort of animal he is
shooting. The hunter has nonetheless committed a purposeful taking
of protected wildlife, and would therefore be subject to the
(lower) strict-liability penalties for the violation.


So far I have discussed only the immediate statutory text bearing
on the regulation. But the definition of "take" in   1532(19)
applies "[f]or the purposes of this chapter," that is, it governs
the meaning of the word as used everywhere in the Act. Thus, the
Secretary's interpretation of "harm" is wrong if it does not fit
with the use of "take" throughout the Act. And it does not. In 
1540(e)(4)(B), for example, Congress provided for the forfeiture
of "[a]ll guns, traps, nets, and other equipment . . . used to aid
the taking, possessing, selling, [etc.]" of protected animals.
This listing plainly relates to "taking" in the ordinary sense. If
environmental modification were part (and necessarily a major
part) of taking, as the Secretary maintains, one would have
expected the list to include "plows, bulldozers, and back-hoes."
As another example,   1539(e)(1) exempts "the taking of any
endangered species" by Alaskan Indians and Eskimos "if such taking
is primarily for subsistence purposes"; and provides that
"[n]on-edible byproducts of species taken pursuant to this section
may be sold . . . when made into authentic native articles of
handicrafts and clothing." Surely these provisions apply to taking
only in the ordinary sense, and are meaningless as applied to
species injured by environmental modification. The Act is full of
like examples. See, e.g.,   1538(a)(1)(D) (prohibiting possession,
sale, and transport of "species taken in violation" of the Act).
"[I]f the Act is to be interpreted as a symmetrical and coherent
regulatory scheme, one in which the operative words have a
consistent meaning throughout," Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S.
___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 6), the regulation must fall.


The broader structure of the Act confirms the unreasonableness of
the regulation. Section 1536 provides:


"Each Federal agency shall . . . insure that any action
authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered
species or threatened species or result in the destruction or
adverse modification of habitat of such species which is
determined by the Secretary . . . to be critical." 16 U.S.C. 
1536(a)(2) (emphasis added).


The Act defines "critical habitat" as habitat that is "essential
to the conservation of the species,"    1532(5)(A), (A)(ii), with
"conservation" in turn defined as the use of methods necessary to
bring listed species "to the point at which the measures provided
pursuant to this chapter are no longer necessary."   1532(3).


These provisions have a double significance. Even if    1536(a)(2)
and 1538(a)(1)(B) were totally independent prohibitions-the former
applying only to federal agencies and their licensees, the latter
only to private parties-Congress's explicit prohibition of habitat
modification in the one section would bar the inference of an
implicit prohibition of habitat modification in the other section.
"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another . . ., it is generally presumed
that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate
inclusion or exclusion." Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S.
___, ___ (1993) (slip op., at 7-8) (internal quotation marks
omitted). And that presumption against implicit prohibition would
be even stronger where the one section which uses the language
carefully defines and limits its application. That is to say, it
would be passing strange for Congress carefully to define
"critical habitat" as used in   1536(a)(2), but leave it to the
Secretary to evaluate, willy-nilly, impermissible "habitat
modification" (under the guise of "harm") in   1538(a)(1)(B).


In fact, however,    1536(a)(2) and 1538(a)(1)(B) do not operate
in separate realms; federal agencies are subject to both, because
the "person[s]" forbidden to take protected species under   1538
include agencies and departments of the Federal Government. See 
1532(13). This means that the "harm" regulation also contradicts
another principle of interpretation: that statutes should be read
so far as possible to give independent effect to all their
provisions. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. ___, ___ (slip
op., at 6-8). By defining "harm" in the definition of "take" in 
1538(a)(1)(B) to include significant habitat modification that
injures populations of wildlife, the regulation makes the
habitat-modification restriction in   1536(a)(2) almost wholly
superfluous. As "critical habitat" is habitat "essential to the
conservation of the species," adverse modification of "critical"
habitat by a federal agency would also constitute habitat
modification that injures a population of wildlife.


Petitioners try to salvage some independent scope for   1536(a)(2)
by the following contortion: because the definition of critical
habitat includes not only "the specific areas within the
geographical area occupied by the species [that are] essential to
the conservation of the species,"   1532(5)(A), but also "specific
areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the
time it is listed [as a protected species] . . . [that are]
essential to the conservation of the species,"   1532A(5)(ii),
there may be some agency modifications of critical habitat which
do not injure a population of wildlife. See Brief for Petitioners
41, and n. 27. This is dubious to begin with. A principal way to
injure wildlife under the Secretary's own regulation is to
"significantly impai[r] . . . breeding," 50 CFR   17.3 (1994). To
prevent the natural increase of a species by adverse modification
of habitat suitable for expansion assuredly impairs breeding. But
even if true, the argument only narrows the scope of the
superfluity, leaving as so many wasted words the   1532(a)(5)
definition of critical habitat to include currently occupied
habitat essential to the species' conservation. If the Secretary's
definition of "harm" under   1538(a)(1)(B) is to be upheld, we
must believe that Congress enacted   1536(a)(2) solely because in
its absence federal agencies would be able to modify habitat in
currently unoccupied areas. It is more rational to believe that
the Secretary's expansion of   1538(a)(1)(B) carves out the heart
of one of the central provisions of the Act.


II


The Court makes four other arguments. First, "the broad purpose of
the [Act] supports the Secretary's decision to extend protection
against activities that cause the precise harms Congress enacted
the statute to avoid." Ante, at 10. I thought we had renounced the
vice of "simplistically . . . assum[ing] that whatever furthers
the statute's primary objective must be the law." Rodriguez v.
United States, 480 U.S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis in
original). Deduction from the "broad purpose" of a statute begs
the question if it is used to decide by what means (and hence to
what length) Congress pursued that purpose; to get the right
answer to that question there is no substitute for the hard job
(or in this case, the quite simple one) of reading the whole text.
"The Act must do everything necessary to achieve its broad
purpose" is the slogan of the enthusiast, not the analytical tool
of the arbiter.[FOOTNOTE 3]


Second, the Court maintains that the legislative history of the
1973 Act supports the Secretary's definition. See ante, at 16-18.
Even if legislative history were a legitimate and reliable tool of
interpretation (which I shall assume in order to rebut the Court's
claim); and even if it could appropriately be resorted to when the
enacted text is as clear as this, but see Chicago v. Environmental
Defense Fund, 511 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 9-10); here
it shows quite the opposite of what the Court says. I shall not
pause to discuss the Court's reliance on such statements in the
Committee Reports as "'[t]ake' is defined . . . in the broadest
possible manner to include every conceivable way in which a person
can 'take' or attempt to 'take' any fish or wildlife.'" S. Rep.
No. 93-307, p. 7 (1973) (quoted ante, at 17). This sort of empty
flourish-to the effect that "this statute means what it means all
the way"-counts for little even when enacted into the law itself.
See Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. ___, ___ (1993) (slip op., at
13-14).


Much of the Court's discussion of legislative history is devoted
to two items: first, the Senate floor manager's introduction of an
amendment that added the word "harm" to the definition of "take,"
with the observation that (along with other amendments) it would
"help to achieve the purposes of the bill"; second, the relevant
Committee's removal from the definition of a provision stating
that "take" includes "the destruction, modification or curtailment
of [the] habitat or range" of fish and wildlife. See ante, at
17-18. The Court inflates the first and belittles the second, even
though the second is on its face far more pertinent. But this
elaborate inference from various pre-enactment actions and
inactions is quite unnecessary, since we have direct evidence of
what those who brought the legislation to the floor thought it
meant-evidence as solid as any ever to be found in legislative
history, but which the Court banishes to a footnote. See ante, at
18-19, n. 19.


Both the Senate and House floor managers of the bill explained it
in terms which leave no doubt that the problem of habitat
destruction on private lands was to be solved principally by the
land acquisition program of   1534, while   1538 solved a
different problem altogether- the problem of takings. Senator
Tunney stated:


"Through [the] land acquisition provisions, we will be able to
conserve habitats necessary to protect fish and wildlife from
further destruction.


"Although most endangered species are threatened primarily by the
destruction of their natural habitats, a significant portion of
these animals are subject to predation by man for commercial,
sport, consumption, or other purposes. The provisions of [the
bill] would prohibit the commerce in or the importation,
exportation, or taking of endangered species . . . ." 119 Cong.
Rec. 25669 (1973) (emphasis added).


The House floor manager, Representative Sullivan, put the same
thought in this way:


"[T]he principal threat to animals stems from destruction of their
habitat. . . . [The bill] will meet this problem by providing
funds for acquisition of critical habitat. . . . It will also
enable the Department of Agriculture to cooperate with willing
landowners who desire to assist in the protection of endangered
species, but who are understandably unwilling to do so at
excessive cost to themselves. Another hazard to endangered species
arises from those who would capture or kill them for pleasure or
profit. There is no way that Congress can make it less pleasurable
for a person to take an animal, but we can certainly make it less
profitable for them to do so." Id., at 30162 (emphasis added).


Habitat modification and takings, in other words, were viewed as
different problems, addressed by different provisions of the Act.
The Court really has no explanation for these statements. All it
can say is that "[n]either statement even suggested that [the
habitat acquisition funding provision in   1534] would be the
Act's exclusive remedy for habitat modification by private
landowners or that habitat modification by private landowners
stood outside the ambit of [  1538]." Ante, at 18-19, n. 19. That
is to say, the statements are not as bad as they might have been.
Little in life is. They are, however, quite bad enough to destroy
the Court's legislative-history case, since they display the clear
understanding (1) that habitat modification is separate from
"taking," and (2) that habitat destruction on private lands is to
be remedied by public acquisition, and not by making particular
unlucky landowners incur "excessive cost to themselves." The Court
points out triumphantly that they do not display the understanding
(3) that the land acquisition program is "the [Act's] only
response to habitat modification." Ibid. Of course not, since that
is not so (all public lands are subject to habitat-modification
restrictions); but (1) and (2) are quite enough to exclude the
Court's interpretation. They identify the land acquisition program
as the Act's only response to habitat modification by private
landowners, and thus do not in the least "contradic[t]," ibid.,
the fact that   1536 prohibits habitat modification by federal
agencies.


Third, the Court seeks support from a provision which was added to
the Act in 1982, the year after the Secretary promulgated the
current regulation. The provision states:


"[T]he Secretary may permit, under such terms and conditions as he
shall prescribe-




"any taking otherwise prohibited by section 1538(a)(1)(B) . . . if
such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying
out of an otherwise lawful activity." 16 U.S.C.   1539(a)(1)(B).


This provision does not, of course, implicate our doctrine that
reenactment of a statutory provision ratifies an extant judicial
or administrative interpretation, for neither the taking
prohibition in   1538(a)(1)(B) nor the definition in   1532(19)
was reenacted. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip
op., at 21). The Court claims, however, that the provision
"strongly suggests that Congress understood [  1538(a)(1)(B)] to
prohibit indirect as well as deliberate takings." Ante, at 12.
That would be a valid inference if habitat modification were the
only substantial "otherwise lawful activity" that might
incidentally and nonpurposefully cause a prohibited "taking." Of
course it is not. This provision applies to the many otherwise
lawful takings that incidentally take a protected species-as when
fishing for unprotected salmon also takes an endangered species of
salmon, see Pacific Northwest Generating Cooperative v. Brown, 38
f.3d 1058, 1067 (CA9 1994). Congress has referred to such
"incidental takings" in other statutes as well-for example, a
statute referring to "the incidental taking of . . . sea turtles
in the course of . . . harvesting [shrimp]" and to the "rate of
incidental taking of sea turtles by United States vessels in the
course of such harvesting," 103 Stat. 1038   609(b)(2), note
following 16 U.S.C.   1537 (1988 ed., Supp. V); and a statute
referring to "the incidental taking of marine mammals in the
course of commercial fishing operations," 108 Stat. 546,   118(a).
The Court shows that it misunderstands the question when it says
that "[n]o one could seriously request an 'incidental' take permit
to avert . . . liability for direct, deliberate action against a
member of an endangered or threatened species." Ante, at 12-13
(emphasis added). That is not an incidental take at all.[FOOTNOTE
4]


This is enough to show, in my view, that the 1982 permit provision
does not support the regulation. I must acknowledge that the
Senate Committee Report on this provision, and the House
Conference Committee Report, clearly contemplate that it will
enable the Secretary to permit environmental modification. See S.
Rep. No. 97-418, p. 10 (1982); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 97-835, pp.
30-32 (1982). But the text of the amendment cannot possibly bear
that asserted meaning, when placed within the context of an Act
that must be interpreted (as we have seen) not to prohibit private
environmental modification. The neutral language of the amendment
cannot possibly alter that interpretation, nor can its legislative
history be summoned forth to contradict, rather than clarify, what
is in its totality an unambiguous statutory text. See Chicago v.
Environmental Defense Fund, 511 U.S. ___ (1994). There is little
fear, of course, that giving no effect to the relevant portions of
the Committee Reports will frustrate the real-life expectations of
a majority of the Members of Congress. If they read and relied on
such tedious detail on such an obscure point (it was not, after
all, presented as a revision of the statute's prohibitory scope,
but as a discretionary-waiver provision) the Republic would be in
grave peril.


Fourth and lastly, the Court seeks to avoid the evident
shortcomings of the regulation on the ground that the respondents
are challenging it on its face rather than as applied. See ante,
at 11; see also ante, at 1 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Court
seems to say that even if the regulation dispenses wi happened to
be premeditated. It could not be applied to such a killing,
because it does not require the factfinder to find premeditation,
as the statute requires. In other words, to simplify its task the
Court today confuses lawful application of the challenged
regulation with lawful application of a different regulation,
i.e., one requiring the various elements of liability that this
regulation omits.


III


In response to the points made in this dissent, the Court's
opinion stresses two points, neither of which is supported by the
regulation, and so cannot validly be used to uphold it. First, the
Court and the concurrence suggest that the regulation should be
read to contain a requirement of proximate causation or
foreseeability, principally because the statute does-and
"[n]othing in the regulation purports to weaken those requirements
[of the statute]." See ante, at 8, n. 9; 11-12, n. 13; see also
ante, at 4-6 (O'Connor, J., concurring). I quite agree that the
statute contains such a limitation, because the verbs of purpose
in   1538(a)(1)(B) denote action directed at animals. But the
Court has rejected that reading. The critical premise on which it
has upheld the regulation is that, despite the weight of the other
words in   1538(a)(1)(B), "the statutory term 'harm' encompasses
indirect as well as direct injuries," ante, at 9. See also ante,
at 9-10, n. 11 (describing "the sense of indirect causation that
'harm' adds to the statute"); ante, at 14 (stating that the
Secretary permissibly interprets "'harm'" to include "indirectly
injuring endangered animals"). Consequently, unless there is some
strange category of causation that is indirect and yet also
proximate, the Court has already rejected its own basis for
finding a proximate-cause limitation in the regulation. In fact
"proximate" causation simply means "direct" causation. See, e.g.,
Black's Law Dictionary 1103 (5th ed. 1979) (defining "[p]roximate"
as "Immediate; nearest; direct") (emphasis added); Webster's New
International Dictionary of the English Language 1995 (2d ed.
1949) ("proximate cause. A cause which directly, or with no
mediate agency, produces an effect") (emphasis added).


The only other reason given for finding a proximate-cause
limitation in the regulation is that "by use of the word
'actually,' the regulation clearly rejects speculative or
conjectural effects, and thus itself invokes principles of
proximate causation." Ante, at 5 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see
also ante, at 11-12, n. 13 (majority opinion). Non sequitur, of
course. That the injury must be "actual" as opposed to "potential"
simply says nothing at all about the length or foreseeability of
the causal chain between the habitat modification and the "actual"
injury. It is thus true and irrelevant that "the Secretary did not
need to include 'actually' to connote 'but for' causation," ante,
at 11-12, n. 13; "actually" defines the requisite injury, not the
requisite causality.


The regulation says (it is worth repeating) that "harm" means (1)
an act which (2) actually kills or injures wildlife. If that does
not dispense with a proximate-cause requirement, I do not know
what language would. And changing the regulation by judicial
invention, even to achieve compliance with the statute, is not
permissible. Perhaps the agency itself would prefer to achieve
compliance in some other fashion. We defer to reasonable agency
interpretations of ambiguous statutes precisely in order that
agencies, rather than courts, may exercise policymaking discretion
in the interstices of statutes. See Chevron, 467 U.S., at 843-845.
Just as courts may not exercise an agency's power to adjudicate,
and so may not affirm an agency order on discretionary grounds the
agency has not advanced, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80
(1943), so also this Court may not exercise the Secretary's power
to regulate, and so may not uphold a regulation by adding to it
even the most reasonable of elements it does not contain.


The second point the Court stresses in its response seems to me a
belated mending of its hold. It apparently concedes that the
statute requires injury to particular animals rather than merely
to populations of animals. See ante, at 11-12, n. 13; id., at 7, 9
(referring to killing or injuring "members of [listed] species"
(emphasis added)). The Court then rejects my contention that the
regulation ignores this requirement, since, it says, "every term
in the regulation's definition of 'harm' is subservient to the
phrase 'an act which actually kills or injures wildlife.'" Id., at
11-12, n. 13. As I have pointed out, see supra, at 3, this reading
is incompatible with the regulation's specification of impairment
of "breeding" as one of the modes of "kill[ing] or injur[ing]
wildlife."[FOOTNOTE 5]


But since the Court is reading the regulation and the statute
incorrectly in other respects, it may as well introduce this
novelty as well-law  la carte. As I understand the regulation
that the Court has created and held consistent with the statute
that it has also created, habitat modification can constitute a
"taking," but only if it results in the killing or harming of
individual animals, and only if that consequence is the direct
result of the modification. This means that the destruction of
privately owned habitat that is essential, not for the feeding or
nesting, but for the breeding, of butterflies, would not violate
the Act, since it would not harm or kill any living butterfly. I,
too, think it would not violate the Act-not for the utterly
unsupported reason that habitat modifications fall outside the
regulation if they happen not to kill or injure a living animal,
but for the textual reason that only action directed at living
animals constitutes a "take."


* * *


The Endangered Species Act is a carefully considered piece of
legislation that forbids all persons to hunt or harm endangered
animals, but places upon the public at large, rather than upon
fortuitously accountable individual landowners, the cost of
preserving the habitat of endangered species. There is neither
textual support for, nor even evidence of congressional
consideration of, the radically different disposition contained in
the regulation that the Court sustains. For these reasons, I
respectfully dissent.





FN* Justice Scalia suggests that, if the word "direct" merits
emphasis in this sentence, then the sentence should be read as an
effort to negate principles of proximate causation. See post, at
22, n. 5. As this case itself demonstrates, however, the word
"direct" is susceptible of many meanings. The Court of Appeals,
for example, used "direct" to suggest an element of
purposefulness. See Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great
Oregon v. Babbitt, 17 F.3d 1463, 1465 (CADC 1994). So,
occasionally, does the dissent. See post, at 7 (describing
"affirmative acts . . . which are directed immediately and
intentionally against a particular animal") (emphasis added). It
is not hard to imagine conduct that, while "indirect" (i.e.,
nonpurposeful), proximately causes actual death or injury to
individual protected animals, cf. post, at 20; indeed, principles
of proximate cause routinely apply in the negligence and strict
liability contexts.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FOOTNOTES
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



FN1. The Act defines the term "endangered species" to mean "any
species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a
significant portion of its range other than a species of the Class
Insecta determined by the Secretary to constitute a pest whose
protection under the provisions of this chapter would present an
overwhelming and overriding risk to man." 16 U.S.C.   1532(6).





FN2. The Secretary, through the Director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, originally promulgated the regulation in 1975 and amended
it in 1981 to emphasize that actual death or injury of a protected
animal is necessary for a violation. See 40 Fed. Reg. 44412, 44416
(1975); 46 Fed. Reg. 54748, 54750 (1981).





FN3. Respondents also argued in the District Court that the
Secretary's definition of "harm" is unconstitutionally void for
vagueness, but they do not press that argument here.





FN4. The woodpecker was listed as an endangered species in 1970
pursuant to the statutory predecessor of the ESA. See 50 CFR 
17.11(h) (1994), issued pursuant to the Endangered Species
Conservation Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 275.





FN5. See 55 Fed. Reg. 26114 (1990). Another regulation promulgated
by the Secretary extends to threatened species, defined in the ESA
as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species
within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant
portion of its range," 16 U.S.C.   1532(20), some but not all of
the protections endangered species enjoy. See 50 CFR 17.31(a)
(1994). In the District Court respondents unsuccessfully
challenged that regulation's extension of   9 to threatened
species, but they do not press the challenge here.





FN6. Senate 1983, reprinted in Hearings on S. 1592 and S. 1983
before the Subcommittee on Environment of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 27 (1973).





FN7. Judge Sentelle filed a partial concurrence in which he
declined to join the portions of the court's opinion that relied
on legislative history. See 17 F.3d 1463, 1472 (CADC 1994).





FN8. The 1982 amendment had formed the basis on which the author
of the majority's opinion on rehearing originally voted to affirm
the judgment of the District Court. Compare 1 F.3d 1, 11 (CADC
1993) (Williams, J., concurring in part), with 17 F.3d, at
1467-1472.





FN9. As discussed above, the Secretary's definition of "harm" is
limited to "act[s] which actually kil[l] or injur[e] wildlife." 50
CFR   17.3 (1994). In addition, in order to be subject to the
Act's criminal penalties or the more severe of its civil
penalties, one must "knowingly violat[e]" the Act or its
implementing regulations. 16 U.S.C.    1540(a)(1),(b)(1). Congress
added "knowingly" in place of "willfully" in 1978 to make
"criminal violations of the act a general rather than a specific
intent crime." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1804, p. 26 (1978). The Act
does authorize up to a $500 civil fine for "[a]ny person who
otherwise violates" the Act or its implementing regulations. 16
U.S.C.   1540(a)(1). That provision is potentially sweeping, but
it would be so with or without the Secretary's "harm" regulation,
making it unhelpful in assessing the reasonableness of the
regulation. We have imputed scienter requirements to criminal
statutes that impose sanctions without expressly requiring
scienter, see, e.g., Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. ___
(1994), but the proper case in which we might consider whether to
do so in the   9 provision for a $500 civil penalty would be a
challenge to enforcement of that provision itself, not a challenge
to a regulation that merely defines a statutory term. We do not
agree with the dissent that the regulation covers results that are
not "even foreseeable . . . no matter how long the chain of
causality between modification and injury." Post, at 2.
Respondents have suggested no reason why either the "knowingly
violates" or the "otherwise violates" provision of the statute-or
the "harm" regulation itself-should not be read to incorporate
ordinary requirements of proximate causation and foreseeability.
In any event, neither respondents nor their amici have suggested
that the Secretary employs the "otherwise violates" provision with
any frequency.





FN10. Respondents and the dissent emphasize what they portray as
the "established meaning" of "take" in the sense of a "wildlife
take," a meaning respondents argue extends only to "the effort to
exercise dominion over some creature, and the concrete effect of
[sic] that creature." Brief for Respondents 19; see post, at 4-5.
This limitation ill serves the statutory text, which forbids not
taking "some creature" but "tak[ing] any [endangered] species"-a
formidable task for even the most rapacious feudal lord. More
importantly, Congress explicitly defined the operative term "take"
in the ESA, no matter how much the dissent wishes otherwise, see
post, at 4-7, 11-12, thereby obviating the need for us to probe
its meaning as we must probe the meaning of the undefined
subsidiary term "harm." Finally, Congress' definition of "take"
includes several words-most obviously "harass," "pursue," and
"wound," in addition to "harm" itself-that fit respondents' and
the dissent's definition of "take" no better than does
"significant habitat modification or degradation."





FN11. In contrast, if the statutory term "harm" encompasses such
indirect means of killing and injuring wildlife as habitat
modification, the other terms listed in   3-"harass," "pursue,"
"hunt," "shoot," "wound," "kill," "trap," "capture," and
"collect"-generally retain independent meanings. Most of those
terms refer to deliberate actions more frequently than does
"harm," and they therefore do not duplicate the sense of indirect
causation that "harm" adds to the statute. In addition, most of
the other words in the definition describe either actions from
which habitat modification does not usually result (e.g.,
"pursue," "harass") or effects to which activities that modify
habitat do not usually lead (e.g., "trap," "collect"). To the
extent the Secretary's definition of "harm" may have applications
that overlap with other words in the definition, that overlap
reflects the broad purpose of the Act. See infra, at 9-11.





FN12. We stated: "The Secretary of the Interior has defined the
term 'harm' to mean 'an act or omission which actually injures or
kills wildlife, including acts which annoy it to such an extent as
to significantly disrupt essential behavioral patterns, which
include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding or sheltering;
significant environmental modification or degradation which has
such effects is included within the meaning of "harm."'" TVA v.
Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 184-185, n. 30 (1978) (citations omitted;
emphasis in original).





FN13. The dissent incorrectly asserts that the Secretary's
regulation (1) "dispenses with the foreseeability of harm" and (2)
"fail[s] to require injury to particular animals," post, at 19. As
to the first assertion, the regulation merely implements the
statute, and it is therefore subject to the statute's "knowingly
violates" language, see 16 U.S.C.    1540(a)(1),(b)(1), and
ordinary requirements of proximate causation and foreseeability.
See n. 9, supra. Nothing in the regulation purports to weaken
those requirements. To the contrary, the word "actually" in the
regulation should be construed to limit the liability about which
the dissent appears most concerned, liability under the statute's
"otherwise violates" provision. See n. 9, supra; post, at 8-9,
19-20. The Secretary did not need to include "actually" to connote
"but for" causation, which the other words in the definition
obviously require. As to the dissent's second assertion, every
term in the regulation's definition of "harm" is subservient to
the phrase "an act which actually kills or injures wildlife."





FN14. The dissent acknowledges the legislative history's clear
indication that the drafters of the 1982 amendment had habitat
modification in mind, see post, at 18, but argues that the text of
the amendment requires a contrary conclusion. This argument
overlooks the statute's requirement of a "conservation plan,"
which must describe an alternative to a known, but undesired,
habitat modification.





FN15. The dissent makes no effort to defend the Court of Appeals'
reading of the statutory definition as requiring a direct
application of force. Instead, it tries to impose on   9 a
limitation of liability to "affirmative conduct intentionally
directed against a particular animal or animals." Post, at 7.
Under the dissent's interpretation of the Act, a developer could
drain a pond, knowing that the act would extinguish an endangered
species of turtles, without even proposing a conservation plan or
applying for a permit under   9(a)(1)(B); unless the developer was
motivated by a desire "to get at a turtle," post, at 8, no
statutory taking could occur. Because such conduct would not
constitute a taking at common law, the dissent would shield it
from   9 liability, even though the words "kill" and "harm" in the
statutory definition could apply to such deliberate conduct. We
cannot accept that limitation. In any event, our reasons for
rejecting the Court of Appeals' interpretation apply as well to
the dissent's novel construction.





FN16. Respondents' reliance on United States v. Hayashi, 22 F.3d
859 (CA9 1993) is also misplaced. Hayashi construed the term
"harass," part of the definition of "take" in the Marine Mammal
Protection Act of 1972, 16 U.S.C.   1361 et seq., as requiring a
"direct intrusion" on wildlife to support a criminal prosecution.
22 F.3d, at 864. Hayashi dealt with a challenge to a single
application of a statute whose "take" definition includes neither
"harm" nor several of the other words that appear in the ESA
definition. Moreover, Hayashi was decided by a panel of the Ninth
Circuit, the same court that had previously upheld the regulation
at issue here in Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural
Resources, 852 F.2d 1106 (1988) (Palila II). Neither the Hayashi
majority nor the dissent saw any need to distinguish or even to
cite Palila II.





FN17. Congress recognized that    7 and 9 are not coextensive as
to federal agencies when, in the wake of our decision in Hill in
1978, it added   7(o), 16 U.S.C.   1536(o), to the Act. That
section provides that any federal project subject to exemption
from   7, 16 U.S.C.   1536(h), will also be exempt from   9.





FN18. Respondents also argue that the rule of lenity should
foreclose any deference to the Secretary's interpretation of the
ESA because the statute includes criminal penalties. The rule of
lenity is premised on two ideas: first, "'a fair warning should be
given to the world in language that the common world will
understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is
passed'"; second, "legislatures and not courts should define
criminal activity." United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-350
(1971) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 282 U.S. 25, 27 (1931)).
We have applied the rule of lenity in a case raising a narrow
question concerning the application of a statute that contains
criminal sanctions to a specific factual dispute-whether pistols
with short barrels and attachable shoulder stocks are
short-barreled rifles-where no regulation was present. See United
States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U.S. 505, 517-518, and n.
9 (1992). We have never suggested that the rule of lenity should
provide the standard for reviewing facial challenges to
administrative regulations whenever the governing statute
authorizes criminal enforcement. Even if there exist regulations
whose interpretations of statutory criminal penaltieloor statement
by Representative Sullivan, the House floor manager for the ESA:


"For the most part, the principal threat to animals stems from
destruction of their habitat. . . . H. R. 37 will meet this
problem by providing funds for acquisition of critical habitat . .
with willing landowners who desire to assist in the protection of
endangered species, but who are understandably unwilling to do so
at excessive cost to themselves.


"Another hazard to endangered species arises from those who would
capture or kill them for pleasure or profit. There is no way that
Congress can make it less pleasurable for a person to take an
animal, but we can certainly make it less profitable for them to
do so." Id., at 30162.


Each of these statements merely explained features of the bills
that Congress eventually enacted in   5 of the ESA and went on to
discuss elements enacted in   9. Neither statement even suggested
that   5 would be the Act's exclusive remedy for habitat
modification by private landowners or that habitat modification by
private landowners stood outside the ambit of   9. Respondents'
suggestion that these statements identified   5 as the ESA's only
response to habitat modification contradicts their emphasis
elsewhere on the habitat protections in   7. See supra, at 14.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: DISSENTING FOOTNOTES
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



FN1. The Court and Justice O'Connor deny that the regulation has
the first or the third of these features. I respond to their
arguments in Part III, infra.





FN2. The Court suggests halfheartedly that "take" cannot refer to
the taking of particular animals, because   1538(a)(1)(B)
prohibits "tak[ing] any [endangered] species." Ante, at 9, n. 10.
The suggestion is halfhearted because that reading obviously
contradicts the statutory intent. It would mean no violation in
the intentional shooting of a single bald eagle-or, for that
matter, the intentional shooting of 1,000 bald eagles out of the
extant 1,001. The phrasing of   1538(a)(1)(B), as the Court
recognizes elsewhere, see, e.g., ante, at 7, is shorthand for
"take any member of [an endangered] species."





FN3. This portion of the Court's opinion, see ante, at 11, n. 12,
discusses and quotes a footnote in TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153,
184-185, n. 30 (1978), in which we described the then-current
version of the Secretary's regulation, and said that the habitat
modification undertaken by the federal agency in the case would
have violated the regulation. Even if we had said that the
Secretary's regulation was authorized by   1538, that would have
been utter dictum, for the only provision at issue was   1536. See
437 U.S., at 193. But in fact we simply opined on the effect of
the regulation while assuming its validity, just as courts always
do with provisions of law whose validity is not at issue.





FN4. The statutory requirement of a "conservation plan" is as
consistent with this construction as with the Court's. See ante,
at 12, and n. 14. The commercial fisherman who is in danger of
incidentally sweeping up protected fish in his nets can quite
reasonably be required to "minimize and mitigate" the "impact" of
his activity. 16 U.S.C.   1539(a)(2)(A).





FN5. Justice O'Connor supposes that an "impairment of breeding"
intrinsically injures an animal because "[t]o make it impossible
for an animal to reproduce is to impair its most essential
physical functions and to render that animal, and its genetic
material, biologically obsolete." Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion).
This imaginative construction does achieve the result of extending
"impairment of breeding" to individual animals; but only at the
expense of also expanding "injury" to include elements beyond
physical harm to individual animals. For surely the only harm to
the individual animal from impairment of that "essential function"
is not the failure of issue (which harms only the issue), but the
psychic harm of perceiving that it will leave this world with no
issue (assuming, of course, that the animal in question, perhaps
an endangered species of slug, is capable of such painful
sentiments). If it includes that psychic harm, then why not the
psychic harm of not being able to frolic about-so that the
draining of a pond used for an endangered animal's recreation, but
in no way essential to its survival, would be prohibited by the
Act? That the concurrence is driven to such a dubious redoubt is
an argument for, not against, the proposition that "injury" in the
regulation includes injury to populations of animals. Even more so
with the concurrence's alternative explanation: that "impairment
of breeding" refers to nothing more than concrete injuries
inflicted by the habitat modification on the animal who does the
breeding, such as "physical complications [suffered] during
gestation," ante, at 3. Quite obviously, if "impairment of
breeding" meant such physical harm to an individual animal, it
would not have had to be mentioned.


The concurrence entangles itself in a dilemma while attempting to
explain the Secretary's commentary to the harm regulation, which
stated that "harm" is not limited to "direct physical injury to an
individual member of the wildlife species," 46 Fed. Reg. 54748
(1981). The concurrence denies that this means that the regulation
does not require injury to particular animals, because "one could
just as easily emphasize the word 'direct' in this sentence as the
word 'individual.'" Ante, at 3. One could; but if the concurrence
does, it thereby refutes its separate attempt to exclude indirect
causation from the regulation's coverage, see ante, at 4-6. The
regulation, after emerging from the concurrence's analysis, has
acquired both a proximate-cause limitation and a
particular-animals limitation-precisely the one meaning that the
Secretary's quoted declaration will not allow, whichever part of
it is emphasized.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: SYLLABUS
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality,
authorizes payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to
outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of
publications issued by student groups called "Contracted
Independent Organizations" (CIOs). The SAF receives its money from
mandatory student fees and is designed to support a broad range of
extracurricular student activities related to the University's
educational purpose. CIOs must include in their dealings with
third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer stating
that they are independent of the University and that the
University is not responsible for them. The University withheld
authorization for payments to a printer on behalf of petitioners'
CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely because its student
newspaper, Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University
of Virginia, "primarily promotes or manifests a particular
belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality," as
prohibited by the University's SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed
this suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging, inter alia, that the
refusal to authorize payment violated their First Amendment right
to freedom of speech. After the District Court granted summary
judgment for the University, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the University's invocation of viewpoint discrimination to
deny third-party payment violated the Speech Clause, but
concluding that the discrimination was justified by the necessity
of complying with the Establishment Clause.
Held:
1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their
right of free speech. Pp. 7-16.
(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47. In
determining whether a State is acting within its power to preserve
the limits it has set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a
class of speech there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, this
Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand, content
discrimination-i.e., discrimination against speech because of its
subject matter-which may be permissible if it preserves the
limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination-i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective-which is
presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise
within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46. The most recent
and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. __, __, in which the
Court held that permitting school property to be used for the
presentation of all views on an issue except those dealing with it
from a religious standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint
discrimination. Here, as in that case, the State's actions are
properly interpreted as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination
rather than permissible line-drawing based on content: By the very
terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude
religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment
those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints. Pp. 7-11.
(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds
rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may
regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when
it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, the
University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint of private
persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548. Its argument that the
scarcity of public money may justify otherwise impermissible
viewpoint discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong.
Pp. 11-14.
(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term "promotes"
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a
philosophic position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a
deity or ultimate reality, while the term "manifests" would bring
within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise
presupposing the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or
ultimate reality. It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose
writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming
all connection to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. 14-16.
2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of
complying with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 16-25.
(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs in
the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee of
neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows
neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to
recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious
ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel v.
Grumet, 512 U.S. __, __. There is no suggestion that the
University created its program to advance religion or aid a
religious cause. The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech
and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The SAF Guidelines have a separate
classification for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf
of, "religious organizations," and WAP did not seek a subsidy
because of its Christian editorial viewpoint; it sought funding
under the Guidielines as a "student . . . communications . . .
grou[p]." Neutrality is also apparent in the fact that the
University has taken pains to disassociate itself from the private
speech involved in this case. The program's neutrality
distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied for the
direct support of a church or group of churches, which would
violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 16-21.
(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer
v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, since it is
undisputed that no public funds flow directly into WAP's coffers
under the program at issue. A public university does not violate
the Establishment Clause when it grants access to its facilities
on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups,
even if some of those groups would use the facilities for
devotional exercises. See e.g., Widmar, 474 U.S., at 269. This is
so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those
facilities is paid out of a student activities fund to which
students are required to contribute. Id., at 265. There is no
difference in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of
constitutional significance, between using such funds to operate a
facility to which students have access, and paying a third-party
contractor to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that
is involved here: The University provides printing services to a
broad spectrum of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to
become law, the University could only avoid a constitutional
violation by scrutinizing the content of student speech, lest it
contain too great a religious message. Such censorship would be
far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates
than would governmental provision of secular printing services on
a religion-blind basis. Pp. 21-25.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: OPINION
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth
for which it is named and thus bound by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for the
printing costs of a variety of student publications. It withheld
any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper "primarily promotes or
manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality." That the paper did promote or manifest views within the
defined exclusion seems plain enough. The challenge is to the
University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the case
raising issues under the Speech and Establishment Clauses of the
First Amendment.
I
The public corporation we refer to as the "University" is
denominated by state law as "the Rector and Visitors of the
University of Virginia," Va. Code Ann.   23-69 (1993), and it is
responsible for governing the school, see    23-69 to 23-80.
Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him, together
with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence and of the
Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va. Code Ann.   57-1, as one
of his proudest achievements, the University is among the Nation's
oldest and most respected seats of higher learning. It has more
than 11,000 undergraduate students, and 6,000 graduate and
professional students. An understanding of the case requires a
somewhat detailed description of the program the University
created to support extracurricular student activities on its
campus.
Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its
outside contractors for payment by the fund described below, it
must become a "Contracted Independent Organization" (CIO). CIO
status is available to any group the majority of whose members are
students, whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that
complies with certain procedural requirements. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 2a. A CIO must file its constitution with the University;
must pledge not to discriminate in its membership; and must
include in dealings with third parties and in all written
materials a disclaimer, stating that the CIO is independent of the
University and that the University is not responsible for the CIO.
App. 27-28. CIOs enjoy access to University facilities, including
meeting rooms and computer terminals. Id., at 30. A standard
agreement signed between each CIO and the University provides that
the benefits and opportunities afforded to CIOs "should not be
misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations are part of or
controlled by the University, that the University is responsible
for the organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or
that the University approves of the organizations' goals or
activities." Id., at 26.
All CIOs may exist and operate at the University, but some are
also entitled to apply for funds from the Student Activities Fund
(SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the
purpose of the SAF is to support a broad range of extracurricular
student activities that "are related to the educational purpose of
the University." App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is based on
the University's "recogni[tion] that the availability of a wide
range of opportunities" for its students "tends to enhance the
University environment." App. 26. The Guidelines require that it
be administered "in a manner consistent with the educational
purpose of the University as well as with state and federal law."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives its money from a
mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to each full-time
student. The Student Council, elected by the students, has the
initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions are
subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee of the
Vice President for Student Affairs. Cf. id., at 63a-64a.
Some, but not all, CIOs may submit disbursement requests to the
SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories of student groups that
may seek payment to third-party contractors because they "are
related to the educational purpose of the University of Virginia."
Id., at 61a-62a. One of these is "student news, information,
opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media groups."
Id., at 61a. The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs
of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for
funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activities
which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,
philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,
activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt
status, those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees,
or social entertainment or related expenses. Id., at 62a-63a. The
prohibition on "political activities" is defined so that it is
limited to electioneering and lobbying. The Guidelines provide
that "[t]hese restrictions on funding political activities are not
intended to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student
organization which . . . espouses particular positions or
ideological viewpoints, including those that may be unpopular or
are not generally accepted." Id., at 65a-66a. A "religious
activity," by contrast, is defined as any activity that "primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or
an ultimate reality." Id., at 66a.
The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining the
amounts of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on
behalf of each eligible student organization: the size of the
group, its financial self-sufficiency, and the University-wide
benefit of its activities. If an organization seeks SAF support,
it must submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the
organization's creditors upon determining that the expenses are
appropriate. No direct payments are made to the student groups.
During the 1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified
as CIOs. One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from
the SAF, and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups were
funded as "student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or
academic communications media groups."
Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), qualified
as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other
undergraduates in 1990, WAP was established "[t]o publish a
magazine of philosophical and religious expression," "[t]o
facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity
to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints," and "[t]o provide a
unifying focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds." App.
67. WAP publishes Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the
University of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was
evident from the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the
journal "offers a Christian perspective on both personal and
community issues, especially those relevant to college students at
the University of Virginia." App. 45. The editors committed the
paper to a two-fold mission: "to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to
encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ means." Ibid. The first issue had articles about
racism, crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C. S. Lewis' ideas about
evil and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next
two issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality,
Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music
reviews and interviews with University professors. Each page of
Wide Awake, and the end of each article or review, is marked by a
cross. The advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the
Christian perspective of the journal. For the most part, the
advertisers are churches, centers for Christian study, or
Christian bookstores. By June 1992, WAP had distributed about
5,000 copies of Wide Awake to University students, free of charge.
WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This is
an important consideration in this case, for had it been a
"religious organization," WAP would not have been accorded CIO
status. As defined by the Guidelines, a "religious organization"
is "an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an
acknowledged ultimate reality or deity." App. to Pet. for Cert.
66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University contended
that WAP is such an organization.
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF
to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of printing its newspaper.
The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's
request on the ground that Wide Awake was a "religious activity"
within the meaning of the Guidelines, i.e., that the newspaper
"promote[d] or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about a
deity or an ultimate reality." Ibid. It made its determination
after examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial
to the full Student Council, contending that WAP met all the
applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis
of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.
The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed to
the next level, the Student Activities Committee. In a letter
signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial
of funding. App. 55.
Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP,
Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia,
challenging the SAF's action as violative of Rev. Stat.   1979, 42
U.S.C.   1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize payment of
the printing costs of the publication, solely on the basis of its
religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights to freedom of
speech and press, to the free exercise of religion, and to equal
protection of the law. They relied also upon Article I of the
Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom,
Va. Code Ann.    57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp. 1994), but did not
pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages for the
costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory relief,
and attorney's fees.
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled
for the University, holding that denial of SAF support was not an
impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against
petitioners' speech, and that the University's Establishment
Clause concern over its "religious activities" was a sufficient
justification for denying payment to third-party contractors. The
court did not issue a definitive ruling on whether reimbursement,
had it been made here, would or would not have violated the
Establishment Clause. 795 F.Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va. 1992).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guidelines did
discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that, while the
State need not underwrite speech, there was a presumptive
violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was
invoked to deny third-party payment otherwise available to CIOs.
18 F.3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the District Court nonetheless, concluding that the
discrimination by the University was justified by the "compelling
interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state."
Id., at 281.
II
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based
on its substantive content or the message it conveys. Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972). Other principles
follow from this precept. In the realm of private speech or
expression, government regulation may not favor one speaker over
another. City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466
U.S. 789, 804 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of its
message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. __, __ (1994) (slip
op., at 16-19). These rules informed our determination that the
government offends the First Amendment when it imposes financial
burdens on certain speakers based on the content of their
expression. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991). When the government targets
not subject matter but particular views taken by speakers on a
subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more
blatant. See R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992).
Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious form of content
discrimination. The government must abstain from regulating speech
when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or
perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.
See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37,
46 (1983).
These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from
exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public
forum is one of its own creation. In a case involving a school
district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we
declared that "[t]here is no question that the District, like the
private owner of property, may legally preserve the property under
its control for the use to which it is dedicated." Lamb's Chapel
v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. __, __ (slip
op., at 5-7) (1993). The necessities of confining a forum to the
limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may
justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the
discussion of certain topics. See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985); Perry Ed.
Assn., supra, at 49. Once it has opened a limited forum, however,
the State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.
The State may not exclude speech where its distinction is not
"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,"
Cornelius, supra, at 804-806; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at
46, 49, nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its
viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at __ (slip op., at 6-7); see
also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46; R. A. V., supra, at 386-388,
391-393; cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414-415 (1989). Thus,
in determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits
of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of
speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between, on
the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible if
it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the other
hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible
when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's
limitations. See Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46.
The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or
geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable. See,
e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47 (forum analysis of a school
mail system); Cornelius, supra, at 801 (forum analysis of
charitable contribution program). The most recent and most
apposite case is our decision in Lamb's Chapel, supra. There, a
school district had opened school facilities for use after school
hours by community groups for a wide variety of social, civic, and
recreational purposes. The district, however, had enacted a formal
policy against opening facilities to groups for religious
purposes. Invoking its policy, the district rejected a request
from a group desiring to show a film series addressing various
child-rearing questions from a "Christian perspective." There was
no indication in the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to
use the school facilities was "denied for any reason other than
the fact that the presentation would have been from a religious
perspective." 508 U.S., at __ (slip op., at 8-9). Our conclusion
was unanimous: "[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint to
permit school property to be used for the presentation of all
views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing
with the subject matter from a religious standpoint." Ibid.
The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our
precedents) that "ideologically driven attempts to suppress a
particular point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in
funding, as in other contexts," but insists that this case does
not present that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on
content, not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10. As we
have noted, discrimination against one set of views or ideas is
but a subset or particular instance of the more general phenomenon
of content discrimination. See, e.g., R. A. V., supra, at 391.
And, it must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise
one. It is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of
religious thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct
from a comprehensive body of thought. The nature of our origins
and destiny and their dependence upon the existence of a divine
being have been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human
history. We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel,
viewpoint discrimination is the proper way to interpret the
University's objections to Wide Awake. By the very terms of the
SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a
subject matter but selects for disfavored treatment those student
journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion
may be a vast area of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did
here, a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from which a
variety of subjects may be discussed and considered. The
prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted
in the refusal to make third-party payments, for the subjects
discussed were otherwise within the approved category of
publications.
The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs
because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of
viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate is
bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response to
religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and
multifaceted nature of public discourse has not embraced such a
contrived description of the marketplace of ideas. If the topic of
debate is, for example, racism, then exclusion of several views on
that problem is just as offensive to the First Amendment as
exclusion of only one. It is as objectionable to exclude both a
theistic and an atheistic perspective on the debate as it is to
exclude one, the other, or yet another political, economic, or
social viewpoint. The dissent's declaration that debate is not
skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong;
the debate is skewed in multiple ways.
The University's denial of WAP's request for third-party payments
in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not
unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in
Lamb's Chapel and that we found invalid. The church group in
Lamb's Chapel would have been qualified as a social or civic
organization, save for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just
as the school district in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the
religious views of the group as the rationale for excluding its
message, so in this case the University justifies its denial of
SAF participation to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide
Awake reveal an avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 5. It
bears only passing mention that the dissent's attempt to
distinguish Lamb's Chapel is entirely without support in the law.
Relying on the transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to
argue that we found viewpoint discrimination in that case because
the government excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints
from being expressed in the forum there. Post, at 37-38, and n.
13. The Court relied on no such distinction in holding that
discriminating against religious speech was discriminating on the
basis of viewpoint. There is no indication in the opinion of the
Court (which, unlike an advocate's statements at oral argument, is
the law) that exclusion or inclusion of other religious or
antireligious voices from that forum had any bearing on its
decision.
The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding in
Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of
funds rather than access to facilities. The University begins with
the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial
discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to
accomplish its educational mission. Citing our decisions in Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540 (1983), and Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the University argues that
content-based funding decisions are both inevitable and lawful.
Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding decisions
as well as to those involving access to facilities, it is urged,
its holding "would become a judicial juggernaut,
constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that
schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make in
the allocation of public funds." Brief for Respondents 16.
To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v.
Vincent, supra. There, in the course of striking down a public
university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school
facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated:
"Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic
judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources." 454 U.S.,
at 276. The quoted language in Widmar was but a proper recognition
of the principle that when the State is the speaker, it may make
content-based choices. When the University determines the content
of the education it provides, it is the University speaking, and
we have permitted the government to regulate the content of what
is or is not expressed when it is the speaker or when it enlists
private entities to convey its own message. In the same vein, in
Rust v. Sullivan, supra, we upheld the government's prohibition on
abortion-related advice applicable to recipients of federal funds
for family planning counseling. There, the government did not
create a program to encourage private speech but instead used
private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to
its own program. We recognized that when the government
appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its
own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S., at 194. When
the government disburses public funds to private entities to
convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and
appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled
nor distorted by the grantee. See id., at 196-200.
It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar,
that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University
does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
from private speakers. A holding that the University may not
discriminate based on the viewpoint of private persons whose
speech it facilitates does not restrict the University's own
speech, which is controlled by different principles. See, e.g.,
Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,
496 U.S. 226, 250 (1990); Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484
U.S. 260, 270-272 (1988). For that reason, the University's
reliance on Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra,
is inapposite as well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress'
choice to grant tax deductions for contributions made to veterans'
groups engaged in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to
other charities which pursued lobbying efforts. Although
acknowledging that the Government is not required to subsidize the
exercise of fundamental rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, we
reaffirmed the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the
Government's provision of financial benefits by observing that
"[t]he case would be different if Congress were to discriminate
invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the
suppression of dangerous ideas,'" see id., at 548 (quoting
Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513 (1959), in turn
quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 519 (1958). Regan relied
on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain
speakers-veterans organizations-and not a distinction based on the
content or messages of those groups' speech. 461 U.S., at 548; cf.
Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49. The University's regulation now
before us, however, has a speech-based restriction as its sole
rationale and operative principle.
The distinction between the University's own favored message and
the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.
The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction in
the agreement each CIO must sign. See supra, at 2. The University
declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are not
the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and are
not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party
contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own
messages, the University may not silence the expression of
selected viewpoints.
The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint,
funding of speech differs from provision of access to facilities
because money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond
the fact that in any given case this proposition might not be true
as an empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University
could discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded
its availability is wrong as well. The government cannot justify
viewpoint discrimination among private speakers on the economic
fact of scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been
scarce, had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision
would have been no different. It would have been incumbent on the
State, of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on
some acceptable neutral principle; but nothing in our decision
indicated that scarcity would give the State the right to exercise
viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.
Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to
examine publications to determine whether or not they are based on
some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them. The
second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling of
individual thought and expression. That danger is especially real
in the University setting, where the State acts against a
background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the
center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See Healy v.
James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of
Regents, State Univ. of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967); Sweezy v.
New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957). In ancient Athens, and,
as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in
places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as
voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students
to speak and to write and to learn. See generally R. Palmer & J.
Colton, A History of the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The
quality and creative power of student intellectual life to this
day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and
attainment. For the University, by regulation, to cast disapproval
on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of
free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for
the nation's intellectual life, its college and university
campuses.
The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party
contractor payments on behalf of WAP ef-fects a sweeping
restriction on student thought and student inquiry in the context
of University sponsored publications. The prohibition on funding
on behalf of publications that "primarily promot[e] or manifes[t]
a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,"
in its ordinary and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential
reach. The term "promotes" as used here would comprehend any
writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief
in a deity or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining "promote" as "to
contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further,
encourage"). And the term "manifests" would bring within the scope
of the prohibition any writing that is explicable as resting upon
a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate
reality. See id., at 1375 (defining "manifest" as "to show
plainly: make palpably evident or certain by showing or
displaying"). Were the prohibition applied with much vigor at all,
it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical student
contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. And if the
regulation covers, as the University says it does, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which primarily
manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no
ultimate reality, then undergraduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand
Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some of their
major essays excluded from student publications. If any
manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the
writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate
philosophy. Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable
essay on making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did
not point out their (necessary) imperfections.
Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the
regulation invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in
its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their right
of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. It remains to be
considered whether the violation following from the University's
action is excused by the necessity of complying with the
Constitution's prohibition against state establishment of
religion. We turn to that question.
III
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the University had
argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of WAP's
contractors in SAF funding authorization would violate the
Establishment Clause. Indeed, that is the ground on which the
University prevailed in the Court of Appeals. We granted
certiorari on this question: "Whether the Establishment Clause
compels a state university to exclude an otherwise eligible
student publication from participation in the student activities
fund, solely on the basis of its religious viewpoint, where such
exclusion would violate the Speech and Press Clauses if the
viewpoint of the publication were nonreligious." Pet. for Cert. i.
The University now seems to have abandoned this position,
contending that "[t]he fundamental objection to petitioners'
argument is not that it implicates the Establishment Clause but
that it would defeat the ability of public education at all levels
to control the use of public funds." Brief for Respondents 29; see
id., at 27-29, and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University
itself no longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is some
indication that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals rested
its judgment on the point and our dissenting colleagues would find
it determinative, it must be addressed.
The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF support from Wide
Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but
proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by
the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause,
an interest it found compelling. 18 F.3d, at 281. Recognizing that
this Court has regularly "sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary
benefits to religious groups where the government has created open
fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited,"
18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at 277), the Fourth
Circuit asserted that direct monetary subsidization of religious
organizations and projects is "a beast of an entirely different
color," 18 F.3d, at 286. The court declared that the Establishment
Clause would not permit the use of public funds to support "'a
specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially
secular setting.'" Id., at 285 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S.
734, 743 (1973) (emphasis deleted)). It reasoned that because Wide
Awake is "a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion and
advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal
philosophy," the University's provision of SAF funds for its
publication would "send an unmistakably clear signal that the
University of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to
promote the wide promulgation of such values." 18 F.3d, at 286.
If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause retains
its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was
intended to prohibit, we must in each case inquire first into the
purpose and object of the governmental action in question and then
into the practical details of the program's operation. Before
turning to these matters, however, we can set forth certain
general principles that must bear upon our determination.
A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor in
upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment
Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have
decided a series of cases addressing the receipt of government
benefits where religion or religious views are implicated in some
degree. The first case in our modern Establishment Clause
jurisprudence was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1
(1947). There we cautioned that in enforcing the prohibition
against laws respecting establishment of religion, we must "be
sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the government] from
extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens
without regard to their religious belief." Id., at 16. We have
held that the guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended,
when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded
policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and
viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse. See
Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512
U.S. __, __ (1994) (slip op., at 16) (Souter, J.) ("[T]he
principle is well grounded in our case law [and] we have
frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any
benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside
Establishment Clause challenges"); Witters v. Washington Dept. of
Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 487-488 (1986); Mueller v.
Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 398-399 (1983); Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274-275.
More than once have we rejected the position that the
Establishment Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal
to extend free speech rights to religious speakers who participate
in broad-reaching government programs neutral in design. See
Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at __; Mergens, 496 U.S., at 248, 252;
Widmar, supra, at 274-275.
The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There is
no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion
or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a
religious cause. The object of the SAF is to open a forum for
speech and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The University's SAF Guidelines have a
separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments
on behalf of, "religious organizations," which are those "whose
purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged ultimate
reality or deity." Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category of support
here is for "student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or
academic communications media groups," of which Wide Awake was 1
of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did not seek a subsidy because
of its Christian editorial viewpoint; it sought funding as a
student journal, which it was.
The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from
a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of
churches. A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to
Establishment Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the
Republic. The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the
levying of taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive
purpose of establishing and supporting specific sects. The
exaction here, by contrast, is a student activity fee designed to
reflect the reality that student life in its many dimensions
includes the necessity of wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that
student expression is an integral part of the University's
educational mission. The fee is mandatory, and we do not have
before us the question whether an objecting student has the First
Amendment right to demand a pro rata return to the extent the fee
is expended for speech to which he or she does not subscribe. See
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1990); Abood
v. Detroit Board of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 235-236 (1977). We must
treat it, then, as an exaction upon the students. But the $14 paid
each semester by the students is not a general tax designed to
raise revenue for the University. See United States v. Butler, 297
U.S. 1, 61 (1936) ("A tax, in the general understanding of the
term, and as used in the Constitution, signifies an exaction for
the support of the Government"); see also Head Money Cases, 112
U.S. 580, 595-596 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited
purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one
religion. Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes to a
special fund from which any group of students with CIO status can
draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational
mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech,
withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech,
whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view, or
neither. Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an
expenditure from a general tax fund. Here, the disbursements from
the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that
which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and
effected to provide financial support for a church.
Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme in
a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical
difference "between government speech endorsing religion, which
the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses
protect." Mergens, supra, at 250 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). In
this case, "the government has not willfully fostered or
encouraged" any mistaken impression that the student newspapers
speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, ante, at __ (slip op., at 10). The University has
taken pains to disassociate itself from the private speech
involved in this case. The Court of Appeals' apparent concern that
Wide Awake's religious orientation would be attributed to the
University is not a plausible fear, and there is no real
likelihood that the speech in question is being either endorsed or
coerced by the State, see Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, ___
(1992); Witters, supra, at 489 (citing Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S.
668, 688 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)); see also Witters,
supra, at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring)).
The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract from
our decisions the principle that we have recognized special
Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick,
487 U.S. 589, 614-615 (1988); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 742;
Tilton, 403 U.S., at 679-680; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist.
No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968). The error is not in
identifying the principle but in believing that it controls this
case. Even assuming that WAP is no different from a church and
that its speech is the same as the religious exercises conducted
in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the Court of Appeals decided
a case that was, in essence, not before it, and the dissent would
have us do the same. We do not confront a case where, even under a
neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the
government is making direct money payments to an institution or
group that is engaged in religious activity. Neither the Court of
Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes sufficient cognizance
of the undisputed fact that no public funds flow directly to WAP's
coffers.
It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public
university to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral
basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which
use meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some
devotional exercises. See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269; Mergens, 496
U.S., at 252. This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and
repair of the facilities attributed to those uses is paid from a
student activities fund to which students are required to
contribute. Widmar, supra, at 265. The government usually acts by
spending money. Even the provision of a meeting room, as in
Mergens and Widmar, involved governmental expenditure, if only in
the form of electricity and heating or cooling costs. The error
made by the Court of Appeals, as well as by the dissent, lies in
focusing on the money that is undoubtedly expended by the
government, rather than on the nature of the benefit received by
the recipient. If the expenditure of governmental funds is
prohibited whenever those funds pay for a service that is,
pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used by a group for
sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel would
have to be overruled. Given our holdings in these cases, it
follows that a public university may maintain its own computer
facility and give student groups access to that facility,
including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say
first-come-first-served, basis. If a religious student
organization obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and
used a computer to compose or a printer or copy machine to print
speech with a religious content or viewpoint, the State's action
in providing the group with access would no more violate the
Establishment Clause than would giving those groups access to an
assembly hall. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist.,
508 U.S. __ (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens, supra. There is no
difference in logic or principle, and no difference of
constitutional significance, between a school using its funds to
operate a facility to which students have access, and a school
paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. The latter occurs here. The University provides printing
services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as
CIOs by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to
religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular
services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis.
Printing is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student
life.
By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a
further degree of separation from the student publication, for it
avoids the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep,
repair, and replacement attributable to student use, and has a
clear record of costs. As a result, and as in Widmar, the
University can charge the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole,
for the discrete activity in question. It would be formalistic for
us to say that the University must forfeit these advantages and
provide the services itself in order to comply with the
Establishment Clause. It is, of course, true that if the State
pays a church's bills it is subsidizing it, and we must guard
against this abuse. That is not a danger here, based on the
considerations we have advanced and for the additional reason that
the student publication is not a religious institution, at least
in the usual sense of that term as used in our case law, and it is
not a religious organization as used in the University's own
regulations. It is instead a publication involved in a pure forum
for the expression of ideas, ideas that would be both incomplete
and chilled were the Constitution to be interpreted to require
that state officials and courts scan the publication to ferret out
views that principally manifest a belief in a divine being.
Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the
University, in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to
scrutinize the content of student speech, lest the expression in
question-speech otherwise protected by the Constitution-contain
too great a religious content. The dissent, in fact, anticipates
such censorship as "crucial" in distinguishing between "works
characterized by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that
merely happens to express views that a given religion might
approve." Post, at 36. That eventuality raises the specter of
governmental censorship, to ensure that all student writings and
publications meet some baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To
impose that standard on student speech at a university is to
imperil the very sources of free speech and expression. As we
recognized in Widmar, official censorship would be far more
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would
governmental provision of secular printing services on a
religion-blind basis.
"[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [between
'religious' speech and speech 'about' religion] has intelligible
content. There is no indication when 'singing hymns, reading
scripture, and teaching biblical principles' cease to be 'singing,
teaching, and reading'-all apparently forms of 'speech,' despite
their religious subject matter-and become unprotected 'worship.' .
"[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principled line, it is
highly doubtful that it would lie within the judicial competence
to administer. Merely to draw the distinction would require the
university-and ultimately the courts-to inquire into the
significance of words and practices to different religious faiths,
and in varying circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries
would tend inevitably to entangle the State with religion in a
manner forbidden by our cases. E.g., Walz [v. Tax Comm'n of New
York City, 397 U.S. 664 (1970)]." 454 U.S., at 269-270, n. 6
(citations omitted).
* * *
To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the
University to deny eligibility to student publications because of
their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded of the State by the
separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the
University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination
inherent in the University's regulation required public officials
to scan and interpret student publications to discern their
underlying philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and
belief. That course of action was a denial of the right of free
speech and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to
religion, which could undermine the very neutrality the
Establishment Clause requires. There is no Establishment Clause
violation in the University's honoring its duties under the Free
Speech Clause.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring.
"We have time and again held that the government generally may not
treat people differently based on the God or gods they worship, or
don't worship." Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist.
v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ___, ___ (1994) (slip op., at 4) (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). This
insistence on government neutrality toward religion explains why
we have held that schools may not discriminate against religious
groups by denying them equal access to facilities that the schools
make available to all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___ (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454
U.S. 263 (1981). Withholding access would leave an impermissible
perception that religious activities are disfavored: "the message
is one of neutrality rather than endorsement; if a State refused
to let religious groups use facilities open to others, then it
would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility toward religion."
Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,
496 U.S. 226, 248 (1990) (plurality opinion). "The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they
provide no warrant for discriminating against religion." Kiryas
Joel, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (O'Connor, J.). Neutrality,
in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment
Clause.
As Justice Souter demonstrates, however, post, at 6-10, there
exists another axiom in the history and precedent of the
Establishment Clause. "Public funds may not be used to endorse the
religious message." Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 642 (1988)
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also id., at 622 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). Our cases have permitted some government funding of
secular functions performed by sectarian organizations. See, e.
g., id., at 617 (funding for sex education); Roemer v. Board of
Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 741 (1976) (cash grant to
colleges not to be used for "sectarian purposes"); Bradfield v.
Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, 299-300 (1899) (funding of health care for
indigent patients). These decisions, however, provide no precedent
for the use of public funds to finance religious activities.
This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government
neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious
activities. It is clear that the University has established a
generally applicable program to encourage the free exchange of
ideas by its students, an expressive marketplace that includes
some 15 student publications with predictably divergent
viewpoints. It is equally clear that petitioners' viewpoint is
religious and that publication of Wide Awake is a religious
activity, under both the University's regulation and a fair
reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide Awake, according to
petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality by sending a
message of hostility toward religion. To finance Wide Awake,
argues the University, violates the prohibition on direct state
funding of religious activities.
When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably neither
can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical
platitudes is unavailing. Resolution instead depends on the hard
task of judging-sifting through the details and determining
whether the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause.
Such judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine,
based on the particular facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, 598 (1992) ("Our jurisprudence in this area is of
necessity one of line-drawing"). As Justice Holmes observed in a
different context: "Neither are we troubled by the question where
to draw the line. That is the question in pretty much everything
worth arguing in the law. Day and night, youth and age are only
types." Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U.S. 161, 168 (1925) (citation
omitted).
In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481
(1986), for example, we unanimously held that the State may,
through a generally applicable financial aid program, pay a blind
student's tuition at a sectarian theological institution. The
Court so held, however, only after emphasizing that "vocational
assistance provided under the Washington program is paid directly
to the student, who transmits it to the educational institution of
his or her choice." Id., at 487. The benefit to religion under the
program, therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her
government paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the
conflict between the neutrality principle and the funding
prohibition, not by permitting one to trump the other, but by
relying on the elements of choice peculiar to the facts of that
case: "The aid to religion at issue here is the result of
petitioner's private choice. No reasonable observer is likely to
draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself
is endorsing a religious practice or belief." Id., at 493
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See
also Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, ___
(1993) (slip op., at 7-8).
The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents
itself even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,
330 U.S. 1 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest exposition of
the no-funding principle: "No tax in any amount, large or small,
can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions,
whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to
teach or practice religion." Id., at 16. Yet the Court approved
the use of public funds, in a general program, to reimburse
parents for their children's bus fares to attend Catholic schools.
Id., at 17-18. Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's
disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at 19
(Jackson, J., dissenting) ("the most fitting precedent is that of
Julia who, according to Byron's reports, 'whispering "I will ne'er
consent,"-consented'"), the decision reflected the need to rely on
careful judgment-not simple categories-when two principles, of
equal historical and jurisprudential pedigree, come into
unavoidable conflict.
So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not admit of
categorical answers, nor should any be inferred from the Court's
decision today, see ante, at 18. Instead, certain considerations
specific to the program at issue lead me to conclude that by
providing the same assistance to Wide Awake that it does to other
publications, the University would not be endorsing the magazine's
religious perspective.
First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence,
remain strictly independent of the University. The University's
agreement with the Contracted Independent Organizations (CIO)-i.
e., student groups-provides:
"The University is a Virginia public corporation and the CIO is
not part of that corporation, but rather exists and operates
independently of the University. . . . The parties understand and
agree that this Agreement is the only source of any control the
University may have over the CIO or its activities . . . ." App.
27.
And the agreement requires that student organizations include in
every letter, contract, publication, or other written materials
the following disclaimer:
"Although this organization has members who are University of
Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the organization is
independent of the corporation which is the University and which
is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or
omissions." Id., at 28.
Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publication's
independence from the University. Cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.,
at 274, n. 14.
Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that
ensures its use only for permissible purposes. A student
organization seeking assistance must submit disbursement requests;
if approved, the funds are paid directly to the third-party vendor
and do not pass through the organization's coffers. This safeguard
accompanying the University's financial assistance, when provided
to a publication with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake,
ensures that the funds are used only to further the University's
purpose in maintaining a free and robust marketplace of ideas,
from whatever perspective. This feature also makes this case
analogous to a school providing equal access to a generally
available printing press (or other physical facilities), ante, at
23, and unlike a block grant to religious organizations.
Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in a
context that makes improbable any perception of government
endorsement of the religious message. Wide Awake does not exist in
a vacuum. It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for
advertising and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of
these many purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis
by the University, significantly diminishes the danger that the
message of any one publication is perceived as endorsed by the
University. Besides the general news publications, for example,
the University has provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor
magazine that has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire,
and Al-Salam, a publication to "promote a better understanding of
Islam to the University Community," App. 92. Given this wide array
of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious
viewpoints in the forum supported by the University, any
perception that the University endorses one particular viewpoint
would be illogical. This is not the harder case where religious
speech threatens to dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review
and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, ante, at ___ (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Mergens, 496 U.S.,
at 275.
Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note the
possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a Free Speech
Clause challenge by an objecting student that she should not be
compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees. See, e. g.,
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15 (1990); Abood v.
Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209, 236 (1977). There
currently exists a split in the lower courts as to whether such a
challenge would be successful. Compare Hays County Guardian v.
Supple, 969 F.2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S. ___
(1993); Kania v. Fordham, 702 F.2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v.
Associated Students of Univ. of Wash., 86 Wash. 2d 94, 105-106,
542 P. 2d 762, 769 (1975) (en banc), with Smith v. Regents of
Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal. 4th 843, 863-864, 844 P. 2d 500, 513-514,
cert. denied, 510 U.S. ___ (1993). While the Court does not
resolve the question here, see ante, at 20, the existence of such
an opt-out possibility not available to citizens generally, see
Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment),
provides a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the
student fees in this case from proceeds of the general assessments
in support of religion that lie at the core of the prohibition
against religious funding, see ante, at 19-20; post, at 1-3
(Thomas, J., concurring); post, at 6-10 (Souter, J., dissenting),
and from government funds generally. Unlike monies dispensed from
state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is
collected from students who themselves administer the fund and
select qualifying recipients only from among those who originally
paid the fee. The government neither pays into nor draws from this
common pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting
individual students proportional refunds. The Student Activities
Fund, then, represents not government resources, whether derived
from tax revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that
simply belongs to the students.
The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets the
supremacy of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of
the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As
I observed last Term, "[e]xperience proves that the Establishment
Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a
single test." Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of
categorical obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand
Unified Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified.
The Court today does only what courts must do in many
Establishment Clause cases-focus on specific features of a
particular government action to ensure that it does not violate
the Constitution. By withholding from Wide Awake assistance that
the University provides generally to all other student
publications, the University has discriminated on the basis of the
magazine's religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech
Clause. And particular features of the University's program-such
as the explicit disclaimer, the disbursement of funds directly to
third-party vendors, the vigorous nature of the forum at issue,
and the possibility for objecting students to opt out-convince me
that providing such assistance in this case would not carry the
danger of impermissible use of public funds to endorse Wide
Awake's religious message.
Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but I write
separately to express my disagreement with the historical analysis
put forward by the dissent. Although the dissent starts down the
right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment
Clause, its misleading application of history yields a principle
that is inconsistent with our Nation's long tradition of allowing
religious adherents to participate on equal terms in neutral
government programs.
Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called
"Assessment Controversy" was indicative of the principles embodied
in the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the
dissent's conclusion that government must actively discriminate
against religion. The dissent's historical discussion glosses over
the fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill
that sparked the controversy: The assessment was to be imposed for
the support of clergy in the performance of their function of
teaching religion. Thus, the "Bill Establishing a Provision for
Teachers of the Christian Religion" provided for the collection of
a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be appropriated "by
the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each religious society . . .
to a provision for a Minister or Teacher of the Gospel of their
denomination, or the providing places of divine worship, and to
none other use whatsoever." See Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,
330 U.S. 1, 74 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge,
J.).[FOOTNOTE 1]
James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be
understood in this context. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion,
Madison's objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the
premise that religious entities may never participate on equal
terms in neutral government programs. Nor did Madison embrace the
argument that forms the linchpin of the dissent: that monetary
subsidies are constitutionally different from other neutral
benefits programs. Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent
with the neutrality principle that the dissent inexplicably
discards. According to Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed
because it "violate[d] that equality which ought to be the basis
of every law." Madison's Remonstrance  4, reprinted in Everson,
supra, at 66 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). The assessment
violated the "equality" principle not because it allowed religious
groups to participate in a generally available government program,
but because the bill singled out religious entities for special
benefits. See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated the
equality principle "by subjecting some to peculiar burdens" and
"by granting to others peculiar exemptions").
Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson to
take from the Assessment Controversy. For some, the experience in
Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the
Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental
preferences for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord,
Separation of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current
Fiction 20-23 (1982); Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and
Back on Again: A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of
the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the
Reynolds and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L. Rev. 569,
590-591 (1984). Other commentators have rejected this view,
concluding that the Establishment Clause forbids not only
government preferences for some religious sects over others, but
also government preferences for religion over irreligion. See,
e.g., Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A False Claim
About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 875 (1986).
I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the
preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the
fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above. The funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:
"Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion
of all other Sects." Madison's Remonstrance  3, reprinted in
Everson, supra, at 65.
In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the
Remonstrance, "Madison's seventh, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth
arguments all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance,
bigotry, unenlightenment, and persecution that had generally
resulted from previous exclusive religious establishments." Cord,
supra, at 21. The conclusion that Madison saw the principle of
nonestablishment as barring governmental preferences for
particular religious faiths seems especially clear in light of
statements he made in the more-relevant context of the House
debates on the First Amendment. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S.
38, 98 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (Madison's views "as
reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate]
that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the
establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent
discrimination among sects," but not "as requiring neutrality on
the part of government between religion and irreligion").
Moreover, even if more extreme notions of the separation of church
and state can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem
from "arguments reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural
rights, and the social contract between government and a civil
society," Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of
nonestablishment in the Constitution. In any event, the views of
one man do not establish the original understanding of the First
Amendment.
But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this
case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the
history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that
the Establishment Clause "categorically condemn[s] state programs
directly aiding religious activity" when that aid is part of a
neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries. Post,
at 13. Even if Madison believed that the principle of
nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial
support for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits
specifically targeting religion), there is no indication that at
the time of the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that
the government must discriminate against religious adherents by
excluding them from more generally available financial
subsidies.[FOOTNOTE 2]
In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against the
dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary
Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison
prepared an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican
Church. This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and
was not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's
version of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention
to declare that "no man or class of men ought, on account of
religion[,] to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges
29-June 12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson
& W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's
Remonstrance stressed that "just government" is "best supported by
protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with the
same equal hand which protects his person and his property; by
neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering any
Sect to invade those of another." Madison's Remonstrance  8,
reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68; cf. Terrett v. Taylor, 9
Cranch 43, 49 (1815) (holding that the Virginia constitution did
not prevent the government from "aiding the votaries of every sect
to . . . perform their own religious duties," or from
"establishing funds for the support of ministers, for public
charities, for the endowment of churches, or for the sepulture of
the dead").
Stripped of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument
is reduced to the claim that our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence permits neutrality in the context of access to
government facilities but requires discrimination in access to
government funds. The dissent purports to locate the prohibition
against "direct public funding" at the "heart" of the
Establishment Clause, see post, at 17, but this conclusion fails
to confront historical examples of funding that date back to the
time of the founding. To take but one famous example, both Houses
of the First Congress elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong.,
1st Sess., 10 (1820 ed.); H. R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26
(1826 ed.), and that Congress enacted legislation providing for an
annual salary of $500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of
Sept. 22, 1789, ch. 17,   4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a
member of the committee that recommended the chaplain system in
the House. See H. R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of Cong. 891
(1789); Cord, supra, at 25. This same system of "direct public
funding" of congressional chaplains has "continued without
interruption ever since that early session of Congress." Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 788 (1983).[FOOTNOTE 3]
The historical evidence of government support for religious
entities through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As
the dissent concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies
"have been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the
interests represented by the Establishment Clause." Post, at 20,
n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
676-680 (1970)).[FOOTNOTE 4] In my view, the dissent's acceptance
of this tradition puts to rest the notion that the Establishment
Clause bars monetary aid to religious groups even when the aid is
equally available to other groups. A tax exemption in many cases
is economically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct
monetary subsidy.[FOOTNOTE 5] In one instance, the government
relieves religious entities (along with others) of a generally
applicable tax; in the other, it relieves religious entities
(along with others) of some or all of the burden of that tax by
returning it in the form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is
provided at the front or back end of the taxation process, the
financial aid to religious groups is undeniable. The analysis
under the Establishment Clause must also be the same: "Few
concepts are more deeply embedded in the fabric of our national
life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary colonial times, than for
the government to exercise at the very least this kind of
benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious exercise . . .
Consistent application of the dissent's "no-aid" principle would
require that "'a church could not be protected by the police and
fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair.'"
Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. ___, ___
(1993) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
274-275 (1981)). The dissent admits that "evenhandedness may
become important to ensuring that religious interests are not
inhibited." Post, at 18, n. 5. Surely the dissent must concede,
however, that the same result should obtain whether the government
provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing the
costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or by
establishing a public fire department. If churches may benefit on
equal terms with other groups in the latter program-that is, if a
public fire department may extinguish fires at churches-then they
may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.
Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless
disarray, this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic
principle that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of
consensus: The Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious
groups from government benefits programs that are generally
available to a broad class of participants. See Lamb's Chapel v.
Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___ (1993);
Zobrest, supra; Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist.
66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990); Texas Monthly, Inc. v.
Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989); Witters v. Washington Dept. of
Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463
U.S. 388 (1983); Widmar, supra. Under the dissent's view, however,
the University of Virginia may provide neutral access to the
University's own printing press, but it may not provide the same
service when the press is owned by a third party. Not
surprisingly, the dissent offers no logical justification for this
conclusion, and none is evident in the text or original meaning of
the First Amendment.
If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents
benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's
Student Activities Fund, it must also be offended when they
receive the same benefits in the form of in-kind subsidies. The
constitutional demands of the Establishment Clause may be judged
against either a baseline of "neutrality" or a baseline of "no aid
to religion," but the appropriate baseline surely cannot depend on
the fortuitous circumstances surrounding the form of aid. The
contrary rule would lead to absurd results that would jettison
centuries of practice respecting the right of religious adherents
to participate on neutral terms in a wide variety of
government-funded programs.
Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to
participate in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to
the class of "essential public benefits" identified by the
dissent. See post, at 18, n. 5. A broader tradition can be traced
at least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the
Northwest Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1
Stat. 50. Article III of that famous enactment of the
Confederation Congress had provided: "Religion, morality, and
knowledge . . . being necessary to good government and the
happiness of mankind, schools and the means of learning shall
forever be encouraged." Id., at 52, n. (a). Congress subsequently
set aside federal lands in the Northwest Territory and other
territories for the use of schools. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3,
1803, ch. 21,   1, 2 Stat. 225-226; Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35,
 5, 2 Stat. 279; Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14,   10, 2 Stat. 621;
Act of Apr. 18, 1818, ch. 67,   6, 3 Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20,
1818, ch. 126,   2, 3 Stat. 467. Many of the schools that enjoyed
the benefits of these land grants undoubtedly were
church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there was no
requirement that the schools be "public." See C. Antieau, A.
Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal Establishment,
Formation and Early History of the First Amendment Religion
Clauses 163 (1964). Nevertheless, early Congresses found no
problem with the provision of such neutral benefits. See also id.,
at 174 (noting that "almost universally[,] Americans from 1789 to
1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion and
religiously oriented educational institutions").
Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been
available to religious adherents on neutral terms. Several
examples may be found in the work of early Congresses, including
copyright protection for "the author and authors of any map,
chart, book or books," Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15,   1, 1 Stat.
124, 124, and a privilege allowing "every printer of newspapers
[to] send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers
within the United States, free of postage," Act of Feb. 20, 1792,
ch. 7,   21, 1 Stat. 232, 238. Neither of these laws made any
exclusion for the numerous authors or printers who manifested a
belief in or about a deity. Thus, history provides an answer for
the constitutional question posed by this case, but it is not the
one given by the dissent. The dissent identifies no evidence that
the Framers intended to disable religious entities from
participating on neutral terms in evenhanded government programs.
The evidence that does exist points in the opposite direction and
provides ample support for today's decision.
JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.
The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding of
core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does so,
however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar
principles of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment
and Speech Clauses, and by viewing the very funds in question as
beyond the reach of the Establishment Clause's funding
restrictions as such. Because there is no warrant for
distinguishing among public funding sources for purposes of
applying the First Amendment's prohibition of religious
establishment, I would hold that the University's refusal to
support petitioners' religious activities is compelled by the
Establishment Clause. I would therefore affirm.
I
The central question in this case is whether a grant from the
Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses
would violate the Establishment Clause. Although the Court does
not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes
something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand
Establishment Clause scrutiny. Although the Court places great
stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious
activities for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it
recognizes that such evenhanded availability is not by itself
enough to satisfy constitutional requirements for any aid scheme
that results in a benefit to religion. Ante, at 18; see also ante,
at 1-3 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Something more is necessary to
justify any religious aid. Some members of the Court, at least,
may think the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect,
since the money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide
Awake's own checking account. The Court's principal reliance,
however, is on an argument that providing religion with
economically valuable services is permissible on the theory that
services are economically indistinguishable from religious access
to governmental speech forums, which sometimes is permissible. But
this reasoning would commit the Court to approving direct
religious aid beyond anything justifiable for the sake of access
to speaking forums. The Court implicitly recognizes this in its
further attempt to circumvent the clear bar to direct governmental
aid to religion. Different members of the Court seek to avoid this
bar in different ways. The opinion of the Court makes the novel
assumption that only direct aid financed with tax revenue is
barred, and draws the erroneous conclusion that the involuntary
Student Activities Fee is not a tax. I do not read Justice
O'Connor's opinion as sharing that assumption; she places this
Student Activities Fund in a category of student funding
enterprises from which religious activities in public universities
may benefit, so long as there is no consequent endorsement of
religion. The resulting decision is in unmistakable tension with
the accepted law that the Court continues to avow.
A
The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a closer
look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords. The
character of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the opening
page of the first issue, where the editor-in-chief announces Wide
Awake's mission in a letter to the readership signed, "Love in
Christ": it is "to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed,
according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students to
consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means."
App. 45. The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation,
that "[t]he hour has come for you to awake from your slumber,
because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11."
Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on the
editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call to accept
salvation:
"The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and
repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware
of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and
condemn sin, or else they fail in their duty of love." Mourad &
Prince, A Love/Hate Relationship, November/December 1990, p. 3.
"When you get to the final gate, the Lord will be handing out
boarding passes, and He will examine your ticket. If, in your
lifetime, you did not request a seat on His Friendly Skies Flyer
by trusting Him and asking Him to be your pilot, then you will not
be on His list of reserved seats (and the Lord will know you not).
You will not be able to buy a ticket then; no amount of money or
desire will do the trick. You will be met by your chosen pilot and
flown straight to Hell on an express jet (without air conditioning
or toilets, of course)." Ace, The Plane Truth, id., at 3.
"'Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.'
(Mark 16:15) The Great Commission is the prime-directive for our
lives as Christians . . . ." Liu, Christianity and the Five-legged
Stool, September/October 1991, p. 3.
"The Spirit provides access to an intimate relationship with the
Lord of the Universe, awakens our minds to comprehend spiritual
truth and empowers us to serve as effective ambassadors for the
Lord Jesus in our earthly lives." Buterbaugh, A Spiritual
Advantage, March/April 1991, p. 21.
There is no need to quote further from articles of like tenor, but
one could examine such other examples as religious poetry, see
Macpherson, I Have Started Searching for Angels, November/December
1990, p. 18; religious textual analysis and commentary, see
Buterbaugh, Colossians 1:1-14: Abundant Life, id., at 20;
Buterbaugh, John 14-16: A Spiritual Advantage, March/April, pp.
20-21; and instruction on religious practice, see Early,
Thanksgiving and Prayer, November/December 1990, p. 21 (providing
readers with suggested prayers and posing contemplative questions
about biblical texts); Early, Hope and Spirit, March/April 1991,
p. 21 (similar).
Even featured essays on facially secular topics become platforms
from which to call readers to fulfill the tenets of Christianity
in their lives. Although a piece on racism has some general
discussion on the subject, it proceeds beyond even the analysis
and interpretation of biblical texts to conclude with the counsel
to take action because that is the Christian thing to do:
"God calls us to take the risks of voluntarily stepping out of our
comfort zones and to take joy in the whole richness of our
inheritance in the body of Christ. We must take the love we
receive from God and share it with all peoples of the world.
"Racism is a disease of the heart, soul, and mind, and only when
it is extirpated from the individual consciousness and replaced
with the love and peace of God will true personal and communal
healing begin." Liu, et al., "Eracing" Mistakes, November/December
1990, p. 14.
The same progression occurs in an article on eating disorders,
which begins with descriptions of anorexia and bulimia and ends
with this religious message:
"As thinking people who profess a belief in God, we must grasp
firmly the truth, the reality of who we are because of Christ.
Christ is the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Through Him, we are full.
He alone can provide the ultimate source of spiritual fulfillment
which permeates the emotional, psychological, and physical
dimensions of our lives." Ferguson & Lassiter, From Calorie to
Calvary, September/October 1991, p. 14.
This writing is no merely descriptive examination of religious
doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's
social and personal problems. Nor is it merely the expression of
editorial opinion that incidentally coincides with Christian
ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is
straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with God
as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral
obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These are
not the words of "student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] . . ." (in the language
of the University's funding criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a), but the words of "challenge [to] Christians to live, in word
and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and . . . to
consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means" (in
the language of Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject is not
the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room, but of
the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is nothing
other than the preaching of the word, which (along with the
sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer those
called to the religious life.
Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the
word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause,
and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was
meant to bar this use of public money. Evidence on the subject
antedates even the Bill of Rights itself, as may be seen in the
writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the
meaning of the Establishment Clause is well settled, e.g.,
Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S.
756, 770, n. 28 (1973); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S.
1, 13 (1947). Four years before the First Congress proposed the
First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy of
using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial and
Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played the
central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment
bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses
stand:
"Who does not see that . . . the same authority which can force a
citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the
support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any
other establishment in all cases whatsoever?" James Madison,
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments  3
(hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson, supra,
at 65-66 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).
Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony
had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n. 8,
the practice having become "so commonplace as to shock the
freedom-loving colonials into a feeling of abhorrence," 330 U.S.,
at 11 (footnote omitted). Madison's Remonstrance captured the
colonists'"conviction that individual religious liberty could be
achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power
to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions,
or to interfere with the beliefs of any religious individual or
group." Ibid.[FOOTNOTE 1] Their sentiment as expressed by Madison
in Virginia, led not only to the defeat of Virginia's tax
assessment bill, but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill
for Establishing Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson.
That bill's preamble declared that "to compel a man to furnish
contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical," Jefferson, A Bill for
Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's
Constitution 84-85 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its
text provided "[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or
support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever . . .
recognized that the provisions of the First Amendment, in the
drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson played such
leading roles, had the same objective and were intended to provide
the same protection against governmental intrusion on religious
liberty as the Virginia statute." Ibid.; see also Laycock,
"Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original
Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 921, 923 (1986) ("[I]f the
debates of the 1780's support any proposition, it is that the
Framers opposed government financial support for religion. . . .
They did not substitute small taxes for large taxes; three pence
was as bad as any larger sum. The principle was what mattered.
With respect to money, religion was to be wholly voluntary.
Churches either would support themselves or they would not, but
the government would neither help nor interfere") (footnote
omitted); T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time of
the framing of the Bill of Rights, "[t]he belief that government
assistance to religion, especially in the form of taxes, violated
religious liberty had a long history"); J. Choper, Securing
Religious Liberty 16 (1995) ("There is broad consensus that a
central threat to the religious freedom of individuals and
groups-indeed, in the judgment of many the most serious
infringement upon religious liberty-is posed by forcing them to
pay taxes in support of a religious establishment or religious
activities") (footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted).[FOOTNOTE 2]
The principle against direct funding with public money is patently
violated by the contested use of today's student activity
fee.[FOOTNOTE 3] Like today's taxes generally, the fee is
Madison's threepence. The University exercises the power of the
State to compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble,
supra, and the use of any part of it for the direct support of
religious activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly held to
be the heart of the prohibition on establishment. Everson, 330
U.S., at 15- 16 ("The 'establishment of religion clause' . . .
means at least this . . . . No tax in any amount, large or small,
can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions,
whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to
teach or practice religion"); see School Dist. of Grand Rapids v.
Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 385 (1985) ("Although Establishment Clause
jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does
absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored
indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith");
Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780 ("In
the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state
aid derived from public funds will be used exclusively for
secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, it is clear from
our cases that direct aid in whatever form is invalid"); id., at
772 ("Primary among those evils" against which the Establishment
Clause guards "have been sponsorship, financial support, and
active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity")
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Lee v.
Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 640 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The
coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of
religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial
support by force of law and threat of penalty") (emphasis
omitted); cf. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 103-104 (1968) (holding
that taxpayers have an adequate stake in the outcome of
Establishment Clause litigation to satisfy Article III standing
requirements, after stating that "[o]ur history vividly
illustrates that one of the specific evils feared by those who
drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was
that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one
religion over another or to support religion in general").
The Court, accordingly, has never before upheld direct state
funding of the sort of proselytizing published in Wide Awake and,
in fact, has categorically condemned state programs directly
aiding religious activity, School Dist. v. Ball, supra, at 395
(striking programs providing secular instruction to nonpublic
school students on nonpublic school premises because they are
"indistinguishable from the provision of a direct cash subsidy to
the religious school that is most clearly prohibited under the
Establishment Clause"); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229, 254 (1977)
(striking field trip aid program because it constituted "an
impermissible direct aid to sectarian education"); Meek v.
Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 365 (1975) (striking material and
equipment loan program to nonpublic schools because of the
inability to "channe[l] aid to the secular without providing
direct aid to the sectarian"); Committee for Public Education v.
Nyquist, supra, at 774 (striking aid to nonpublic schools for
maintenance and repair of facilities because "[n]o attempt is made
to restrict payments to those expenditures related to the upkeep
of facilities used exclusively for secular purposes"); Levitt v.
Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472, 480
(1973) (striking aid to nonpublic schools for state-mandated tests
because the state had failed to "assure that the state-supported
activity is not being used for religious indoctrination"); Tilton
v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 683 (1971) (plurality opinion)
(striking as insufficient a 20-year limit on prohibition for
religious use in federal construction program for university
facilities because unrestricted use even after 20 years "is in
effect a contribution of some value to a religious body"); id., at
689 (Douglas, Black, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and
dissenting in part).
Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing
both secular and sectarian functions, it has always made a
searching enquiry to ensure that the institution kept the secular
activities separate from its sectarian ones, with any direct aid
flowing only to the former and never the latter. Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615 (1988) (upholding grant program
for services related to premarital adolescent sexual relations on
ground that funds cannot be "used by the grantees in such a way as
to advance religion"); Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426
U.S. 736, 746-748, 755, 759-761 (1976) (plurality opinion)
(upholding general aid program restricting uses of funds to
secular activities only); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 742-745
(1973) (upholding general revenue bond program excluding from
participation facilities used for religious purposes); Tilton v.
Richardson, supra, at 679-682 (plurality opinion) (upholding
general aid program for construction of academic facilities as
"[t]here is no evidence that religion seeps into the use of any of
these facilities"); see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 244-248 (1968) (upholding textbook loan
program limited to secular books requested by individual students
for secular educational purposes).
Reasonable minds may differ over whether the Court reached the
correct result in each of these cases, but their common principle
has never been questioned or repudiated. "Although Establishment
Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause
does absolutely prohibit government-financed . . . indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith." School Dist. v.
Ball, 473 U.S., at 385.
B
Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts
and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear
constitutional violation? The answer must be in part that the
Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding
section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively
to Wide Awake's "Christian viewpoint," ante, at 4, or its
"religious perspective," ante, at 11, and in distinguishing
funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court
maintains that "[Wide Awake] is not a religious institution, at
least in the usual sense," ante, at 24;[FOOTNOTE 4] see also ante,
at 5. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint
Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any
of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the
religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the
suggested prayers. And so it is easy for the Court to lose sight
of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so
obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic
character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious
points of view.
Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide
Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently
religious about the magazine to require examination under the
Establishment Clause, and one may therefore ask why the
unequivocal prohibition on direct funding does not lead the Court
to conclude that funding would be unconstitutional. The answer is
that the Court focuses on a subsidiary body of law, which it
correctly states but ultimately misapplies. That subsidiary body
of law accounts for the Court's substantial attention to the fact
that the University's funding scheme is "neutral," in the formal
sense that it makes funds available on an evenhanded basis to
secular and sectarian applicants alike. Ante, at 18-20. While this
is indeed true and relevant under our cases, it does not alone
satisfy the requirements of the Establishment Clause, as the Court
recognizes when it says that evenhandedness is only a "significant
factor" in certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a
dispositive one. Ante, at 18; see ante, at 19-20; see also ante,
at 1-3 (O'Connor, J., concurring); id., at 2 ("Neutrality, in both
form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause");
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, ___ U.S. ___,
___ (slip op., at 6) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment) ("the Establishment Clause forbids a
State from hiding behind the application of formally neutral
criteria and remaining studiously oblivious to the effects of its
actions. . . . [N]ot all State policies are permissible under the
Religion Clauses simply because they are neutral in form"). This
recognition reflects the Court's appreciation of two general
rules: that whenever affirmative government aid ultimately
benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires some
justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part; and
that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even if
accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at the
very heart of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 22 ("We do not
confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes
nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money
payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious
activity"); ante, at 19-20, 23-24; see also ante, at 2 (O'Connor,
J., concurring) ("[Our] decisions . . . provide no precedent for
the use of public funds to finance religious activities").
In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules
but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those
rules in greater detail than the Court does. As the foregoing
quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship
between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of
evenhandedness when affirmative government aid does result in some
benefit to religion reflects the relationship between basic rule
and marginal criterion. At the heart of the Establishment Clause
stands the prohibition against direct public funding, but that
prohibition does not answer the questions that occur at the
margins of the Clause's application. Is any government activity
that provides any incidental benefit to religion likewise
unconstitutional? Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning
churches, wrong to pay the bus fares of students on the way to
parochial schools, wrong to allow a grantee of special education
funds to spend them at a religious college? These are the
questions that call for drawing lines, and it is in drawing them
that evenhandedness becomes important. However the Court may in
the past have phrased its line-drawing test, the question whether
such benefits are provided on an evenhanded basis has been
relevant, for the question addresses one aspect of the issue
whether a law is truly neutral with respect to religion (that is,
whether the law either "advance[s] [or] inhibit[s] religion,"
Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, American Civil
Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592 (1989)). In Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274 (1981), for example, we noted that "[t]he
provision of benefits to [a] broad . . . spectrum of [religious
and nonreligious] groups is an important index of secular effect."
See also Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.
Grumet, 512 U.S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 14-17) (1994). In the
doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding), where
there is initially room for argument about a law's effect,
evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly
advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively.
Evenhandedness is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into
the constitutionality of a doubtful law,[FOOTNOTE 5] but
evenhandedness goes no further. It does not guarantee success
under Establishment Clause scrutiny.
Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen,
463 U.S. 388 (1983), Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for
Blind, 474 U.S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U.S. 1 (1993), are among the latest of those to
illustrate this relevance of evenhandedness when advancement is
not so obvious as to be patently unconstitutional. Each case
involved a program in which benefits given to individuals on a
religion-neutral basis ultimately were used by the individuals, in
one way or another, to support religious institutions.[FOOTNOTE 6]
In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a
neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program
at issue. Witters, supra, at 487-488; Mueller, supra, at 397-399;
Zobrest, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7-8). But the significance of
evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases,
hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.
Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might be
sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional. Quite
the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was the
fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious institutions
"only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices
of aid recipients," Witters, supra, at 487; see also Mueller,
supra, at 399-400; Zobrest, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 7-12).
In noting and relying on this particular feature of each of the
programs at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on
direct funding of religious activities. See Zobrest, supra, at
___-___ (slip op., at 9-12); Witters, supra, at 487; see also
Mueller, supra, at 399-400. Thus, our holdings in these cases were
little more than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that
"a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may
then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious
institution, all without constitutional barrier . . . ." Witters,
supra, at 486-487. Such "attenuated financial benefit[s],
ultimately controlled by the private choices of individual[s]," we
have found, are simply not within the contemplation of the
Establishment Clause's broad prohibition. Mueller, supra, at 400;
see also Witters, supra, at 493 (opinion of O'Connor,
J.).[FOOTNOTE 7]
Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit
is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient
condition of constitutionality for direct financial support of
religious proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly
repudiated any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down
to a mere prohibition against unequal direct aid. See, e.g.,
Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 682-684 (striking portion of
general aid program providing grants for construction of college
and university facilities to the extent program made possible the
use of funds for sectarian activities);[FOOTNOTE 8] Wolman v.
Walter, 433 U.S., at 252-255 (striking funding of field trips for
nonpublic school students, such as are "provided to public school
students in the district," because of unacceptable danger that
state funds would be used to foster religion). And nowhere has the
Court's adherence to the preeminence of the no-direct-funding
principle over the principle of evenhandedness been as clear as in
Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589.
Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act
(AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions
for counseling and educational services related to adolescent
sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the litigation, 141 grants
had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular
and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597. In an
Establishment Clause challenge to the Act brought by taxpayers and
other interested parties, the District Court resolved the case on
a pre-trial motion for summary judgment, holding the AFLA program
unconstitutional both on its face and also insofar as religious
institutions were involved in receiving grants under the Act. When
this Court reversed on the issue of facial constitutionality under
the Establishment Clause, id., at 602-618, we said that there was
"no intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some
grantees, religious uses are permitted." Id., at 614. On the
contrary, after looking at the legislative history and applicable
regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure that grants
would not be "used by . . . grantees in such a way as to advance
religion." Id., at 615.
With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional as
applied, we remanded the case to the District Court "for
consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as it
sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently being
administered." Id., at 621. Specifically, we told the District
Court, on remand, to "consider . . . whether in particular cases
AFLA aid has been used to fund 'specifically religious
activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially secular setting.'"
Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 743. In giving
additional guidance to the District Court, we suggested that
application of the Act would be unconstitutional if it turned out
that aid recipients were using materials "that have an explicitly
religious content or are designed to inculcate the views of a
particular religious faith." Ibid. At no point in our opinion did
we suggest that the breadth of potential recipients, or
distribution on an evenhanded basis, could have justified the use
of federal funds for religious activities, a position that would
have made no sense after we had pegged the Act's facial
constitutionality to our conclusion that advancement of religion
was not inevitable. Justice O'Connor's separate opinion in the
case underscored just this point: "I fully agree . . . that
'[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse the religious message.'
Post, at 642 [(Blackmun, J., dissenting)]. . . . [A]ny use of
public funds to promote religious doctrines violates the
Establishment Clause." Id., at 622-623 (concurring opinion)
(emphasis in original).
Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Everson v. Board
of Ed., 330 U.S., at 16-18, Board of Ed. v. Allen, 392 U.S., at
243-249, Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 678-682, Hunt v.
McNair, 413 U.S., at 742-745, and Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of
Md., 426 U.S., at 759-761. Each of these cases involved a general
aid program that provided benefits to a broad array of secular and
sectarian institutions on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them
was that fact dispositive. The plurality opinion in Roemer made
this point exactly:
"The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and a facial
neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is lending
direct support to a religious activity. The State may not, for
example, pay for what is actually a religious education, even
though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even though
it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions
alike." 426 U.S., at 747 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).
Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aid cases,
as in Bowen, was whether secular activities could be separated
from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that aid would flow
to the secular alone.
Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve the standard thus
exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished
the indirect aid in issue from contrasting examples in the line of
cases striking down direct aid, and each thereby expressly
preserved the core constitutional principle that direct aid to
religion is impermissible. See Zobrest, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 9-12) (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, and
School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, and noting that "'[t]he state
may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind,
where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the
religious school'") (quoting Witters, 474 U.S., at 487); see also
ibid.; Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399. It appears that the University
perfectly understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule
over the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short of
funding "any activity which primarily promotes or manifests a
particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality."[FOOTNOTE 9] App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
C
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of
evenhandedness is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the
constitutionality of providing a government benefit that reaches
religion, the Court must identify some further element in the
funding scheme that does demonstrate its permissibility. For one
reason or another, the Court's chosen element appears to be the
fact that under the University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the
printer chosen by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself.
Ante, at 22-24.
1
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding
program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and
Zobrest (discussed supra, at 18-19), the Court has misread those
cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit
religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between
the government and a religious institution. See Witters, 474 U.S.,
at 487; see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400; Zobrest, 509 U.S.,
at ___-___ (slip op., at 7-12). Here there is no third party
standing between the government and the ultimate religious
beneficiary to break the circuit by its independent discretion to
put state money to religious use. The printer, of course, has no
option to take the money and use it to print a secular journal
instead of Wide Awake. It only gets the money because of its
contract to print a message of religious evangelism at the
direction of Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for
doing precisely that. The formalism of distinguishing between
payment to Wide Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment
of the approved bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of
Constitutional law. If this indeed were a critical distinction,
the Constitution would permit a State to pay all the bills of any
religious institution;[FOOTNOTE 10] in fact, despite the Court's
purported adherence to the no-direct-funding principle, the State
could simply hand out credit cards to religious institutions and
honor the monthly statements (so long as someone could devise an
evenhanded umbrella to cover the whole scheme). Witters and the
other cases cannot be distinguished out of existence this way.
2
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the
printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On
this purported justification, the payment to the printer is
significant only as the last step in an argument resting on the
assumption that a public university may give a religious group the
use of any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular
groups are likewise eligible. The Court starts with the cases of
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), Board of Ed. of Westside
Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990), and Lamb's
Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ___
(1993), in which religious groups were held to be entitled to
access for speaking in government buildings open generally for
that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability of a forum
has economic value (the government built and maintained the
building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall); and that
economically there is no difference between the University's
provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the
University's printing equipment; and that therefore the University
must be able to provide the use of the latter. Since it may do
that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw
the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what
the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's
own printing equipment. Ante, at 23-24.
The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its
troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon to
support it. The common factual thread running through Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution
created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or
college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude
speakers with religious messages. See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46 (1983) (forum
analysis). In each case the restriction was struck down either as
an impermissible attempt to regulate the content of speech in an
open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens) or to suppress a particular
religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's Chapel, see infra, at 37-38). In
each case, to be sure, the religious speaker's use of the room
passed muster as an incident of a plan to facilitate speech
generally for a secular purpose, entailing neither secular
entanglement with religion nor risk that the religious speech
would be taken to be the speech of the government or that the
government's endorsement of a religious message would be inferred.
But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable Speech Clause
doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation Army, the
millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker in a
public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the model
of the street corner that supplied the justification going beyond
the requirement of evenhandedness.
The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is
ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While they do
indeed allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on
the recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street
corner (even though the State paves the roads and provides police
protection to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between
the public street corner and open classroom space. Thus, the Court
found it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in
traditional speech activities in these forums, too, even though
the rooms (like street corners) require some incidental state
spending to maintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely,
however, if the cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote
them, to cover more than forums for literal speaking. There is no
traditional street corner printing provided by the government on
equal terms to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to
a higher plane of generalization without admitting that new
economic benefits are being extended directly to religion in clear
violation of the principle barring direct aid. The argument from
economic equivalence thus breaks down on recognizing that the
direct state aid it would support is not mitigated by the street
corner analogy in the service of free speech. Absent that, the
rule against direct aid stands as a bar to printing services as
well as printers.
3
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads
the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third
attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law,
but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways
that make further affirmative justification unnecessary.  Justice
O'Connor makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which the
activity fee is assessed and distributed. She concludes that the
funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of
governmental treasuries generally that it falls outside
Establishment Clause's purview in the absence of a message of
religious endorsement (which she finds not to be present). Ante,
at 4-8 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The opinion of the Court
concludes more expansively that the activity fee is not a tax, and
then proceeds to find the aid permissible on the legal assumption
that the bar against direct aid applies only to aid derived from
tax revenue. I have already indicated why it is fanciful to treat
the fee as anything but a tax, supra, at 11-12, and n. 3; see also
ante, at 20 (noting mandatory nature of the fee), and will not
repeat the point again. The novelty of the assumption that the
direct aid bar only extends to aid derived from taxation, however,
requires some response.
Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write in
the first instance, the Court has never held that government
resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct
religious support, and our cases on direct government aid have
frequently spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues.
E.g., School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385 ("Although
Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few
absolutes, the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed
or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a
particular religious faith"); Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780 ("In the
absence of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid
derived from public funds will be used exclusively for secular,
neutral, and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases
that direct aid in whatever form is invalid"); id., at 772
("Primary among those evils" against which the Establishment
Clause guards "have been sponsorship, financial support, and
active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity")
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also T.
Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time of the framing
of the Bill of Rights, "[t]he belief that government assistance to
religion, especially in the form of taxes, violated religious
liberty had a long history").
Allowing non-tax funds to be spent on religion would, in fact, fly
in the face of clear principle. Leaving entirely aside the
question whether public non-tax revenues could ever be used to
finance religion without violating the endorsement test, see
Allegheny County v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at
593-594, any such use of them would ignore one the dual objectives
of the Establishment Clause, which was meant not only to protect
individuals and their republics from the destructive consequences
of mixing government and religion, but to protect religion from a
corrupting dependence on support from the Government. Engel v.
Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's
"first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a
union of government and religion tends to destroy government and
to degrade religion"); Everson, 330 U.S., at 53 (Rutledge, J.,
dissenting) ("The great condition of religious liberty is that it
be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other
interferences, by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that
secular foundation it vanishes with the resting") (citing
Madison's Remonstrance   7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at
63-72 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)); School Dist. of
Abington v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 259 (1963) (Brennan, J.,
concurring) ("It is not only the nonbeliever who fears the
injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil
polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears
the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved
with and dependent upon the government") (footnote omitted);
Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in
5 The Founder's Constitution, at 84-85. Since the corrupting
effect of government support does not turn on whether the
Government's own money comes from taxation or gift or the sale of
public lands, the Establishment Clause could hardly relax its
vigilance simply because tax revenue was not implicated.
Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal, one can
only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate one half of
the Establishment Clause's justification.
D
Nothing in the Court's opinion would lead me to end this enquiry
into the application of the Establishment Clause any differently
from the way I began it. The Court is ordering an instrumentality
of the State to support religious evangelism with direct funding.
This is a flat violation of the Establishment Clause.
II
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause's bar to
funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether in
the absence of this bar the University would violate the Free
Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has done. Widmar, 454
U.S., at 271 (university's compliance with its Establishment
Clause obligations can be a compelling interest justifying speech
restriction). But the Court's speech analysis may have independent
application, and its flaws should not pass unremarked.
The Court acknowledges, ante, at 11, the necessity for a
university to make judgments based on the content of what may be
said or taught when it decides, in the absence of unlimited
amounts of money or other resources, how to honor its educational
responsibilities. Widmar, supra, at 276; cf. Perry, 460 U.S., at
49 (subject matter and speaker identity distinctions "are inherent
and inescapable in the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to
activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property").
Nor does the Court generally question that in allocating public
funds a state university enjoys spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194 (1991) ("[W]hen the government
appropriates public funds to establish a program it is entitled to
define the limits of that program"); Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540 (1983) (upholding government
subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker).[FOOTNOTE
11] Accordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry in
this case is not merely whether the University bases its funding
decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if there is an
infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision, it
must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing among
competing viewpoints, ante, at 8-9, citing, inter alia, Perry,
supra, at 46; see also Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at, ___ (slip op.,
at 8-9) (subject matter distinctions permissible in controlling
access to limited public forum if reasonable and viewpoint
neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 806 (1985) (similar); Regan, supra, at 548.[FOOTNOTE 12]
The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not
turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be
applied to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint;
the issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is
explained by reference to viewpoint. See Cornelius, supra, at 806
("[T]he government violates the First Amendment when it denies
access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he
espouses on an otherwise includible subject"). As when deciding
whether a speech restriction is content-based or content-neutral,
"[t]he government's purpose is the controlling consideration."
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989); see also
ibid. (content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech
restriction is "justified without reference to the content of the
regulated speech") (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted). So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive
noise ordinance by pulling the plug on a rock band using a
forbidden amplification system is not guilty of viewpoint
discrimination simply because the band wishes to use that
equipment to espouse antiracist views. Accord, Rock Against
Racism, supra. Nor does a municipality's decision to prohibit
political advertising on bus placards amount to viewpoint
discrimination when in the course of applying this policy it
denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor of a
particular political candidate. Accord, Lehman v. Shaker Heights,
418 U.S. 298, 304 (1974) (plurality opinion).
Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves
that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to bar
the government from skewing public debate. Other things being
equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one
message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably
be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,
435 U.S. 765, 785-786 (1978) ("Especially where . . . the
legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give
one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing
its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended")
(footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176 (1976) ("To
permit one side of a debatable public question to have a monopoly
in expressing its views . . . is the antithesis of constitutional
guarantees") (footnote omitted); United States v. Kokinda, 497
U.S. 720, 736 (1990) (viewpoint discrimination involves an
"inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another")
(plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted). It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public
debate that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the
most pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if
government assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality
requires it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as
well.
There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's
application of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under
those Guidelines, a "religious activit[y]," which is not eligible
for funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is "an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality," App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. It is
clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions was
denied funding. Letter from Student Council to Ronald W.
Rosenberger. App. 54 ("In reviewing the request by Wide Awake
Productions, the Appropriations Committee determined your
organization's request could not be funded as it is a religious
activity"). The discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at 3-6,
shows beyond any question that it "primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity . . . ," in the very
specific sense that its manifest function is to call students to
repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular moral
action because of its Christian character.
If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only such
Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that might
compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.
But that is not what the regulation authorizes; it applies to
Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.
And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting
a particular belief not only "in" but "about" a deity or ultimate
reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists as well as it does
to deists and theists (as the University maintained at oral
argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes, see
ante, at 15-16). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide
Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not its
competitors. As understood by their application to Wide Awake,
they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that "primarily
promotes or manifests" any view on the merits of religion; they
deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious
apologetics.
The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while
I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the
important point is that even on the Court's own construction the
Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to
demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding
restrictions might have on learning in our nation's universities,
the Court describes the Guidelines as "a sweeping restriction on
student thought and student inquiry," disentitling a vast array of
topics to funding. Ante, at 15-16. As the Court reads the
Guidelines to exclude "any writing that is explicable as resting
upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or
ultimate reality," as well as "those student journalistic efforts
which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no
deity and no ultimate reality," the Court concludes that the major
works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred from the
funding forum. Ante, at 15-16. The Court goes so far as to suggest
that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate nothing much
more than essays on "making pasta or peanut butter cookies . . .
Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court
protests. The Court reads the word "primarily" ("primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality") right out of the Guidelines, whereas it
is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens to
express views that a given religion might approve, or simply
descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a
given religion. But, as I said, that is not the important point.
Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding
restriction's categorical breadth, the stringency of the
restriction would most certainly not work any impermissible
viewpoint discrimination under any prior understanding of that
species of content discrimination. If a University wished to fund
no speech beyond the subjects of pasta and cookie preparation, it
surely would not be discriminating on the basis of someone's
viewpoint, at least absent some controversial claim that pasta and
cookies did not exist. The upshot would be an instructional
universe without higher education, but not a universe where one
viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.
The Guidelines are thus substantially different from the access
restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case upon which the
Court heavily relies in finding a viewpoint distinction here,
ante, at 9-11. Lamb's Chapel addressed a school board's regulation
prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises "by any group
for religious purposes," even though the forum otherwise was open
for a variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. 508
U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted). "Religious" was understood to refer to the
viewpoint of a believer, and the regulation did not purport to
deny access to any speaker wishing to express a non-religious or
expressly antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid.
("The issue in this case is whether . . . it violates the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment . . . to deny a church access
to school premises to exhibit for public viewing and for
assertedly religious purposes, a film dealing with family and
child-rearing issues"); id., at ___ (slip op., at 8-9), citing May
v. Evansville-Vanderburgh School Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1114 (CA7
1986).[FOOTNOTE 13]
With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel
we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied
to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian
perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the
basis of viewpoint. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ___ (slip op., at
8-9) (considering as-applied challenge only). Equally obvious is
the distinction between that case and this one, where the
regulation is being applied, not to deny funding for those who
discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint, but to those
engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion and
religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint
discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between
viewpoint and content.
To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating a
categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate with
viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded that
primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together,
always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint
to any speech about any secular topic. Thus, the Court's reasoning
requires a university that funds private publications about any
primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily
espousing adherence to or rejection of religion. But a
university's decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to
fund publications aimed at urging repentance before God does not
skew the debate either about racism or the desirability of
religious conversion. The Court's contrary holding amounts to a
significant reformulation of our viewpoint discrimination
precedents and will significantly expand access to limited-access
forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976) (upholding
regulation prohibiting political speeches on military base);
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 812 (exclusion from fundraising drive of
political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint
neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health and welfare
agencies); Perry, 460 U.S., at 49-50, and n. 9 (ability of
teachers' bargaining representative to use internal school mail
system does not require that access be provided to "any other
citizen's group or community organization with a message for
school personnel"); Lehman, 418 U.S., at 304 (exclusion of
political messages from forum permissible despite ability of
nonpolitical speakers to use the forum) (plurality opinion).
III
Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today's
decision portends much more than making a shambles out of student
activity fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehension is
whetted by Chief Justice Burger's warning in Lemon v. Kurtzman,
403 U.S. 602, 624 (1971): "in constitutional adjudication some
steps, which when taken were thought to approach 'the verge,' have
become the platform for yet further steps. A certain momentum
develops in constitutional theory and it can be a 'downhill
thrust' easily set in motion but difficult to retard or stop."
I respectfully dissent.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FOOTNOTES
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
FN1. The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have
created a "generally available subsidy program" comparable to
respondent's Student Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 7, n. 1.
The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is squarely
at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide "for
the support of Christian teachers." Everson, 330 U.S., at 72.
Moreover, the section of the bill cited by the dissent, see post,
at 7, n. 1, simply indicated that funds would be "disposed of
under the direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement
of seminaries of learning within the Counties whence such sums
shall arise," Everson, supra, at 74. This provision disposing of
undesignated funds hardly transformed the "Bill Establishing a
Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion" into a truly
neutral program that would benefit religious adherents as part of
a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference to
religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the bill
would have been to promote "the general diffusion of Christian
knowledge," id., at 72; any possible appropriation for "seminaries
of learning" depended entirely on future legislative action.
Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's
directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing
in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian
educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the
time of the founding were affiliated with some religious
organization, see C. Antieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom
From Federal Establishment, Formation and Early History of the
First Amendment Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was
no system of public education in Virginia until several decades
after the assessment bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The
Beginnings of Public Education in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9
(1917); see also A. Johnson, The Legal Status of Church-State
Relationships in the United States 4 (1982) ("In Virginia the
parish institutions transported from England were the earliest
educational agencies. Although much of the teaching took place in
the home and with the aid of tutors, every minister had a school,
and it was the duty of the vestry to see that all the poor
children were taught to read and write") (footnote omitted).
Further, the clearly religious tenor of the Virginia assessment
would seem to point toward appropriation of residual funds to
sectarian "seminaries of learning." Finally, although modern
historians have focused on the opt-out provision, the dissent
provides no indication that Madison viewed the Virginia assessment
as an evenhanded program; in fact, several of the objections
expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63, focus clearly on
the bill's violation of the principle of "equality," or
evenhandedness. See infra, at 3-5.
FN2. To the contrary, Madison's Remonstrance decried the fact that
the assessment bill would require civil society to take
"cognizance" of religion. Madison's Remonstrance  1, reprinted in
Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947).
Respondent's exclusion of religious activities from SAF funding
creates this very problem. It requires University officials to
classify publications as "religious activities," and to
discriminate against the publications that fall into that
category. Such a policy also contravenes the principles expressed
in Madison's Remonstrance by encouraging religious adherents to
cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus "degrad[ing]
from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in
Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority." Id.
9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69.
FN3. A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount to
direct funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e.g. Act of
Feb. 20, 1833, ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the State of
Ohio to sell "all or any part of the lands heretofore reserved and
appropriated by Congress for the support of religion within the
Ohio Company's . . . purchases . . . and to invest the money
arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund; the
proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied . . . for the
support of religion within the several townships for which said
lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no other use
or purpose whatsoever"); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 86,    1, 3, 6
Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College -a Jesuit
institution-"lots in the city of Washington, to the amount, in
value, of twenty-five thousand dollars," and directing the College
to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter using the
dividends to establish and endow such professorships as it saw
fit); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 103 (1985)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("As the United States moved from the
18th into the 19th century, Congress appropriated time and again
public moneys in support of sectarian Indian education carried on
by religious organizations").
FN4. The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment
Controversy itself is inconsistent with the rigid "no-aid"
principle embraced by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the
Virginia legislature authorized tax exemptions for property
belonging to the "commonwealth, or to any county, town, college,
houses for divine worship, or seminary of learning." Act of Jan.
23, 1800, ch.2,   1, 1800 Va. Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson,
respondent's founder and a champion of disestablishment in
Virginia, advocated the use of public funds in Virginia for a
department of theology in conjunction with other professional
schools. See S. Padover, The Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see
also id., at 958 (noting that Jefferson advocated giving "to the
sectarian schools of divinity the full benefit [of] the public
provisions made for instruction in the other branches of
science").
FN5. In the tax literature, this identity is called a "tax
expenditure," a concept "based upon recognition of the fact that a
government can appropriate money to a particular person or group
by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or exclusion,
instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms. For
example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to add
$7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax rate is
30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government can send the
preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his income, or
it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by $23,333.33
[resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct payment were
itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket, the preacher
would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction as he would
from the direct payment." Wolfman, Tax Expenditures: From Idea to
Ideology, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985). In fact, Congress
has provided a similar "tax expenditure" in   107 of the Internal
Revenue Code by granting a "'minister of the gospel'" an unlimited
exclusion for the rental value of any home furnished as part of
his pay or for the rental allowance paid to him. See id., at 492,
n. 6.
Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the
tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 20, n.
7, is misplaced in this context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue
Code, The Constitution, and the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure
Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 855,
862, n. 30 (1993):
"Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on the
difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is not a
special provision. Professor Boris Bittker, for example, argued
that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any tax could
not be described as the equivalent of subsidies. Boris I. Bittker,
Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L. J. 1285 (1969).
This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis was
short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large body
of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept
that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The
current debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly
identified as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions
are more efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than
direct spending programs. See generally [numerous authorities]."
:::::::::::::::::::::::::: DISSENTING FOOTNOTES
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
FN1. Justice Thomas suggests that Madison would have approved of
the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle of
evenhandedness. Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison
advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial
support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy
program. Indeed, while Justice Thomas claims that the "funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects," ante, at 4, it is clear that the bill was more
general in scope than this. While the bill, which is reprinted in
Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74 (1947),
provided that each taxpayer could designate a religious society to
which he wanted his levy paid, id., at 73, it would also have
allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any
religious society, in which case the legislature was to use these
unappropriated sums to fund "seminaries of learning." Id., at 74
(contrary to Justice Thomas's unsupported assertion, this portion
of the bill was no less obligatory than any other). While some of
these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious in
character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally
understood at the time to be "any school, academy, college or
university, in which young persons are instructed in the several
branches of learning which may qualify them for their future
employments." N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English
Language (1st ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary
956 (2d ed. 1989). Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally
agreed that the bill would have provided funding for nonreligious
schools. See, e.g., Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 897
(1986) ("Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church, with
undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools . . . The
bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost
certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the
training of ministers"); T. Buckley, Church and State in
Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) ("The assessment
had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to
support education rather than religion to do so"); T. Curry, The
First Freedoms 141 (1986) ("[T]hose taxes not designated for any
specific denomination [were] allocated to education"). It is
beside the point that "there was no system of public education in
Virginia until several decades after the assessment bill was
proposed," ante, at 2, n. 1 (Thomas, J., concurring); because the
bill was never passed, the funds that it would have made available
for secular, public schools never materialized. The fact that the
bill, if passed, would have funded secular as well as religious
instruction did nothing to soften Madison's opposition to it.
Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because
it treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 3 (Thomas, J.,
concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison
did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions,
Everson, supra, at 66, but to identify this factor as the sole
point of Madison's opposition to the bill is unfaithful to the
Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed against the
proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the Remonstrance
numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one point in
opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of those
reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid was being
distributed equally among sects, and whether or not the aid was
going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded government
program. See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted in Everson,
330 U.S., at 64,  1 ("[I]n matters of Religion, no man's right is
abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and . . . Religion
is wholly exempt from its cognizance"); id., at 67,  6 (arguing
that State support of religion "is a contradiction to the
Christian Religion itself; for every page of it disavows a
dependence on the powers of this world"); ibid.,  7 ("[E]xperience
witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of
maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a
contrary operation"). Madison's objections were supplemented by
numerous other petitions in opposition to the bill that likewise
do not suggest that the lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive
flaw. L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed. 1994). For
example, the petition that received the largest number of
signatories was motivated by the view that religion should only be
supported voluntarily. Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's
Remonstrance did not argue for a bill distributing aid to all
sects and religions on an equal basis, and the outgrowth of the
Remonstrance and the defeat of the Virginia assessment was not
such a bill; rather, it was the Virginia Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, which, as discussed in the text, proscribed the
use of tax dollars for religious purposes.
In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally
been targeted against "governmental preferences for particular
religious faiths," ante, at 4 (emphasis in original), Justice
Thomas wishes to wage a battle that was lost long ago, for "this
Court has rejected unequivocally the contention that the
Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference of one
religion over another," School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374
U.S. 203, 216 (1963); see also Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489
U.S. 1, 17 (1989) (plurality opinion); id., at 28 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in judgment); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 52-53
(1985); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 495 (1961); Engel v.
Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 430 (1962); Everson, supra, at 15; see
generally Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 609-616 (1992) (Souter,
J., concurring).
FN2. Justice Thomas attempts to cast doubt on this accepted
version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical
facts that are largely inapposite. Ante, at 5-7, 11-12 (concurring
opinion). As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress,
especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as an
authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses, for
"like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses] could
raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs on them
the next. [For example,] . . . [t]en years after proposing the
First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the
early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would have
to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room for
political censorship." Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 626 (1992)
(concurring opinion). The legislation cited by Justice Thomas,
including the Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the
Alien and Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even
less persuasive, then, are citations to constitutionally untested
Acts dating from the mid-19th century, for without some rather
innovative argument, they cannot be offered as providing an
authoritative gloss on the Framers' intent.
Justice Thomas's references to Madison's actions as a legislator
also provide little support for his cause. Justice Thomas seeks to
draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking to
disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison did
not inveigh against state funding of religious activities. Ante,
at 6 (concurring opinion). That was not the task at hand, however.
Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating the
special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made no
effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that came
to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years
later. That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than
necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his
proposal was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone
too far. Ibid.
Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional
committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides
no support for more general principles that run counter to settled
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed
out, Madison, upon retirement, "insisted that 'it was not with my
approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of religion
from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they appointed
Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.'" Lee, supra, at
625, n. 6, quoting Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July
10, 1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 105. And when we
turned our attention to deciding whether funding of legislative
chaplains posed an establishment problem, we did not address the
practice as one instance of a larger class of permissible
government funding of religious activities. Instead, Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791 (1983), explicitly relied on the
singular, 200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that
"[t]his unique history" justified carving out an exception for the
specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding
this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would
stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it a
broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.
FN3. In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following
facts: "The University of Virginia has charged at all times
relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a
compulsory student activity fee of $14.00 per semester. There is
no procedural or other mechanism by which a student may decline to
pay the fee." App. 37; see also App. 9, 21.
FN4. To the extent the Court perceives some distinction between
the printing and dissemination of evangelism and proselytization,
and core religious activity "in [its] usual sense," ante, at 24,
this distinction goes entirely unexplained in the Court's opinion.
FN5. In a narrow band of cases at the polar extreme from direct
funding cases, those involving essential public benefits commonly
associated with living in an organized society (like police and
fire protection, for example), evenhandedness may become important
to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.
FN6. In Zobrest, a deaf student sought to have an interpreter,
provided under a state Act aiding individuals with disabilities,
accompany him to a Roman Catholic high school. In Witters, a blind
student sought to use aid, provided under a state program for
assistance to handicapped persons, to attend a private Christian
college. In Mueller, parents sought to take a tax deduction,
available for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren,
for certain expenses incurred in connection with providing
education for their children in private religious schools.
FN7. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664 (1970), is
yet another example of a case in which the Court treated the
general availability of a government benefit as a significant
condition defining compliance with the Establishment Clause, but
did not deem that condition sufficient. In upholding state
property tax exemptions given to religious organizations in Walz,
we noted that the law at issue was applicable to "a broad class of
property owned by nonprofit [and] quasi-public corporations," id.,
at 673, but did not rest on that factor alone. Critical to our
decision was the central principle that direct funding of
religious activities is prohibited under the Establishment Clause.
"It is sufficient to note that for the men who wrote the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment the 'establishment' of a religion
connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of
the sovereign in religious activity." Id., at 668. We emphasized
that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of
government funds in support of religious activities. "The grant of
a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not
transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from
demanding that the church support the state." Id., at 675.
Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation context,
"exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote involvement
between church and state and far less than taxation of churches,"
and in operation "ten[d] to complement and reinforce the desired
separation insulating" church and state, id., at 676; and that
religious property tax exemptions have been in place for over 200
years without disruption to the interests represented by the
Establishment Clause, id., at 676-680.
Justice Thomas's assertion, that "[a] tax exemption in many cases
is economically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct
monetary subsidy," ante, at 8 (concurring opinion) (footnote
omitted), assumes that the "natural" or "correct" tax base is so
self-evident that any provision excusing a person or institution
from taxes to which others are subjected must be a departure from
the natural tax base rather than part of the definition of the tax
base itself. The equivalence (asserted by Justice Thomas, ante, at
8) between a direct money subsidy and the tax liability avoided by
an institution (because it is part of the class of institutions
that defines the relevant tax base by its exclusion) was tested
and dispatched long ago by Professor Bittker in Churches, Taxes
and the Constitution, 78 Yale L. J. 1285 (1969). Justice Thomas's
suggestion that my "reliance on Bittker . . . is misplaced in this
context," ante, at 9, n. 5, is not on point. Even granting that
Justice Thomas's assertion of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot
and does not deny the fact that the Court in Walz explicitly
distinguished tax exemptions from direct money subsidies, 397
U.S., at 675, and rested its decision on that distinction. If
Justice Thomas's assertion of equivalence should prevail then the
Walz Court necessarily was wrong about a distinction critical to
its holding. Justice Thomas can hardly use Walz coherently for
support after removing the basis on which it relies.
FN8. Although the main opinion in Tilton was a plurality, the
entire Court was unanimous on this point. See 403 U.S., at 682-684
(plurality opinion); id., at 692 (Douglas, J., joined by Black and
Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Lemon
v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 659-661 (1971) (opinion of Brennan,
J.); id., at 665, n. 1 (opinion of White, J.).
FN9. Congress apparently also reads our cases as the University
did, for it routinely excludes religious activities from general
funding programs. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C.   1062(b) (federal grant
program for institutions of higher education; "[n]o grant may be
made under this chapter for any educational program, activity, or
service related to sectarian instruction or religious worship, or
provided by a school or department of divinity"); 20 U.S.C. 
1069c (certain grants to higher education institutions "may not be
used . . . for a school or department of divinity or any religious
worship or sectarian activity . . ."); 20 U.S.C.   1132c-3(c)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal assistance for renovation of certain
academic facilities; "[n]o loan may be made under this part for
any educational program, activity or service related to sectarian
instruction or religious worship or provided by a school or
department of divinity or to an institution in which a substantial
portion of its functions is subsumed in a religious mission"); 20
U.S.C.   1132i(c) (grant program for educational facilities; "no
project assisted with funds under this subchapter shall ever be
used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or for a school
or department of divinity"); 20 U.S.C.   1213d ("No grant may be
made under this chapter for any educational program, activity, or
service related to sectarian instruction or religious worship, or
provided by a school or department of divinity"); 25 U.S.C. 
3306(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (funding for Indian higher education
programs; "[n]one of the funds made available under this
subchapter may be used for study at any school or department of
divinity or for any religious worship or sectarian activity"); 29
U.S.C.   776(g) (grants for projects and activities for
rehabilitation of handicapped persons; "[n]o funds provided under
this subchapter may be used to assist in the construction of any
facility which is or will be used for religious worship or any
sectarian activity"); 42 U.S.C.   3027(a)(14)(A)(iv) (requiring
states seeking federal aid for construction of centers for the
elderly to submit plans providing assurances that "the
facilit[ies] will not be used and [are] not intended to be used
for sectarian instruction or as . . . place[s] for religious
worship"); 42 U.S.C.   5001(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal
grants to support volunteer projects for the elderly, but not
including "projects involving the construction, operation, or
maintenance of so much of any facility used or to be used for
sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship"); 42
U.S.C.   9858k(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (no child care and
development block grants "shall be expended for any sectarian
purpose or activity, including sectarian worship or instruction").

FN10. The Court acknowledges that "if the State pays a church's
bills it is subsidizing it," and concedes that "we must guard
against this abuse." Ante, at 24. These concerns are not present
here, the Court contends, because Wide Awake "is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used in
our case law." Ibid. The Court's concession suggests that its
distinction between paying a religious institution and paying a
religious institution's bills is not really significant. But if
the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake as not
a religious institution, "at least in the usual sense," the Court
could presumably stop right there.

FN11. The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of
public funds to advance its own speech and the State's funding of
private speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related
choices is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the
former. Ante, at 12-14. I would not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-273 (1988), but I do
suggest that this case reveals the difficulties that can be
encountered in drawing this distinction. There is a communicative
element inherent in the very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 15-19 (1976) (per curiam), and although it is
the student speakers who choose which particular messages to
advance in the forum created by the University, the initial act of
defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision attributable to
the University, not the students. In any event, even assuming that
private and state speech always may be separated by clean lines
and that this case involves only the former, I believe the
distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed infra,
this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination.

FN12. I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a
public university's funding determinations would violate the Free
Speech Clause. If, however, the determinations are made on the
basis of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a
viewpoint distinction, there is no violation. In a limited-access
forum, a speech restriction must be "reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum" as well as viewpoint-neutral. E.g.,
Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), quoting
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806. Because petitioners have not
challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable, I express
no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness
criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that
it applies in limited-access forum cases.

FN13. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., O. T. 1992, No. 91-2024, where
counsel for the school district charged with enforcing the
restriction unequivocally admitted that anyone with an atheistic
or antireligious message would be permitted to use school property
under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The complete
exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as
follows:

"QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address
the subject of family values and they thought there was a value in
not having children waste their time going to Sunday school or
church and therefore they had a point of view that was definitely
antireligious, they would be permitted, under your policy, to
discuss family values in that context?

"[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

"QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the Court]
you indicated that communists would be able to give their
perspective on family. I-I assume from that that atheists would be
able to give theirs under your rules.

"[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor."
