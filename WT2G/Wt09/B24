                                October 31, 1996, Thursday<br>
    PARIS, Oct. 31<p> 
        The French oil company Total, facing criticism over its decision to 
     maintain
     investments in Burma despite the outcry over abuses committed by that 
     country's
     military regime, says its actions are legal and provide no immediate 
     direct benefit for the state.
     
        Criticisms by human rights advocates and international legal 
     experts were not
     fair said a spokesman for Total. "There is no international law 
     prohibiting
     foreign companies from working in Burma."
     
        Critics say the firm's project in Burma make it at least partly 
     responsible
     for the brutalities being committed against politicians and the 
     general
     population by the military regime. In a report released recently in 
     Paris, the
     International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) said Total was 
     accountable for the abuses.  
     <p>
        Citing the company's gas project in southern Burma, FIDH accused 
     Total of
     extending moral, political and economic support to the State Law and 
     Order
     Restoration Council (SLORC) in Rangoon.
     
        But the Total spokesman said: "We are not engaging in politics. 
     Legally, we
     are not breaking any law. The situation is not the same as that of 
     Iraq against
     which there is an international embargo. Total is not present in 
     Iraq."
     
        He said at this stage the project in southern Burma represents an 
     investment
     and does not profit the Burmese authorities. "It is not bringing in 
     revenues for
     the authorities, and will not for a long time to come. In a few more 
     years, who
     knows who the authorities will be," the Total spokesman told IPS.
     <p>
        But Olivier Russbach, specialist on international law and director 
     of the
     International Law Research Center 90 said: "It is a false approach to 
     excuse
     one's behavior on the basis of what the international community 
     decides to do or
     not to do about the human rights violations committed by a country."
     
        He added: "It is not necessary at all to wait for what the U.N. 
     Security
     Council says or does not say about Burma. Total does have civil 
     responsibility
     for what is going on in Burma."
     
        According to Russbach, the silence of the U.N. Security Council is 
     not a
     measure of the gravity of acts of states. "There is no embargo against 
     Turkey or
     Russia, but that does not say anything about the crimes by Turkey or 
     Russia."
     <p>
        The military junta in Burma, which has changed its name to Myanmar, 
     is one of
     the most dictatorial regimes in the world, says the FIDH.
        It has jailed opponents, restricted political activity and 
     overturned the
     results of the last democratic elections and jailed its winner, Aung 
     San Suu Kyi
     of the National League For Democracy (NLD). Earlier this month, the 
     regime
     arrested pro-democracy campaigner U Kyi Maung.
     
        Its human rights record is recognized as "particularly terrifying," 
     or
     "sufficiently serious," the FIDH points out. They are attempting to 
     push the
     U.N. Human Rights Commission to appoint a special rapporteur for the 
     country.
     Burma's military has been condemned repeatedly by the U.N. General 
     Assembly and
     the International Labor Organization.
     <p>
        Begun in 1992 in a joint venture with the state-controlled Myanma 
     Oil and Gas
     Enterprise (MOGE), Total's project in Burma represents more than a 
     third of the
     foreign investments in that country.
     
        Estimated at $ 1.2 billion, the project will exploit the vast gas 
     reserves at
     Yadana. When completed some time in 1998, it would deliver some 525 
     million
     cubic feet of gas per day to Thailand, earning Rangoon yearly revenues 
     estimated
     at between $ 200 billion and $ 500 billion.
     
        "Human rights violations related to the project have been 
     confirmed: forced
     displacement of populations, forced labor, child labor, torture, rape 
     and
     extortion," charged the FIDH.
     
        Together with several other non-governmental organizations in 
     France and
     other countries, the FIDH has joined an international campaign to get 
     Total to
     freeze its activities in Burma and to allow an independent 
     investigation into
     various charges.
     <p>
        While human rights violations have been committed by members of the 
     Burmese
     army placed in charge of the security at the construction site, the 
     FIDH
     maintains that Total is not exonerated. And while it is unlikely that 
     Total has
     resorted directly to forced labor, it is nevertheless clear that it 
     tolerates
     and benefits from it.
     
        The abuses, says the FIDH, arise from the militarization of the 
     region
     through which the pipeline will pass. "A number of groups opposed to 
     the regime
     in Rangoon are active in the area. The regime and foreign investors 
     agree that
     the pacification of Burma is a necessary condition for contracts," the 
     organization states.
     
        As such, contracts with Burma specify that the regime must 
     guarantee the
     security of the site and the protection of Total employees, the FIDH 
     points out.
     SLORC has therefore sent several infantry battalions, or around 10,000 
     soldiers.
     
        Total would also be interested in seeing that the SLORC stays in 
     place, says
     the FIDH. Legislators elected in the nullified 1989 elections have 
     clearly
     indicated that as the "real representatives" of the Burmese people, 
     they do not
     recognize contracts passed with the SLORC. They have said that they 
     will not
     recognize contracts signed up with the junta if the civil government 
     comes to
     power.
     <p>
        Total has reaffirmed its commitment to respecting human rights 
     everywhere in
     the world and says it will never accept to use forced or child labor 
     on any
     project, in Burma or anywhere else. The project, it argues, will 
     contribute to
     the country's economic development, which will probably encourage 
     Burma "to
     improve relations with the rest of the world and promote social 
     change."
     
        Under these circumstances, FIDH says that investing in Burma, and
     particularly under the form of a joint venture with an enterprise 
     entirely
     controlled by the authorities, amounts to a gesture of moral and 
     political
     solidarity with the authorities.
     <p>
        "It is also an act of complicity. In signing a contract with the 
     junta, Total
     agreed to close its eyes to the massive, systematic and confirmed 
     violations of
     human rights," it charges.
     
        "There are actions that are apparently innocuous but are heavy with 
     moral
     meaning, and there are economic actions that have political 
     consequences.
     Whether one likes it or not, economic power these days means disposing 
     of
     political power," it argues.
     <p>
        Upbeat official assessments of the state of the Burmese economy 
     have recently
     been challenged by a report prepared by the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon 
     which cited
     soaring deficits, declining foreign investments, rising and 
     potentially
     unserviceable debt, rampant military spending and increased reliance 
     on income
     derived from drug trafficking.
     
        Since 1991, the Burmese regime claims it has attracted over $ 4.13 
     billion
     worth of foreign investments and in 1993 and 1994 recorded an average 
     gross
     domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.2 percent.
     
        But the 134-page U.S. embassy report said that although pledged 
     foreign
     investment is rising the actual inflows had fallen from 9.3 percent to 
     five
     percent of GDP between 1991 and 1994.

</h1></td>
</table>

August 16, 1996<p>

Heavy-handed politics carries a hard economic cost, businessmen 
tell BJ Lee in Rangoon.<p>

Despite the assertions of Asean officials at their recent meeting 
in Jakarta that politics and economics are separate issues, many 
businesspeople in Burma say the two are linked.<p>

"Human rights abuses are bad for the economy," says a businessman 
from a Southeast Asian country who employs dozens of Burmese in 
Rangoon. "people won't work properly if they are scared. They'll 
work hard if they believe their life is going to get better."<p>

While military-led Indonesia has independent television stations, 
and Thailand, the Philippines, and even Cambodia a lively press, 
the Burmese government still strictly controls the voice of 
Burmese people. The result, say analysts in Rangoon, is a stiff 
economy lagging behind its dynamic competitors in Asia.<p>

"Unlike most countries in the region, there is no forum in 
Myanmar for our complaints," says a Burmese entrepreneur. "If 
something is wrong in the economy, we have no way of telling the 
government. We're afraid of being called 'destructionists'. So, 
even if they want to fix it, the government leaders have no way 
of knowing what's wrong."<p>

"If they want a capitalist, market economy, they need to 
encourage people to think creatively and act boldly," he adds. 
"But people won't do that if they see academics and intellectuals 
in prison."<p>

While returning refugees are sparking the economies of Vietnam, 
Laos and Cambodia, most of Burma's most educated exiles remain 
outside the country. Many are blacklisted, and they say they fear 
they won't be allowed to leave Burma again if they return.<p>

Several business sources said the stormy investment climate is 
keeping Burma at least five or 10 years away from becoming the 
next Asian tiger.<p>

According to an old adage of Western businessmen, money is a 
coward. A few Western breweries, soft-drinks makers and textile 
manufactures have pulled out of Burma this year. Local investors 
say they are also cautious. The opening of a stock market remains 
at least three years away, say officials involved in a project 
with Japan's Daiwa corporation.<p>

Observers say the government needs legitimacy to get big 
international loans for infrastructure projects to pave the way 
for an economic boom, but won't get legitimacy as long as human 
rights abuses continue.<p>

Human rights activists and investors also question the quality of 
roads and railways built with dubious labour practices. Critics 
charge the government with enslaving villagers and prisoners in 
the south to clear the way for pipeline and transportation 
projects. The government has said the labour is part of national 
volunteer service to help develop the country. Most employees in 
Burma earn less than US$10 (Bt250) a month.<p>

Many businessmen say privately that they themselves have to be 
careful inside Burma. "You can talk about business, don't talk 
about politics," advises a Singporean businessman.<p>

The death of James Leander Nichols in prison sent shockwaves not 
only through diplomatic circles, but through the business 
community as well. According to diplomats in Rangoon, Nichols, a 
former consul for Denmark and other European countries, was a 
"respected member of the business community." Others claim he had 
connections with senior Slorc generals as well as the democracy 
movement.<p>

Regardless of the government's political motives in sentencing 
him to prison, or the business dealings of Nichols, his 
conviction for violating laws concerning phone lines and fax 
machines caught the attention of businessmen who rely on 
telecommunications but are also unsure of local laws. "Even 
people in the government aren't daring enough," says an Asean 
businessman working with generals on infrastructure projects. 
"They are still testing, still thinking about whether to open or 
close the door. They are obsessed with control, and they are 
afraid of cutting their own throats."<p>

The source, however, noted that the human rights situation in 
Burma was different from China where he also does business.<p>

"If Aung San Suu Kyi was in China, they would throw her in prison 
and nobody would hear from her for about 40 years. In Myanmar, 
the government has to tolerate her. Maybe they would like to shut 
her up but they can't because of their respect for her father."<p>

He also explained about the differences between Burma and China 
in the global business community. "They world has to trade with 
China, because it fears China as a superpower and wants to 
contain it and avoid another Cold War like with the Soviet Union. 
The Chinese market is also too big to ignore. It's not this way 
with Burma. If business is too risky here, the world will go 
somewhere else." (TN)<p>

<title> Big Oil's Gamble on a Pariah Regime

Big Oil's Gamble on a Pariah Regime
</h1></td>
</table>

It was a foreign investor's worst nightmare.  During an "open for
business"  investment promotion meeting in May, Roger Truitt, president of
Arco Asia Inc., met with one of the ruling generals from Burma's brutal
military regime.  The next day, a photo of the two smiling men was
splashed on the front page of the government news-paper-just as the
generals touched off a firestorm of international protests by arbitrarily
arresting more than 250 supporters of the opposition National League for
Democracy.<p> 

But embarrassment goes with the territory these days for
Westerners doing business in Burma (or Myanmar, as the current crowd
renamed it seven years ago).  "Burma has become the South Africa of the
1990s," says Simon Billenness, senior analyst at Boston-based Franklin
Research & Development, which specializes in what it terms socially
responsible investments. Some half- dozen U.S. companies-among them Amoco,
Liz Claiborne, Levi Strauss, and Pepsico-have tried and quit the country,
turned off by both local corruption and pressure from customers back home.
Six U.S. cities have passed laws barring municipal contracts to companies
that deal with Burma.<p> 

Despite the rising heat, Arco and a hardy band of
international oil giants have so far vowed to press ahead with major
energy development projects. Unocal, the largest U.S. inves- tor in Burma,
owns 28% of the $1 billion Yadana offshore gas project-the French company
Total is the lead partner-a potentially lucrative venture that will export
to Thailand for hard currency. Says John Imle Jr., president of Unocal: 
"Geology and geography-not geopolitics-are our dictates."<p> 

Echoing that
line, Arco has also brushed aside a shareholder resolution calling on the
com- pany to quit Burma.  After all, it points out, it is following a
strict code of conduct that prohibits illegal payoffs, endangering
employees, and investing in places that Washington puts off-limits.<p>

The odds are growing, however, that Burma may soon join the ranks
of those off-limits countries.  The U.S. already denies the Burmese junta
access to World Bank loans.  Now critics want to put it right at the top
of Washington s list of outlaw regimes, along with Libya and Iraq, and
shut off private invest- ment by U.S. companies as well. Says Senator
Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican from Kentucky who has attracted
bipartisan support for just such a bill: "There is no doubt that
investment by U.S. companies subsidizes a regime responsible for
outrageous abuses."<p>
<img align=left src=child.gif>
Though McConnell agrees with the notion that trade and investment
help moderate governments in China and Vietnam, Burma, he maintains, "is
quite different." For one thing, its military rulers have done nothing to
curb production of opium-their biggest cash crop and the source of 60% of
the heroin seized on U.S. streets.  Moreover, the Burmese generals are
suppressing a local democracy movement that won 82% of the seats in a free
parliamentary election in 1990 and was prevented from taking office. To
keep their grip on power, the generals'State Law and Order Restoration
Council (whose acronym in English is the sinister-sounding handle Slorc),
has relied upon arbitrary arrests, summary executions, rape, and forced
labor-abuses well-documented by Washington, the United Nations, and most
recently, by a film produced by the British network ITV, which showed
children being forced to help build a state railway that runs through the
region where Unocal and Total's pipeline is being laid.<p> 

So far,
including the big-ticket energy projects, Burma has managed to attract
only about $1 billion of investment, mainly from Southeast Asian nations. 
Such "constructive engagement," Burma's neighbors insist, is the best way
to encourage further reforms.  Imle of Unocal argues that even if his
company pulled out, another would take its place: "As Myanmar opens up its
economy to the West, it is time for us to lead by example.  It is not time
to slam the door shut."<p>

<img align=left src=suu_kyi.gif>
But can an open-door policy really civilize this rogue regime's
behavior?  Aung San Sun Kyi, leader of Burma's democratic forces and
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, urges foreign companies to stay out of
Burma until Slorc's generals agree to share power.  Says she: "Anybody who
really knows what's going on with the Burmese economy wouldn't want to
invest here." One influential fellow who buys that line is billionaire
global investor George Soros.  Testifying before Congress last month, he
backed a ban on investment: "I would endorse any type of economic
sanctions only as a last resort.  But Burma is a case where desperate
measures are needed because the situation is so desperate."<p>

Ten local private entrepreneurs have been authorized to open 
     counters for sale and purchase of foreign exchange certificates (fecs) at the 
     Yangon Fec Exchange Center to nurture a foreign currency market, official paper 
     the new light of Myanmar reported today.  The fec, which is equivalent to the US 
     dollar in value and lawfully circulated on the Myanmar market, was introduced in 
     february 1993 for the convenience of foreigners visiting and doing business in 
     Myanmar since hard currency is not allowed for circulation in the country.  
     since local Myanmar nationals are also allowed to hold fecs, the use of them has 
     become widespread following the opening of the fec exchange center in 
     december last year.  
<p>The center was set up in Yangon to effect easy, legal 
     transactions of fecs and their use in the market, eliminate the practice of offering 
     lower prices to the buyers and sellers, nurture a foreign currency market 
     and do away with unsightly, illegal transactions on roadsides, the paper said.  
     the market exchange rate of the us dollar or fec with the Myanmar currency kyat 
     is 1 to 160, while its official rate is about 6, the paper added.

Reuters World Service<br>
     
                            December 2, 1996<br> 
     
<b>Rangoon</b><p>
     
        Indonesia is negotiating with Burma's military government over the 
     prospect of buying natural gas from big offshore fields in the Bay of Mottama 
     in southern Burma, Indonesian diplomats said on Monday.
     
        The sources said any future Indonesian purchase of Burmese natural 
     gas would come under the framework of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 
     bilateral cooperation in the energy sector signed by the two countries in 
     mid-October.  They said an Indonesian delegation arrived in Rangoon recently to 
     negotiate with their Burmese counterparts following a visit in mid-October by 
     Indonesian Oil Minister Sudjana and Faisal Abda'oe, the chief of state oil 
     company Pertamina.
     <p>
        Burma is currently developing its Yadana and Yetagun offshore 
     fields. It will pipe natural gas from the fields onshore in 1998, mostly for export to 
     Thailand. Burma's energy ministry estimated that the Yadana field in the Bay 
     of Mottama contained about 5.7 trillion cubic feet of commercial reserves of 
     natural gas.<p>

        Indonesian diplomats said the recently-signed MOU covered bilateral
     cooperation in both upstream and downstream energy sectors.
It includes technical and human resource assistance that Jakarta 
     will provide
     to Burma in exploring new gas and petroleum resources and in 
     modernising its
     run-down oil refineries.
     
        They said Pertamina will likely send a few more delegations to 
     Rangoon to
     negotiate with Burmese officials in 1997.
     
        The sources did not exclude the possibility that Indonesia might 
     supply
     Burma with crude oil and refined products in the future, saying it 
     could come
     under bilateral talks.

<b>YANGON</b>, Nov. 26 Kyodo<br>
     
        Japan and Myanmar have exchanged notes in Yangon for a Japanese 
     government
     debt-relief grant of 4 billion yen for the first half of fiscal 1996, 
     the
     Japanese Embassy here said Tuesday.
     
        Since Myanmar was declared a least developed developing country 
     (LDDC) in
     1987, Japan has extended debt-relief grants to cover interest and part 
     of
     capital with the intention of producing the same effect as canceling 
     the debt of
     an LDDC.   Myanmar owed Japan more than 400 billion yen when Japanese 
     loans were
     stopped in 1988.
     
        Japan extended a debt-relief grant of 3.6 billion yen in 1988, 3.5 
     billion
     yen in 1990, 3 billion yen in 1991, 4 billion yen in 1992, 6.2 billion 
     yen in
     1993, 12 billion yen in 1994, and 4 billion yen in 1995.

Unocal Admits to Credit Deal with Rangoon 
</h1></td>

     <br>
     
November 15, 1996<br>
     AP<p>
     
     AMERICAN oil company Unocal has sold Burma's military government US$7 
     million (Bt175 million) worth of badly needed fertiliser on credit, to 
     be
     repaid from the junta's profits from a controversial gas pipeline now 
     being
     built.
     
     Unocal representative Carol Scott confirmed the agreement on a press 
     tour of
     the pipeline area in remote and isolated southern Burma earlier this 
     week.
     <p>
     The deal deepens Unocal's involvement with a government that has been 
     frequently criticised by the United Nations and international human 
     rights
     groups for suppressing Burma's democracy movement and committing 
     rampant
     human rights violations.
     
     Unocal is part of a consortium, including Total of France, the Burmese 
     government and the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, that is building a 
     $1.2
     billion pipeline to carry gas from Burma to Thailand.
     <p>
     Herve Madeo, a Total official, said earlier this week the Burmese 
     government
     won't reap any profits from the pipeline until some time after 2001. 
     Opponents of the junta have criticised the pipeline deal as providing 
     profits for a cash-starved regime that uses most of its money to buy 
     weapons
     and repress its citizens.
     <p>
     Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and other 
     opponents of
     the military government have called for a halt to foreign investment 
     in
     Burma until there is  clear progress toward democracy.
     
     Local analysts said the 40,000 tons of urea fertiliser from a Unocal 
     plant
     in Alaska cleared Rangoon's port in September and October. The amount 
     is
     approximately half of what the government needs to ensure the success 
     of the
     rice harvest. A decrease in rice and timber exports, coupled with 
     extremely
     high military spending, has left the junta with a severe cash-flow 
     problem
     according to Rangoon-based economists.
     <p>
     IN August, the government couldn't meet a $31 million payment to 
     Japan's
     Mitsui Corp for oil and the resulting shortage caused gas prices to 
     skyrocket and led some people in Rangoon to hoard food and other 
     essentials.
     
     The government has denied there was an oil shortage or that it is 
     having
     financial difficulties. But recent World Bank reports show the regime 
     is
     $6.6 billion in debt, with nearly $2 billion in arrears. The same 
     reports,
     using the regime's own figures, show the government spends at least 46 
     per
     cent of its budget on defence.
     
     Gen David Abel, minister of economic planning, said in September that 
     the
     World Bank doesn't understand how to use his government's numbers and 
     that
     defence spending is in fact eight per cent to 12 per cent of the 
     budget.
     <p>
     Although the government has made significant strides in increasing the 
     country's rice yields, it has fallen short of its own production 
     targets
     after forcing farmers to grow a second rice crop during the year. 
     Local
     economies said the attempt, while well-intentioned, was misguided and 
     failure.
     
     The rice crop became a political issue earlier this year when the 
     regime
     handed out 14-year prison sentences to Win Htein, a key aide to Suu 
     Kyi, and
     two other democracy activists because, it said, they shot a videotape 
     showing the failure of the second crop. (TN)<p>

                                    The Nikkei Weekly
<br>     
                                     November 4, 1996
     <p>
        Nippon Oil Co., Texaco Inc. of the U.S. and Premier Oil Plc of the 
     U.K. will
     start pumping natural gas from a field about 160km off the coast of 
     Myanmar from
     the fall of 1999.
     
        The consortium inked an agreement on Oct. 29 with the Myanmarese 
     and Thai
     governments to sell planned daily output of 30,000 barrels to Thai 
     electric-power companies through the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.
     
        The Texaco-led group will invest 50 yen billion (438.6 million 
     dollars) in
     the project to build plant and transport facilities. Texaco holds a 
     50%
     concession in the field, while Premier owns 30% and Nippon Oil has 
     20%. Premier
     obtained the rights to the Andaman Sea gas field; Texaco and Nippon 
     Oil joined
     the project in 1991.  
     <p>
        Officials from the companies predict the field has sufficient gas 
     reserves to
     support commercial drilling.
     
        This is the first natural-gas project in Myanmar to include a 
     Japanese oil
     refiner-wholesaler. The daily output will be equivalent to 3% of the 
     daily
     volume of liquefied natural gas imported by all Japanese 
     electric-power and
     city-gas companies. Thailand is increasing imports of gas to meet 
     surging
     electricity demand.
     <p>
        Field fits strategy
     <p>
        Nippon Oil has already invested 3 yen billion in the project 
     through Nippon
     Oil Exploration (Myanmar) Ltd., a joint venture shared with Japan 
     National Oil
     Corp.
     
        Under contract terms with the Myanmarese government, Nippon Oil's 
     proceeds
     will likely be less than its stake of 20%, industry sources said.
     
        Nippon Oil has rights to parts of gas fields in Texas and the Gulf 
     of Mexico,
     and produces between 8,000 and 9,000 barrels of natural gas each day. 
     The
     Myanmarese project is in line with the company's strategy to reinforce 
     supply of
     raw materials from its own operations.
     <p>
        Despite some political risks involved in development and 
     production, the
     project has stable buyers and is expected to contribute to Myanmar's 
     economy,
     Nippon Oil sources said.
     
        Despite growing criticism of its military government, foreign 
     companies are
     showing a strong interest in developing the country's natural 
     resources.
     <p>
        In late September, Myanmar's military junta arrested several 
     members of the
     National League for Democracy, a move that further strained its 
     relations with
     the U.S. and other countries. As a result, some foreign companies are 
     pulling
     out of the country.
     
        But companies from Europe, the U.S. and member countries of the 
     Association
     of Southeast Asian Nations are active in developing Myanmar's 
     natural-resources
     and tourism industry.
     
        From April through September, Myanmar approved foreign investments 
     of more
     than 1 billion dollars, up 150% from the same period last year.

                           December 3, 1996 <br>
     
     

      By Mary George, <i>Denver Post</i>  Staff Writer<p>
     
     
     BOULDER - AT&T, Ford and Federal Express would be among firms turned 
     away by
     Boulder if it boycotts companies doing business in Myanmar.
     
        Boulder Friends for a Democratic Burma, led by former Burmese 
     princess Inge
     Sargent, has asked the city council to consider the "selective 
     purchasing"
     ordinance.  The measure would prevent the city from buying goods or 
     services
     from companies that do business in Myanmar.
     <p>
        The military government of Myanmar, the Asian country formerly 
     known as
     Burma, is getting attention worldwide for its drug trade and its poor 
     human-rights record. The U.S. government estimates that 60 percent of 
     the heroin
     used in the United States comes from Myanmar.
     
        "For the sake of our city and our people, let's send them a 
     message," said
     Sargent, whose first husband, Shan Prince Sao Kya Seng, disappeared 
     after a 1962
     military coup and is presumed murdered. "Maybe others will follow us. 
     I do
     believe that we can motivate the nation, and that this nation can 
     motivate the
     world."
     <p>
        Boulder council members will take a preliminary vote on the 
     proposal tonight, then a second vote Dec. 17. Other companies that might have to be purged from the city's purchasing logs are Arco, Texaco, Unocal and ITT.  The law would affect an estimated $2 million in city business a year, said Benita Duran, assistant city manager.
     <p>
        The state of Massachusetts and eight other U.S. cities have such 
     laws. The cities are San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland and Santa Monica, Calif.; 
     Ann Arbor,  Mich.; Madison, Wis., Takoma Park, Md., and Carbarro, N.C.

<title> Motorola's pullout from Burma clears way for big San Francisco contract

Motorola's pullout from Burma clears way for big San Francisco contract
</h1></td>      
</table>      

Motorola Inc. is in line to win a $ 40 million contract to provide 
     an emergency communication system for San Francisco because it is closing 
     its operations in Burma and coming into compliance with a city ban on 
     doing business with the country's repressive regime.
     <p>
        Although Motorola said yesterday that its Burma shutdown had 
     nothing to do with San Francisco's boycott, backers of the measure called the 
     decision a significant human rights victory. But others said Motorola now stands 
     to win the contract without competitive bidding -- at a potential cost of 
     millions in taxpayer dollars. 
     <p>
        ''There's been a growing national and international boycott against 
     doing business with Burma because of gross human rights violations there,'' 
     said Supervisor Tom Ammiano. ''Motorola can say they made the decision 
     because of business concerns, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, 
     it's a duck.''
     <p>
        Motorola's decision is the latest turn in a twisting course that is 
     supposed to lead to a state-of-the- art communication system to serve San 
     Francisco's Fire Department, paramedics and Police Department.
     <p>
        The company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., won the contract 2 1/2 
     years ago without competitive bidding. City officials supervising the project 
     had said they already had some Motorola equipment and wanted Motorola to 
     provide the rest of the system.
     <p>
        But a year ago, a federal court ruled that the city could not award 
     the contract without taking bids from other companies.
     <p>
        Ericsson GE, part of an international conglomerate and one of 
     Motorola's biggest competitors worldwide, then submitted its bid on the project.  
     According to Supervisor Angela Alioto, it was $ 12 million to $ 14 million less 
     than Motorola's.
     <p>
        Then last spring, the supervisors passed the Burma measure. The 
     country's military leaders have been widely condemned for repressing a 
     pro-democracy movement and refusing to cede power to a democratically elected 
     government. 
<p>
        That measure made both Ericsson and Motorola ineligible for the
     communications project. Ericsson's Swedish parent company has had 
     multimillion dollar deals to provide phone system equipment in Burma. And Motorola 
     has had a small office there with one employee.
     <p>
        The decision to close that office and relocate the employee 
     apparently leaves Motorola once again as the sole bidder on the project. 
        But the controversy probably is not over.

        ''Competitive bids keep prices down and services up,'' said Alioto.
     ''Awarding these contracts without bids is the biggest scam going in 
     this government. If you want money to clean the streets and help the 
     homeless, that's where you can find it.''
     <p>
        Alioto said she would press for further reviews of the 
     communication project.

<title> Conflict Over Hiring Mitsubishi to build San Francisco Airport

Conflict Over Hiring Mitsubishi to build San Francisco Airport </h1></td>      
</table> 
<p>     
         Airport officials want to award a $ 137 million construction 
     contract to Mitsubishi, despite strong warnings by another city agency that San 
     Francisco's minority contracting goals will not be met and that the intended 
     subcontractors are not qualified to do the work.
     <p>
         Airport chief John Martin said Wednesday that he wanted Mitsubishi 
     Heavy Industries of America to build a "people mover" at San Francisco 
     International Airport. Mitsubishi's bid on the light-rail transit system is $ 19 
     million less than the second-lowest bidder, ADtranz of Pittsburg.
     <p>
         The fight for the contract has been fierce, with Mitsubishi 
     retaining high-powered attorney William Coblentz as a chief representative and 
     ADtranz retaining City Hall lobbying guru Don Solem and his firm. ADtranz has 
     gone so far as to hire a private investigator to check the credentials of the 
     subcontractors with which Mitsubishi plans to work.  
     <p>
         In addition, politics has come into play. Supervisor Tom Ammiano 
     is trying to block Mitsubishi's bid, contending that the company has ties to 
     Burma in violation of a city law he authored. The ordinance prohibits The City 
     from contracting with firms that do business in Burma, a Southeast Asian 
     nation whose
     military rulers routinely violate human rights, watchdog groups say.
     <p>
         Martin says the Burma ordinance does not apply to the people-mover 
     contract because the law exempts construction projects, a contention Ammiano is 
     fighting. The Airports Commission will consider the matter at a special 
     meeting tentatively scheduled for Dec. 23.
     <p>
         Martin's recommendation comes after the release of a scathing 
     report Nov. 21 by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission asking that Mitsubishi's 
     bid be shelved. The agency investigated Mitsubishi's bid to see whether it 
     complied with city goals that call for at least 12 percent of contracted work to be 
     done by local businesses owned by women and minorities. The commission keeps a 
     list of qualified businesses from which contractors are supposed to select.
     <p>
         The panel contends that the three subcontractors Mitsubishi picked 
     to meet the contracting goals come up short, and that Mitsubishi failed to 
     show that it had made a good-faith effort to find qualified outfits. Among its 
     findings: 
<ul>
       <li>  Woman-owned Aladdin Builders, assigned to supply and install 
     equipment for automated doors, "does not possess the expertise" to do the job and 
     will have to work under another subcontractor that does.
     
<li>Minority-owned B&F Concrete Contractors Inc., assigned to provide 
     finishing work, including doors, ceilings, hardware, walls, floor finishes and 
     painting, is "not certified by the Human Rights Commission as a supplier of such 
     material." In addition, the expected work is not the type "supplied by 
     the company in the normal course of its business."
     
<li>Minority-owned Metalset, assigned to perform steel fabrication and 
     to supply and install walkway, guidance and retention material, is not certified 
     as a supplier, "nor does it have adequate facilities to be a supplier of 
     such material."
     </ul>
     Not good enough, panel says, because B&F Concrete Contractors and Metalset are certified by the 
     Human Rights Commission to do some of the work, the panel gives Mitsubishi 
     partial credit toward meeting the minority- and female-owned contracting 
     goals. But the value adds up to only 10.5 percent of the total project, falling short 
     of the 12 percent recommended.
     <p>
         Meanwhile, ADtranz is raising questions about the legitimacy of 
     the subcontractors, and hired a private investigator to check them out. 
     The investigator, Montano and Associates, concluded that Metalset and B&F 
     Concrete Contractors were shell businesses, that their San Francisco offices 
     were seldom if ever used, and that their principal owners worked for other 
     companies. 
<p>
         Metalset President Ricardo Rosales called the allegations 
     nonsense, saying his business is legitimate. Representatives of B&F Concrete 
     Contractors could not be reached for comment.
     <p>
<center><h3>     Officials feud</h3></center>
     
         Adding further intrigue to the tangled people-mover contract is a
     disagreement between the airport's Martin and the Human Rights 
     Commission. Martin sent Human Rights Executive Director Marivic Bamba a pointed 
     letter last week in which he said he had a number of "concerns and questions" over 
     the panel's Mitsubishi report, which she wrote.
     <p>
         He declined to outline his concerns in the letter "so as not to 
     adversely impact litigation The City is facing or will face in the future." 
     However, he offered to direct the city attorney to review her report and present 
     findings to the Airport Commission.
     <p>
         Bamba could not be reached for comment.
     <p>
         Martin said Wednesday that he felt comfortable in recommending 
     Mitsubishi get the job. "They're the low bidder and qualified," he said.<p>

<P><center><b>INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE </b></center></p>
<P></P><P>
	The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) is comprised of professional health care 
providers focused upon serving the health care needs of elderly persons.  Founded in 1942, the 
AGS has 6,000 dues-paying members.  The AGS sponsors conferences and seminars, articulates 
policy and practice guidelines, publishes a preeminent professional journal (The Journal of the 
American Geriatrics Society), and encourages improved health care services for elderly persons 
and research on the illnesses from which they suffer.  As practitioners specializing in the care of 
the elderly, AGS members are particularly dedicated to improving how people live at the end of 
life and consequently have abiding concerns with the issues raised by proposals to legalize 
physician-assisted suicide (PAS).</p>

<P>	The AGS and its members have worked diligently to assure that even elderly persons 
with severe dependency and limited personal and family resources can count on reliable and 
effective diagnosis, treatment, prevention, rehabilitation and supportive care.  The AGS has 
encouraged care providers, the elderly, and their families to adopt an optimistic and energetic 
approach to treatment of illness.  However, geriatricians (including physicians, nurse 
practitioners, and other health-care professionals) also realize that all elderly persons die, and that 
serving people well in their old age requires incorporating that fact into judging various strategies 
<for care.  Just as we must strive to make available all potentially beneficial treatment, we must 
also strive to avoid interventions that are more harmful than beneficial.</p>

<P>	Legalization of PAS would create a moral dilemma for geriatricians.  Most elderly 
persons experience serious and progressive illness for extended periods before death and need 
significant social, financial and medical supports.   These resources too often are not available, 
are of inadequate quality, are not covered by insurance, and are not provided by public 
entitlement programs.   By collaborating in causing early deaths, when continuing to live has 
been made so difficult, geriatricians would become complicit in a social policy which effectively 
conserves community resources by eliminating those who need services.  By refusing to assist 
with suicides because a patients relative poverty and disadvantaged social situation is seen as 
coercive, geriatricians would condemn their patients, and themselves, to live through the 
patients undesired adversities for the time remaining.</p>

<P>	This conundrum has prevented defining a defensible role for geriatricians in any legalized 
practice of PAS.  These concerns have driven the members of the AGS to address this issue at a 
time when few professional organizations have done so.  The AGS position statements on PAS 
and euthanasia are attached.   The AGS opposes legalization of PAS at this time.  Elderly and 
frail persons would be put at risk, yet their interests and concerns have not been addressed in the 
public discussion of these issues.</p>

<P>	The AGS urges this Court to note that improving life at its end has only recently become 
the subject of research and innovation.  The potential consequences of accepting or tolerating 
PAS are unknown.  The AGS believes that continued debate on these issues is essential if there is 
to be wise policy.  The AGS takes no position on the merits of PAS for the patients in the cases 
before the Court.  Instead, the AGS urges this Court not to recognize a constitutional right to the 
practice of PAS.  At this time, the Court should exercise restraint in deciding a matter that would 
be more appropriately left to the states and the people.  The AGS adopts the legal argument 
advanced in the amicus brief of the Project on Death in America of the Open Society Institute 
which contends that the matter is not yet ripe for Constitutional adjudication.  The AGS limits 
this amicus brief to a presentation of  a medical perspective on the uncertainties that require 
study and resolution before PAS could be implemented as the policy of any jurisdiction, 
especially as a Constitutional right.</p>

<P><center><b>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT </b></center></p>

<P>	The courts for the Second and Ninth Circuits relied on three serious misperceptions in 
overturning state laws prohibiting PAS.   First, the courts were misinformed as to how people 
live while dying in the United States.  Contrary to the courts apparent assumptions, the plaintiff-
patients in Quill and Compassion in Dying do not represent the usual situation of persons facing 
the end of life; severe pain and other symptoms can be relieved for persons near death; and health 
care generally and at the end of life is undergoing major changes.</p>

<P>	Second, the lower courts mistakenly concluded that there is no significant difference 
between PAS and foregoing life-sustaining treatment.  From a medical standpoint, however, 
clinical, definitional, and procedural considerations reveal important distinctions.  These 
differences add to the legal, ethical, and historical distinctions identified by this court in 
Cruzan. </p>

	Third, the courts below mistakenly condition their holdings upon the erroneous 
assumptions that six restrictive criteria or safeguards can be easily identified and implemented:  
that the patients be (a) terminally ill, (b) competent, (c) suffering, (d) acting voluntarily and (e) 
seeking assistance in obtaining a means of suicide (f) which will be available only from a 
physician.  In fact, as the discussion below makes clear, the medical profession has no adequate 
definitions for some and lacks experience with all of them, making it unreasonable to believe that 
legislatures or courts could easily design procedures to ensure that each criterion could be met 
and could be sustained.

	In view of the misperceptions upon which the decisions below were based and the dearth 
of experience and knowledge that would be necessary to implement the exercise of a right to 
PAS, the AGS respectfully submits that a decision by this Court to constitutionalize access to 
PAS would be, at best, seriously premature.

ARGUMENT

I.	THE COURTS WERE MISLED BY MISPERCEPTIONS END-OF-LIFE 
EXPERIENCES.

<P><B>	A.	The Patient-Plaintiffs Are Not Representative of Dying Persons 
Generally.</b></p>

<P>	The named patients in the cases before the Court are dying in ways that do not 
characterize how people generally die in the United States.  The identified patients all have a 
single, well-defined disease:  three suffer from AIDS, two from cancer, and one from 
emphysema.  Their situations thus fail to reflect the multiple diseases and uncertain prognoses 
that are much more common in advanced old age.  Patient-plaintiffs ages average 56 years.  Not 
one of the named plaintiffs is as old as the median age of death in the United States, 77 years.   
None is characterized as poor, without family, or living in nursing homes.  All have physicians, 
and none mention problems of access due to inadequate health insurance.  This sample thus falls 
far short of representing the array of problems and concerns which should inform a determination 
of the constitutionality, or even the wisdom, of allowing PAS.  The relative simplicity of the 
medical and social situations of these patients appears to have misled the lower courts into 
believing that PAS is the only or best response to those patients problems.</p>

<P>	Much has changed about how people come to the end of their lives in the United States.  
No more than a century ago, dying afflicted every decade of adult life, nearly evenly.   The most 
common causes of death were infections and accidents, which generally allowed little time 
between onset and death.  Even cancer and heart disease were discovered late and the lack of 
effective treatment meant that death often occurred shortly after diagnosis.</p>

<P>	Average life spans have also increased.  Now, median life expectancy is 79 for women 
and 72 for men.  Among those who survive to age 65, median age at death is 84 for women and 
80 for men.   The usual causes of death now include cancer, heart disease, other organ system 
failures, and dementia, all of which are illnesses that ordinarily cause progressive disability over 
more than a year.   Typically, persons dying in their eighties and older succumb to a 
combination of loss of reserve capacity in aging organs, deficiencies in daily functioning, and 
diseases with specific etiology. </p>

<P>	Modern society must learn how to assure that dependent and disabled persons can live 
well, despite living for a long time with eventually fatal illnesses.  Prognosis is ordinarily 
uncertain.  Poverty and isolation are common.  Nearly one in five dies in a nursing home.   
Depression and other psychiatric problems are common and largely unrecognized.   
Characterizing the issue as simply acquiescing in the patients request to end his suffering, as the 
courts below did, is much more difficult when one imagines a slowly failing elderly widow who 
is blind, nearly deaf, disabled, and in a Medicaid nursing home, rather than when the claimant is  
a younger patient with  a predictably fatal illness.</p>

<P><B>B.	Dying is Mischaracterized as Unavoidably Dreadful.</B></P>
<P>	Contrary to the apparent assumptions by the courts below, fatal illness does not have to 
mean severe pain and suffering.  The Ninth Circuits opinion repeatedly describes dying painful, 
protracted, and agonizing.   The Ninth Circuit then contrasts this fate with death by assisted 
suicide with lets a patient:  end his life peacefully and with dignity. </p>

<P>	However, most people die quietly, most often in their sleep.   Hospice and palliative care 
programs have demonstrated that no dying person must live with overwhelming pain or other 
severe physical symptoms.  Severe and persistent pain affects about half of cancer patients  and 
for about one quarter of dying persons generally.   Sophisticated palliative care relieves pain for 
most of these patients without confusion or substantial sedation.  Intractable pain that can be 
relieved only by inducing sedation afflicts less than 3%, mostly very near the end of life.   
Aggressive palliative care and sedation near death are already permissible.  So is the removal of 
artificial nutrition and hydration  that were mentioned as sustaining two of the plaintiff-
patients.</p>

<P>	However, the standard of care lags behind what is possible to achieve, due both to 
barriers meant to limit the availability of narcotics and to delay in adoption of better practices by 
the health care professions.   Public policy should more vigorously encourage reliable relief of 
symptoms, but PAS is never the only option to relieve symptoms in a person near death.</p>

<P>	How society arranges services to support care of those at the end of life has profound 
effects upon how that life can be lived.  Life just before death can be especially precious and 
important.  When supported and comfortable, dying persons ordinarily accomplish important 
tasks, such as saying farewells, disposing of property, completing life projects, and enjoying their 
remaining days.  The courts below do not seem to have taken account of this possibility.  See, 
e.g., Quill, 80 F.3d at 729.</p>

<P>	Many persons consider suicide or wish for early death while they are angry or suffering.  
Since persons feeling worthless often test others to see whether these views are shared, 
encountering agreement actually functions to affirm the denigration of value.  To offer PAS at 
this time does not merely offer an option but also affirms feelings of worthlessness or 
devaluation.   Since, when comfortable and comforted, most feel that this was an unexpectedly 
important time,   encouraging supportive care and discouraging suicide seems well within the 
purview of wise public policy.</p>

<P><B>C.	The Lower Courts Misperceived Current Shortcomings in Care at the End of 
Life as Persistent and Unchanging.</b></P>
<P>	Discussions about PAS are clouded by the paucity of reliable information regarding death 
in the United States.   Nevertheless, this is clearly a time of great ferment.  Research in 
palliative care has developed considerably in the past twenty years.   About 61% of Americans 
die in hospitals and 17% in nursing homes, with the proportions in nursing homes increasing and 
those in hospitals decreasing.   In 1970, the standard of practice was to attempt resuscitation for 
virtually every person who died.   Now, foregoing life-sustaining treatment is commonplace,  
especially for those with poor prognoses for survival.  Resuscitation is attempted for only about 
10% of seriously ill persons who die in hospitals.   In the past, treatments were often continued 
for patients with poor prognoses and small chances of recovery. </p>

<P>	It is important to consider the major changes that are now reshaping health care generally.  
The rise of managed or capitated arrangements for service delivery and financing and the shift 
toward competing on costs rather than quality are rearranging relationships and roles.  The 
impact on end-of-life care is not yet clear.  But it is likely to include more reluctance to provide 
expensive care or to encourage patients and families to seek prolonged survival. </p>

<P>	The lower courts accept a descriptive claim that PAS already exists as a clandestine but 
widely acknowledged practice.   AGS leadership is not familiar with situations in which this is 
true, and it seems unlikely.  Three-quarters of all deaths happen in institutions where a 
regularized endeavor would require the collusion of a large number of persons, which seems 
implausible.  Little reliable evidence characterizes the rate and nature of actual instances of PAS. 
   Courts should not rely upon presumptions and unsubstantiated reports in such a matter.</p>

<P>	The constitutionality of PAS should not be resolved by reference to atypical situations 
and reliance upon misperceptions, as happened in these cases.  Consideration of the role of PAS 
must be part of a broader examination of how this society should care for people with fatal illness 
and is therefore an endeavor more properly undertaken by state legislatures and professional and 
lay organizations than by the federal judiciary.</p>

<P><B>II.	THE COURTS BELOW MISTAKENLY CONCLUDED THAT 
PHYSICIAN ASSISTED SUICIDE IS NO DIFFERENT FROM FOREGOING 
LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.</B></p>

<P>	The lower courts erred when they found no justification for distinguishing PAS from 
foregoing (withdrawing and withholding) life-sustaining treatment (FLST).  However, significant 
medical, legal, and societal distinctions exist between the two practices and fatally undermine the 
conclusion that they are entitled to the same legal status.  The AGS defines PAS as [w]hen a 
physician provides either equipment or medication, or informs the patient of the most efficacious 
use of already available means, for the sole purpose of assisting the patient to end his or her own 
life.  FLST is defined as [w]hen medical intervention is either not given or the on-going use of 
the intervention is discontinued, allowing natural progression of the underlying disease state.   
Major American medical associations and public committees and commissions  have recognized 
the distinctions between PAS and FLST.</p>

<P><B>A.	Descriptive Aspects Differentiate the Two Situations</b></P>
<P>	In addition to definitional differences and historical precedent, the situations involving 
PAS and FLST are associated with important moral and practical differences, including 
differences in access to medical care, in the practical effects of decisions, and in clinical 
intent.</P>

<P>	Patients wishing to forgo treatment are generally already receiving medical attention, and 
they have life-sustaining treatment available if desired.  Thus, FLST decisions are effectuated 
only when the life-sustaining treatment is unwarranted.  However, for those seeking PAS, suicide 
may become a substitute for valuable but inaccessible medical attention.  Persons seeking PAS 
may not know about, nor have available, other options for treatment, whether because of 
financial need, because their physician has inadequate skills,  or because social or ethnic barriers 
intervene.</p>

<P>	Patients receiving life-sustaining treatment are usually very sick and close to death, so 
that even aggressive intervention is unlikely to lengthen their lives appreciably.  With PAS, 
however, an individual may be giving up a more extended period of life.  Fear of suffering and of 
losing dignity, along with a desire to control circumstances of death, may prompt a request for 
assistance in suicide before suffering might become unbearable. </p>

<P>	In FLST, the intent is not to bring about the patients death but to respect the patients 
wishes not to be subjected to undesired treatment.  Once medical treatment is withdrawn or 
withheld, the underlying disease process usually leads to the patients death, though some 
survive.  Although a physician sometimes physically removes the life support, the underlying 
disease and not the physicians action is ordinarily considered the cause of death.  Failure to 
remove the undesired treatment would amount to battery, an unconsented touching.  In PAS, the 
physician may be acting in accord with the patients wishes, but death results from a drug 
overdose rather than a natural course of dying.</p>

<P>	The Second Circuits opinion also appears to suggest that PAS follows from aggressive 
pain management (80 f.3d at 729).  Good pain management, however, usually prolongs life, and 
even very high doses of opioids rarely cause respiratory depression in patients who have been 
taking them for more than a few days.   Further, good palliative care aims to eliminate the 
suffering, whereas PAS succeeds only by eliminating the sufferer.</p>

<P><B>B.	Rights Against Interference Are Stronger Claims than Those for 
Assistance.</B></P>

<P>	This Court has established that patients have the authority to forgo life sustaining 
treatment, based on the requirement that the patients informed consent is required for medical 
intervention.   The authority to forgo life-sustaining treatment is thus a right to prevent 
unwanted bodily intrusion.  Withdrawing or withholding a treatment to honor the patients 
refusal of consent is not a matter of providing a patient with assistance but one of leaving that 
patient alone.  Physicians may not impose treatment on a patient who refuses that treatment, even 
if the physician believes that the treatment will benefit the patient.  This right to be left alone 
does not imply any corollary right to receive a form of assistance such as PAS.</p>

<P><B>C.	The Restriction of Physician-Assisted Suicide to a Narrow Class of Persons 
Highlights Its Differences from Foregoing Life-Sustaining Treatment.</B></P>

<P>	FLST is an option for all treatments and all patients, just like any other medical decision.  
If PAS were equivalent to FLST, it should be available to all patients. Yet both courts below and 
all current legislative proposals restrict the right to PAS to a certain category of patients
terminally ill, competent, acting voluntarily, and suffering.  Unlike FLST, no proposal allows 
PAS to be directed in advance or by surrogate decision makers.  The uniform agreement on such 
restrictions clearly suggests that the courts, the legislatures, and the policymakers recognize clear 
distinctions between PAS from FLST.</p>

<P><B>D.	The History of Familiarity with Foregoing Life-Sustaining Treatment 
Contrasts Sharply with the Lack of Experience with Physician-Assisted 
Suicide.</b></p>

<P>	As this Court recognized in Cruzan, the right to reject life-sustaining medical treatment 
has had a long history of public acceptance, from legal, ethical, and medical perspectives.   
Rooted in the common law doctrine of informed consent and recognized by courts, legislatures, 
and the health care professions, a consensus has emerged that persons generally have the right to 
refuse medical interventions, even though death may result.</p>

<P>	In sharp contrast, no such consensus surrounds the practice of PAS.  It has no common-
law basis and has not been recognized widely by courts, legislatures, the public, or the medical 
profession.  Most states have statutes prohibiting the practice of PASsimilar to the New York 
and Washington statutes struck down by the courts below in these cases.  The practice has been 
approved by the voters in only one state, Oregon, where an initiative passed by a narrow margin 
but has not yet been implemented.  The striking lack of any substantive experience with PAS, 
and the myriad restrictions attached to every proposed formulation of a right to request it, show 
that PAS is considered quite differently by allits proponents, the law, health care providers, 
and the public.</p>

<P><B>III.	THE CONSTRAINTS PROPOSED FOR THE PRACTICE OF 
PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE PRESENT INTRACTABLE 
PROBLEMS.</b></p>

<P>	As noted above, the plaintiffs below sought PAS in suicide only for a limited class of 
persons.  Accordingly, the right to assisted suicide recognized in both cases is confined to adult 
patients who have terminal illnesses; are mentally competent; suffer from chronic and/or severe 
pain; and make a voluntary request for PAS.  In addition, the only authorized method of 
assistance is through a physician's prescription of lethal medication which the patient must self-
administer.</p>

<P>	The Second and Ninth Circuits found a constitutional right to PAS conditional upon these 
criteria, which they assume will also function as safeguards to prevent mistakes or abuse.  As the 
discussion below demonstrates, however, those decisions were based upon erroneous 
assumptions about the feasibility of both defining and applying the eligibility criteria. In fact, if 
PAS were to be implemented, determining the eligible population would be intractably difficult 
and the proposed constraints would likely fail to provide the safeguards upon which the lower 
courts decisions were based.</p>

<P><B>A.	Terminal Illness</b></p>
	Various statutory proposals and the cases before this Court contemplate that PAS will be 
authorized only for those who are terminally ill.   The opinions below suggest that limiting 
the category to terminal illness helps to make the shortening of life acceptable and presume 
that the category can be clearly delineated.  The Second and Ninth Circuits dismissed arguments 
asserting the difficulty of determining when a patient is terminally ill, noting that terminal 
illness and terminal condition have been defined repeatedly...in a model statute, the Uniform 
Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, and in over 40 state natural death statutes.   In actuality, such 
judgments are notoriously difficult to make.  Indeed, because terminal illness or terminal 
condition is so difficult to define, the new Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act, which supersedes 
the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act,  upon which the Ninth Circuit partially relied, 
omits any reference to terminal condition and does not attempt to define terminal illness.  The 
reasons for this omission have been explained as follows by David English, the reporter for this 
new Uniform Act:  Most existing advance directive legislation becomes effective only if a 
patient is in a terminal condition, or is permanently unconscious.  Such restrictions have 
severely limited the usefulness of many state statutes and, indeed, have rendered them virtual 
nullities. 

	As the drafters of this new Uniform Act thus recognized, terminal illness is notoriously 
difficult to define, and the working definitions of terminal illness for hospice or advance 
directive legislation are neither relevant nor reassuring, as the courts below erroneously 
concluded.

<P>	Hospice programs, for example, enroll mostly persons with some cancers.   Referral to 
hospice is most often initiated when such a patient experiences a deterioration in function, weight 
and comfort, usually three to six weeks ahead of death.   For cancer, then, the clinical course 
dictates timing, which is much shorter than the statutory prognosis requirement of six months.  
Other illnesses do not regularly have such a final, relatively distinct, phase of clinical 
deterioration, and they are engendering problems when referred into hospice. </p>

<P>	A more rigorous definition of terminal illness seems necessary for PAS, since PAS has 
such significant and irreversible consequences.  Three general approaches might be used in 
attempting to define the category terminally ill:  subjective judgment, statistical criteria, or a 
disease severity threshold.  An examination of each of these reveals crippling problems.</p>

<P><B>1.	Subjective Determination</b></p>
<P>	Some person or persons could be designated to judge whether a patient is terminally ill, 
using information about the patients situation, prognosis, care needs, and preferences.  At 
present, the patient, family, and professional caregivers negotiate the designation while 
discussing plans and making decisions.  The label then marks a change from a strategy of 
correcting abnormalities with the expectation of long survival to a strategy focusing on function, 
comfort, and emotional and spiritual support with the expectation of death.</p>

<P>	In routine patient care, the timing of this change in focus does not much matter.  The 
various participants can arrive at the designation at somewhat different times.  However, the 
obvious variation in and diffuseness of this process would be troubling in the context of 
determining eligibility for authorizing PAS, and the fact that availability of PAS would be 
contingent on a designation of being terminally ill may result in pressure to accelerate or resist 
the label.</p>

<P><B>2.	Statistical Determination</b></p>

<P>	Defining terminal illness with an explicit statistical threshold seems to offer clarity:  a 
person is either below or above that threshold.  However, this approach fails as it encounters at 
least four serious barriers.</P>
<P>	First, the data necessary to calculate estimates which can be compared with a legislated 
statistical threshold is only rarely available.  Very little research addresses the issue.  Most 
people will die of conditions that are not predictable with a statistical model. </p>

<P>	Second, the threshold is unavoidably arbitrary, with many borderline cases and 
unavoidable errors of overinclusion and underinclusion.  Any threshold will include people who 
will live a long time; the rate increases with more inclusive thresholds.  A population in which 
each person has exactly a 25% chance to live six months will have one in four persons still alive 
at six months.  The threshold should include all those who will soon die of a serious chronic 
disease.  However, some diseases are intrinsically unpredictable, even very close to death.   No 
reason justifies setting the threshold at any particular point, thus rendering any threshold arbitrary 
and subject to dispute.</p>

<P>	Third, any specific threshold is inconsistent with current usage of the category.  The 
popular conception of terminal illness mainly deals with cancer, neurological degenerative 
disease, and AIDS patients, all persons who have no available treatment, are losing weight and 
function, and who are psychologically ready to die.  Most persons dying of chronic organ 
system failure will be excluded with a restrictive threshold and many persons with substantial 
opportunities for treatment and prolonged survival will be encompassed within an inclusive 
threshold.  </p>

<P>	Fourth, the prognosis for survival can depend upon patient and physician choice and 
availability of treatment.  A person with diabetes could stop insulin, a person with a feeding tube 
could stop its use, or a person with heart disease could be refused for transplant.  If thereby such 
a person becomes terminally ill, then the category is disquietingly dependent upon volitional 
actions rather than patient status.</p>

<P>	Thus, defining the category of terminal illness with a statistical threshold would be 
arbitrary and certain to overinclude and underinclude substantial populations.</p>

<P><B>3.	Disease Threshold</b></p>

<P>	The third way to define terminal illness ties the classification to clinically significant 
and morally important events, such as the recurrence of cancer in a distant site or the onset of 
fecal incontinence in a demented person.  However, an individuals status is not well 
characterized by the extent of one serious disease.  Rather, a persons future is shaped by a 
variety of illnesses; reserve capacity of various organs; social situation; personal preferences; and 
treatment availability, use, and response.  Thus, many of the patients included will actually have 
long expected lifespans.  This method is also afflicted with problems described above with 
regard to a statistical criterion.</p>

<P>	Thus, no approach to defining terminal illness offers a simple and feasible method for 
determining who should have access to PAS.  The problems appear to be intractable and no 
experience yet shows that they can be overcome.</p>

<P>	Finally, even if terminal illness could be satisfactorily defined, it would not last long as a 
restriction on PAS.  The courts below held, for example, that there are no differences between 
PAS and FLST.  If that were true, requiring terminal illness would eventually be dropped, since 
there is no such requirement for FLST.</p>

<P><B>B.	Competence</b></p>

<P>	Another criterion, upon which the right to PAS recognized by the courts below is 
contingent, is competency at the time the request for PAS is made and implemented.  This 
criterion is also problematic.  Classifying competence is difficult and sometimes impossible.  In 
addition, the requirement raises troubling questions about PAS, since it may induce patients to 
choose suicide preemptively, in order to preclude losing the option through a subsequent 
deterioration in their mental faculties.  Furthermore, the competence requirement interacts with 
the requirement for being terminally ill, since patients tend to lose competence as illness 
becomes more severe.</p>

<P>	Although a variety of legal and medical decisions are predicated on a finding of 
competency, there is no uniform standard or set of procedures for making this determination.   
In practice, such judgments typically are made by health care professionals, in consultation with 
family members, and may be influenced by many factors, including the purpose of the 
evaluation.  No professional discussion yet addresses appropriate competence standards for PAS, 
what components of cognitive and emotional functioning should be measured, or how capable 
the person must be in each component (or all taken together) in order to qualify for PAS.</p>

<P>	The seriously ill commonly have deficits in cognitive and emotional functioning which 
change over relatively short periods of time and correlate strongly with suicide inquiries.  Many 
elderly patients and dying cancer patients experience delirium, a syndrome in which they are 
confused, unable to maintain attention, and unable to master new information.   Most episodes 
are not detected in usual care.  Likewise, depression is common, serious, and often undetected 
and untreated.   Depression, delirium, and mood disorders have a strong correlation with 
suicide.  Indeed, most cancer patients now committing suicide have discernible psychiatric 
illness, and having such an illness corresponds strongly with risk of suicide.   Treatment of 
depression substantially alters initial inclination to refuse life-sustaining treatment.   Excluding 
these patients from access to PAS would be essential, but that turns out to be quite difficult.  
Most depression, just like most delirium, is not recognized or treated in current practice.   The 
risks of involving persons with diminished capacity in PAS are substantial.  Furthermore, a 
narrow definition of terminal illness will yield high rates of long survival.</p>

<P>	Moreover, as suggested above, a special problem with a lengthy dying process is fear of 
the indignity associated with incompetence.   If the right to PAS extends only to those with 
contemporaneous competence, then patients with conditions likely to lead to incompetence may 
find it appealing to undertake preemptive suicide.  This is a special risk in early dementia, when 
patients retain ability to understand but have failing memory.  The rate of progression to 
cognitive disability is unpredictable.  Thus dementia patients hoping to avoid the worst-case 
scenario may be sacrificing many comfortable and relatively capable years if they seek PAS 
preemptively.</p>

<P><B>C.	Undue InfluenceCoercion.</b></p>

<P><B>1.	The Context of Care</b></P>

<p>	Proponents of a constitutional right to PAS expect the practice to be limited to persons 
who are acting voluntarily or without undue influence or coercion.  The image is that of an 
independent, capable person thoughtfully evaluating his or her options, unaffected by biased 
third parties or other circumstances.  This is so far from the experience of dying as to be fanciful.  
Dying persons are often very weak; prone to strong emotions; and vulnerable to the suggestions, 
expectations, and guidance of others.  In this context, pressure or encouragement from family, 
friends, and caregivers may cloud or overwhelm the patients independent judgment and thus 
amount to inappropriate coercion. </P>

<P>	The health care available to the terminally ill may be the most important factor 
influencing the care provided and may result in requests for PAS that could be avoided if 
appropriate care were available.  Large variations in whether people die at home or in a hospital 
in various regions of the country are strongly related to hospital bed supply and regional hospice 
investment, and not to preferences, wealth, family presence, or other patient 
characteristics. </p>

<P><B>2.	Financial Considerations</b></p>

<P>	Patients nearing death are generally quite disabled and their care is costly.  While hospital 
and physician costs decline past the age of 70, long-term care costs rise, and these are mostly 
borne privately. </p>

<P>	The plaintiff-patients in the cases below do not appear to have been burdened with 
economic difficulties.  Yet, economic influences are probably the most important in defining a 
population eligible for PAS.  One-quarter of those over 65 are below 150% of the Federal 
poverty level, and institutional long-term care has become largely a poverty program under 
Medicaid.   As pressures increase to curtail health care expenses, hospital admissions are limited 
and hospitalizations are shortened.  Decreasing availability and increasing expense in health care 
and the uncertain impact of managed care may intensify pressure to choose PAS.</p>

<P>	Should financial pressures be considered undue influence or not?  This is the special 
dilemma of those who serve the frail, disabled, and poor.  The AGS's concern is that PAS may 
become inherently coercive in a society in which supportive services and medical care are often 
unavailable.  It would be ironic, indeed, to have a constitutional right to PAS when there is no 
guarantee of access to health care.</p>

<P><B>D.	Suffering.</b></p>
<P>	The courts below also appear to assume that the right to PAS may be reliably limited to 
persons who are suffering or in pain.  Medical practice has no consensus on how to define or 
measure such a state.  Most patients can be physically comfortable without sedation, and sedation 
can always eliminate symptoms in persons near death.  This course is available at present, 
without any change in the law, and thus precludes a requirement that the patient must have 
symptoms that cannot be relieved.  While some may view such treatment as undesirable, it is 
difficult to see why death through PAS should be considered a distinctly better (and 
constitutionally dictated) policy option.</p>

<P><B>E.	Physician Involvement</B></p>

<P>	There is little reason to believe that physicians now have expertise in modes of killing, 
yet all proposals for PAS mandate physician participation.  Although the counseling skills and 
prescription-writing privileges of physicians might at first blush suggest that their participation in 
PAS is appropriate, this Court should recognize the difficulties this requirement imposes upon 
medical caregivers.  There is no drug approved as safe and effective and therefore no drug legally 
available for PAS,  no instruction is given in medical texts , and practice standards show 
pervasive inattention to counseling and symptom management for those near death.  Physicians 
are usually required to inform patients of alternatives which might be advantageous.  No 
proposal has exempted PAS, but the ill persons have not been considered in the discussions to 
date.  The potential for engendering distrust and diminishing effectiveness in physician-patient 
encounters may justify not engaging physicians in this work.  Without experience, recognizing a 
right to commit suicide through the assistance of physicians is clearly premature.</p>

<P><B>F.	The Scope of Assistance </B></p>
<P>	The constitutional right to PAS articulated by the courts below limits the physicians aid 
to prescribing medications in lethal doses.  Clinical experience suggests that this limit is 
untenable and will inevitably lead to demands for more active physician involvement in bringing 
about the patients death.</p>

<P>	If a physician were to prescribe medication in a dose which should be sufficient to cause 
death, the rulings below require that the patient seeking PAS actually ingest the drugs and do not 
provide for any further assistance by the physician.  Very likely, patients will sometimes take too 
little of the drug, will be more resistant than expected, or might vomit and lose much of what was 
ingested.  Determining the appropriate response to a partial overdose in the context of legal, 
assisted suicide would pose difficult problems for physicians, family members, or friends, since 
survival with brain damage and incompetence could result.</p>

<P>	Such difficulties seem likely to lead to pressure to allow intravenous administration of 
lethal drugs, both because they are more reliable and because they bring about death without 
apparent symptoms, such as prolonged respiratory distress, that might be difficult for family 
members or attendants to witness.  Limiting the scope of physician assistance to the prescription 
of lethal drugs is thus unlikely to be sustainable.  The experiences of physician assisted death in 
The Netherlands suggest that a progression from patient self-administration of lethal medication 
to physician assistance with intravenous routes is not an unlikely consequence of allowing 
PAS. </p>

<P>	In summary, the criteria delimiting the boundaries of the constitutional right to PAS 
found by the courts below are inherently unstable, difficult or impossible to define, and probably 
incapable of application at the present time.  Without the benefit of further experience, there 
simply is no way of knowing whether this society could accommodate the exercise of a 
constitutional right dependent on these eligibility criteria.</p>

<P><B>IV.	The Court should Vacate the Orders of the Lower Courts </B></P>

<P>	This Court should reverse the opinions of the lower courts, and decline to recognize a 
constitutional right to PAS for a limited class of persons at the end of life.  This is clearly an 
issue that is not ripe for consideration by this Court now.  We explicitly adopt the legal argument 
for this position as presented by the Project on Death in America in an amicus brief filed in these 
cases. </p>
<P>	As explained above, no jurisdiction in the United States has yet had any experience with 
the practice that, it is contended, should be recognized as a fundamental right.  The AGS has 
been opposed to legalizing PAS or physician involvement in euthanasia, primarily on the 
grounds that our frail elderly patients are especially vulnerable to social coercion and that the 
well-being of those who are old and sick is not being carefully considered in the legislative and 
judicial discussion around this issue.</p>

<P>	This is a very dynamic time with regard to care at the end of life.  Only in the last few 
decades has living past the eighth decade become commonplace, and only recently has dying 
become a slow process in the setting of progressive chronic disease.  New findings about what 
can be done with regard to relieving symptoms and supporting dying persons and their families 
are being reported regularly.  States continue to debate their support of the poor and their 
willingness to allow PAS.  This is a time to enhance our understanding of how to care for dying 
patients, not a time to foreclose further learning by precluding innovation and evaluation.</p>

<P>	Instead, we believe that the issue should be left to institutions more able to fashion 
flexible resolutions, with the benefit of further study and debate, such as state legislatures, the 
health care professions, and community organizations.</p>

<P>	In this connection, we note that, should the Court agree with the petitioners arguments 
that the New York and Washington statutes do not violate the 14th Amendment, then the 10th 
Amendment could provide an additional constitutional framework for reversal.   Since the 
Constitution neither delegates to the federal government the power to regulate PAS, no prohibits 
is regulation by the States, [such power is] reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people. </p>

<P><center>CONCLUSION</center></P>

<P>	For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the United States Courts of Appeals for the 
Second and Ninth Circuits should be reversed.</p>

the patients pain, for pain is a respiratory stimulant.  Tolerance to respiratory depression develops rapidly so that

General, with disagreements on prognosis as hospice expands to enroll patients dying of chronic diseases. JG

March 1996). See also Standards and Accreditation Committee, Medical Guidelines Task Force, Medical Guidelines

<P>  APACHE III and similar systems estimate the risks of dying during a particular hospitalization for very 
seriously ill patients in hospital intensive care units.  W.A. Knaus et al, The APACHE III Prognostic System.  Risk 
Prediction of Hospital Mortality for Critically Ill Hospitalized Adults. 100 Chest 16191636, (1991). SUPPORTs 
formula allows estimation of survival throughout the ensuing six months, but only for certain seriously ill patients 
with nine specific diseases, treated in hospitals.  W.A. Kanaus, et. Al., The SUPPORT Prognostic Model:  Objective 
Estimates of Survival for Seriously Ill Hospitalized Adults, 122 Ann. Internal Med. 191203 (1995).  Other available 
formulae are even more similarly restricted in population, setting, or data collected.</p>
<P>  The estimate is the midpoint of possible predictions arising from the research database.</p>
<P>  Prognoses are surprisingly optimistic very near to death.  Lung cancer patients in one study had a median 
prognosis of 17% to live two months on the day before death, and 50% just one week before death.  Those dying of 
congestive heart failure, however, had a prognosis of more than 60% to live two months, and more than 40% to live 
six months, on the day before death.  So, any criterion requiring less than 5050 chances to live two months would 
exclude virtually all of those who die with congestive heart failure; J. Lynn et al., Defining the Terminally Ill: 
Insights from SUPPORT, 35 Duquesne Law Review 311336 (1996).</p>
<P>  Id; Half of all persons who die of lung cancer today will have had a prognosis of better than 30% to live 2 
months, just one week ago, so any more restrictive threshold will miss most persons dying of lung cancer.  
Conversely, such a threshold will include many persons with acute respiratory, cardiac, or liver failure, who usually 
are vigorously treated.  In fact, they qualify for transplantation only when they become so severely ill.  If the 
category were expanded to include everyone with up to a 50% chance to live six months, most nursing home 
residents would qualify.  If the category were restricted to those with a 1% chance to live two months, not only 
would one exclude virtually all cancer patients but those in the category would be so sick that they would, on 
average, die within a day; see  also J.M. Teno et al., Prognosis-Based Futility Guidelines:  Does Anyone Win?  42 J.

August 1996<br>

<center><h2>TURKMENISTAN BACKGROUND</h2></center>
Turkmenistan is a large country in Central Asia, mostly desert and 
sparsely populated, with about four million inhabitants. It is divided 
into five administrative districts formerly known as oblasts and now 
called veloiats. The capital, Ashgabat, is the largest city, with a 
population of about 400,000; the four other main cities, the veloiat 
capitals of Chardzhou, Krasnovodsk (Turkmenbashi), Mary, and Tashouz, 
each have a population of under 150,000, and all other population 
centers are much smaller.
<p>
Turkmenistan is about seventy percent Turkmens, twenty percent Uzbeks 
along the northern border, and about ten percent other (mostly 
Russians). While Russians do not for the most part report that they are 
made to feel unwelcome, they do report an ethnic discrimination policy 
(as in most other NIS republics) whereby all the top leadership of any 
enterprise or government organ must be Turkmens, regardless of skill. 
Many Russians have left, especially those with a higher level of 
education.
<p>
Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan has made the least 
progress in moving toward a market-oriented economy, and its political 
system is the most repressive, offering little in the way of even token 
democracy. The president, Sapurmurad Niiazov, controls every aspect of 
the country, mostly through patronage; corruption is rampant and a high 
post can be lucrative. While the president has announced his intent to 
create a society where basic goods and services are free, the result so 
far has been a precipitous fall in living standards to the point where 
they are arguably the lowest in the NIS and still falling.
<p>
The national currency, the manat, was introduced in 1993 and valued at 
two to the dollar, but is now traded at about 4650 to the dollar and is 
still falling in value. Any economic activity quickly runs up against 
the difficulty of converting manats into a currency acceptable to a 
business partner abroad, whether in Moscow, Istanbul, Bagdad, or Dubai.
<p>
Water is also a key currency. Because of insufficient delivery 
infrasctructure, even cold water is in most places available only for an 
hour or two in the morning and the evening. The country's agricultural 
economy, such as it is, is based on cotton, which requires irrigation. 
As elsewhere in Central Asia, many years of a cotton monoculture 
enforced by Moscow has resulted in fields so salinated and water tables 
so high that much agricultural land is no longer usable.
<p>
Niiazov, who took control shortly after Turkmenistan's independence was 
declared upon the breakup of the USSR in 1991, has assumed the surrogate 
last name "Turkmenbashi", or "head of the Turkmens", and to a ludicrous 
extent has established his visage and name as the symbol of the 
country--on all money, on statutes everywhere,on many public buildings, 
in every office (public and private) in the country, as street names in 
every city and town, and indeed as the name of a number of cities and 
towns themselves.
<p>
The telephone system works about averagely poorly for the NIS. From most 
lines a telephone call beyond the borders of the city cannot be dialed 
directly, but many government orders placed with e.g. Siemens for modern 
intercity and in some cases city telephone switches are in various 
stages of installation. An exclusive 25-year contract for creation and 
operation of a national analog cell phone network has been provided to 
Barash Communications Technologies Inc., an American company created by 
a Russian emigre. In most cities the cell phones work but not perfectly; 
in one city they can't call locally, in another they can't call 
long-distance, etc. Their cost--$50/mo plus $0.50/min--prices them out 
of the reach of all but perhaps 1000 subscribers nationwide. One local 
puts it this way: our cities are so small that telephones aren't 
important enough to merit spending lots of money on a cell phone; if you 
can't get through, you just drive over with your question--it's only a 
couple minutes, and there's no hurry to do anything in Central Asia.
<p>
The Turkmen language is a member of the Turkic group, and shortly after 
independence the country began to move quickly toward using Latin 
instead of the Soviet-enforced Cyrillic alphabet. Most signs have 
already been changed, although all mass media is still in Cyrillic.
<p>
This report is the result of a one-week trip made in August 1996 by the 
author to the Turkmenistani capital and three of the veloiat capitals to 
investigate the commercial TV environment. The author wishes to thank 
the dozens of people who unfailingly graciously and helpfully made 
themselves available for interviews.
<p>
<center><h2>THE MEDIA ENVIRONMENT</h2></center>
In the early 1990s, independent media appeared and became popular as in 
other NIS republics, but during the period 1994-5 it was all effectively 
closed down, apparently by decision of the president. In 1991 the 
country's parliament passed a Law on Mass Media identical to the 
relatively liberal USSR one of that year. This law remains in effect. 
Modifications have been proposed by the State Print Committee but not 
yet passed, and we did not have time to examine them.
<p>
Rumors of an official ban on cable TV, a ban on private transmitter 
ownership, and a ban on non- government broadcasting have proved 
impossible to confirm since no one, from the state broadcasting 
authority to the parliament to the state library, was willing or able to 
satisfy request for copies of legislation impacting television 
broadcasting. To the best of our knowledge, when State TV was converted 
into the National TV & Radio Company a secret decree gave it the power 
to regulate all broadcasting in the republic, and fearing competition 
(and ideological pollution) it does not allow any to occur.
<p>
Starting in the late 1980s cable TV appeared in all of Turkmenistan's 
cities. On 24 May 1990, a Law for Regulation of Video Salons, Video 
Bars, and Video Rentals  was passed in Turkmenistan which gave the State 
Film Committee (Goskino) a monopoly over showing all video in the 
republic. The law did not mention cable TV, but Goskino has interpreted 
the law to mean that all video showing, including cable TV, can only be 
done by them: to open a cable TV or video salon enterprise, a private 
individual must first get written permission from the city government, 
and then Goskino will sanction the activity, essentially by authorizing 
the creation of a Goskino daughter enterprise run by the private 
individual. This model worked for a while but in 1994 most cable TV was 
closed down because of the general clampdown on independent activity. In 
some of the large cities (Chardzhou, Krasnovodsk, Mary) cable TV remains 
but is extremely weak (subscribers number in the hundreds) and shows no 
production of its own.
<p>
Frequency management is carried out by a subdivision of the Ministry of 
Communications called the State Commission on Radio Frequencies (SCRF, 
formerly known as GIE). Although newspaper articles have declared that 
VSATs (satellite dishes) must be registered with the SCRF, the latter's 
director says this is untrue; if asked to, the SCRF will provide 
registration papers for a nominal fee ($4) to mollify overzealous 
customs inspectors who think that the dishes might be communications 
equipment and thus regulated. Of course, the SCRF doesn't mind the 
modest additional income, and that is probably the reason the newspaper 
articles appeared in the first place. In the event, though, almost no 
one has registered their dish.
<p>
There are about 250 satellite dishes in each of the four regional cities 
and perhaps 1000 in the capital. For the most part they are used for 
reception of Russian TV programs: Channel 1, Channel 2, Moscow's Channel 
6, and for the very few who have Ku-band equipment, NTV and St 
Petersburg's Channel 6. The initial interest in Astra and Asiasat 
flagged as the language barrier kicked in (few speak English).
<p>
ORT, Russia's Channel 1, is broadcast over the air everywhere in 
Turkmenistan. There are two national TV channels, TMT1 and TMT2 (the 
latter occupying the transmitters which were formerly used for Channel 2 
from Moscow). Both are strictly managed by the government in the capital 
and distributed to the country by transmitters situated every 160 km 
along the microwave lines which run from Ashgabat to the east to the 
Caspian and to the west and then north to Uzbekistan.. There used to be 
state-run mini-channels in several of the viloiat centers, but they have 
been all closed down in the mid-1990s to ensure that the media is 
totally controlled by the center.
<p>
In the capital, the Turks pay for their pan-Central Asian satellite 
beam, Avrasye, to be transmitted over the air on a local transmitter. 
The Ministry of Communications has proposed to the government to do the 
same for Turkish radio, since there are a number (seven by one report) 
of unused high-power radio transmitters outside Ashgabat (including 
equipment used during the Soviet period to jam Western radio 
transmittions).
<p>
Turkmenistan is the only CIS country which refused to join the 
intergovernmental TV company "Mir", which has been allocated time on ORT 
(Russia's Channel 1). The official line is that Turkmenistan now holds 
to a policy of "positive neutrality", a designation the president says 
the country was awarded by the UN but which no one understands. In any 
case the reason is more likely to be that Mir requires money which 
Turkmenistan does not have. Also, insofar as we were able to determine, 
Turkmenistan lacks a satellite transmission unit which could send video. 
(There is said to be an 8-Mbps data transmitter run by an Italian 
company over an Intelsat bird.)
<p>
The State Film & Video Company licenses video rental stores. One of its 
licensees said that the Company also engages in distributing 
videocassettes around the country, but the Company denies this. In any 
case none of the videocassettes in the country are legal. Cassette 
rental costs about $0.13 for one day. Each rental store is likely to 
have from 100 to 500 cassettes, mostly Western action movies.
<p>
When videos are shown in public (e.g. on TV), as in neighboring 
countries, the parts with graphic exposure of sex or violence are cut or 
replaced by advertisements--or just faded out for a second or two!
<p>
Local journalists report that the Turkmenistan government is still 
extremely sensitive about publication of any non-sanctioned information 
within the country, particularly in the Turkmen language. It seems to 
have loosened up considerably with respect to what gets sent abroad 
about Turkmenistan; for instance, correspondents for Russian 
publications are not subjected to the same degree of harassment as in 
Uzbekistan.
<p>
<center><h2>PRINT MASS MEDIA</h2></center>
There is one national daily four-page newspaper, Turkmenistan, published 
in Turkmen and, under the name Neitral'nyi Turkmenistan (formerly 
Turkmenskaia iskra), in Russian, with occasional versions in Kazakh and 
Uzbek. Each viloiat has a thrice-weekly broadsheet published in Turkmen 
and Russian.
<p>
There is one "independent" newspaper, Turkmenistan segodnia, which is 
printed in Moscow, but it comes out rarely (seven issues in three years) 
and is under tight Turkmenistan governmental control.
<p>
The official state news agency is TurkmenPress. A private company run by 
a former Turkmenpress chief, Murat Kuranov, has created an "information 
agency" which provides services to foreign correspondents and embassies, 
including a sort of clipping service where all information from all 
electronic and print sources in the country is typed into a computer-- 
resulting in a raw text database (in Russian) of about 15 megabytes of 
information as of this writing. We advised Murat to get e-mail, which he 
promptly did, but he does not use it much. He can be reached at 
<a href="murad@ric.cat.glasnet.ru"><b> murad@ric.cat.glasnet.ru</b></a>
<p>.

<center><h2>ELECTRONIC MASS MEDIA</h2></center>
Because of the ban on non-governmental broadcasting, there is 
practically no broadcasting outside of the state-run TMT1, TMT2, and 
ORT.
<p>
State TV operates with an almost total lack of equipment. Though the 
central studio has some Betacam SP (nine cameras and six editing suites) 
equipment, most of its work is done on VHS (several dozen cameras and 
VTRs), and the four regional studios, each of which is supposed to 
provide about ten hours of programming per month to the central channel, 
each have only one or two VHS cameras and no editing equipment. State TV 
accepts advertising at rates of about $200 per spot, but during my 
entire stay I didn't see a single ad. No one watches State TV so it is 
unclear why anyone would pay for air time on it.
 State TV is by all reports a dinosaur. For instance, the cultural 
section of the US embassy reports that when State TV borrows cassettes, 
they fail to return them and claim ignorance, and when the Americans 
sponsored a trip to the US for a shooting group from State TV to produce 
a program about the US, the shooting group a month after its return 
reported that it "couldn't find" any of the ten cassettes it shot in the 
US and nothing would be produced.
<p>
 There is a rumor that the Turkmenistani government is preparing to 
sanction the opening of a commercial channel in the capital, but it 
would be owned by State TV. The limit of its independence would probably 
be its ability to show "pozdravleniia", pirated video clips dedicated to 
a wife or boyfriend and costing several dollars to order. State TV says, 
though, that this is unlikely to happen since it doesn't even have the 
resources to fill its own air, much less do any commercial work.
<p>
In 1993 there were commercial TV channels in several of the republic's 
cities--at a minimum, in Ashgabat, Krasnovodsk, and Dashkhovuz. However, 
in 1994 they were all closed down using the excuse of accusations 
revolving around illegal financial machinations. As far as could be 
determined, these accusations were groundless, and the closures had no 
legal basis--at any rate no one has actually seen official documents 
which would restrict private TV transmitter ownership or use. The 
largest station was Sakhra, first in Krasnovodsk and then in Ashgabat. 
Sakhra operated from October 1993 to November 1994, broadcasting on its 
own transmitter on channel 11. Part of the scandal around Sakhra was 
related to the fact that its employees and equipment were the same as 
those of State TV, so in effect the private channel was siphoning 
resources off of State TV. Sakhra's less-then-above-board operation 
created a suspicion toward any commercial TV ventures which lingers to 
this day among the country's leadership.
<p>
A strange exception to the unofficial ban on non-state TV is a small 
private station serving a village where the employees of Turkmenistan's 
largest power station live (the Mary GRES). A local businessman who has 
amassed a small fortune through an investment in a leather factory 
established Gonkhor, which broadcasts fifteen hours a day. Most of its 
air time is taken up by rebroadcasting from satellite either Russian TV 
(Channel 2) or one of the channels on Asiasat, which it receives on its 
three 2-m dishes, but it does produce perhaps ten minutes per day of its 
own programming on themes which can't offend the government: health, 
culture, music, computer and language lessons, etc. The station uses 
professional S-VHS equipment: one AG- 455 camera and a full editing 
suite based on the 7750 line of Panasonic equipment. Gonkhor broadcasts 
on a 100-w transmitter on channel eight, and it is hoping to expand the 
territory it covers by putting its antenna on one of the smokestacks at 
the power plant; the microwave relay for this is already installed. It 
is doubtful that it will be allowed to expand in order to reach an 
audience sufficiently large to be able to sell advertising and start 
moving toward financial viability.
<p>
 Gonkhor survives because its owner promised the government he would 
encode his signal. Thus, only the 200 families in the village who pay 
the $2/mo for a decoder can see the station's broadcasts. Also, Gonkhor 
will sometimes sell its programs to State TV in Ashgabat.
<p>
Several almost-stations exist in Turkmenistan; however, until the 
official ban is lifted, they cannot be counted as non-governmental TV 
stations since they do not feel able to release onto the air any of 
their own production.
<p>
 In the north in Tashouz, the local natural gas processing plant has 
refurbished a 5-kw transmitter, receives Moscow's Channel 2 by microwave 
from Nukus in Uzbekistan (where a dish pulls it down from satellite), 
and rebroadcasts it without modification. However, probably because the 
satellite dish lacks tracking equipment, the signal is clear in the 
morning but by mid- afternoon fades out completely.
 In Chardzhou a private station was formed several years ago with the 
political and financial backing of local businessmen but in spite of 
support from the local government and pulling many strings in the 
capital, Ashgabat never allowed it to open. The transmitter and 
equipment are still there, ready for operation, should the opportunity 
arise.
<p>
 In Mary, a local businessmen says he has received permission to install 
a private transmitter for rebroadcast of Moscow's Channel 1, which 
although it is already rebroadcast locally cannot be clearly seen 
because Iran installed a powerful transmitter on the same channel 
several years ago, and the Iranian signal interferes with the local one. 
However, since the Turkmenistani manat is not convertible, the 
businessman found his considerable financial resources to be useless 
when it came down to paying the $15,000 to a Russian factory for a 100- 
W VHF transmitter.
<p>
 Finally, in little villages around the country there are very low-power 
transmitters used to rebroadcast Russian-language programming from 
satellite. Most of these are not even registered by the SCRF. Most are 
not likely to produce any programming of their own.
<p>
Several organizations have at various times acquired time on State TV. 
The first was Orient- TVM, which had an hour per week, but found this 
arrangement unprofitable. Next in line was a privately-produced 
thrice-per-week English-language news program created by former 
TurkmenPress chief Murat Karanov, which has since been transferred to 
State TV because it too was unprofitable. Finally, Gairat, a shady local 
business conglomerate, acquired some time and continues to produce its 
own programming and tries to find advertising to support the costs, but 
it occupies its spot sporadically at best.
<p>
TACIS, the EU's aid organization, spent over $100,000 to create Nazar 
Media, a company in posession of an A/B-roll Betacam SP shooting and 
editing suite and two Mac 7100s for graphics and titling. The equipment 
was meant to be used for production of agriculture training videos, but 
when funding for the project ends (according to schedule, in October 
1996), the chances are that some government organization (probably the 
office of the President) will take control of the equipment and use it 
for PR.
<p>
There is a report that UNESCO has signed a memo of understanding with 
the Turkmenistan government to aid production of Russian-language 
entertainment programs with support from the French government for 
equipment and training, but we were unable to confirm the details.
<p>
<center><h2>INTERNET</h2></center>
There is a local e-mail service created by the Ashgabat Ecological Club, 
providing store-and- forward e-mail via periodic UUPC connections with 
Moscow to about fifty users; use is free for NGOs and for commercial 
users the cost is $20/mo plus $0.04/kb. A Relcom node was also recently 
created. Very few are aware of these servers and almost no one has even 
heard of a modem, let alone e-mail. The computer density in Turkemnistan 
is extremely low.
<p>
Because many areas of the country do not have long-distance direct dial, 
the AEC node can poll remote users at night.
<p>
<center><h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2></center>

The Turkmenistan media, such as it is, is so totally under the control 
of the government that there is little Westerners can do to support it. 
However, should any of the independent television groups mentioned above 
manage to acquire permission to go on the air, they should be encouraged 
as much as possible with standard types of support: donation of 
small-format TV equipment, training in journalism and management, 
provision of legal TV programs in Russian. It is our policy to work only 
with TV organizations which are already on the air. But we plan to keep 
in touch with those in the TV field who showed interest and optimism 
with respect to the private TV situation (we provided them with copies 
of our handbooks on private TV in Russian), and should the opportunity 
arise we will not hesitate to extend a helping hand.

Trip Report<br>

Internews<br>
August 1996<br>
<p>
TURKMENISTAN BACKGROUND
Turkmenistan is a large country in Central Asia, mostly desert and sparsely populated, with about four million inhabitants. It is divided into five administrative districts formerly known as oblasts and now called veloiats. The capital, Ashgabat, is the largest city, with a population of about 400,000; the four other main cities, the veloiat capitals of Chardzhou, Krasnovodsk (Turkmenbashi), Mary, and Tashouz, each have a population of under 150,000, and all other population centers are much smaller.
<p>
Turkmenistan is about seventy percent Turkmens, twenty percent Uzbeks along the northern border, and about ten percent other (mostly Russians). While Russians do not for the most part report that they are made to feel unwelcome, they do report an ethnic discrimination policy (as in most other NIS republics) whereby all the top leadership of any enterprise or government organ must be Turkmens, regardless of skill. Many Russians have left, especially those with a higher level of education.
<p>
Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan has made the least progress in moving toward a market-oriented economy, and its political system is the most repressive, offering little in the way of even token democracy. The president, Sapurmurad Niiazov, controls every aspect of the country, mostly through patronage; corruption is rampant and a high post can be lucrative. While the president has announced his intent to create a society where basic goods and services are free, the result so far has been a precipitous fall in living standards to the point where they are arguably the lowest in the NIS and still falling.
<p>
The national currency, the manat, was introduced in 1993 and valued at two to the dollar, but is now traded at about 4650 to the dollar and is still falling in value. Any economic activity quickly runs up against the difficulty of converting manats into a currency acceptable to a business partner abroad, whether in Moscow, Istanbul, Bagdad, or Dubai.
<p>
Water is also a key currency. Because of insufficient delivery infrasctructure, even cold water is in most places available only for an hour or two in the morning and the evening. The country's agricultural economy, such as it is, is based on cotton, which requires irrigation. As elsewhere in Central Asia, many years of a cotton monoculture enforced by Moscow has resulted in fields so salinated and water tables so high that much agricultural land is no longer usable.
<p>
Niiazov, who took control shortly after Turkmenistan's independence was declared upon the breakup of the USSR in 1991, has assumed the surrogate last name "Turkmenbashi", or "head of the Turkmens", and to a ludicrous extent has established his visage and name as the symbol of the country--on all money, on statutes everywhere,on many public buildings, in every office (public and private) in the country, as street names in every city and town, and indeed as the name of a number of cities and towns themselves.
<p>
The telephone system works about averagely poorly for the NIS. From most lines a telephone call beyond the borders of the city cannot be dialed directly, but many government orders placed with e.g. Siemens for modern intercity and in some cases city telephone switches are in various stages of installation. An exclusive 25-year contract for creation and operation of a national analog cell phone network has been provided to Barash Communications Technologies Inc., an American company created by a Russian emigre. In most cities the cell phones work but not perfectly; in one city they can't call locally, in another they can't call long-distance, etc. Their cost--$50/mo plus $0.50/min--prices them out of the reach of all but perhaps 1000 subscribers nationwide. One local puts it this way: our cities are so small that telephones aren't important enough to merit spending lots of money on a cell phone; if you can't get through, you just drive over with your question--it's only a couple minutes, and there's no hurry to do anything in Central Asia.
<p>
The Turkmen language is a member of the Turkic group, and shortly after independence the country began to move quickly toward using Latin instead of the Soviet-enforced Cyrillic alphabet. Most signs have already been changed, although all mass media is still in Cyrillic.
<p>
This report is the result of a one-week trip made in August 1996 by the author to the Turkmenistani capital and three of the veloiat capitals to investigate the commercial TV environment.

Part of the scandal around Sakhra was related to the fact that its employees and equipment were the same as those of State TV, so in effect the private channel was siphoning resources off of State TV. Sakhra's less-then-above-board operation created a suspicion toward any commercial TV ventures which lingers to this day among the country's leadership.
<p>
A strange exception to the unofficial ban on non-state TV is a small private station serving a village where the employees of Turkmenistan's largest power station live (the Mary GRES). A local businessman who has amassed a small fortune through an investment in a leather factory established Gonkhor, which broadcasts fifteen hours a day. Most of its air time is taken up by rebroadcasting from satellite either Russian TV (Channel 2) or one of the channels on Asiasat, which it receives on its three 2-m dishes, but it does produce perhaps ten minutes per day of its own programming on themes which can't offend the government: health, culture, music, computer and language lessons, etc. The station uses professional S-VHS equipment: one AG- 455 camera and a full editing suite based on the 7750 line of Panasonic equipment. Gonkhor broadcasts on a 100-w transmitter on channel eight, and it is hoping to expand the territory it covers by putting its antenna on one of the smokestacks at the power plant; the microwave relay for this is already installed. It is doubtful that it will be allowed to expand in order to reach an audience sufficiently large to be able to sell advertising and start moving toward financial viability.
<p>	Gonkhor survives because its owner promised the government he would encode his signal. Thus, only the 200 families in the village who pay the $2/mo for a decoder can see the station's broadcasts. Also, Gonkhor will sometimes sell its programs to State TV in Ashgabat.
<p>
Several almost-stations exist in Turkmenistan; however, until the official ban is lifted, they cannot be counted as non-governmental TV stations since they do not feel able to release onto the air any of their own production.
<p>	In the north in Tashouz, the local natural gas processing plant has refurbished a 5-kw transmitter, receives Moscow's Channel 2 by microwave from Nukus in Uzbekistan (where a dish pulls it down from satellite), and rebroadcasts it without modification. However, probably because the satellite dish lacks tracking equipment, the signal is clear in the morning but by mid- afternoon fades out completely.
<p>	In Chardzhou a private station was formed several years ago with the political and financial backing of local businessmen but in spite of support from the local government and pulling many strings in the capital, Ashgabat never allowed it to open. The transmitter and equipment are still there, ready for operation, should the opportunity arise.
<p>	In Mary, a local businessmen says he has received permission to install a private transmitter for rebroadcast of Moscow's Channel 1, which although it is already rebroadcast locally cannot be clearly seen because Iran installed a powerful transmitter on the same channel several years ago, and the Iranian signal interferes with the local one. However, since the Turkmenistani manat is not convertible, the businessman found his considerable financial resources to be useless when it came down to paying the $15,000 to a Russian factory for a 100- W VHF transmitter.
<p>	Finally, in little villages around the country there are very low-power transmitters used to rebroadcast Russian-language programming from satellite. Most of these are not even registered by the SCRF. Most are not likely to produce any programming of their own.
<p>
Several organizations have at various times acquired time on State TV. The first was Orient- TVM, which had an hour per week, but found this arrangement unprofitable. Next in line was a privately-produced thrice-per-week English-language news program created by former TurkmenPress chief Murat Karanov, which has since been transferred to State TV because it too was unprofitable. Finally, Gairat, a shady local business conglomerate, acquired some time and continues to produce its own programming and tries to find advertising to support the costs, but it occupies its spot sporadically at best.
<p>
TACIS, the EU's aid organization, spent over $100,000 to create Nazar Media, a company in posession of an A/B-roll Betacam SP shooting and editing suite and two Mac 7100s for graphics and titling. The equipment was meant to be used for production of agriculture training videos, but when funding for the project ends (according to schedule, in October 1996), the chances are that some government organization (probably the office of the President) will take control of the equipment and use it for PR.
<p>
There is a report that UNESCO has signed a memo of understanding with the Turkmenistan government to aid production of Russian-language entertainment programs with support from the French government for equipment and training, but we were unable to confirm the details.
<p>
<b>INTERNET</b><p>
There is a local e-mail service created by the Ashgabat Ecological Club, providing store-and- forward e-mail via periodic UUPC connections with Moscow to about fifty users; use is free for NGOs and for commercial users the cost is $20/mo plus $0.04/kb. A Relcom node was also recently created. Very few are aware of these servers and almost no one has even heard of a modem, let alone e-mail. The computer density in Turkemnistan is extremely low.
<p>
Because many areas of the country do not have long-distance direct dial, the AEC node can poll remote users at night.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>

The Turkmenistan media, such as it is, is so totally under the control of the government that there is little Westerners can do to support it. However, should any of the independent television groups mentioned above manage to acquire permission to go on the air, they should be encouraged as much as possible with standard types of support: donation of small-format TV equipment, training in journalism and management, provision of legal TV programs in Russian. It is our policy to work only with TV organizations which are already on the air. But we plan to keep in touch with those in the TV field who showed interest and optimism with respect to the private TV situation (we provided them with copies of our handbooks on private TV in Russian), and should the opportunity arise we will not hesitate to extend a helping hand.

The Ashgabat Ecology Club is the sole non-profit provider of Internet connectivity in Turkmenistan.  At 
present, the club serves 150 clients, of whom 40 are commercial.  The club provides services to 
commercial clients at one-half the rate charged by the only other server in Turkmenistan, and its 
commercial revenues allow it to provide services free of charge to individual and non-profit users.
<p> 
The club has 3 Pentium computers which provide full cross-platform access to dial-up customers from all 
over Turkmenistan.  It also houses a publicly accessible database geared towards general use.  Because it 
has no constant connection to the Web, it receives email from Glasnet in Moscow every three hours.

     DASHNAK LEADERS MEET WITH ARMENIAN JUSTICE MINISTER. During a meeting <br>
     with leaders of the banned Dashnak party (HHD), Armenian Justice <br>
     Minister Marat Aleksanyan said that documents submitted by the HHD are <br>
     "not sufficient" for the party to be legalized, Noyan Tapan reported <br>
     on 8 January. Ruben Hakobyan, a HHD leader, complained that the <br>
     authorities have not specified the steps that his party should take in <br>
     order to resume its activities. The meeting comes amid speculation <br>
     that the party might soon be legalized following a 10 December court <br>
     verdict that found no connection between the HHD and the alleged <br>
     terrorist group Dro. The HHD's activities in Armenia were suspended in <br>
     January 1995 by the Supreme Court on the grounds that it violated <br>
     Armenian law on political parties by having foreign members. In a bid <br>
     to overcome the legal deadlock, the HHD in November 1995 made <br>
     significant changes in its structure, granting its Armenia <br>
     organization a substantial degree of autonomy. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

               RED CROSS SAYS POWs SEIZED IN KARABAKH STILL TO BE FREED<br>
     <br>
                    YEREVAN, Jan 5 (Interfax) - Many of the POWs and hostages<br>
               seized during  the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh have not<br>
               been  freed  yet  and  are  currently  kept  in  Karabakh  and<br>
               Azerbaijan, Zoran  Jovanovic, the  leader of the International<br>
               Red Cross delegation in Armenia, told Interfax Sunday.<br>
                    He said, however, that the sides had promised to free all<br>
               prisoners. In  1996, he  said, the  Armenian  and  Azerbaijani<br>
               sides freed a total of about 110 POWs.<br>
                    The International Committee of Red Cross Organizations in<br>
               1996 spent  $4.2 million  on  the  implementation  of  various<br>
               humanitarian programs  for Armenia,  he continued.  Next year,<br>
               the International  Red Cross  is to  increase the  sum to $5.5<br>
               million. He  said that  the  International  Red  Cross  should<br>
               continue its humanitarian activity in Nagorno Karabakh until a<br>
               political solution has been found.<br>
                    Ten foreign  and 70  local Red Cross staff currently work<br>
               in Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. The Red Cross personnel is to<br>
               be increased  next year.  Proper conditions  have been created<br>
               for the  Red Cross staff and nothing threatens them in Armenia<br>
               and Nagorno Karabakh, said Jovanovic.<br>

     FRANCE BECOMES CO-CHAIR OF KARABAKH NEGOTIATIONS. The OSCE has named <br>
     France as the new co-chair of the deadlocked negotiations on the <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, RFE/RL reported on 7 January. France, <br>
     beating out an active U.S. bid, succeeds Finland, which held the <br>
     office for 20 months. The other co-chair is Russia, whose post is <br>
     permanent. The chief French negotiator will be Jacques Blot. -- Lowell <br>

     MANUKYAN ON 1996, NEED FOR NATIONAL FRONT. The leader of Armenia's <br>
     opposition National Democratic Union, Vazgen Manukyan, said the <br>
     "Armenian state" failed a crucial test last year, pointing to what he <br>
     termed the undemocratic presidential elections which took place last <br>
     September. According to a 30 December Interfax report monitored by the <br>
     BBC, Manukyan harshly criticized the governemnt's social and economic <br>
     policy while applauding the high political activity of the Armenian <br>
     population. He said he is willing to maintain a dialogue with the <br>
     authorities only to discuss new presidential elections and a new <br>
     constitution; he also called for the establishment of a "national <br>
     front" of "political parties and various public forces" to effect <br>
     change.<br>

     HIGH-RANKING IRANIAN DELEGATION IN ARMENIA. An Iranian delegation <br>
     headed by First Vice-President Hasan Habibi concluded a four-day visit <br>
     to Armenia on 28 December, Noyan Tapan reported. The two sides pledged <br>
     to boost bilateral cooperation in  communications, energy and <br>
     industry. Habibi, the highest-ranking Iranian official to visit <br>
     Armenia since 1991, said the current state of Armenian-Iranian <br>
     relationships is "at the desired level," ITAR-TASS reported. Armenian <br>
     President Levon Ter- Petrossyan described Iran's policy in the <br>
     Transcaucasus as "balanced" and a "stability factor" in the region. <br>
     According to Prime-Minister Armen Sarkisyan, the two countries have <br>
     "great" potential for further cooperation. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN PRESIDENT ON 1997. Speaking on national TV, Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan said that in 1997 Armenia will have to end the <br>
     trade-route blockade and deal with international pressure due to the <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, ITAR-TASS reported on 1 January. The <br>
     president said the two challenges can be successfully overcome if <br>
     people maintain solidarity and the country remains stable. He also <br>
     said that the new year will be marked by an economic revival, an <br>
     improvement in living standards, and a stronger rule of law. -- Emil <br>

     ARMENIAN PRIME MINISTER ON RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. Armen Sarkisyan said <br>
     he agreed with Russian officials in Moscow on 28 December on the <br>
     construction of a pipeline to run from Russia to Turkey via Armenia, <br>
     ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL reported on 30 December. Sarkisyan described the <br>
     move as "politically important." He added that Russian Prime Minister <br>
     Viktor Chernomyrdin described the current state of Armenian-Russian <br>
     ties as "unsatisfactory for the strategic partners in the region." The <br>
     two leaders agreed to restore the railway connection (which has been <br>
     broken off since 1992 as a result of the Azerbaijani blockade and the <br>
     war in Abkhazia) between Armenia and Russia. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     LATEST ISSUE OF OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER CONFISCATED IN ARMENIA. The 18 <br>
     December issue of Ayzhm, the newspaper of the opposition National <br>
     Democratic Union, has been confiscated by the Haymamul state-run <br>
     distributing agency, Groong reported on 18 December citing Asbarez-on- <br>
     line. Ayzhm's latest issue contained an article critical of Haymamul's <br>
     activities. The agency, which has a monopoly over newspaper <br>
     distribution, has been repeatedly slammed by Armenian journalists for <br>
     its allegedly inefficient work, including delays in paying periodicals <br>
     for copies sold. Some journalists claim that the agency is used by the<br>
     authorities as an instrument of control over the media. -- Emil <br>

     SAFETY OF ARMENIAN NUCLEAR PLANT KEY TOPIC IN TALKS WITH EBRD<br>
     <br>
                    YEREVAN, Dec  19 (Interfax)  - The safety of the <br>
     Armenian nuclear power  station has  been a  key subject  of the  <br>
     talks between Yerevan  and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and<br>
     Development (EBRD)  during the  past two years, Armenian Prime<br>
     Minister Armen  Sarkisian told  a Thursday  news conference in<br>
     Yerevan.<br>
        Under a 1993 agreement on a $57 million EBRD loan for the<br>
     construction of  the fifth section of the Razdan thermal power<br>
     station, the  nuclear plant should not have resumed operation.<br>
     Now Armenia has a chance "to overcome the clause by diplomatic<br>
     means," Sarkisian said.<br>
        The second  unit of  the nuclear  station resumed work in<br>
     1995 and  now the  international community  has  focussed  its<br>
     attention on  the safety  of the  facility.  "The  station  is<br>
     vitally important  for the  republic and we will do our utmost<br>
     to resolve the problem," the prime minister said.<br>
        He thinks  the task  is achievable  because "the  West is<br>
     ready to offer experts and funds for this purpose."<br>
     He said  that on  recommendations from the EBRD a council<br>
     for nuclear  energy including  foreign experts was formed this<br>
     year under the Armenian president.<br>
        Sarkisian said  the  EBRD  suspended  financing  for  the<br>
     expansion of the Razdan thermal station last year. A total $30<br>
     million out of the planned $57 million was disbursed.<br>
        He  said   a  mistake  in  evaluating  the  cost  of  the<br>
     construction was  among the  reasons for  the freezing  of the<br>
     project. Initially  it was planned to spend $80 million on the<br>
     project, $25  million of  which  should  have  come  from  the<br>
        Armenian government,  but in  the process  of construction  it<br>
     turned out  that the  funds were  insufficient,  the  official<br>
     said.<br>
        A total  $80 million more has to be found now to complete<br>
     the station,  the prime minister said. The Armenian government<br>
     intends to invite international financial institutions as well<br>
     as private investors to join the project.<br>
     During his  recent visit  to London,  Sarkisian suggested<br>
     repaying Armenia's  debt by  offering the  EBRD a stake in the<br>
     Razdan power plant.<br>

     <br>
     TRIALS ON POST-ELECTION UNREST IN YEREVAN TO START IN JANUARY. An <br>
     Armenian opposition representative, Vladimir Hakhverdyan, said that <br>
     the investigation into the 25 September protests in Yerevan is <br>
     complete and that trials will begin in January, Groong reported on 18 <br>
     December citing Asbarez-on-line. The protests were triggered by <br>
     reports of alleged vote- rigging in the 22 September presidential <br>
     election. A number of supporters of the defeated opposition candidate <br>
     Vazgen Manukyan burst into the parliament building and took the <br>
     National Assembly speaker and his deputy hostage. According to <br>
     Hakhverdyan, a group of opposition activists arrested in connection <br>
     with the unrest, have been charged with inciting mass disorder and <br>
     illegally possessing arms. * Emil Danielyan<br>

     FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In <br>
     its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based <br>
     Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 <br>
     most repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. <br>
     Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category, <br>
     improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, <br>
     Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are rated "partly free;" and <br>
     Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, <br>
     and Uzbekistan are listed as "not free." Freedom House ratings are <br>
     based on a check- list of political rights and civil liberties, <br>
     including the degree of autonomy for minorities, the status of the <br>
     opposition, the nature of electoral laws, and the degree of freedom of <br>
     assembly and freedom of the media. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

               NAGORNO-KARABAKH MAY OPT OUT OF PEACE TALKS WITH AZERBAIJAN<br>
     <br>
                    STEPANAKERT, Dec  12 (Interfax)  - The  parliament of the<br>
               self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic has  questioned the<br>
               wisdom of participating in the Minsk peace process.<br>
                    It expressed  its regret Thursday over the failure of the<br>
               Organization for  Security and  Cooperation in Europe's summit<br>
               in Lisbon to denounce the Azerbaijani delegation's position on<br>
               the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict.<br>
                    The remarks  made by  the OSCE  chairman-in-office on the<br>
               principles underlying  the resolution  of the Karabakh problem<br>
               is "an  attempt at dictating the status of Nagorno-Karabakh in<br>
               total disregard  of the  people's right  to self-determination<br>
               and other OSCE principles," a parliament statement says.<br>
                    Every nation  has a  right to  freedom and  security,  it<br>
               says. "Our  people have  paid too  large a price for that, and<br>
               will never  agree to  become a  chit in  a big  oil game," the<br>
               statement says.<br>
                    The Karabakh  parliament called  on Baku  "to abandon the<br>
               policy of  annexation" and  start  bilateral  talks.  "We  are<br>
               convinced that this is the shortest and most constructive road<br>
               to accord  and peace between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan,"<br>
               the document says.<br>
                    The Karabakh  parliament described  the statement made by<br>
               the  OSCE   chairman-in-office  as  a  biased  position  which<br>
               reflects only  Azerbaijani interests  and is inconsistent with<br>
               the essence of international cooperation.<br>

     ARMENIAN CHURCH HEAD MEETS WITH POPE. Pope John Paul II said he hopes <br>
     the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Roman Catholic Church will <br>
     eventually reunite, after meeting with Supreme Patriarch and <br>
     Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin I in the Vatican on 11 December, <br>
     Reuters reported. The independent Armenian church split from the <br>
     Vatican in the 5th century. Garegin said he is praying for the <br>
     pontiff's health for "the good of all humanity." -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     TURKEY ABANDONS PLANS TO OPEN BORDER WITH ARMENIA. The Turkish Foreign <br>
     Ministry on 11 December announced that Turkey will not open its border <br>
     with Armenia unless the latter "takes steps" toward respecting <br>
     Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh and provides for a <br>
     withdrawal of Armenian forces from the "occupied Azerbaijani <br>
     territories," international agencies reported. The ministry statement <br>
     contradictsa an earlier announcement by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller <br>
     that the border will be opened soon (see OMRI Daily Digest, 24 October <br>
     1996). The ministry might be reacting to Armenia's refusal to sign a <br>
     document that mentioned Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan at the <br>
     OSCE's recent summit in Lisbon. Turkey closed its border with Armenia <br>
     in early 1992 after accusing it of "military aggression" against <br>
     Azerbaijan. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     THREE DASHNAK PARTY MEMBERS SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ARMENIA. Armenia's <br>
     Supreme Court on 10 December sentenced to death three members of the <br>
     banned Dashnak party (HHD) on charges of terrorism after a trial that <br>
     lasted more than 16 months, international agencies reported. Arsen <br>
     Ardzrouni (a Lebanese citizen of Armenian origin), Armen Grigoryan, <br>
     and Armenak Mnjoyan have been convicted of forming a clandestine armed <br>
     group called Dro and committing three murders. Eight other members of <br>
     the alleged group were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to <br>
     15 years. The lawyers of the defendants can appeal the verdict within <br>
     a week. President Levon Ter-Petrossyan suspended the activities of the <br>
     HHD in December 1994 on the grounds that Dro was affiliated with the <br>
     party and planned to overthrow the government. But according to <br>
     RFE/RL, the three-member panel of judges ruled that there is not <br>
     enough evidence to prove a connection between HHD and Dro. -- Emil <br>

     RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS FOR COMPROMISE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH. <br>
     Yevgenii Primakov said after a meeting in Moscow with his Armenian <br>
     counterpart, Aleksandr Arzumanyan, that Russia is interested in a <br>
     peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 9 December. He added that a compromise solution should <br>
     recognize "Nagorno-Karabakh's right to self-determination and <br>
     self-government while preserving Azerbaijan's territorial integrity." <br>
     Addressing the 24 November presidential election in the disputed <br>
     enclave, Primakov reiterated the official Russian position that such <br>
     votes should not be held until "a mechanism for settling the conflict <br>
     is worked out," while Arzumanyan said the election did not hamper the <br>
     peace process. The two ministers pledged to "develop fraternal and <br>
     friendly relations," ITAR- TASS reported. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     RUSSIAN BORDER TROOP COMMANDER IN ARMENIA. Gen. Andrei Nikolaev <br>
     completed a one-day visit to Armenia after holding a long private <br>
     meeting with President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL <br>
     reported on 8 December. Nikolaev said that the Armenian leadership <br>
     supports the presence of Russian troops on its borders with Turkey and <br>
     Iran, and that he is satisfied with the results of the visit. <br>
     According to Nikolaev, Ter-Petrossyan called for "additional measures" <br>
     to strengthen the CIS's external borders. Nikolaev ruled out the <br>
     possibility of a withdrawal of the Russian border troops from Georgia, <br>
     arguing that all the problems with the latter "have been settled" <br>
     during his recent visit to that country, Noyan Tapan reported on 6 <br>
     December. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     <br>
     ENERGY TARIFFS TO RISE IN ARMENIA. Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan on 4 <br>
     December said the government will raise energy tariffs by 40% starting <br>
     in January, Noyan Tapan reported the same day. Sarkisyan said the <br>
     decision was taken in accordance with the 4 March agreement with the <br>
     World Bank which made its loans to Armenia contingent on bringing <br>
     energy prices closer to world ones. Armenia has undergone severe <br>
     energy shortages and winter rationing since the war in <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh broke out in 1992. The crisis has been substantially <br>
     alleviated by the reopening of the Medzamor nuclear plant in summer <br>
     1995. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     LAST-MINUTE OSCE COMPROMISE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH. A last-minute <br>
     compromise wording proposed by the U.S. prevented Armenia and <br>
     Azerbaijan from vetoing the final communique by the OSCE summit in <br>
     Lisbon, international media reported on 3 December. Armenia had <br>
     objected to an article of the draft communique which upheld <br>
     Azerbaijan's territorial integrity as a guiding principle for settling <br>
     the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The provision was included following <br>
     vigorous efforts by Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliev, who said he <br>
     would block the entire document unless it formally recognized <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. Austrian Chancellor Franz <br>
     Vranitzky told RFE/RL that Flavio Cotti, the Swiss chairman of the <br>
     OSCE, might condemn Azerbaijan's tactic. Yet, according to CNN, <br>
     Aliev's position was strongly backed by the European Union. As a <br>
     result of the compromise, the contentious language was removed from <br>
     the final communique and adopted as a separate document. -- Emil <br>
     Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN, AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENTS CLASH AT OSCE SUMMIT. Azerbaijani <br>
     President Heydar Aliev, speaking at the OSCE summit in Lisbon on 2 <br>
     December, accused Armenia of refusing to recognize his country's <br>
     territorial integrity and of pursuing "non-legitimate claims for the <br>
     independence of Nagorno-Karabakh," Reuters reported. Aliev said a high <br>
     degree of autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan, along with <br>
     security guarantees for the region's population, should be the key <br>
     principles for settling the conflict. Aliev added that "we cannot <br>
     allow the creation on the territory of Azerbaijan of a second Armenian <br>
     state." Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan said the people of <br>
     Nagorno- Karabakh should be given the right to self-determination <br>
     because Azerbaijan is "unable" to guarantee their safety. <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan warned that the region's population would face <br>
     "genocide or forced deportation" if Azerbaijan's proposals were <br>
     accepted. Observers note that Azerbaijan may block a final declaration <br>
     by the OSCE on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict if it fails to affirm the <br>
     region's territorial integrity. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT GETS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. The Armenian parliament <br>
     on 29 November approved the government program of recently appointed <br>
     Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan, ITAR-TASS reported the same day. <br>
     Speaking at a session of parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated <br>
     by deputies loyal to President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, Sarkisyan said a <br>
     "qualitative improvement" of economic reforms will be his government's <br>
     top priority. He also pledged more state support for education, <br>
     science, and culture. -- Emil Danielyan. The Armenian parliament on 29 <br>

     MORE REACTIONS TO NAGORNO-KARABAKH ELECTION. The Azerbaijani Foreign <br>
     Ministry on 26 November issued a statement reiterating its <br>
     condemnation of the 24 November presidential election in the <br>
     self-proclaimed Nagorno- Karabakh Republic, ITAR-TASS reported. The <br>
     statement said the election was an attempt "to annex a part of <br>
     Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian troops," and blamed Armenia <br>
     for initiating the "illegal act." Meanwhile, reelected <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh President Robert Kocharyan assessed his landslide <br>
     victory (more than 85% of the vote) as support for his <br>
     administration's policies, Noyan Tapan reported on 26 November. -- <br>

     National Democratic Union (AZhM) was reopened on 25 November. It was <br>
     sealed on 25 September by police following violent protests by <br>
     opposition supporters against the official results of the presidential <br>

     NAGORNO-KARABAKH TALKS DEADLOCKED. Yet another round of negotiations <br>
     to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which began on 18 November in <br>
     Finland, have failed to make any progress, RFE/RL reported on 25 <br>
     November. The parties could not agree on a declaration of principles <br>
     for ending the conflict that was intended to be signed at the OSCE's <br>
     upcoming summit in Lisbon. Observers note that, as a result, the <br>
     summit will probably adopt a nonbinding statement urging all sides to <br>
     reach a peaceful resolution. Diplomats who attended the talks said <br>
     there was a "slight movement" in Azerbaijan's position, whereas the <br>
     positions of Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh representatives remained <br>
     unchanged. Armenia's chief presidential aide Gerard Libaridian said <br>
     his country will veto any document at the Lisbon summit that runs <br>
     counter to its interests, according to RFE/RL. In other news, <br>
     commenting on the 24 November presidential election in <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh, chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Court Hanlar Hajiev <br>
     said it was the "result of the thoughtless policy of Russia," Turan <br>
     reported on 25 November. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN OPPOSITION DEMANDS FRESH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. The leader of <br>
     the opposition National Democratic Union, defeated presidential <br>
     candidate Vazgen Manukyan, has demanded a fresh election following the <br>
     decision by the Constitutional Court to reject the opposition's appeal <br>
     of the results of the 22 September presidential polls (see OMRI Daily <br>
     Digest, 22 November 1996), Noyan Tapan reported on 22 November. <br>
     Manukyan called on the international community to exert pressure on <br>
     the Armenian government to make the latter respect democratic <br>
     principles. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     KOCHARYAN REELECTED PRESIDENT OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH. The presidential <br>
     election in Nagorno-Karabakh took place on 24 November despite its <br>
     condemnation by Azerbaijan, Russia, and major Western countries, <br>
     Western agencies reported. According to the Central Electoral <br>
     Commission in Stepanakert, 76% of the region's 89,000 voters turned <br>
     out. Robert Kocharyan, the incumbent president of the self-proclaimed <br>
     Nagorno- Karabakh Republic, who was opposed by two other candidates, <br>
     won a decisive victory, Radio France Internationale reported on 25 <br>
     November. Meanwhile, mass rallies were held in Azerbaijan to protest <br>
     the election, ITAR-TASS reported on 24 November. Turan quoted <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliev as saying that his country will <br>
     never recognize the vote. Aliev said that besides Armenia some <br>
     unspecified countries also "support separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh." <br>

       ROBERT KOCHARIAN REPORTEDLY ELECTED KARABAKH PRESIDENT<br>
     <br>
                    STEPANAKERT, Nov 25 (Interfax) - According to <br>
     preliminary reports, current  president of  the  self-proclaimed  <br>
     Nagorno-<br>
               Karabakh Republic  Robert Kocharian  was re-elected  <br>
     president<br>
               November 24.<br>
                    Kocharian won  86.11% of  the votes,  the  local  <br>
     central<br>
               electoral commission  told Interfax.  Next came  Deputy of <br>
     the<br>
               Karabakh parliament Boris Arushunian (6.9%) and in third <br>
     place<br>
               leader of the local Communist Party Grant Melkumian (3.7%).<br>
                    The same  source said  that turnout  stood at  78% <br>
     (about<br>
     <br>
               90,000 voters).  International observers,  including <br>
     observers<br>
               from  Russia,  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Switzerland,  Germany  <br>
     and<br>
               Slovenia, did  not reveal  any serious  violations  of  <br>
     voting<br>
               procedure, said the Central Electoral Commission.<br>
                    Kocharian was  born in  Stepanakert in 1954. He <br>
     graduated<br>
               from the  Yerevan Polytechnic  Institute in Armenia. From <br>
     1980<br>
               onwards he  held various  posts in the Communist Party and <br>
     the<br>
               Young Communist League in the then Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
     Autonomous<br>
               Region of  Azerbaijan. In  1994 he became the head of <br>
     Nagorno-<br>
               Karabakh's State  Defense Committee.  On December 22, 1994, <br>
     he<br>
               was elected president of Karabakh by the Karabakh <br>
     parliament.<br>

     ARMENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT REJECTS OPPOSITION APPEAL. The Consti- <br>
     tutional Court on 22 November rejected the opposition's appeal to <br>
     annul the results of the 22 September controversial presidential <br>
     election, Reuters reported, citing ITAR-TASS. Observers note that the <br>
     decision, which is not subject to appeal, may trigger a new wave of <br>
     mass protests by opposition supporters. Also, commenting on the <br>
     resolution of the European Parliament condemning the ballot (see OMRI <br>
     Daily Digest, 21 November 1996), acting presidential spokesman Levon <br>
     Zurabyan said "it was based on inaccurate and unverified data," <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported on 21 November. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CONDEMNS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN ARMENIA. The <br>
     European Parliament has passed a resolution challenging the legitimacy <br>
     of the 22 September Armenian presidential election and calling for a <br>
     new round of elections to be held in those electoral districts where <br>
     serious violations took place, Noyan Tapan reported on 20 November. <br>
     The resolution condemned the crackdown on the opposition and the media <br>
     and called on the Armenian government to adhere to democratic <br>
     principles. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HEARINGS INTERRUPTED. The Armenian <br>
     Constitutional Court on 19 November interrupted its hearings on the <br>
     opposition's appeal of the recent presidential polls after the proxies <br>
     of defeated candidate Vazgen Manukyan staged a walk-out, RFE/RL <br>
     reported. Shavarsh Kocharyan, Manukyan's representative to the court, <br>
     said the proxies were protesting the court's refusal to demand access <br>
     to all of the precinct-level voting protocols from the Central <br>
     Electoral Commission and to listen to complaints of alleged voting <br>
     irregularities from opposition witnesses. Kocharyan said the <br>
     opposition will not attend the hearings unless its demands are <br>
     satisfied. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     NAGORNO-KARABAKH NEGOTIATION UPDATE. Acting Armenian presidential <br>
     spokesman Levon Zurabyan said that Azerbaijan has refused to <br>
     participate further in drafting a joint declaration of principles on a <br>
     settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, RFE/RL reported on 19 <br>
     November. The declaration was due to be presented at the OSCE's <br>
     December summit in Lisbon. Zurabyan said Armenia will not sign any <br>
     documents at the summit unless all sides agree on them in advance. <br>
     Meanwhile, another round of Nagorno-Karabakh peace talks sponsored by <br>
     the OSCE Minsk group began in Helsinki on 18 November, Noyan Tapan and <br>
     Turan reported. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     OPPOSITION RALLY IN YEREVAN. Speaking at their traditional weekly <br>
     rally on 15 November, Armenian opposition leaders said they do not <br>
     trust the Constitutional Court because it is "not independent," Noyan <br>
     Tapan reported on 18 November. The Constitutional Court is to rule on <br>
     the opposition's appeal of the recent presidential election results. <br>
     Representatives of student organizations at the rally demanded the <br>
     release of Mikael Surenyants and Vahe Varsamyan, two activists <br>
     arrested during the violent 25 September protests against the election <br>
     results. Meanwhile, some 300 protesters gathered in front of the <br>
     Constitutional Court building in Yerevan on 18 November to demand a <br>
     live TV broadcast of the court's hearings on the appeal. -- Emil <br>
     Danielyan<br>

     U.S., RUSSIAN DELEGATIONS IN ARMENIA. James Collins, special advisor <br>
     to the U.S. secretary of state on the newly independent states, <br>
     arrived on 14 November in Yerevan from Baku where he held talks with <br>
     the Azerbaijani leadership (see OMRI Daily Digest, 14 November 1996), <br>
     Armenian and Russian media reported. Collins and Armenian Foreign <br>
     Minister Aleksandr Arzumanyan agreed that the Caucasus region needs a <br>
     security system to settle conflicts. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy <br>
     Security Council Secretary Boris Berezovskii, who is also visiting the <br>
     Transcaucasus, met the same day with President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, <br>
     AFP reported. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     CONFLICTING REPORTS ON LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ARMENIA. Armenia's 10 <br>
     November local elections, which were boycotted by the opposition, were <br>
     marred by serious irregularities, according to Noyan Tapan. A group of <br>
     candidates has lodged complaints of electoral law violations at some <br>
     polling stations with Interior and National Security Minister Serzh <br>
     Sarkisyan. Voter turnout in one of the Yerevan districts was as low as <br>
     27%. Meanwhile, a Council of Europe observer group released a <br>
     statement describing the ballot as free and fair, adding that the <br>
     irregularities did not affect the results. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     NAGORNO-KARABAKH ELECTION UPDATE. The leader of the self-proclaimed <br>
     Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Robert Kocharyan, called on residents of <br>
     the region to take part in the 24 November presidential election, <br>
     Noyan Tapan reported on 12 November. During one of his campaign <br>
     speeches, Kocharyan said the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as an <br>
     equal side to the conflict by the OSCE and creation of a strong army <br>
     are among the biggest achievements of his government. According to <br>
     Kocharyan, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and <br>
     tax privileges for agriculture will remedy Karabakh's economic <br>
     hardships. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 CENTRAL  ASIAN  BATTALION  MAY  BACK  PEACEKEEPING  EFFORT  IN KARABAKH<br>
 <br>
 BAKU, Nov  12 (Interfax)  - Kyrgyz  Foreign Minister Roza<br>
 Otunbayeva  does   not  rule   out  the   possibility  of  the participation of <br>
 a Central Asian battalion in the peacekeeping operation in Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
 The Central  Asian states' forces might be represented in<br>
 the international peacekeeping contingent that is likely to be deployed in  the <br>
 conflict  zone after  Azerbaijan and  Armenia sign a peace agreement, she told <br>
 Interfax in Baku today.<br>
 If the parties concerned make this request, this question<br>
 may be  discussed by  the Interstate  Council of  the  Central Asian Union, <br>
 comprising Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.<br>
 The Central  Asian battalion  has this year taken part in<br>
 military exercises within NATO's Partnership for Peace program in Virginia, the <br>
 United States, she said.<br>
 Similar military  exercises, observed by foreign military<br>
 experts, including  NATO  representatives,  will  be  held  in Central Asia <br>
 next year, she said.<br>

     TER-PETROSSYAN INAUGURATED AMID CONTROVERSY. Armenian President Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan was inaugurated for a second five-year term on 11 <br>
     November, Armenian and Western media reported. The OSCE questioned the <br>
     vote results of the disputed 22 September presidential election, while <br>
     the opposition National Accord bloc (AHD) still claims it was robbed <br>
     of the victory. The ceremony, which was boycotted by the AHD deputies, <br>
     took place two days before the Constitutional Court is to start <br>
     hearings on the opposition's appeal to annul the election results. The <br>
     defeated AHD candidate, Vazgen Manukyan, described Ter-Petrossyan's <br>
     decision to take the oath before the court's ruling as a "violation of <br>
     ethical principles." According to Reuters, "Ter-Petrossyan looked <br>
     grave and seemed to have lost weight." Meanwhile, there were no <br>
     results yet from the 10 November local elections. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ENDS HUNGER STRIKE. Vahan Hovannesyan, a <br>
     leader of the banned Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaktsutyun <br>
     party (HHD), ended the hunger strike that he began on 29 October to <br>
     protest the continuous delays in his trial, AFP reported on 8 <br>
     November. Several of Hovannesyan's supporters joined the hunger strike <br>
     in solidarity with him in Yerevan's Freedom Square. Hovannesyan and 31 <br>
     other members and supporters of the HHD were arrested in July 1995 on <br>
     charges of plotting a coup Hovannesyan and the HHD have repeatedly <br>
     accused the Armenian authorities of staging a political trial in order <br>
     to outlaw one of the strongest opposition parties. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     candidates to become ministers in the government of newly appointed <br>
     Prime Minister Armen Sarkisyan. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER TO CONTINUE ECONOMIC REFORMS. Armen <br>
     Sarkisyan said he will continue the economic reforms of his <br>
     predecessor, Hrant Bagratyan, with a "new impetus" and uphold the <br>
     country's independence, international media reported on 6 November. <br>
     According to Sarkisyan, Armenia should enter the 21st century with a <br>
     competitive and modern economy so that certain unspecified "regional <br>
     economic and political forces cannot swallow our state." Bagratyan's <br>
     replacement is seen as an attempt by President Levon Ter-Petrossyan to <br>
     soothe Armenia's tense internal political situation. Meanwhile, <br>
     Interior Minister Vano Siradeghyan told RFE/RL on 6 November that he <br>
     and Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan are ready to step down. <br>
     Siradeghyan said he is ready to take over as mayor of Yerevan and <br>
     suggested that Alexander Arzumanyan, Armenia's permanent <br>
     representative to the UN, could succeed Papazyan. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN OPPOSITION CRITICIZES CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. Shavarsh <br>
     Kocharyan, the Constitutional Court representative of defeated <br>
     presidential candidate Vazgen Manukyan, said the court "violates the <br>
     principles of equality and transparency" in validating the 22 <br>
     September election results, Noyan Tapan reported on 5 November. The <br>
     opposition appealed to the court on 24 October, asking it to annul the <br>
     vote. Kocharyan claimed that numerous documented cases of <br>
     irregularities are not being addressed. According to him, Manukyan <br>
     asked the court to return property and documents from his campaign <br>
     headquarters seized by the Interior Ministry, but this was refused on <br>
     the grounds that the court "is not empowered to solve this problem." <br>
     Kocharyan said the Ministry's actions amount to a virtual suspension <br>
     of the party, which, according to Armenian law, only the <br>
     Constitutional Court has the right to decide. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     MORE KARABAKH DIPLOMACY. The chairman of the OSCE Parliamentary <br>
     Assembly, Xavier Ruperes, held talks in Baku on 5 November with <br>
     Azerbaijan's President Heidar Aliev, Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov, <br>
     and representatives of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front and <br>
     Party of National Independence of Azerbaijan, Turan and ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported. Ruperes advocated direct bilateral talks between Armenia and <br>
     Azerbaijan to expedite a political solution to the Karabakh conflict. <br>
     On 4 November, Aliev's special advisor, Vafa Gulu-Zade, left Baku to <br>
     meet at an undisclosed European location with his Armenian <br>
     counterpart, Zhirair Liparitian. They were to discuss the progress <br>
     achieved on the Declaration of Principles that is due to be signed by <br>
     the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the OSCE heads of state <br>
     summit in Lisbon in early December. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ARMENIAN PRIME MINISTER RESIGNS. Hrant Bagratyan announced his <br>
     resignation on 4 November, Western media reported the same day. He was <br>
     replaced by Armen Sarkisyan, Armenia's Ambassador to Britain. <br>
     Bagratyan declined to give any reason for his decision. The move <br>
     follows recent statements by several leaders of the ruling Armenian <br>
     Pan-National Movement blaming Bagratyan for the poorer than expected <br>
     showing of President Levon Ter-Petrossyan in the controversial 22 <br>
     September elections. During his first post-election speech, <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan promised a "serious reshuffle" in the government. A <br>
     staunch supporter of market reforms and tough monetary policy, 38-year <br>
     old Bagratyan headed the government since February 1993 and is <br>
     credited by the West for Armenia's good macroeconomic indicators. <br>
     Speaking at his last news conference, he called for a dialogue between <br>
     the authorities and the opposition. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     FINNISH FOREIGN MINISTER IN TRANSCAUCASUS. Tarja Halonen on 3 November <br>
     concluded visits to Armenia and Azerbaijan in connection with the end <br>
     of Finland's almost two-year co-chairmanship of the OSCE-sponsored <br>
     negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, ITAR-TASS reported. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev told Halonen that his country is <br>
     ready to grant Nagorno-Karabakh "the highest autonomy status," citing <br>
     the examples of the Aland Islands in Finland and "some republics of <br>
     Russia." Aliev reiterated that Azerbaijan's territorial integrity must <br>
     be preserved and criticized the OSCE's Minsk group for its <br>
     insufficient emphasis on the principle of inviolability of borders. <br>
     The next round of Karabakh talks will begin on 18 November in <br>
     Helsinki. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     OPPOSITION LEADER ON THE SITUATION IN ARMENIA. Former presidential <br>
     national security adviser and leader of the opposition Scientific- <br>
     Industrial and Civic Union Ashot Manucharyan claimed that Armenia may <br>
     face a threat of "military aggression" from the Nakhichevan sector of <br>
     the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, Noyan Tapan reported on 1 November. <br>
     Speaking about the country's political situation, Manucharyan said the <br>
     authorities and opposition should start a "strictly confidential" <br>
     dialogue to overcome the current stand-off. He suggested that the <br>
     establishment of a consultative council and fresh elections might be <br>
     among possible compromises. According to Manucharyan, the U.S. can use <br>
     its "great influence" with the Armenian government to make the latter <br>
     respect human rights and democratic principles. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     AZERBAIJANI-TURKISH MILITARY COOPERATION. A delegation from the <br>
     Turkish armed forces general staff, headed by Deputy Chief of Staff <br>
     Gen. Cetin Dogan, met in Baku on 31 October with Azerbaijan's defense <br>
     minister Safar Abiev, Turan reported on 1 November. The two men signed <br>
     protocols on cooperation between the ministries of defense of the two <br>
     countries. Azerbaijani politicians have condemned recent Turkish <br>
     statements about the possible opening of a frontier crossing between <br>
     Armenia and Turkey; Azerbaijan Popular Front Deputy Chairman Ali <br>
     Kerimov argued that Azerbaijan's Milli Mejlis should appeal to the <br>
     Turkish parliament not to do so, according to Turan of 2 November. -- <br>

 NOTHING NEW IN THE LATEST ROUND OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH TALKS. No progress was made <br>
 at the negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict sponsored by the OSCE's <br>
 Minsk group that ended on 30 October in Moscow, RFE/RL and Russian media <br>
 reported. The OSCE urged all parties to agree on a "declaration of principles" <br>
 of the conflict's settlement before the December summit in Lisbon. The Minsk <br>
 group released a statement criticizing the plans of the Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
 leadership to hold presidential elections on 24 November, Noyan Tapan reported <br>
 on 31 October. Despite similar criticism from Azerbaijan, Russia, and the U.S., <br>
 Karabakh authorities said on 30 October that the elections will take place. -- <br>

 ARMENIAN POWER MINISTERS ACCUSED OF PLANNING COUP. Former Armenian National <br>
 Security Minister David Shahnazaryan accused the country's "power" ministers of <br>
 plotting a coup d'etat and demanded their resignation, ITAR-TASS reported on 30 <br>
 October citing Vremya. Shahnazaryan, who used to be one of the closest figures <br>
 to President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, called for a dialogue between the <br>
 authorities and the opposition. According to him, fresh parliamentary elections <br>
 are a "political necessity." Meanwhile, acting presidential spokesman Levon <br>
 Zurabyan said Armenia's political situation is returning to normal and praised <br>
 the opposition for its efforts to "return to legal activity," Noyan Tapan <br>
 reported on 30 October. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 KARABAKH LEADER SAYS ELECTION WILL BE HELD. Robert Kocharyan, the president of <br>
 the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, said on 28 October that the <br>
 presidential election in Karabakh will be held despite criticism from <br>
 Azerbaijan and Russia (see OMRI Daily Digest, 29 October 1996), Noyan Tapan <br>
 reported. Kocharyan predicted that the Nagorno-Karabakh peace negotiations will <br>
 drag on "for years" and did not expect any progress from the upcoming OSCE <br>
 summit. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department expressed its concern over the <br>
 planned election and warned against "complicating the outcome of the OSCE's <br>
 Minsk Group peace process," Turan reported on 29 October. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 OPPOSITION LEADERS ON ARMENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. Paruyr Hayrikyan, the <br>
 leader of the Union of National Self-Determination, said he hopes that the <br>
 Armenian Constitutional Court will rule in favor of the opposition candidate <br>
 Vazgen Manukyan and annul the results of the 22 September presidential <br>
 elections, Noyan Tapan reported on 29 October. According to a leader of the <br>
 Scientific-Industrial and Civic Union, Suren Zolyan, the court cannot be <br>
 trusted because "it is not independent." Zolyan alleged that the judicial <br>
 branch did nothing to prevent human rights violations in Armenia, and therefore <br>
 "leadership cannot be changed through elections." -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SLAMS PLANNED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN <br>
 NAGORNO-KARABAKH. The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned as "a challenge to <br>
 the international community" the decision by the parliament of the <br>
 self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh to hold presidential elections on <br>
 24 November while "up to one third of the enclave's population are living as <br>
 refugees beyond its borders", Radio Mayak reported on 26 October quoting <br>
 ITAR-TASS. The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan discussed the Karabakh <br>
 peace process during the Black Sea Economic Cooperation heads of state summit <br>
 in Moscow on 25 October. A further round of talks on the Karabakh conflict <br>
 under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk group opened in Moscow on 28 October. -- Liz <br>

 MASS RALLY IN YEREVAN. The opposition National Accord bloc (AHD) held a rally <br>
 in Yerevan on 25 October, the first since the government lifted a ban on public <br>
 gatherings in the capital, Armenian and Western media reported on 25 October. <br>
 An estimated 40,000 people participated in the sanctioned demonstration. Vazgen <br>
 Manukyan, the defeated presidential candidate and leader of the opposition, <br>
 reiterated charges that the 22 September election results were falsified and <br>
 said the opposition "will continue to struggle to replace the current <br>
 government" through legal means. Manukyan called for a boycott of the local <br>
 elections scheduled for 10 November. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 ARMENIAN OPPOSITION APPEALS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. Defeated presidential <br>
 candidate Vazgen Manukyan has formally filed an appeal with the Armenian <br>
 Constitutional Court, asking that it annul the 22 September election results, <br>
 Noyan Tapan reported on 24 October. Manukyan's campaign officials submitted a <br>
 document of more than 500 pages containing "the evidence of election rigging." <br>
 According to Armenian laws, the court must issue its verdict within one month <br>
 of the appeal being lodged. Ashot Manucharyan, another opposition candidate and <br>
 leader of the Scientific-Industrial and Civic Union, will also appeal to the <br>
 court on 25 October. Meanwhile, several Armenian political parties, including <br>
 the pro-government Shamiram party, have called for a boycott of the local <br>
 elections scheduled for November. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

 KARABAKH ELECTION RUMPUS. Azerbaijan's Central Electoral Commission on 22 <br>
 October issued a statement condemning as "an attempt to legalize a puppet <br>
 regime" the presidential elections scheduled for 24 November by the <br>
 self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Turan reported. The agency also <br>
 quoted the U.S. Ambassador to Baku, Richard Kauzlarich, as stating that the <br>
 U.S. government does not recognize the legitimacy of the elections. To date <br>
 four presidential candidates have been registered: incumbent Robert Kocharyan, <br>
 former parliament deputy speaker Boris Arushanyan, Nagorno-Karabakh Communist <br>

 LEADER OF RULING PARTY ON ARMENIAN PRIME MINISTER. The chairman of Armenia's <br>
 ruling Armenian Pan-National Movement party (HHSh), Ter-Husik Lazaryan, in an <br>
 interview with RFE/RL on 22 October, called on Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan <br>
 to step down. Lazaryan claimed that Bagratyan is to blame for the country's <br>
 economic hardships that resulted in the poorer than expected performance of <br>
 Ter-Petrossyan in the disputed 22 September election. Lazaryan's statements <br>
 follow similar comments by other HHSh leaders. In his first post-election <br>
 speech Ter-Petrossyan promised a "serious reshuffle" of the government. -- Emil <br>

 FINAL RESULTS OF ARMENIAN ELECTIONS. The Armenian Central Election Commission <br>
 released the final results of the 22 September presidential polls, confirming <br>
 the victory of the incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan with 52.75% of the vote, <br>
 ITAR-TASS reported on 22 October. The opposition, whose candidate, Vazgen <br>
 Manukyan, won 41.3% of the vote, has accused the authorities of election <br>
 rigging and plans to appeal the official results to the Constitutional Court. <br>

     ARMENIAN OPPOSITION PARTY CALLS FOR BOYCOTT OF LOCAL ELECTIONS. The <br>
     Scientific-Industrial and Civic Union (GAKM), an Armenian opposition <br>
     party, has issued a statement calling for a boycott of the local <br>
     elections due in November, Noyan Tapan reported on 21 October. <br>
     According to GAKM, the elections cannot be considered democratic <br>
     because of "the illegitimacy of the authorities and the constitution <br>
     that have been adopted through falsifications." The statement <br>
     concluded that all efforts to change the government through elections <br>
     are now "fruitless" in Armenia. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN OPPOSITION RALLY BANNED. The Yerevan city authorities <br>
     reversed themselves and withdrew permission for opposition rallies <br>
     slated for 18 October, citing errors in the application, Noyan Tapan <br>
     and RFE/RL reported the same day. The opposition said that they will <br>
     apply for the demonstration to be held next week. The move follows <br>
     President Levon Ter-Petrossyan's 11 October decree lifting the ban on <br>
     public gatherings that was imposed after the 25 September violence in <br>
     the capital. In other news, chief presidential aide Gerard Libaridian <br>
     charged that the OSCE used the 22 September presidential elections to <br>
     force Armenia to make concessions in the negotiations over the <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Noyan Tapan reported. Libaridian accused <br>
     the OSCE observer mission monitoring the vote of "playing political <br>
     games," and said the latter misinterpreted Armenian electoral laws. <br>
     The mission questioned the official election results according to <br>
     which Ter-Petrossyan won a second term. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CRITICIZE ARMENIAN ELECTION. The U.S.-based <br>
     International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES), an international <br>
     election observer group, issued a report on Armenia's 22 September <br>
     presidential election, citing numerous irregularities and describing <br>
     the ballot as "flawed," Reuters reported on 15 October. IFES urged the <br>
     Armenian government to investigate the irregularities. IFES is the <br>
     second international organization after the OSCE to question the <br>
     election results. Meanwhile, Armenian presidential spokesman Levon <br>
     Zurabyan acknowledged "numerous shortcomings" in the election process <br>
     and said the authorities will "punish the guilty," Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported on 15 October. Paruyr Hayrikyan, one of the leaders of the <br>
     opposition National Accord bloc, said the opposition plans to resume <br>
     its protest rallies on 18 October, RFE/RL reported. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     COUNCIL OF EUROPE DELEGATION VISITS ARMENIA. A three-member delegation <br>
     of the Council of Europe has concluded a visit to Armenia aimed at <br>
     assessing the post-election situation in that country, Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported on 14 October. The delegation met with Armenian President <br>
     Levon Ter-Petrossyan and his main opposition challenger, Vazgen <br>
     Manukyan. The delegates said on 11 October that they do not consider <br>
     the Armenian opposition to be "fascist." During one of his campaign <br>
     speeches, Ter- Petrossyan said Armenia would be faced with fascism if <br>
     the opposition came to power. The delegation will release its final <br>
     report in November. In other news, the OSCE's Warsaw Office for <br>
     Democratic Institutions and Human Rights told RFE/RL on 14 October <br>
     that its final report on the presidential election in Armenia "will be <br>
     consistent with" its previous statement that questioned the validity <br>
     of the vote. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     COUNCIL OF EUROPE DELEGATION VISITS ARMENIA. A three-member delegation <br>
     of the Council of Europe has concluded a visit to Armenia aimed at <br>
     assessing the post-election situation in that country, Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported on 14 October. The delegation met with Armenian President <br>
     Levon Ter-Petrossyan and his main opposition challenger, Vazgen <br>
     Manukyan. The delegates said on 11 October that they do not consider <br>
     the Armenian opposition to be "fascist." During one of his campaign <br>
     speeches, Ter- Petrossyan said Armenia would be faced with fascism if <br>
     the opposition came to power. The delegation will release its final <br>
     report in November. In other news, the OSCE's Warsaw Office for <br>
     Democratic Institutions and Human Rights told RFE/RL on 14 October <br>
     that its final report on the presidential election in Armenia "will be <br>
     consistent with" its previous statement that questioned the validity <br>
     of the vote. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     ARMENIAN PRESIDENT LIFTS A BAN ON RALLIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS. Armenian <br>
     President Levon Ter-Petrossyan lifted a ban on rallies and <br>
     demonstrations imposed on 26 September arguing that there is no longer <br>
     any "direct threat to the constitutional order," Russian and Western <br>
     media reported on 11 October. The government withdrew its last troops <br>
     from the capital Yerevan on 11 October. Shavarsh Kocharyan and Samvel <br>
     Shahinyan, two prominent opposition members, were released from prison <br>
     on 9 October. Meanwhile, former National Security Minister David <br>
     Shahnazaryan called for the dismissal of the prime minister and the <br>
     defense and interior ministers claiming that they are to blame for the <br>
     tense situation in the country, Radio Rossii reported on 12 October. <br>
     Hanneke Gelderblom-Iankhout, a member of a Council of Europe <br>
     delegation visiting Armenia, told AFP that the election was not <br>
     democratic. The delegation will release its report in November. -- <br>

     FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER IN ARMENIA. Herve de Charette met with <br>
     Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan on 9 October for the <br>
     first-ever visit by a French foreign minister to Armenia, AFP <br>
     reported. De Charette said his country is ready to help Armenia and <br>
     Azerbaijan settle their dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. France is a <br>
     member of a 10-nation OSCE Minsk group involved in seeking peace in <br>
     the troubled region. Ter-Petrossyan and de Charette also discussed the <br>
     possibility of boosting France's current 3.5% share in Armenia's <br>
     foreign trade and French assistance in Armenia's plans to build a new <br>
     atomic plant. Although defeated presidential candidate Vazgen Manukyan <br>
     expressed a desire to meet with de Charette, it is not clear if the <br>
     meeting will take place. -- Emil Danielyan<br>

     Hakobyan, the only parliamentary deputy for the Armenian Revolutionary <br>
     Federation- Dashnaktsutyun party, was beaten and seriously injured <br>

     also said he has not been allowed to meet with his client since 30 <br>
     September. He described the official charges against Hakobyan and <br>

     NEW ROUND OF KARABAKH DIPLOMACY. Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev on <br>
     3 October criticized the OSCE Minsk group for having accomplished <br>
     nothing beyond declarations in the two years since the 1994 OSCE <br>
     Budapest summit, Turan reported the following day. Aliev, who was <br>
     meeting with representatives of the group, condemned the <br>
     organization's "failure to explain to Armenia that the Armenian <br>
     community of Karabakh will not receive the status of an independent <br>
     state." He also reiterated his criticism of Russia's "one-sided" <br>
     approach to the conflict. On 4 October, the OSCE delegation traveled <br>
     to Stepanakert for talks with the president of the self-proclaimed <br>
     Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Noyan Tapan reported on 7 October. The <br>
     Minsk conference co-chairmen, Heikki Talvitie and Valentin Lozinskii, <br>
     called for a quick settlement of political negotiations on the <br>
     conflict before the December OSCE summit in Lisbon. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ARMENIAN ELECTORAL COMMISSION REJECTS OSCE CRITICISM. Central <br>
     Electoral Commission Chairman Khachatour Bezirjian on 3 October <br>
     rejected as "misleading" the report issued the day before by the <br>
     OSCE/ODIHR mission that monitored the 22 September presidential <br>
     election, Reuters and NTV reported. Bezirjian and President Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan's spokesman Levon Zurabyan both argued that the OSCE <br>
     report contained mathematical inaccuracies, and that even if the <br>
     21,000 ballots that the OSCE said were unaccounted for had all been <br>
     cast in favor of opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan, Ter-Petrossyan <br>
     would still have won more than the 50% voted required to avoid a <br>
     runoff. The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly Committee for <br>
     Non-Member States plans to send a delegation to Armenia to assess the <br>
     post-election situation there, RFE/RL reported on 3 October. -- Liz <br>

     MANUKYAN ABJURES VIOLENCE. In an interview broadcast by Russian Public <br>
     TV (ORT) on 1 October, defeated Armenian presidential candidate Vazgen <br>
     Maukyan, who is currently in hiding, stated that he favors a <br>
     political, rather than a violent solution to the problems facing the <br>
     country. Speaking at a press conference in Yerevan on 1 October, the <br>
     chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, Khachatour Bezirjian, <br>
     denied that there had been major irregularities during the 22 <br>
     September presidential poll. Also on 1 October, U.S. State Department <br>
     spokesman Nicholas Burns expressed concern at reports that up to 250 <br>
     Armenians have been detained following the 25 September attack by <br>
     Manukyan's supporters on the Armenian parliament building, Reuters <br>
     reported. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     <br>
     OSCE CASTS DOUBTS ON ARMENIAN PRESIDENTIAL POLL. The OSCE/ODIHR <br>
     mission issued a statement in Warsaw on 2 October noting "very serious <br>
     breaches of the election law" during last month's Armenian <br>
     presidential election, AFP and RFE/RL reported. The mission noted a <br>
     discrepancy of 21,000 between the number of ballots counted and the <br>
     number of votes cast; President Levon Ter-Petrossyan has claimed <br>
     victory by a margin of less than 22,000 votes. Central Electoral <br>
     Commission Chairman Khachatour Bezirjian rejected the OSCE claims on <br>
     the grounds that the organization's tallies of irregularities are "not <br>
     mathematically correct," according to AFP. Opposition presidential <br>
     candidate Vazgen Manukyan on 2 October called for a second round of <br>
     voting or a new election. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     TER-PETROSSYAN SOFTENS RHETORIC IN TV ADDRESS. Speaking on state TV on <br>
     30 September, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan acknowledged <br>
     that voter dissatisfaction with his leadership's social and economic <br>
     policies compelled more than 40% of the electorate to vote against him <br>
     in the 22 September presidential elections, RFE/RL reported. He <br>
     reiterated his campaign promises of a government reshuffle and a <br>
     crackdown on corruption. Ter-Petrossyan characterized the 25 September <br>
     attack on the parliament building by supporters of his opponent Vazgen <br>
     Manukyan as "a sad event" but argued that it should not be turned <br>
     "into a national tragedy." A spokesman for the Armenian prosecutor <br>
     told Reuters on 30 September that only nine arrest warrants have been <br>
     issued so far, but Western diplomats estimate that a total of 250 have <br>
     been detained, many of whom did not participate in the violence. -- <br>

     COMMISSION UPHOLDS TER-PETROSSYAN'S ELECTION VICTORY . . . Armenia's <br>
     Central Electoral Commission on 29 September released the final <br>
     results of the 22 September presidential election in which incumbent <br>
     Levon Ter- Petrossyan received 51.75% of the 2,210,189 votes cast and <br>
     his rival, National Democratic Union (NDU) chairman Vazgen Manukyan, <br>
     only 41.29%, Western agencies reported. Speaking at a press conference <br>
     in Yerevan on 27 September, Manukyan's wife, Vardouhi Ishkhanyan, said <br>
     that the NDU would hand over evidence that the vote count had been <br>
     falsified to international observers within two days. Manukyan is <br>
     currently in hiding. Also on 27 September, Communist presidential <br>
     candidate Sergei Badalyan, who received 6.34% of the vote, announced <br>
     that his faction of eight deputies would no longer participate in the <br>
     work of the "undemocratic" National Assembly, AFP reported. -- Liz <br>
     Fuller<br>
     <br>
     . . . AND MORE ARRESTS IN YEREVAN. Three NDU deputies and the sole <br>
     Dashnak parliamentary deputy were arrested in Yerevan on 27 September, <br>
     Noyan Tapan reported. Western diplomats estimate that in all some 200 <br>
     people have been detained since the election, including the chairman <br>
     of the Artsakh-Hayastan party, Lenser Aghalovyan, who withdrew his <br>
     presidential candidacy to support Manukyan, according to Western <br>
     agencies. Police are still searching for Democratic Party Chairman <br>
     Aram Sarkisyan, who also withdrew his candidacy in Manukyan's favor. <br>
     The third candidate who withdrew, Paruir Hairikyan, is under house <br>
     arrest. Most of the troops and tanks deployed in Yerevan on 26 <br>
     September following an attack on the parliament building by Manukyan's <br>
     supporters were pulled back on 29 September. The city was reported to <br>
     be calm. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     TER-PETROSSYAN LEADS IN ARMENIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION . . . According <br>
     to data released at midday on 24 September by the Central Electoral <br>
     Commission, incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan received 52.32% of the <br>
     votes cast in the 22 September presidential election, while his <br>
     principal challenger Vazgen Manukyan gained 40.73%, Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported. Voter turnout was given at 58.25%. In Yerevan, with returns <br>
     from one district still outstanding, Manukyan's share of the vote was <br>
     53% compared with 41% for Ter-Petrossyan. Simon Osborn, who <br>
     coordinated the OSCE/ODIHR election monitoring mission, told a news <br>
     conference on 24 September that the 89 foreign observers had noted <br>
     several flagrant violations, including the theft of ballot boxes in <br>
     one Yerevan precinct, but that these were not of a magnitude to cast <br>
     doubt on the overall results, Western agencies reported. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     <br>
     . . . BUT OPPOSITION CHALLENGES RESULTS. Representatives of the <br>
     National Accord opposition bloc supporting Manukyan staged <br>
     demonstrations outside the parliament and Central Electoral Commission <br>
     buildings in Yerevan on 24 September to protest the alleged <br>
     falsification of the election results, Western agencies reported. At <br>
     an evening rally in Manukyan's support attended by some 120,000 <br>
     people, the bloc issued a statement calling on the international <br>
     community to give an honest assessment of the results, which were <br>
     described as an attempted coup d'etat, Noyan Tapan reported. In an <br>
     interview with RFE/RL on 24 September, Manukyan, whose proxies were <br>
     present at the vote count in many electoral precincts, said he would <br>
     accept any election returns put out by the CEC that tallied with those <br>
     compiled by his own team. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     MANUKYAN ARRESTED. Presidential spokesman Shahen Karamanukyan and <br>
     Interior Minister Vano Siradeghyan denounced the attack on the <br>
     parliament building as "an attempted fascist coup ordered by one of <br>
     the leaders of the National Democratic Union," Reuters and AFP <br>
     reported. ITAR-TASS quoted Siradeghyan as stating that three <br>
     organizers of the protest had been arrested; Prosecutor General <br>
     Artavazd Gevorkyan announced that the organizers would be charged with <br>
     attempting to stage a coup d'etat and the attempted murder of the <br>
     parliament speaker and his deputy, according to AFP. Speaking on state <br>
     television on the morning of 26 September, President Ter-Petrossyan <br>
     imposed a ban on all unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations. Early <br>
     the same day, riot police surrounded the presidential palace, which is <br>
     close to the parliament building, and tanks and armored personnel <br>
     carriers cordoned off Yerevan's main square and the nearby <br>
     headquarters of the NDU. On the morning of 26 September, the Armenian <br>
     parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to lift Manukyan's <br>
     immunity. He and several other opposition leaders were subsequently <br>
     arrested, Western agencies reported. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS STORM ARMENIAN PARLIAMENT. Following a session <br>
     of the Central Electoral Commission on 25 September, four commission <br>
     members issued a statement rejecting as inaccurate the preliminary <br>
     presidential election returns released on 24 September by CEC Chairman <br>
     Khachatour Bezirjian. The four claimed that opposition candidate and <br>
     National Democratic Union Chairman Vazgen Manukyan polled 55% of the <br>
     vote as opposed to 37% for incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan, Western <br>
     agencies reported. Some 10,000 Manukyan supporters marched to the <br>
     building housing the CEC and the Armenian parliament, which was <br>
     cordoned off by special police. Some 45 minutes after Manukyan entered <br>
     the building, Paruir Hairikyan, chairman of the radical Union for <br>
     National Self-Determination and one of three presidential contenders <br>
     who withdrew to support Manukyan, announced (mistakenly) that the <br>
     latter had been arrested, whereupon demonstrators broke through the <br>
     perimeter fence and forced their way into the building. Riot police <br>
     used water cannon and fired over the heads of the demonstrators; <br>
     parliament Chairman Babken Ararktsyan and his deputy were hospitalized <br>
     after being beaten by demonstrators. According to Noyan Tapan, Western <br>
     agencies, and The New York Times of 26 September, one person was <br>
     killed in the clashes and up to 50 others, including former <br>
     presidential candidate Lenser Agahalovyan, were injured -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ARMENIA, ADZHARIA ELECTIONS. An estimated 2.4 million voters cast <br>
     their ballots on 22 September in Armenia's second presidential <br>
     election, international agencies reported. Incumbent Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan's principal challenger, National Democratic Union <br>
     leader Vazgen Manukyan, alleged that serious irregularities took place <br>
     during the vote. There has been no independent confirmation of these <br>
     allegations. Russia openly threw its weight behind Ter-Petrossyan, <br>
     with President Yeltsin sending greetings to mark the fifth anniversary <br>
     of Armenia's independence the day before the vote. Prime Minister <br>
     Chernomyrdin went further the same day, telling Armenian Television <br>
     viewers Ter-Petrossyan was a brave, reliable, selfless, and thoughtful <br>
     man he liked to work with. Joint Russo-Armenian military exercises and <br>
     a subsequent military parade in Yerevan were also intended to support <br>
     the incumbent. Meanwhile, parliamentary elections were held in <br>
     Adzharia on 22 September, ITAR-TASS reported. Some 225,000 voters cast <br>
     ballots without incident to elect 80 deputies. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     ARMENIAN ELECTION UPDATE. Three candidates have withdrawn from the 22 <br>
     September presidential election and thrown their support behind <br>
     National Democratic Union leader Vazgen Manukyan, Western and Russian <br>
     agencies reported on 17 September. The now four-way presidential race <br>
     pits Communist leader Sergei Badalyan and Scientific-Industrial Civic <br>
     Union leader Ashot Manucharyan against Manukyan and incumbent Levon <br>
     Ter- Petrossyan. Long the clear favorite, Ter-Petrossyan is now widely <br>
     perceived to be facing a serious challenge from Manukyan. -- Lowell <br>

     JOINT RUSSO-ARMENIAN MILITARY EXERCISE UNDER WAY. Russian and Armenian <br>
     forces began joint tactical exercises on 19 September, Russian and <br>
     Western media reported. The exercises involve troops, warplanes and <br>
     armored vehicles and are taking place near the Turkish border in <br>
     Armavir. The exercises were originally to be held from 23-27 September <br>
     but were pulled forward to effectively coincide with the Armenian <br>
     presidential election. Last March the two sides undertook similar <br>
     exercises for the first time. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     BADALYAN'S CAMPAIGN PROGRAM. Interviewed in Yerevan on 16 September, <br>
     Armenian Communist Party leader Sergei Badalyan highlighted the key <br>
     points of his program for the 22 September presidential election. <br>
     Badalyan advocates "renewed socialism," which he argues is an ideology <br>
     uniquely suited to the Armenian mindset; a new NEP (New Economic <br>
     Policy); the creation of agricultural collectives which peasants may <br>
     join on a voluntary basis without relinquishing the land they acquired <br>
     through privatization; and the revision of the constitution adopted in <br>
     1995 to limit the powers of the president and subordinate the <br>
     government to parliament. Badalyan's foreign policy focuses on <br>
     Armenian membership of the Russia-Belarus Union "in order to guarantee <br>
     Armenia's national security." He believes that in seeking a solution <br>
     to the Karabakh conflict the right to national self-determination <br>
     should take precedence over the principle of territorial integrity. <br>
     RFE/RL reports that there are now only three candidates for the 22 <br>
     September election. Incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan faces the communist <br>
     Badalyan and the unified opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan. -- Liz <br>
     Fuller in Yerevan (monitoring the presidential election for the <br>
     European Institute for Media)<br>

     BOTAS GETS WORLD BANK LOAN FOR BAKU-CEYHAN STUDY. The World Bank on 12 <br>
     September announced in a news release it will loan $5 million to <br>
     Turkey's oil and gas transmission company Botas to undertake a <br>
     feasibility study and environmental audit of several route options for <br>
     exporting up to 45 million metric tons of crude oil per year from <br>
     Azerbaijan and Central Asia. It appears routing options beginning in <br>
     Baku and transiting Armenia or Georgia to Ceyhan will be evaluated. <br>
     According to the news release, World Bank assistance for the study <br>
     does not imply a commitment to further finance the pipeline as it is <br>
     expected to be built and financed by the private sector. -- Lowell <br>

     VAZGEN MANUKYAN'S CAMPAIGN PROGRAM. Armenian presidential candidate <br>
     Vazgen Manukyan, during a 15 September interview in Yerevan, <br>
     characterized the 22 September presidential election as a choice <br>
     between alternative approaches to building democracy and the <br>
     transition to a market economy, and dismissed the Armenian communists <br>
     as a "spent force." While admitting Armenia's economic collapse was <br>
     connected to the collapse of the USSR, the blockade by Turkey and <br>
     Azerbaijan, and the war in Karabakh, Manukyan harshly criticized the <br>
     economic policies of the present leadership, slamming in particular <br>
     its "illiterate" privatization policy. Manukyan's campaign program <br>
     focuses on the reconstruction of the industrial sector, reform of the <br>
     tax system, eradicating corruption and introducing social benefits for <br>
     the most vulnerable sectors of the population. The first point of <br>
     Manukyan's program is a pledge to achieve international recognition of <br>
     the independent status of Nagorno-Karabakh by means of peaceful <br>
     negotiations, although he conceded that this will be a protracted <br>
     process. Manukyan is increasingly viewed as a serious threat to <br>
     incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan. -- Liz Fuller in Yerevan (monitoring <br>
     the presidential election for the European Institute for Media)<br>

     COUNCIL OF CIS BORDER FORCES MEETS IN TBILISI. The commanders of the <br>
     CIS border guard services gathered in Tbilisi to discuss several <br>
     agreements aimed at closer cooperation among their forces, including a <br>
     declaration of demarcation and external border protection principles, <br>
     Russian and Western agencies reported on 12 September. Azerbaijan, <br>
     Georgia, and Turkmenistan did not sign part of the package, including <br>
     the declaration, and Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan did not attend <br>
     the meeting at all, NTV reported on 12 September. Special attention <br>
     was paid to extending the 22 January 1993 CIS agreement "On measures <br>
     to stabilize the situation on the state border between Tajikistan and <br>
     Afghanistan" until 1997. Speaking after his meeting with Georgian <br>
     President Eduard Shevardnadze, Russian Federal Border Service Director <br>
     Andrei Nikolaev denied that Russian-Georgian relations had worsened <br>
     and noted that Russia pays for 60% of Georgia's external border <br>
     patrols. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     ARMENIAN PRESIDENT ON FOREIGN POLICY AND KARABAKH. Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan said that "normalizing" relations with Turkey was his <br>
     main foreign policy success over the last six years, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 13 September. He said ensuring that "Turkey remained <br>
     neutral in the Karabakh conflict" was a great achievement. <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan said relations with Russia have not been as good as <br>
     they are now for 300 years but warned that "one careless step" may <br>
     spoil them. He also expressed satisfaction that Iran is now Armenia's <br>
     main economic partner. On the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, he was <br>
     optimistic that an "interim solution" that would "satisfy all three <br>
     parties" can be found. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     ARMENIANS ABROAD TO VOTE IN ELECTION. In response to opposition <br>
     pressure it has been announced that Armenians living abroad will be <br>
     allowed to vote. However, Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Vardan <br>
     Oskanian said the decision to allow Armenian citizens living abroad to <br>
     vote in the 22 September presidential election is of political rather <br>
     than practical significance, Noyan Tapan reported on 9 September. <br>
     According to Khachatour Bezrijian, the chairman of the Central <br>
     Electoral Committee, about 10,000 Armenians living abroad are expected <br>
     to vote, although an estimated 800,000 Armenians are thought to be <br>
     living abroad. According to Ekspress-Khronikha on 10 September, the <br>
     number is so low because only those who registered with Armenian <br>
     diplomatic missions can vote. In Russia, for instance, there are  only <br>
     172 registered voters. Bezirijian noted that Armenian citizens <br>
     residing in Nagorno-Karabakh will have to vote in Armenia. -- Elin <br>

     THREE ARMENIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WITHDRAW. Three of the seven <br>
     registered candidates for the 22 September Armenian presidential <br>
     election withdrew on 7 September and pledged their support for former <br>
     Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan, the main challenger to incumbent Levon <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan, Reuters reported on 8 September. A further opposition <br>
     candidate, Ashot Manucharyan of the Scientific-Industrial and Civic <br>
     Union, may also withdraw, but Communist Party leader Sergei Badalyan <br>
     has said he will not. Manukyan is reportedly gathering considerable <br>
     support for his pledges to crack down on corruption and the shadow <br>
     economy, to introduce more equitable social and economic policies, and <br>
     to revise the constitution in order to curtail the powers of the <br>
     president. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     HEAD OF ARMENIAN STATE RADIO DISMISSED. The head of Armenian State <br>
     Radio, Stepan Zakaryan, was dismissed on 2 September following a <br>
     controversial court case brought against him by Mikael Martirossyan, <br>
     the head of Yerevan Bread-Baking Plant No. 3, Noyan Tapan reported on <br>
     4 September. Armenian Radio had aired programs earlier this year <br>
     accusing Yerevan bakeries of selling loaves that were below the <br>
     standard weight. Martirossyan successfully sued Zakaryan and two of <br>
     his editors for slander, and Armenian Radio was forced to broadcast a <br>
     retraction. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan recently commented <br>
     that he considered that both Zakaryan and Martirossyan were in the <br>
     wrong and that both should be dismissed. Martirossyan is a member of <br>
     the ruling Armenian National Movement (HHSh); Zakaryan is not. Several <br>
     other radio editors, including the two sued with Zakaryan, have <br>
     tendered their resignations. Noyan Tapan reported that "because of the <br>
     tense situation all radio programs are now being subject to <br>
     pre-broadcast censorship." -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ELECTIONS SCHEDULED IN NAGORNO-KARABAKH . . . At a session marking the <br>
     fifth anniversary of the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh's (RNK) <br>
     unilateral declaration of independence from Azerbaijan, the RNK <br>
     parliament voted to hold a presidential election on 24 November 1996, <br>
     according to a 30 August Armenian Radio report monitored by the BBC. <br>
     The current RNK president, Robert Kocharyan, was elected in 1994; his <br>
     term expires in December 1996. Under the terms of the Law on <br>
     Presidential Elections passed by the RNK parliament in May 1996, the <br>
     new president will be elected for five years; presidential candidates <br>
     must collect a minimum of 1,500 signatures in their support from <br>
     residents of at least four of the six raions of the RNK. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     CONFUSION OVER GERMAN STANCE ON NAGORNO-KARABAKH. The German Embassy <br>
     in Yerevan on 28 August condemned what it described as the <br>
     misinterpretation of statements made by Germany's OSCE Minsk Group <br>
     representative, Ambassador Frank Lambach, during an early August <br>
     meeting with Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev in Baku, Noyan Tapan <br>
     reported on 29 August. On 23 August, the Information Department of the <br>
     self- proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (RNK) accused Lambach of <br>
     exhibiting pro-Azerbaijani bias in statements he had made about the <br>
     possible future status of the RNK. The German Embassy said that <br>
     Lambach's words had been misquoted and "had evoked fair criticism" <br>
     from Armenia, according to Noyan Tapan. Meanwhile, Gerard Liparitian, <br>
     special adviser to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossyan, met this <br>
     week in Germany with his Azerbaijani counterpart, Vafa Gulu-zade, to <br>
     discuss the Karabakh issue before flying to Ankara for a two-day <br>
     working visit. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ARMENIA HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN AID. Armenia received $200 <br>
     million worth of foreign aid in 1995, Finansovye izvestiya reported on <br>
     27 August, citing Armenian Banking Association President Tigran <br>
     Sarkisiyan. The U.S. alone delivered $122 million last year and $85 <br>
     million so far this year. Last year, the World Bank granted the <br>
     country $562 million in loans and the IMF gave $118 million. In 1995, <br>
     Armenian GDP was an estimated $1.3 billion. -- Peter Rutland in Moscow<br>

     RUSSIA TO EXTEND NEW LOAN TO ARMENIA. Under the terms of an agreement <br>
     signed last week in Moscow by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister <br>
     Aleksei Bolshakov and Armenia's Minister for Relations with the CIS, <br>
     Gagik Shahbazyan, Russia will provide Armenia with a 100 billion ruble <br>
     ($20 million) loan to finance safety procedures at the Medzamor <br>
     nuclear power station and the purchase of nuclear fuel, according to <br>
     Noyan Tapan on 27 August and Nezavisimaya gazeta on 28 August. In <br>
     1994, Russia provided Armenia with a 60 billion ruble credit towards <br>
     the cost of restarting the power station, which was closed in 1989. It <br>
     was successfully reopened a year ago, but maintenance work scheduled <br>
     for July 1996 was postponed because of lack of funds. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     TWO IRANIANS SHOT DEAD IN YEREVAN. Armenian police are investigating <br>
     the shooting deaths in Yerevan's central Republic Square on 24 August <br>
     of two Iranian businessmen, ITAR-TASS and Noyan Tapan reported. The <br>
     killer, a young man in combat fatigues, escaped by car. <br>

     ARMENIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN GETS UNDERWAY. Campaigning for <br>
     the 22 September Armenian presidential election got underway on 23 <br>
     August, Western agencies reported. While hitherto observers have <br>
     unanimously predicted that incumbent Levon Ter-Petrossyan will be <br>
     reelected, a recent poll of 1,000 residents of Yerevan revealed that <br>
     23.9% of respondents intended to vote for former Prime Minister and <br>
     chairman of the National Democratic Union Vazgen Manukyan, 16.5% for <br>
     Ter-Petrossyan and 8.2% for Communist Party leader Sergei Badalyan, <br>
     according to Noyan Tapan on 26 August. Seven candidates are contesting <br>
     the election. -- Liz Fuller<br>

     ARMENIAN DEMOGRAPHIC UPDATE. The total number of Armenians in the <br>
     world exceeds 10 million, Noyan Tapan reported on 20 August. Of these, <br>
     3.5 million live in Armenia, 2.5 million in the Russian Federation, <br>
     and almost 1.5 million in the U.S. At the time of the 1989 Soviet <br>
     census, the total population of the Armenian SSR was 3,304,800, of <br>
     whom approximately 90% were Armenians. The figure cited for the number <br>
     of Armenians currently living in Armenia is difficult to reconcile <br>
     with reports that some 800,000 people, or 17% of the total population, <br>
     have left Armenia since 1991, and that the sterility rate in Armenia <br>
     is 20-25%, which is 10% higher than the world average. -- Liz Fuller<br>
     <br>
     CORRECTION: Vahan Hovanessyan, one of the leading members of the <br>
     Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsyutyun) arrested on 29 <br>
     July 1995 on charges of terrorism and planning a coup, was erroneously <br>
     referred to in the OMRI Daily Digest of 16 August as the ARFD <br>
     candidate for next month's Armenian presidential elections. The ARFD <br>
     has not in fact nominated a candidate.<br>

     FBI IN TRANSCAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. The U.S. Federal Bureau of <br>
     Investigation plans to double it overseas offices from 23 to 46 over a <br>
     four-year period, AFP reported on 20 August. Among other countries, <br>
     the agency plans to establish a presence in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     and Georgia in 1998. This is part of the FBI's effort to create a <br>
     "first line of defense" or early warning system to cope with what it <br>
     considers to be the growing internationalization of crime and crime <br>
     threats to the U.S. The report detailing these plans stressed that the <br>
     agency, whose mission has been confined to domestic law enforcement <br>
     and counter-intelligence, would not be engaged in espionage but would <br>
     liaise with its foreign counterparts. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     IMF SATISFIED WITH REFORMS IN ARMENIA . . . Tanas Katsanbas, deputy <br>
     director of the IMF's Second European Division, said in Yerevan on 7 <br>
     August that he is satisfied with the progress of economic reform in <br>
     Armenia. The government's macroeconomic stabilization measures have <br>
     resulted in an annual real GDP growth rate of 4%, while monthly <br>
     inflation rates have fallen to 2-3%, Snark reported. Katsanbas also <br>
     pointed to a range of problems, including enterprise fiscal arrears <br>
     and credit shortages, but noted that those problems can be resolved <br>
     through fiscal reform. Katsanbas also argued that Armenian industries <br>
     must be restructured in order to improve export competitiveness <br>
     abroad, and stressed the importance of joining the WTO. -- Aghasi <br>
     Yenokian in Yerevan<br>

     ASTRONOMER AMBARTSUMYAN DIES. Viktor Ambartsumyan, internationally <br>
     renown for his work in theoretical astrophysics and stellar astronomy, <br>
     died on 11 August, ITAR-TASS and Western media reported two days <br>
     later. In 1989, he went on a three-week hunger strike to bring <br>
     attention to Nagorno-Karabakh's efforts to secede from Azerbaijan. <br>
     Yerevan plans a state funeral for the scientist who served as the <br>
     president of Armenia's Academy of Sciences from 1946 to 1993. -- <br>

     "WANTED" AZERBAIJANIS HIDING IN TURKEY. Azerbaijani Interior Minister <br>
     Ramil Usubov was quoted by Yeni Yuzyil on 10 August as saying many of <br>
     the fugitives wanted in his country, "including those wanted for <br>
     treason," are hiding in Turkey. He said his government has sought <br>
     their extradition repeatedly, but Ankara has been unable to locate any <br>
     of them to date. Turkey has denied these charges. In other news, the <br>
     Turkish Daily News quoted the Azerbaijani Ambassador in Ankara, Mehmet <br>
     Nevruzoglu, as saying the plans of the "secret" Armenian lobby in <br>
     Turkey, which aims to open the Turkish-Armenian border for economic <br>
     reasons, could hurt bilateral ties between Baku and Ankara. -- Lowell <br>

     ARMENIA UPDATE. Armenian authorities have detained and disarmed a <br>
     "large" number of what they described as Kurdish resistance fighters <br>
     near the village of Tsorevan on the border with Turkey, Moskovskii <br>
     komsomolets reported on 8 August. In other news, two high-ranking <br>
     officers of the Armenian Interior Ministry--one responsible for <br>
     personnel and the other for passports and visas--were sacked on 8 <br>
     August for abusing their positions. Fifty people were hospitalized in <br>
     the wake of an outbreak of typhoid in Vanadzor, ITAR-TASS reported the <br>
     next day. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

                         TURKISH PRESS REVIEW<br>
                           JANUARY 9, 1997<br>
<p>
<p>
Summary of the political and economic news in the Turkish  press  this<br>
morning.<br>
<p>
<p>
WINDS OF WAR BLOWING OVER CYPRUS<br>
<p>
Turkey's Security Council yesterday decided in favour of a  strike  in<br>
Cyprus  "should  the need arise." In response to the huge purchases of<br>
weapons and missile systems by the Greek Cypriots  on  Cyprus,  Turkey<br>
has  sent  warning notes and made it clear that the Greek Cypriots are<br>
leading the island into a more serious situation.<br>
<p>
In line with the  warning  words  of  the  President  of  the  Turkish<br>
Republic  of  Northern  Cyprus  (TRNC),  Rauf  Denktas, Turkey has now<br>
declared that massive mobilation of military force in the  Greek  side<br>
will  not be tolerated.  Denktas yesterday warned that the Greeks were<br>
playing with fire and that Cyprus would be ruined if Greece  continued<br>
to play dangerous games in the Aegean and other regions.<br>
<p>
According to some news  sources,  Ankara  has  now  issued  a  "final"<br>
warning  that  in line with stated policy Turkish forces on the island<br>
would strike and  destroy  missile  launchers  in  the  Greek  Cypriot<br>
community if Greek forces continue to force the issue.<br>
<p>
The  international  community  has  also  condemned   the   aggressive<br>
attitudes  of  the  Cypriot  Greeks,  supported  by  Athens,  as  they<br>
blatantly refuse to listen to warnings from Britain,  France,  the  US<br>
and other governments concerned about developments on the island.<br>
<p>
Diplomatic initiatives to  cool  the  situation  have  intensified  in<br>
Ankara,  the  US  and  Cyprus.   France  has drawn the matter of Greek<br>
Cypriot military purchases, especially the  issue  of  buying  Russian<br>
S-300  missile  systems-  to the attention of the UN Security Council.<br>
Newly appointed head of the US Foreign Department  Madeleine  Albright<br>
said  yesterday  that  Cyprus  was  the major problem involving the US<br>
today.<br>
<p>
Russia too has joined in the general  dismay  over  developments,  but<br>
from  a  rather  different  angle.   Russia  has offered to defuse the<br>
situation by selling the same S-300 systems to both Turkey and Greece.<br>
Russian  diplomats are however expected to visit the island later this<br>
month to push through the sale of the S-300 system.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, warnings that both communities on the island  face  serious<br>
consequences  if  current  developments  are not halted continue to be<br>
issued.  There even thoughts that the  situation  is  already  out  of<br>
control.  /All papers/<br>
<p>
<p>
CILLER REPLIES TO IRAQI COMPLAINTS<br>
<p>
Turkish Foreign  Minister  Tansu  Ciller  sent  a  letter  to  the  UN<br>
secretary-general  giving  details about the Turkish Army's operations<br>
in Northern Iraq.  Iraq recently complained to the UN  about  Turkey's<br>
operations  on  its  own  territory.   In  her letter Ciller said that<br>
Turkey respected the territorial integrity of Iraq but that  terrorist<br>
organizations were taking advantage of the power vacuum in the region.<br>
She said that Turkey's operations were aimed  at  securing  peace  and<br>
stability  in  the  region  and that Turkey would continue to take the<br>
measures necessary to protect its borders.  /All papers/<br>
<p>
<p>
AWARD-WINNING PROJECT IN TURKEY<br>
<p>
A  state-of-the-art  aflatoxin  laboratory  has  been  established  in<br>
Gaziantep  to  assure  the  quality  and  safety of pistachios for the<br>
export market.  The project was initiated in 1993 by  Professor  Fatih<br>
Yildiz  to  establish  an  "International  Aflatoxin and Food Analysis<br>
Laboratory".  The project  was  given  financial  support  by  the  UN<br>
Industrial  Organization and completed last October.  This independent<br>
laboratory is now ready to serve the  entire  GAP  region.   Professor<br>
Fatih  Yildiz received a plaque and an award from the president of the<br>
"Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce and  Industry"  for  his  distinguished<br>
service during the establishment of this laboratory.  /All papers/<br>

(I recommend to take some of the assertions of this newspaper with a grain<br>
of salt. Accuracy is not its forte.  And it is generally known for wrapping<br>
world affairs in grand theories of conspiracy. The conference on ivestments<br>
in Russia is not held secretely at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.<br>
The last day of the conference is tomorrow January 12. Some things though<br>
(Yeltsin's health etc.) they often get right. Cheers. AM.)  =20<br>
<p>
<p>
Zavtra No.1, January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Unattributed 'field reports by the DEN =AEMDBO=AF=AEMDNM=AFsecurity=<br>
 service'<br>
<p>
  Sources in the medical circles report that on the night of 2-3 January a<br>
special team from the Kremlin hospital went to B. Yeltsin whose legs had<br>
suddenly begun swelling and who developed malfunctioning in the heart<br>
activity.  That served as a reason for the president's noshow at the<br>
children's [New Year's] celebration at the Kremlin with Yu. Luzhkov.<br>
Meanwhile, the leadership of the presidential staff entrusted the doctors to<br>
do their best to enable Yeltsin to meet with H. Kohl in Zavidovo.  To this<br>
end B. Yeltsin was transported by a special helicopter to his villa in<br>
Zavidovo, which now has a complete intensive care unit with state-of-the-art<br>
equipment that can enable the sick man to hold negotiations for up to two<br>
and a half hours....<br>
 According to sources in Bonn the main motive for H. Kohl's visit to Moscow<br>
is Bonn's intention to consolidate the positions of V. Chernomyrdin as prime<br>
minister in order to make sure that he "lasts" in this post until B.<br>
Yeltsin's natural demise.  Observations by German doctors who took part in<br>
the operation and in consultations were analyzed and presented by the BND to<br>
the federal chancellor.  According to them the physical demise of B. Yeltsin<br>
could come at any moment; it cannot be prevented by any medical means.  The<br>
president's maximum capacity period -- with a gradual worsening of health --<br>
is estimated at 15 months.  In this connection a group of German banks and<br>
leading energy corporations recommended that H. Kohl take to Moscow an offer<br>
of additional IMF loans against the pledge of Viktor Chernomyrdin's<br>
remaining in his post to overcome economic difficulties during the most<br>
crucial period in the first half of 1997.  This activism by H. Kohl,<br>
according to a source in Bonn, is related to the intention of German<br>
financial circles to prevent the advent of a purely U.S. creation (Chubays,<br>
Potanin, Yavlinskiy, and so forth) in the top position in the Russian<br>
Federation after Yeltsin's departure....<br>
 A number of sources in the inner circle of Russian Federation Defense<br>
Council Secretary Yu. Baturin report that pressure on the power ministries<br>
will soon be stepped up; a series of decisions are pending to revise the<br>
internal structure in the power departments.  These include the FSB,<br>
[Federal Security Service] the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the Defense<br>
Ministry.  The Baturin group believes that in late 1996 it achieved a<br>
historic breakthrough in modifying the command and control structure of the<br>
Defense Ministry, as well as its system of as a whole, in the face of<br>
counteraction by P. Grachev and some other generals.  At present chaos is<br>
growing within the Defense Ministry amid the introduction of a<br>
U.S.-patterned concept whereby the General Staff is to play a paramount=<br>
 role. =20<br>
 The general squabble that has emerged in the military conforms with the<br>
guidelines for the full surrender of positions to pro-Turkish forces in<br>
Chechnya and other Caucasus republics. =20<br>
 Baturin and the presidential staff are preparing an analogous attack on the<br>
Internal Affairs Ministry and the FSB.  It is planned to entrust leading<br>
positions in the power structures to those generals who were directly<br>
involved with the Chechen fighters and bankers of a pro-Chechen orientation.<br>
A leading role in the further "chaotization" of the Caucasus is assigned to<br>
the Russian Federation Security Council and I. Rybkin, who for a long period<br>
of time has maintained friendly relations with the Ingushetia Bank [BIN] (M.<br>
Gutseriyev is deputy Duma speaker and head of the BIN).<br>
 According to sources at the World Bank (USA) a series of large scale<br>
schemes are being elaborated in the V. Potantin entourage and the financial<br>
corporation Renaissance Capital, which is affiliated with Uneximbank,<br>
designed to restructure large enterprises in the Russian Federation with the<br>
subsequent sale of new stakes on the New York exchange, which will help to<br>
systematically transfer control of industry and property rights to its<br>
objects into the hands of major U.S. magnates.=20<br>
 The model here is the firm Vympelkom which was created by Academician V.<br>
Zimin, director of the Radio Scientific and Research Institute, who earlier<br>
worked for the FAPSI [Federal Government Communications and Information<br>
Agency] on a project to encode and decode secret radio frequencies.  Trading<br>
on his position, V. Zimin with a number of colleagues founded a firm to sell<br>
Bee-Line mobile phones, transferring to it the best telecommunication<br>
frequencies, and then with the assistance of Renaissance Capital prepared<br>
the placement of stocks on U.S. exchanges, where they were bought up by<br>
representatives of the G. Soros group.  It so happened that G. Soros has<br>
from the start been behind the activity of Renaissance Capital and<br>
Uneximbank in this sphere....<br>
 According to sources in New York's financial circles soon, possibly on 12<br>
to 22 January, Anatoliy Chubays, V. Potanin, Federal Bankruptcy<br>
Administration Director P. Mostovoy, Federal Securities Commission chief S.<br>
Vasilyev, and some other officials will arrive in the United States.  They<br>
will take part in a conference at Harvard University, the J. Kennedy School<br>
of Management, and the Harvard Institute for International Development<br>
(headed by the not-unknown G. Sachs).  Others will come unofficially, via<br>
clandestine channels.  In both instances closed meetings are scheduled with<br>
leading figures at the IMF, the World Bank, and Wall Street.  The central<br>
subject is related to the third stage of the redistribution of property in<br>
the Russian Federation and the CIS as part of the play on arrears and the<br>
transfer of property rights to Russia's key strategic enterprises into the<br>
hands of U.S. major financial groupings.  The main object of the dialogue on<br>
the pending multilevel scheme is RAO [Russian Joint Stock Company] Gazrpom;<br>
in 1997 it is planned to restructure it by giving access to RAO assets to<br>
Uneximbank, Obyedinennyy [United] Bank, and others, which will represent the<br>
interests of U.S. financial circles.  The present scheme of restructuring<br>
(proposed by Gazprom itself) is deemed unable to meet the interests of the<br>
U.S. financial establishment.  In the event of Gazprom's structures being<br>
wholly transferred to the regional level Potanin and Berezovskiy will be<br>
able to acquire controlling stakes in the extremely rich mining enterprises,<br>
including in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, where they have long<br>
been actively sounding out local Duma deputies....<br>
 According to sources close to CIA analytical structures in Washington the<br>
main aim of the U.S. intelligence community in the next few months is the<br>
overthrow of S. Milosevic as well as the current regime in Sofia.  This will<br>
help to place these governments under control and cut the lines of Russia's<br>
potential influence in the Balkans as well as scuttle the implementation of<br>
the Caspian oil transportation route via the port of Burgas (Bulgaria) to<br>
Yugoslavia to Europe bypassing Turkey.  S. Milosevic and the Russian<br>
Federation should reap the fruit of their meek acceptance of the Dayton<br>
agreements.  The only way out for S. Milosevic is to rely on patriotic<br>
circles in Belgrade and in other parts of Serbia, just as it is for the<br>
socialist government in Bulgaria.  The indifference of the Russian special<br>
services and the Foreign Ministry stuns analysts in the United States and<br>
Europe....<br>
 According to reports from Ankara it is planned soon to create a<br>
coordinating center for liaison with Caucasus peoples and republics.<br>
Substantial intermediary functions are to be given to the political top of<br>
Azerbaijan, including President G. Aliyev's personal connections with R.<br>
Aushev, the leader of Ingushetia, via V. Alekperov, president of Russia's<br>
largest oil company Lukoil.  The latter, observers believe, is being<br>
increasingly assigned a major role in infringing Russian strategic oil<br>
interests in the Caucasus and in other regions.  Russia is given a<br>
negligible share of profit in any large oil project while V. Alekperov<br>
pushes through the Russian government such geographic routes for the<br>
pipelines whereby  the Russian Federation loses its strategic control of<br>
them....<br>
 U.S. special services held conferences to assess performance in 1996.<br>
Major debacles are linked with the failure of plans to eliminate A.<br>
Lukashenka in Minsk and foment a new military conflict in Tajikistan, and<br>
the collapse of the Talib offensive toward Turkmenistan's borders.  Another<br>
major flop has been the inability to scuttle the Russian-Chinese dialogue.<br>
In this sphere, it is planned to take pinpoint action to thwart economic<br>
projects (energy, the military industrial complex, aircraft building, and<br>
the nuclear industry).  Expansion of control over TV in the Russian<br>
Federation and in the CIS as a whole is considered to be the most impressive<br>
ideological success story.  It is planned to strengthen financial and other<br>
forms of interaction with the Russian TV leadership (Malashenko, Sagalayev,<br>
Kiselev, Lysenko, Svanidze, and others)....<br>

PREMIER STILL IN USA <br>
ON A WORKING VISIT<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 9 (Noyan Tapan). Armenia's Premier Armen<br>
Sargssian, who is now in Washington on a working visit, met<br>
Wednesday with Paul Gafney, vice-admiral of the US Naval<br>
Research Cemnter. Only three CIS republics have established good<br>
relations with the Naval Research Center and cooperate in the<br>
field of high technologies. Mr.Gafney accepted Premier's<br>
invitation to visit Armenia in order to get familiarized with<br>
our Republic's scientific potential.<br>
     In an interview to the "Washington Times" daily Armen<br>
Sargssian introduced Armenia's stance over the most important<br>
regional problems, in particular, development of cooperation in<br>
Caucasus, regional stability and peace, possible ways of<br>
economic cooperation between Armenia and her neighbors.<br>
     Armen Sargssian also introduced governmental programs aimed<br>
at developing Armenia's economic and social reforms. The goal of<br>
these reforms is to turn Armenia into a regional strategic<br>
state, creating strong sub-structures to ensure growth of<br>
economy and trade and encourage international investments.<br>
     During a short meeting with John Portyr, co-Chairman of the<br>
US Congress's committee for Armenia, the two underlined<br>
Armenia's importance in the establishment of democracy and<br>
market relations in the region. Premier presented Armenian<br>
government's internal policy, that is to solve all disputable<br>
problems with parties and political organizations through a<br>
dialogue.  According to him, the first stage of political<br>
discussions with opposition leaders have already started. <br>
     Premier also had a meeting with Chairman of the<br>
International Fund for Election Systems Richard Saudrith and<br>
introduced the development program for Armenia's democratic<br>
structures, especially mass media. The program suggests creation<br>
of favorable economic conditions for the present mass media and<br>
establishment of new ones.<br>
     During a meeting with representatives of Armenian colony<br>
that took place at the Armenian embassy to the USA, Premier<br>
spoke of programs aimed at strengthening economic stability,<br>
free market relations and involving international and internal<br>
investments. Armen Sargssian emphasized that Armenia's<br>
government is presently working out bills to stimulate<br>
privatization and investments in Armenia.<br>
     Speaking of Armenia-diaspora relations, Premier noted that<br>
the Armenian government encourages active relations between<br>
Armenia and diaspora. He specially emphasized the importance of<br>
unification of all links that unite Armenians all over the<br>
world. This is testified by the establishment of a special<br>
authority to deal with diaspora with the government.<br>
     Armen Sargssian is also supposed to meet with<br>
representatives of American business circles, in order to have a<br>
discussion over establishment of more close relations.  Premier<br>
will also meet with high ranking officials of White House and<br>
State Secretariat, a number of senators and congressmen. <br>

TIGRAN JRBASHIAN: ARMENIA <br>
CAN AFFORD SHARP INCREASE IN<br>
MONEY SUPPLY AND INFLATION<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 9 (Noyan Tapan). Armenia can afford sharp<br>
increase in the money supply (probably, up to 150 billion drams<br>
instead of current 50-60 billion drams) in order to promote<br>
economic growth, said Tigran Jrbashian, Director of the<br>
consulting company "Sed-Marsed."<br>
     In Jrbashian's opinion, one should not be afraid of a sharp<br>
increase in the inflation rate (up to 50% a year) either.<br>
According to him, the main thing is not to evade the inflation<br>
of demand, when "money works for consumption," and to make<br>
"money work for production" when money is spent on the work of<br>
enterprises. "Only in this case the reanimated industry will<br>
help overcome the dependence on international credits", said Mr.<br>
Jrbashian.<br>
     The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)<br>
delegation in Armenia Tanos Katsabmas has stated that the<br>
allocation of the next ESAF credit tranche for 1997 may be<br>
delayed unless Armenia brings down the inflation rate in the<br>
budget and ensures tax assignments to the budget. A credit of<br>
$150 mln is designed for three years; Armenia received the first<br>
$50 mln in 1996.<br>
     One of the toughest conditions the IMF has set up for<br>
allocation of the credit is the stabilization of the dram rate.<br>
However, according to T.Jrbashian, the drop in dram's rate has<br>
been restrained by "barbarous methods" that are delays in<br>
payment of wages, pensions and fellowship.  Moreover, state<br>
enterprises were not even paid for state order supplies.<br>
     There appeared a chain of mutual non-payments on which<br>
sanctions imposed by the tax inspection lay as a heavy burden:<br>
on the one hand the government did not pay, on the other hand it<br>
demanded tax payments.<br>
     Jrbashian noted that economic growth under conditions of a<br>
transition period is known to be accompanied by inflation and<br>
devaluation. Such a growth proved to be impossible in Armenia<br>
because of the gap between the controlled dram rate and<br>
continuous growth of inflation. This gap has led to rise in<br>
prices of commodities in terms of dollar ( on the averrage,<br>
these prices have risen several times in Armenia over the last<br>
three years). Thus, excellent conditions have been created for<br>
getting super profits from import. At the same time such a<br>
situation played for the increase in cost price for export<br>
goods, making it impossible to compete both on the foreign and<br>
domestic markets.<br>
     Jrbashian noted that in response to the conditions on<br>
economic growth set by the IMF Armenia presented the figure of<br>
6%, which quite satisfied the IMF. However, as the Finance<br>
Minister noted, there had been no real economic growth in<br>
Armenia, and, therefore, this figure did not meet the reality.<br>
     In Jrbashian's opinion, the government may be denied IMF<br>
credit if it chooses the variant of an intensive economic<br>
growth. Such a policy proves its value in case of money supply<br>
control (and consequently inflation and devaluation) being aimed<br>
at concrete tasks, the main of which are the payment of state<br>
debts and state investments. <br>

     There was announced a tender for preparation of excise<br>

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OPENED <br>
ITS SECOND OFFICE IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 9 (Noyan Tapan). Through the financial<br>
assistance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the<br>
government of Norway an office of advisor to health ministers of<br>
Armenia and Georgia started recently working in Armenia. The<br>
basis for opening of the office was the quadrilateral agreement<br>
signed by WHO, government of Norway, health ministries of<br>
Georgia and Armenia within the framework of the program "Advisor<br>
for public health". Office Chief, Doc. Turalf Hassvold has been<br>
to Armenia since mid December to cover preliminary works on<br>
opening of the office.<br>
     Head of the WHO's office to Armenia Hrayr Aslanian said<br>
that the aim of the office is to assist health ministries of the<br>
two Transcaucasian states to work out a strategy of prospective<br>
health policy. According to him, WHO opened two offices in<br>
Armenia, however, they are registered at the foreign ministry as<br>
one mission.<br>

     According to Zurabian, the main issue discussed during the<br>
meeting was the membership of Armenia in the European Council.<br>
Ernst Muleman noted that reporting and juridical delegations<br>
will visit Armenia shortly. The delegations should familiarize<br>
themselves with the situation in Armenia. In particular, the<br>
Armenian Legislation should meet the standards of the European<br>
Council.<br>
     Levon Ter-Petrossian assured the guest that Armenia is<br>
ready to provide the delegations with assistance and to review<br>
those legal documents which do not meet the standards of the<br>
European Council. -0-<br>

     Recent amendments to Azerbaijan's law on religion usher in a new era <br>
     of repression for western groups and give new powers to the leader of <br>
     the country's divided Islamic community writes Felix Corley<br>
     ******<br>
     <br>
     As elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, it seemed the end of the <br>
     Soviet period had ushered in an era of freedom of religion in <br>
     Azerbaijan too. Communist persecution came to an end, and a new <br>
     liberal law passed in 1992 guaranteed separation of religion and state <br>
     and banned state interference in religious affairs.  The only group <br>
     unable to take advantage of these new freedoms was the Armenian Church <br>
     in Azerbaijan, because of tensions fostered by the continuing conflict <br>
     over Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
     <br>
     The honeymoon period for religious groups is now over and political <br>
     control over religion appears to be making a comeback. Ironically, <br>
     Islam--the majority religion of the country--is now subjected to the <br>
     tightest controls.  The current government of President Heidar Aliyev <br>
     is suspicious of the inroads made by neighbouring Iran, and in <br>
     particular its promotion of Shia Islam, which is loyal to the Shia <br>
     authorities across the border.  An Iranian-sponsored network of Shia <br>
     mosques has sprung up, which is outside the control of the official <br>
     Muslim Board Led by Sheikh-ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazade. <br>
     <br>
     After a long period of watching and waiting, the government finally <br>
     moved in May 1996 against the Islamic Party, a political body formed <br>
     in 1992 with close links to the Iranian embassy in Baku.  The National <br>
     Security Ministry arrested Akram Aliyev and other party leaders, <br>
     accusing them of spying on behalf of a foreign state. `The members of <br>
     the Islamic Party were dealing with everything but religion,' claimed <br>
     the Security Minster Namig Abbasov.<br>
     <br>
     The following month, the parliament (Milli Majlis) adopted amendment <br>
     to the 1992 law on religion.  One of the main provisions subordinated <br>
     all mosques to the Muslim Board, in an effort to stamp out pro-Iranian <br>
     fundamentalist mullahs. Pashazade had led a public campaign against <br>
     such mullahs, helped by the `competent authorities' (the National <br>
     Security Ministry), whose representatives have muttered darkly that <br>
     foreign religious education is being used as a cover for training in <br>
     espionage.  Other amendments bring religious publishing and <br>
     distribution under closer central control, as well as the selection <br>
     and dispatch of candidates to be trained abroad as mullahs. <br>
     <br>
     The consolidation of central control over mosques comes at a time of <br>
     upheaval within Azerbaijan's Muslim community.  Tension has been <br>
     running high between Pashazade and his former deputy, Haji Sabir <br>
     Hasanly, who was also the rector of the Caucasian Islamic University.  <br>
     After Hasanly accused Pashazade of links with the Ministry of National <br>
     Security, bribery and neglect of mosques, the Muslim Board relieved <br>
     Hasanly of is post for `slandering the Sheikh-ul-Islam, misuse of <br>
     religion and dividing the Muslim community'.  Hasanly retaliated by <br>
     threatening to take Pashazade to court.<br>
     <br>
     Despite the apparent power gained by Pashazade through the amendments <br>
     to the law on religion, and the removal of Hasanly, his basic position <br>
     is weak.  His support for separatists in his home region of Talysh in <br>
     southern Azerbaijan in 1993 has not been forgotten by the country's <br>
     political leadership.  He is also widely unpopular among practising <br>
     Muslims.  Hasanly, who can count on the support of President Aliyev's <br>
     New Azerbaijan Party, is still often tipped as a likely successor to <br>
     Pashazade.<br>
     <br>
     The amendments also affect religious groups other than Islam.  Under <br>
     the new provisions, it will no longer be possible to preach religions <br>
     alien to Azeri tradition or those which the government deems may lead <br>
     to divisions in society.  Foreigners will not be permitted to bring <br>
     religious propaganda into the country.  It remains to be seen how <br>
     these new elements in the law will be put into practice.<br>
     <br>
     Despite his success in promoting amendments to the law on religion, <br>
     Pashazade was still insisting in August that the law was no strong <br>
     enough to counter the activities of Christian `sects' and their <br>
     emissaries in Azerbaijan.  Experts at Baku's Islamic University claim <br>
     that more than 2,000 Azeri Muslims have been converted by such `sects' <br>
     in the past few months alone.  There are complaints that well-funded <br>
     Christian groups have been renting the best halls in Baku for <br>
     missionary purposes. Pashazade has called for the law to be tightened <br>
     further and for an increase in Islamic propaganda.<br>
     <br>
     Once such Christian group to have fallen foul of the law this year is <br>
     the World of Life Church, one of the largest Protestant communities in <br>
     the capital, whose 600 regular worshippers meet in the former KGB <br>
     building in central Baku. After two years of trying to gain official <br>
     status, the church was finally denied registration by the Ministry of <br>
     Justice in May on the grounds that some elements of its statute were <br>
     said to contradict the law on religion.<br>
     <br>
     One of the church's pastors, Aleksandr Neretin, complained that the <br>
     denial of registration was unfounded and represented religious <br>
     discrimination.  The church appealed against the decision, but the <br>
     appeal was turned down in June.  A spokesman for the Ministry of <br>
     Justice reaffirmed its view that the church's activity does not <br>
     conform with the law and cited the `negative attitude' towards the <br>
     church held by the Committee for Religion attached to the Council of <br>
     Ministers.<br>
     <br>
     The church is being backed by the Azerbaijan Committee for the Defence <br>
     of Legality and Human Rights, as well as the Helsinki Commission of <br>
     the US Congress.  However, the support of these bodies has so far <br>
     failed to secure the church's official recognition. <br>

        MODIFICATIONS IN CUSTOMS CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 09, ARMENPRESS.<br>
Starting February 1, the new edition of the Customs Code of the<br>
Republic of Armenia will be put in action. The chapter 14, including <br>
16 articles, on customs rules, violations and liabilities  has been <br>
modified.<br>
According to the First Deputy-Director of the Customs Agency of the <br>
Republic of Armenia Grigor Melkumian, the modifications are made in<br>
consistent with the acting Constitution. If previously  customs officers <br>
levied the goods which became an object of  customs offense, from <br>
February on, according to the Constitution, the court will alienate <br>
property by means of levy. The customs service's administrative<br>
control will be in the forms of notifications and fines. The liabilities<br>
of <br>
the customs offence have been fortified: the articles 84-91 assume <br>
fines equal to 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 times of the salary; the articles <br>
92-97 assume fines equal to 50 % and 100 % of the good which<br>
become an object of customs offence.<br>
The new edition does not make difference in citizens and officials as <br>
well. If formerly the article 92 defined the fine for citizens as equal to <br>
the minimum salary and for the officials as twice the minimum salary, <br>
according to the same article the fine is defined as 50 % worth of the <br>
cost of the good. <br>
Mr. Melkumian believes that these modifications will have positive <br>
and preventive effect  for reducing customs violations. At the same <br>
time it will be an income source for the budget.<br>
<p>
        NEW RATES OF FAMILY ALLOWANCE DEFINED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 09, ARMENPRESS.<br>
Starting January 1, 1997, the new rates of monthly family allowance<br>
for the children of the republic is defined. <br>
Monthly family allowance is given to all children under the age of 6,<br>
as well as to parentless children, to families having physically<br>
disabled children and 4 and more children, to single mothers. The<br>
allowance is given till the child is 17. The allowance is continued<br>
till 18 for the children studying at state registered institutes who<br>
do not receive grants. The children studying at the colleges with the<br>
period of study of 10 month are not considered in this category. The<br>
monthly allowance is 1380 Drams ($ 1= 420 Drams).  The mothers on<br>
partly paid work vacation will receive 1730 Drams till the child is 2.<br>
1730 Drams will also be given to single mothers who have children<br>
under 17 and children who study at state registered institutes do not<br>
receive grants till 18 (the children studying at the colleges with the<br>
period of study of 10 month are not considered in this category). The<br>
same will be applied to mothers who have unemployed status till the<br>
child is 2. The allowance for the birth of child is 4500 Drams.<br>
<p>
        BUDGET OF THIS YEAR TO TAKE RISK<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 09, ARMENPRESS.<br>
The state budget of this year is submitted to the co-session of the <br>
Committees of the National Assembly, on January 07. The Chairman of the<br>
Committee of Finance, Loan, Budgetary, and Economic Affairs Armen <br>
Eghiazarian thinks that it is early to make evaluations for the <br>
presented budget because the discussions have just started.<br>
The Head of the Central Bank Bagrat Asatrian stated that the Central <br>
Bank Council have highly evaluated the proposal. However, this<br>
budget has a risk of over-evaluating the amounts of some type of taxes<br>
and grants. Besides, Mr. Asatrian thinks that it is not necessary to<br>
define the maximum and minimum levels of inflation as 9.5 % and <br>
10.5 % in the Code on Budget. The maximum level defined as 10 %<br>
will be enough.<br>
<p>
        MEETING WITH ARF REPRESENTATIVES IN JUSTICE MINISTRY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
On January 8, representatives of Armenian Justice Ministry met with<br>
the representatives of the supreme body of ARF (Armenian Revolutionary<br>
Federation). (On December 28, 1994 the operation of ARF was suspended<br>
by the Armenian President's order).<br>
During the meeting Mr. Alexanian, Armenian Minister of Justice, said<br>
that the Armenian Justice Ministry has no objections agains resuming<br>
the operation of ARF, provided Law of the Republic of Armenia is<br>
observed.<br>
According to the ARF representatives, the demand of the court verdict,<br>
is satisfied, they have made amendments in their By-Laws, but it is<br>
not acceptable for the Justice Ministry. The Justice Minister said,<br>
"The party may resume its activities only if it reconsiders the issue<br>
of foreign citizens' membership to their party as it is stated in the<br>
Armenian Law on "Non Governmental Political Organizations." The<br>
Minister also said that the Ministry cannot suggest any mechanisms for<br>
resuming the party's activities. According to the decision of the<br>
Supreme Court, Justice Ministry was to suggest mechanism for stopping<br>
the suspension, but after the 6 month period of suspension, the law<br>
is changed and making suggestion is forbidden by Article 5 of the<br>
Armenian Constitution. In conclusion, Mr. Alexanian said that the<br>
acting legislation makes it possible to eliminate the violations and<br>
now ARF may take that opportunity. In response, political<br>
representative of the supreme body of ARF Rouben Hakopian said that<br>
the reason for suspension are already eliminated by the convened<br>
meeting and by the amendments in the By-Laws.<br>
<p>
        NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DISCUSSES BUDGET OF 1997<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
According to the established schedule of the National Assembly,<br>
discussions on budgetary issues started in the permanent committees of<br>
the National Assembly on January 8 and will last for a month, till the<br>
discussion of the law on "State Budget of the Republic of Armenia for<br>
1997" by the National Assembly.<br>
The document submitted by the Armenian Government, presents the<br>
economic policy of this year. The aim of the draft is to secure the<br>
stability of macroeconomics. Armenian Finance Minister Levon<br>
Barkhoudarian presented the state budget for 1997. The income is 113<br>
billion drams ($1=420), expenditure is 147 billion drams, and the<br>
deficite is 1.34 billion drams. The minimum and maximum annual<br>
inflation rates should be 9.5% and 10.5% correspondingly. The budget<br>
income was also presented. According to the Finance Minister, the<br>
increase in the income, as compared with the income of 1996, is<br>
expected to be 31.2%. In the submitted budget there is a considerable<br>
<p>
rise in tax incomes. Its specific gravity is 81 billion drams, which<br>
is by 32% more than it was in 1996.<br>
Such improvements are not due to the growth of taxes, but to improvements<br>
in taxation administration. 10 billion drams are planned to go to the<br>
state budget from the customs payments, which is 83% more than in<br>
1996. It is also planned to impose traffic tax.<br>
The total amount of non-tax income is expected to be 8.7 billion<br>
drams, 35.7% more than in 1996. The total amount of grants is expected<br>
to be 23 billion drams.<br>
Presenting the expenditure of the state budget, Mr. Barkhoudarian said<br>
that it will be 19% of Gross Interproduct. The calculation of the<br>
expenditure is based on the macroeconomic indeces predicted by<br>
socio-economic development program and predictions for the factors of<br>
increase in costs and rates.<br>
The deficite is planned to be covered by foreign and internal sources.<br>
The Central Bank of Armenia approved the bill of the law on "State<br>
Budget for 1997". Mr. Asatrian, the President of the Central Bank,<br>
also made some proposals which will be discussed by the Parliament.<br>

        IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIAL CONDITION OF POPULATION AND ECONOMY TO<br>
        BE IN THE CENTER OF ARMENIAN PRESIDENT'S POLICY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN. JANUARY 9, ARMENPRESS.<br>
On January 8, press conference was held with Acting Press Secretary of<br>
the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon Zourabian. Mr.<br>
Zourabian spoke about the domestic problems of the Republic, foreign<br>
relations and the appointment of France as a Co-Chairman of OSCE<br>
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) Minsk Group.<br>
According to the Acting Press Secretary, Armenia met the New Year in much<br>
better condition as compared with the last year. He said that the<br>
improvement of the social conditions of the population and of the<br>
economy will be in the center of the President's policy. The priority<br>
was given to the payment of salaries, pentions and subsidies to the<br>
employees of budgetary enterprises in time. According to him, the<br>
struggle against corruption could be effective only in case of<br>
substancial growth in the salaries of the officials. Mr. Zourabian<br>
said that the problems can be solved if order is established in tax<br>
collection. He reminded the meeting of the President with the<br>
directors of big enterprises, held on October 28, 1996, where relief<br>
was proposed as a way out for the enterprises. He also mentioned that<br>
as a result of undertaken measures, there have been substantial<br>
improvements in the budget. According to him, the taxation discipline<br>
will permanently be in the center of the President's attention and<br>
under his control.<br>

Mr. Zourabian said that Armenia's position was positive for all three<br>
candidates: Germany, France and the United States.<br>
Later, Mr. Zourabian answered to the questions of the journalist. He<br>
introduced the President's schedule to those who were present.<br>
According to it, governmental session will be held on the coming<br>
Friday, on January 17, the President will head the Armenian<br>
delegation to the summit of CIS states, and in summer the President<br>
will have an official visit to Ukraine.<br>

1. Defense Committee Head Pessimistic About Prospects for 1997  <br>
MOSCOW, Jan 2 (Interfax) --<br>
"Nothing good happened in 1996. Prospects for next year are<br>
no better," Chairman of the Russian Duma's Defense Committee<br>
Lev Rokhlin (the Our Home faction) told Interfax summing up<br>
the results of 1996. <br>
"The armed forces have broken up and the situation in<br>
the army is very serious," he said. <br>
The hopes for decent financing in 1997 have not been<br>
justified, he said. "The spending on defense envisaged in<br>
the state budget is even smaller than in 1996," he added. <br>
The 1997 budget, approved by the State Duma in a third<br>
reading on December 28, reserves 104.3 trillion rubles for<br>
defense which, to quote Rokhlin, is less than the actual<br>
defense-related spending in 1996. <br>
"Such a budget will cause the armed forces' further<br>
break-up," he said. <br>
"The armed forces poor performance in Chechnya attests<br>
to the ongoing disintegration of the army," Rokhlin said. <br>
He said prospects for next year were "very bad." <br>

TEXT: STATE DEPT. ON UPCOMING CHECHNYA ELECTIONS<br>
(Election represents step toward democracy) <br>
<p>
Washington -- The scheduled January 27 Chechnya elections are an<br>
important part of the reconciliation process and "could constitute<br>
another step toward establishing democratic institutions and<br>
legitimate government in Chechnya," said U.S. State Department<br>
spokesman Nicholas Burns.<br>
<p>
Burns said the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in<br>
Europe) can play a "constructive role" in improving the quality of the<br>
elections. The United States has pledged $60,000 to the OSCE's Chechen<br>
election assistance fund.<br>
<p>
The following is the text of the January 6 Burns' statement.<br>
<p>
The United States welcomes continuing progress in preparing for<br>
elections in Chechnya, scheduled for January 27. These elections are<br>
an important part of the process of reconciliation and could<br>
constitute another step toward establishing democratic institutions<br>
and legitimate government in Chechnya. The United States welcomes<br>
recent statements of support for the electoral process by senior<br>
Chechen and Russian officials.<br>
<p>
We believe that the OSCE can play a constructive role in improving the<br>
quality of these elections and we have pledged sixty thousand dollars<br>
to the OSCE's Chechen election assistance fund.<br>
<p>
We have been encouraged by the generous support that other OSCE<br>
participating states have contributed to this purpose.<br>
<p>
We attach paramount importance to the safety of all foreign assistance<br>
workers in Chechnya and will continue to follow closely the security<br>
situation there. We note that Chechnya remains an area of instability.<br>

Armenia/Azerbaijan: Analysis From Washington -- An Opening On Karabakh?<br>
<p>
By Paul Goble<br>
<p>
Prague, 8 January 1997 (RFE/RL) - The decision of the Organization for<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Tuesday to name France<br>
rather than the United States as the new co-chairman of talks on the<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute could provide an opening for progress on the<br>
long-deadlocked talks on the status of that disputed territory.<br>
<p>
That cautious conclusion reflects three things: the problems that a<br>
joint Russian-American chairmanship would have created, the current<br>
state of play of the conflict itself, and the possibility that France<br>
may be able to introduce some new elements into the talks.<br>
<p>
Had the United States succeeded Finland as co-chairman -- and American<br>
diplomats actively campaigned for the position -- Washington would<br>
have had to find a modus vivendi with Moscow, the other co-chairman of<br>
the OSCE-organized negotiations.<br>
<p>
To the extent that Moscow and Washington were prepared to act<br>
together, they might have been able to impose a settlement on the<br>
long-simmering conflict. But there are several reasons why their joint<br>
leadership of the talks would have been more likely to lead to further<br>
deadlock than to a resolution.<br>
<p>
On the one hand, even though Washington and Moscow are committed to<br>
the three OSCE principles on the resolution of the conflict --<br>
territorial integrity, self-determination for Karabakh within<br>
Azerbaijan, and international protections for ethnic Armenians living<br>
there -- the two powers have very different agendas for the region as<br>
a whole.<br>
<p>
The United States is primarily interested in the establishment of<br>
sufficient security in the area to allow oil to flow from the Caspian<br>
basin to the West. The Russian Federation, in contrast, has pursued a<br>
policy that can be described as the promotion of frozen instability,<br>
backing now one side and now another in all conflicts there, to reduce<br>
outside influence and promote its own.<br>
<p>
These very different goals would likely have had a negative impact on<br>
the prospects for talks on the more limited issue of Karabakh.<br>
<p>
And on the other hand, had Washington become the co-chair, that would<br>
inevitably have raised the status and thus the stakes of the<br>
talks. That in turn would have created expectations that any number of<br>
actors both within the region and outside would likely have sought to<br>
dash. Moreover, an American co-chairman would have been both more<br>
visible and more subject to domestic American politics.<br>
<p>
For all these reasons, Washington may be able to do far more behind<br>
the scenes than it would have been able to had it been subject to the<br>
constraints of an official co-chairmanship.<br>
<p>
The second reason for some optimism about the talks arises from the<br>
current state of play in the conflict itself.  On the ground, the<br>
current ceasefire has led some in both Armenia and Azerbaijan to want<br>
to find a way out.<br>
<p>
Internationally, all the members of the current eleven-member OSCE<br>
negotiating group -- except Armenia -- have agreed on the basic<br>
principles for a settlement. Armenia's increasing isolation on this<br>
point even from Moscow, its traditional supporter, suggests that<br>
Yerevan will also be under increasing pressure to make some concession<br>
to end the war.<br>
<p>
And finally there is the likely French contribution to the talks. In<br>
addition to the fact that some in Russia clearly preferred France as<br>
co-chairman and France today is actively interested in increasing its<br>
international role, something Moscow may not be adverse to promoting,<br>
there are three other reasons why France may be able to make a<br>
contribution.<br>
<p>
First, historically sympathetic to Armenia and Armenians, France<br>
nonetheless was one of a very few countries that officially denounced<br>
the recent presidential elections in Karabakh.<br>
<p>
Second, France is increasingly friendly to Azerbaijan because of<br>
French oil interests. On January 13, Azerbaijani President Heidar<br>
Aliyev will visit Paris to sign a major contract with a French oil<br>
company.<br>
<p>
And third, Paris will have a freer hand to make contacts with<br>
countries not now in the OSCE talks. One reason that the OSCE<br>
negotiations on Karabakh have been less successful than many had hoped<br>
is that one major regional actor -- Iran -- has had no voice in<br>
them. That reflects a longstanding and understandable American<br>
opposition to the regime in Tehran.<br>
<p>
The new French co-chairman will certainly not change that formally:<br>
Iran is not going to be invited to sit at the table. It is not a<br>
member of OSCE. But past French commentary suggests that the French<br>
are certainly more willing to play the Iranian card informally than<br>
the United States has been.<br>
<p>
And by introducing the Iranian element into the talks at least behind<br>
the scenes and thus seeking to establish a new balance of forces in<br>
the post-Soviet Caucasus, France might be able to move them off dead<br>
center, albeit at a price some in Washington and elsewhere might see<br>
as too high.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is also the all too real possibility that<br>
precisely these apparent prospects for peace may reenergize those in<br>
the region who benefit from conflict or the current standoff. And<br>
these forces could block any progress in the talks or even seek to<br>
create conditions leading to a resumption of the fighting.<br>

Armenia: Authorities Refuse To Re-register Opposition Party<br>
<p>
By Hrair Tamrazian<br>
<p>
Yerevan, 8 January 1997 (RFE/RL) - Armenia's Justice Ministry today<br>
refused to re-register the Dashnakzutune opposition party, which was<br>
banned more than two years ago.<br>
<p>
The party had applied to be registered again last August after making<br>
some changes in the party charter. But the Justice Ministry today said<br>
that it is not satisfied with the charter changes, and said the major<br>
obstacle for registering the party remained unchanged.<br>
<p>
The party was banned on grounds that there are many foreigners in the<br>
party's leadership, which violates Armenian law. This month, the new<br>
Prime Minister, Armen Sarkissian, met leaders of the Dashnak party (as<br>
it is commonly known) and promised that their case will be resolved<br>
soon. Our Yerevan correspondent reports the party's leadership had<br>
been optimistic that Government would lift the ban.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 7, Part I, 10 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN'S CONDITION FAILS TO IMPROVE. President Boris Yeltsin has
pneumonia of "medium gravity" in both lungs, Ekho Moskvy reported on 10
January, citing anonymous sources at the Central Clinical Hospital. A
Kremlin spokesman refused to comment on the report, according to
Reuters, but an official statement did concede that although the
president is "breathing with more ease," and his "temperature remains
normal," his doctors believe "it is too early to speak about a
breakthrough." Reuters on 9 January cited international heart experts as
saying that the pneumonia could complicate Yeltsin's recovery from his 5
November heart surgery. -- Laura Belin and Scott Parrish
<p>
IZVESTIYA: RUSSIA FENDS FOR ITSELF WHILE YELTSIN IS ILL. While officials
play down Yeltsin's illness, some journalists are expressing skepticism
about the president's health. In an editorial on 10 January, Izvestiya
said it is clear that Yeltsin is seriously ill, and expressed concern
for the country's stability. Like many other papers, Izvestiya avoided
covering Yeltsin's health problems during his re-election campaign.
Vitalii Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya gazeta, wrote in the paper's
10 January edition that "The country is much sicker than the president."
Meanwhile, the weekly Obshchaya gazeta for 9-15 January wrote that a
Kremlin censor vetted all television footage of Yeltsin's meeting with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to delete everything that betrayed the
true state of Yeltsin's health. -- Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
YAVLINSKII: SICK OR WELL, YELTSIN UNABLE TO RUN RUSSIA. Yabloko leader
Grigorii Yavlinskii told Ekho Mosvky on 9 January that President Yeltsin
is incapable of ruling Russia -- not because of his illness, but because
of "the way he sees the political situation, grasps it, selects people,
makes decisions, assigns tasks, and his general abilities to resolve the
problems our country is facing." He claimed that since nobody in the
president's circle understands what policies are needed, it is
irrelevant whether Yeltsin is in the Kremlin or the Central Clinical
Hospital. However, Yavlinskii did not call for the president to resign,
noting that citizens had elected Yeltsin and their choice must be
respected. Commenting on repeated calls for Yeltsin's resignation by
former Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed, Yavlinskii pointed
out that Lebed helped Yeltsin get re-elected by joining his team after
the first round of the presidential race. -- Laura Belin
<p>
SPLITS IN CHECHEN GOVERNMENT. Acting Chechen President Zelimkhan
Yandarbiev on 8 January fired Ruslan Kutaev, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for CIS Affairs, for being too active in support of rival
presidential candidate Aslan Maskhadov, Ekho Moskvy reported. The next
day, five ministers and 15 deputy ministers and department heads, all
members of Maskhadov's Party for National Independence of Chechnya,
resigned from the government in protest. NTV suggested that Maskhadov
and Movladi Udugov are the front-runners in the 27 January race, while
Ekho Moskvy and Russian TV (RTR) saw Yandarbiev and Maskhadov as the
leading candidates. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
RUSSIAN MINISTERS DISCUSS CHECHNYA. Russian ministers still show a
reluctance to admit that Chechnya is well on the way to independence.
Justice Minister Valentin Kovalev said on 9 January that "there are no
prospects for Chechen separatists to gain independence with arms in
hands," and urged negotiations to amend Chechnya's status by
"constitutional" means, ITAR-TASS reported. Foreign Minister Yevgenii
Primakov was more realistic. The same day he told a government meeting
that "there is a real danger that Chechnya will leave Russia de jure and
de facto," ITAR-TASS reported. Primakov said Russia should "put the
brake on this process" by exerting diplomatic pressure on foreign
countries, particularly Russia's Islamic allies. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
RUSSIAN CAPTIVES IN CHECHNYA. Sergei Osipov from the Russian Commission
for Prisoners of War, Detainees, and Missing Persons has provided more
precise figures for the number of Russian servicemen missing in
Chechnya, ITAR-TASS reported on 9 January. He said the whereabouts of a
total of 700 soldiers are unknown. This number includes 300 unidentified
bodies in a morgue in Rostov-on-Don. Osipov estimated 200 of the
remainder are probably buried in unmarked graves, and 200 soldiers are
being held captive. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
DOUBTS OVER CHECHEN AMNESTY. Procurator General Yurii Skuratov told a
press conference that the Duma should not grant an amnesty for the
perpetrators of the kidnappings in Budennovsk (June 1995) and Kizlyar-
Pervomaiskoe (January 1996), ORT reported on 9 January. The Budennovsk
raid was led by presidential candidate Shamil Basaev. Skuratov's
position was supported by deputy Duma speaker Mikhail Gutseriev, ITAR-
TASS reported on 10 January. The Duma rejected an amnesty plan in
December: it will probably discuss the issue again in February. The lack
of an amnesty could delay the release of Russian captives. -- Peter
Rutland
<p>
PRIMAKOV THREATENS BALTICS WITH SANCTIONS. Foreign Minister Yevgenii
Primakov told a meeting of the Russian government on 9 January that
Moscow "should not be afraid to use economic sanctions" to defend the
human rights of Russians living in the Baltic states, Russian and
Western agencies reported. In order to pressure Estonia into halting
what he claimed are discriminatory policies toward its Russian minority,
for example, he said that Moscow will refuse to sign a border treaty
with Tallinn until the issue was resolved. Since Estonia dropped its
demands for the recognition of the 1920 Tartu treaty, a border
agreement, which would bolster Estonia's bid to join the EU and NATO, is
all but ready for signature. Segodnya on 31 December accused Moscow of
deliberately dragging its feet over the border treaty in order to hamper
Estonian integration into Western institutions, and said the policy
"resembles crude blackmail." -- Scott Parrish
<p>
INDIA TO PURCHASE RUSSIAN SUBMARINES. The Indian government has decided
to purchase two Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarines from
Russia, ITAR-TASS reported on 9 January. The new submarines, plus two
others to be built at Indian shipyards under license, will replace six
older Soviet-designed submarines which are slated to be scrapped. India
already has eight Kilo-class boats in service, and Moscow hopes to sell
New Delhi equipment ranging from helicopters to surface combatants for
its naval modernization program. On 6 January ITAR-TASS reported the
delivery of a third Russian-built Kilo-class submarine to Iran. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
FORMER DISSIDENTS CRITICIZE INTELLIGENTSIA. Former dissidents Andrei
Sinyavskii and Mariya Rozanova have sharply criticized Russia's
"egotistical intellectual elite" for ignoring the plight of the poor and
the hungry. In excerpts from a British radio broadcast published in the
9 January edition of Sovetskaya Rossiya, Sinyavskii and Rozanova claimed
that private enterprise was beginning to flourish in 1990 and goods were
widely available at reasonable prices . But they said the "shock
therapy" reforms of the government of Yegor Gaidar in 1992 destroyed
honest enterprise and impoverished millions. They assailed
intellectuals, many of them former dissidents, for defending Gaidar's
reforms rather than the people who suffered under them. Sinyavskii and
Rozanova have lived in Paris since 1973, having emigrated after
Sinyavskii served six years in a labor camp for publishing "anti-Soviet"
literature abroad. They supported former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's presidential bid last year. -- Laura Belin
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
U.S. MAINTAINS PRESSURE ON GEORGIA OVER FATAL CAR ACCIDENT. U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has asked Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze to ensure that diplomat Georgi Makharadze, who
reportedly caused a five-car accident in Washington in which an American
girl was killed (see OMRI Daily Digest, 7 January 1997), is not recalled
home until the United States gets a formal response from Georgia to its
waiver request, Western agencies reported on 9 January. Meanwhile, an
unidentified U.S. official said Makharadze will "leave the country
shortly." The report contradicts an earlier statement by Georgian
Foreign Minister Irakli Menagarashvili that the diplomat will not be
recalled until the investigation is complete. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
HIGH LEVEL GEORGIAN-ABKHAZ TALKS. The foreign ministers of Georgia and
its breakaway republic of Abkhazia have met in the Abkhaz resort town of
Gagra, Russian and Western media reported on 9 January. According to
Abkhaz Foreign Minister Konstantin Ozgan, the fact of direct talks
testifies to the two sides' readiness to reach a compromise on the
Abkhaz conflict and is not a sign of Russia's decreased role in settling
it. Georgian Foreign Minister Irakli Menagarashvili warned the Abkhaz
side that Georgia will ask CIS member countries to tighten the blockade
of Abkhazia unless the latter provides for the return of more than
200,000 ethnic Georgian refugees. Menagarashvili said there was no
progress on the issue of Abkhazia's future status. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
AMERICAN JOURNALIST MURDERED IN ALMATY. The body of the director of the
Internews Network Agency in Kazakstan, 28-year-old Chris Gehring, was
found in his apartment on 9 January, Western and Russian media reported.
Chief detective Alibek Shapenov said Gehring was apparently murdered
during a burglary that went wrong. As a foreigner in Kazakstan Gehring
was likely to be considered wealthy. Gehring's computer was missing and
boxes containing a stereo, VCR, and television were found near the
doorway. However, many journalists doubt the validity of the burglary
theory, noting Gehring was found with his hands and feet bound and his
throat cut. Gehring had been working in Kazakstan since May 1995 as part
of a US AID-funded project to aid independent media. The Committee to
Protect Journalists has sent a strongly worded note to the Kazakstani
government demanding an immediate investigation. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
FIRST BRIGADE TO LEAVE TURSUN ZADE. The commander of Tajikistan's First
Brigade, Col. Mahmud Khudaberdiyev, said on 9 January, he and his unit
are ready to comply with a presidential order that they return to their
base in Kurgan-Tyube, international media reported. Khudaberdiyev's unit
managed to push the outlaw group of Kadyr Abdullayev outside the city
limits, according to Russian television. Abdullayev says he will not
surrender nor heed Khudaberdiyev's order that he permanently vacate
Tursun Zade. Khudaberdiyev said he was satisfied with the recapture of
military hardware Abdullayev's group stole from the First Brigade on 29
December and the departure of Abdullayev's criminal band from the city.

<p>
TAJIK GOVERNMENT SCOFFS AT OPPOSITION PROPOSAL. Peace negotiations
between the Tajik government and United Tajik Opposition (UTO) taking
place in Tehran became bogged down on 8 January, RFE/RL reported. UTO
representatives had the impression the planned National Reconciliation
Commission would consist of 40% representation from both the government
and the UTO, with the remaining 20% being made up of regional and ethnic
groups. However, government negotiators in Tehran now say they want an
80% share of the commission to be from the Tajik government and that all
proposals for amendments to the constitution be approved by a two-thirds
vote. The deputy leader for the UTO, Ali Akbar Turajonzoda, said that is
not what was agreed at the Moscow talks in December between Tajik
President Imomali Rakhmonov and UTO leader Said Abdullo Nuri. -- Bruce

BELGRADE STUDENTS WIN STANDOFF WITH POLICE. Student protesters held a
triumphant and noisy march through the heart of the capital in the early
hours of 10 January following the withdrawal of security forces. The
students had organized shifts in order to confront the police for 13
hours, CNN and AFP reported. It was the first march since the
authorities banned such demonstrations on 25 December, and the students
say they will now seek a formal lifting of that prohibition. Opposition
leader Vuk Draskovic, for his part, demanded that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic resign. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on 9 January
recognized the opposition's 17 November election victory in Vrsac, but
the protesters say they will continue until all 14 of their successes
are acknowledged. Also on 9 January, 52 of the 160 members of the
Serbian Academy of Sciences warned the government to recognize all
opposition victories lest the country degenerate into "a complete police
dictatorship" and civil war, Nasa Borba wrote. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY FOR SERBIA? Prince Alexander, heir to the throne
&gt;from the Karadjordjevic dynasty, who has spent his entire life in
Britain, has said he has close links to the Serbian opposition and is
ready to return as king if the people want him. He told the Daily
Telegraph on 9 January that "it's time for a change. The people are fed
up." Royalist roots run deep in Serbia, and many observers and
politicians have suggested that the country might eventually restore the
Karadjordjevic dynasty, which the communists overthrew in 1945.
Alexander's realm would be confined to Serbia and Montenegro rather than
the entire former Yugoslavia, which his family had ruled since 1918. But
he does not exclude Bosnian Serb territories linking up with Serbia:
"One day, there will have to be a Dayton Two," he argued. He also warned
that "Milosevic is planning a collective suicide of the nation" and must
be gotten rid of. Alexander added that his role model is Spain's King
Juan Carlos, who helped Spain become a prosperous democracy integrated
into Europe. "What does the king provide? He provides unity," Alexander
concluded. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BOSNIAN SERBS SAY TRACKING DOWN WAR CRIMINALS WOULD ENDANGER PEACE.
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serbian member of the Bosnian Presidency, has
said establishing an international police force to apprehend indicted
war criminals in Bosnia would pose a threat for peace in the country,
Onasa reported on 9 January, citing Bosnian Serb Radio reports.
Krajisnik said the Serbs are willing to try their own war criminals
using files received from the Hague-based international criminal
tribunal. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic said in a
letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Bosnian Serbs will
not hand over their former President Radovan Karadzic or military
commander Ratko Mladic, both of whom are indicted war criminals, Reuters
reported on 9 January. Plavsic said the indictments were no longer valid
since fighting was over and there were no more reports on war crimes in
the Republika Srpska. Delivering Karadzic and Mladic to The Hague would
only threaten peace, Plavsic added. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
BRCKO'S FATE CONTINUES TO HANG IN BALANCE. While international mediators
were meeting in Rome to discuss the fate of Brcko (see OMRI Daily
Digest, 9 January 1996), Bosnian Serb leaders warned that war could re-
ignite in the Balkans if the town was awarded to the Muslim-Croat
federation, Reuters reported. "Brcko is Serb and must remain Serb,"
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic said at a ceremony in the
northern Bosnian town marking the founding of the Republika Srpska.
Krajisnik said Serbs would be compelled to wage war if the town were not
in Serbian hands. But the Bosnian Federation argues that Brcko should be
granted to Muslims and Croats, who constituted a majority of the city's
pre-war population and were subsequently "cleansed" by Serbs during the
war. Kresimir Zubak, the Croatian member of Bosnian Presidency, warned
the Serbs of "total defeat" if they were to go to war over Brcko, AFP
reported on 9 January. -- Daria Sito Sucic

<p>
TURKEY IS BUYING MISSILES<br>
<p>
By Alexander Reutov<br>
<p>
Confrontation<br>
<p>
Defense News, an American magazine, has reported recently that Turkey<br>
intends to purchase 18 Hawk missile systems of the ground-to-air class in<br>
Belgium and the Netherlands. France is said to be a go-between in this deal.<br>
This information was confirmed by an official spokesman of the Ministry of<br>
National Defense of Belgium who stated that such negotiations were indeed<br>
under way. Moreover, he opined that negotiations would be completed in the<br>
next couple of weeks.<br>
<p>
American Hawk class missiles were delivered to some NATO countries until<br>
recently. Now these countries need to get rid of them as they no longer meet<br>
modern standards. Turkey's intentions to purchase anti-aircraft systems was<br>
rather timely. The cost of the deal is estimated at $150 million. The cost<br>
includes expenses on modernization of the systems by a French company<br>
Thomson. The obsolete systems will require modernization of means of<br>
electronic security and targeting. It is planned that 10 systems each with 3<br>
missile launching capacity equipped with radars will be sold Belgium, and<br>
the remaining eight by the Netherlands. Turkey will be paying through a<br>
credit provided by France.<br>
<p>
It is noteworthy that this information is disclosed now that Ankara is<br>
making decisive protests against Russian-Cypriot deal on AA S-300 PMU-1<br>
systems. The Turkish leadership thinks that it is an offensive weapon and<br>
presents threat to the security of Turkey. According to Minister of Defense<br>
of Turkey Turhan Tayan (AM:transliterated from Russian) S-300 will enable<br>
armed forces of Cyprus to destroy targets on the southern shore of Turkey.<br>
He also stated that Ankara may be forced to repeat the scenario of 1974 when<br>
the Turkish army occupied the northern part of Cyprus. Now he is speaking<br>
about the southern part of the island populated by Greeks.             <br>
<p>
Situation in that part of the world is rather heated. Russia played a role<br>
in that by providing Cyprus with several dozens of modern tanks T-80U and<br>
armored personnel carriers BMP-3 which, according to the Cypriot leadership,<br>
are deployed to deter the 30 thousand strong Turkish expeditionary corps in<br>
the northern part of the island. Nonetheless it is difficult to imagine that<br>
the sides will end up in another military clash. Senior NATO brothers will<br>
do everything in their power to prevent the confrontation of Turkey and<br>
Greece, two NATO member countries. Last year Athens and Ankara were on the<br>
verge of a head on clash for a small uninhabited island which both countries<br>
claim to be theirs.  Then too passions were running high in both capitals,<br>
but the clash was prevented due to the pressure on them by NATO partners. (end) <br>

1. FOREIGN MINISTER MEETS WITH ARF LEADERSHIP<br>
ATHENS-The Armenian Revolutionary Federation leadership of <br>
Greece met with Armenias Foreign Minister, Alexander <br>
Arzoumanian, who was in Athens on an official visit this <br>
week.<br>
	Thursdays meeting, at the request of Arzoumanian, <br>
discussed the current political situation in Armenia, as <br>
well as issues concerning the Armenian community of Greece.<br>
	Armenias Ambassador to Greece, Armand Kirakossian, also <br>
attended the meeting.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. AZERI PARTIES OPPOSE HIGH AUTONOMY OFFER<br>
BAKU (Lragir, Armenpress)-Most of the political parties <br>
acting in Azerbaijan complained against the proposal of the <br>
Azeri government to provide a status of "high autonomy" to <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
	Representatives of the parties said that the provision of <br>
a "high autonomy" status is contradictory to the <br>
Constitution of Azerbaijan and to international law.<br>
	According to Article 7 of the Azeri Constitution, <br>
Azerbaijan is a unified country, they said, adding that <br>
providing "high autonomy" would mean switching from a <br>
unified to a federative state.<br>
	No other territory, apart from Nakhichevan, could have <br>
autonomy in Azerbaijan, they said, citing their <br>
constitution.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. PRIME MINISTER MEETS WITH LEGISLATORS ON CAPITOL HILL<br>
WASHINGTON-Armenias Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian had a <br>
series of meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the second <br>

	He met with Senators Mitch McConnell and John Kerry, <br>
Congressmen Joseph Kennedy, Jim McGovern, George <br>
Radanovich, Co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on <br>
Armenian Issues Frank Pallone and Congresswoman Nancy <br>
Pelosi.<br>
	Prime Minister Sarkissian introduced the Armenian <br>
governments platform to the representatives of the US <br>
legislature, outlining a number of priority areas in full <br>
democracy building, economic development, privatization and <br>
investment processes, national stability and regional <br>
cooperation.<br>
	Speaking about the necessity of strengthening <br>
democracy and market economy, Sarkissian gave a brief <br>
account on what steps the government has taken during the <br>
first two months of his tenure as prime minister.<br>
	Sarkissian also emphasized the importance of fair <br>
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict for the future <br>
development of the entire region.<br>
	Earlier that morning, Sarkissian met with ExIm Bank <br>
chairman Martin Kamark and director, Dr. Rita Rodriguez. <br>
The ExIm Bank promotes American business both domestically <br>

	Sarkissian presented his governments priorities for <br>
this year, stressing the importance of conducting a policy <br>
of facilitating domestic investments, as well as creating a <br>
favorable infrastructure for large-scale investment.<br>
	Expressing their readiness to assist in accelerating <br>
private investments in Armenia, the ExIm Bank <br>
representatives underlined the importance of establishing <br>
legal framework and favorable conditions for the <br>
realization of financial programs in Armenia. An agreement <br>
with the bank is expected to be signed in the near future.<br>
	Accompanying the Prime Minister were Armenian Trade <br>
Minister Garnik Nanagulian, Armenias Ambassador to the US <br>
Rouben Shugarian and members of the Armenian embassies in <br>
Washington and London.<br>
	In addition to his meetings with the World Bank and <br>
the IMF, Sarkissian was scheduled to meet with members of <br>
the US business community to discuss avenues of closer <br>
cooperation. He was also expected to have meetings with <br>
White House and State Department officials.<br>

YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The All-Armenian Games, which will <br>
last from 7 to 10 days, are expected to be held in Yerevan <br>
in the fall, said Ashot Melik-Shakhnazarian, head of the <br>
International Organizations Department of the Armenian <br>
Foreign Ministry Thursday.<br>
	According to Melik-Shakhnazarian, Armenian athletes from <br>
forty-five countries will take part in the first <br>
competitions.<br>
	Arthur Gevorkian, head of the Sports Department of the <br>
Armenian Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports Affairs, <br>
said the athletic facilities where the competitions are <br>
supposed to be held have already been selected.<br>
	He also noted that these facilities needed repairs. <br>
Chairman of Armenias Olympic Committee, Alexan Avetissian, <br>
said that the committee does not have sufficient funds to <br>
carry out the needed repairs, and therefore must rely on <br>
the government.<br>
	The games will included competitions in basketball, <br>
volleyball, tennis, table tennis and soccer. Women are <br>
expected to take part in only four of the five events.<br>
	Cultural events are also planned simulataneously with the <br>
games, to held once in four years.<br>

5. US WARNS TURKEY AGAINST ATTACKING CYPRUS<br>
WASHINGTON (Reuter)-The United States warned Turkey on <br>
Thursday against attacking Cyprus after reports that Ankara <br>
was seriously considering a military strike.<br>
	"This is no time for the Turkish government to be <br>
making wild and dramatic statements which will not be <br>
supported by any sensible member of the international <br>
community, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told <br>
reporters.<br>
	"It would be completely out of bounds for Turkey to <br>
take this action, he added.<br>
	Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan was reported to <br>
have warned on Wednesday that Turkey would attack Cyprus if <br>
it needed to protect the Turkish Cypriot community in the <br>
north of the Mediterranean island.<br>
	"What was needed in 1974 and what did we do? We will <br>
do the same again. If needed, we will strike, Tayan told <br>
the state-run TRT television channel in an interview.<br>
	Turkey has accused the Cypriot government of trying to <br>
change the balance of forces on the island by a deal <br>
announced over the weekend to buy Russian anti-aircraft <br>
missiles that could neutralize Turkish air superiority.<br>
	Burns, noting Tayans remarks, said: "We hope very <br>
much that this report...is incorrect. We hope it does not <br>
reflect in any way shape or form the views of the Turkish <br>
government.<br>
	"There can be no question that Turkey must respect the <br>
rules of the road here, which are no country, and <br>
specifically in this case Turkey, should threaten the use <br>
of military force against Cyprus; no country, specifically <br>
here Turkey, should undertake military force against <br>
Cyprus, he said.<br>
		In an unusually strong statement, Washington on <br>
Monday deplored Cyprus contract to buy the S-300 anti-<br>
aircraft missile system from Russia, saying it would <br>
introduce a destabilizing new military element and <br>
complicate peace moves.<br>
	But Burns stressed on Thursday that at this point only <br>
a contract has been signed and the system will not be <br>
deployed for at least 16 months. "Theres no reason for the <br>
Turkish government to run off and threaten anybody, he <br>
said.<br>
	He emphasized: "We need peace and stability in the <br>
eastern Mediterranean ... We need to try to convince the <br>
parties that we should re-energize the political talks on <br>
Cyprus.<br>
	Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright, in <br>
testimony presented to her Senate confirmation hearing <br>
Wednesday, said tensions and disputes between Turkey and <br>
Greece, two NATO allies, "affect European stability and our <br>
vital interests.<br>
	"Accordingly, we are prepared in this new year to play <br>
a heightened role in promoting a resolution in Cyprus but <br>
for any initiative to bear fruit, the parties must agree to <br>
steps that will reduce tensions and make direct <br>
negotiations possible, she said.<br>
The United States, gravely concerned about Cyprus plans to<br>
buy Russian anti-aircraft missiles, will renew this weekend <br>
efforts to reduce tensions between Greeks and Turks on the <br>
divided island.<br>
	Officials have said Carey Cavanaugh, a mid-level <br>
diplomat who heads the office of southern European Affairs, <br>
would visit Cyprus on Sunday and Monday, seeking to advance <br>
a political settlement there. He will also visit Greece and <br>
Turkey. <br>
	President Bill Clinton some time ago appointed a <br>
special envoy on Cyprus, Richard Beattie, and Burns was <br>
asked why Cavanaugh was going to the region, not Beattie. <br>
Burns said Cavanaugh had day-to-day responsibility for the <br>
region. Also, "you dont always need to have your special <br>
negotiators from Washington run out every time there is a <br>
problem. We do have very well-qualified American <br>
ambassadors in these three countries ... and we have great <br>
confidence in them, he said.<br>
	The Cypriot government said the missiles are <br>
defensive. The S-300 air defense system has a range of 150 <br>
km (90 miles) and can knock out aircraft and missiles in <br>
flight.<br>
	They dismissed the threats of a military strike by <br>
Turkey as nothing new. "For us the matter is over, <br>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides told Reuters.<br>
	"We will not follow Turkey with polemic statements. <br>
We are focusing our attention to the political solution of <br>
the problem,  he said.<br>
	Earlier on Thursday the Greek government shrugged off <br>
similar but less explicit threats by Turkey.<br>
	Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Cypriot President <br>
Glafcos Clerides would be invited to Athens for talks on <br>
the issue this month but added there was no cause for <br>
concern that a new crisis would erupt between Greece and <br>
Turkey.<br>
	"There is nothing new in our region. Turkish <br>
aggression has been expressed for some time, he told <br>
reporters. "We would be playing Turkeys game if we showed <br>
particular worry over this and were swept into an <br>
atmosphere of crisis.<br>

6. LETTER TO THE EDITOR<br>
Dear Sirs:<br>
On January 3, 1997 the Armenian Assembly of American, <br>
through their staff member Arpi Vartanian, released an <br>
action alert regarding an article which appeared on the <br>
same day in The New York Times. That article, written by <br>
Michael Specter, was entitled "Drift to Dictatorship Clouds <br>
Armenias Happiness." Ostensibly, Ms. Vartanians action <br>
alert was a call to arms for Armenian-Americans to <br>
protest the papers revelation that democracy is faltering <br>
badly in the Republic of Armenia.<br>
	I find the Assemblys adoption of "Anti-Defamation <br>
Alert" in their release to be particularly offensive. It <br>
plays on the fears of well-intentioned Armenians, cloaking <br>
what is nothing but a poorly-reasoned political position <br>
paper under the language of anti-racism. If the Assembly is <br>
going to stick to their position as the de facto lobbying <br>
arm of the Ter-Petrosyan government, they can at least do <br>
the Diaspora in the US and their own credibility a favor <br>
and save the use of "anti-defamation" for slander that is <br>
worthy of community response. A balanced New York Times <br>
article that levels criticism at the side they support is <br>
not worth crying persecution over and only cheapens <br>
legitimate concerns about how Armenia and Armenians are <br>
portrayed in the US media.<br>
	However, I really hope that the Assembly wrote this <br>
out of naivete. I hope it was just sub-par work, a Friday <br>
afternoon rush job that got hastily approved for release. <br>
Because if this level of deception now represents what the <br>
Assembly plans to foist on the community as an "authority" <br>
and as "leaders," this is a cause for real concern. I dont <br>
think we deserve this.<br>
	But I do close with a caveat. I dont appreciate The <br>
New York Times coverage of Armenian issues over the past <br>
15 years, which is as long as I have read the paper. I have <br>
found them biased. With this in mind, I sincerely regret <br>
that the current government in Armenia has strayed so far <br>
that the Times is able to criticize Armenias leadership <br>
through balanced coverage rather than by careful editorial <br>
policy. While I think the Times article was very good, and <br>
some of the best recent writing in the American press on <br>
affairs in Armenia, I hope that we continue to watch their <br>
reporting carefully so that we dont get a false sense of <br>
security from its current honesty.<br>
	Sincerely,<br>
	Aram Adishian<br>
	New York, NY<br>

7. KEY TO HIEROGLYPHICS DISCOVERED<br>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenian scientists have discovered <br>
the key to decipher the hieroglyphics of the Urartu Kingdom <br>
in Van, the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia <br>
announced Friday.<br>
	Under the supervision of the academys vice-chairman <br>
Gagik Sargsian, a post-graduate student of the Armenian <br>
Oriental Studies Institute Artak Movsessian surveyed a <br>
writing system, which included 200 signs. The signs were <br>
written from right to left and up and down. The system also <br>
included auxillary signs and figures.<br>
	The key was said to have been discovered after thorough <br>
scrutiny of the Urartu hieroglyphics and cuneiform. <br>
Armenian scientists have managed to decode 33 signs, <br>
including three names-Ishpani, Menua and Inouan.<br>
	According to the scientists, there are grounds to <br>
make a presumption that inhabitants of the area of <br>
Biayna-Urartu-were writing in classical Armenian.<br>
<p>
<p>
8.HYDROELECTRIC PLANT PRIVATIZATION POSTPONED<br>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The privatization of eight small <br>
hydroelectric plants in Areni, Yeghegnadzor, Azatek, <br>
Ijevan, Arium, Meghri, Martuni, Giumri, which was planned <br>
to be carried out this month has been postponed until <br>
March, sources close to the Energy Ministry reported.<br>
	Seven other stations, including Voghji-2, Voghji-3, <br>
are also slated for privatization.<br>
	The 15 plants together are said to produce only 30 <br>
megaWatts of energy.<br>

Moskovskiy Komsomolets 9 January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Yulia Kalinina:  "We Shall Always Find a Cyprus To Put<br>
   Against Their NATO"<br>
<p>
  The scandal that has developed around the decision of "Greek" Cyprus<br>
  to buy Russian S-300 surface to air missiles can be regarded as<br>
  nothing short of a "worldwide" recognition.  The West thus sings<br>
  praise to Russian arms traders.<br>
 The righteous wrath over the prospect that the SAM complexes will<br>
 necessarily disturb the balance of forces in Cyprus means that our<br>
 weapons have not only gained a good and firm foothold on the world<br>
 arms market, but have also gradually turned into a real threat for<br>
 the western arms market, including the U.S. market. The fact is that<br>
 the current contract with Cyprus is not the first in the history of<br>
 Russian-Cypriot trade relations.  Approximately a year ago<br>
 Rosvooruzheniye [state company for the export and import of arms and<br>
 military equipment] sold to the island a substantial amount of armor,<br>
 including BMP-3 armored vehicles and T-80U tanks.  The Americans<br>
 missed the contract, but when they woke up, it was too late:  They<br>
 failed to prevent the appearance of Russian armor on Cyprus.  As a<br>
 result the military attache of the U.S. Embassy had to leave Cyprus: <br>
 The appropriate services apparently deemed his slip unpardonable. As<br>
 concerns the latest "SAM" contract, our western competitors learned<br>
 about it in good time and immediately tried to scuttle it.  In<br>
 mid-December Cyprus was visited by British Foreign Secretary Rifkind,<br>
 who thoroughly tried to persuade the government to give up the deal. <br>
 In late December Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Chiller came to<br>
 Moscow.  She tried to work on the Russian side but to no avail<br>
 either.  All the efforts proved futile, and on 4 January the<br>
 multi-million contract for the delivery of S-300's was signed. True,<br>
 not everything has yet been lost for the Americans because before the<br>
 contract takes effect it is to be confirmed by a session of the<br>
 Cypriot parliament.  It is quite possible that such a strong pressure<br>
 will be exerted on the lawmakers that they will give in, respond to<br>
 the appeals "not to disturb the balance of forces," and the contract<br>
 will not be ratified. Rosvooruzheniye, whose hyperactivity brought<br>
 about the entire scandal, refuses to comment on it because "the whole<br>
 story from a purely commercial turned into a purely political one." <br>
 The only thing that we managed to learn from company experts is that<br>
 U.S. Patriot complexes (analogues of our S-300's) are obviously<br>
 inferior to the Russian systems on many characteristics, and if the<br>
 Americans do not stop the realization of the contract now, soon our<br>
 SAM complexes will naturally begin to squeeze U.S. products from the<br>
 "Mediterranean" market.<br>
(end)<br>

Nezavisimaya Gazeta 9 January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Igor Korotchenko:  "It Will Be Safer on Cyprus"<br>
<p>
  Turkey's demarche is not going to change Moscow's principled<br>
  approach to expanding military-technical cooperation between Russia<br>
  and Cyprus, NG was advised at the Rosvooruzheniye state company.  As<br>
  we know, a contract signed in Nicosia 4 January 1997 calls for the<br>
  delivery to Cyprus a batch of mobile S-300 PMU-1 antiaircraft<br>
  missile systems which has sparked Ankara's extremely negative<br>
  reaction.  The S-300 PMU-1 is capable of effectively engaging<br>
  high-speed aerodynamic and ballistic targets up to 100 and 40<br>
  kilometers away and at corresponding altitudes of between 50 meters<br>
  to 25 kilometers.  It takes not more than five minutes to deploy the<br>
  antiaircraft missile system.<br>
 The Rosvooruzheniye state company delivered to Cyprus earlier T-80U<br>
 tanks and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles.  Nicosia has signed the<br>
 C-300 PMU-1 contract despite unprecedented pressure from major<br>
 Western countries.  For example, the island was visited for this<br>
 purpose by a British government delegation led by Secretary of State<br>
 for Foreign Affairs Malcolm Rifkind in December 1996.  The United<br>
 States military attache accredited in Cyprus was relieved of his<br>
 position by the Pentagon for ineffective work to prevent the signing<br>
 of this contract.<br>

     ALBRIGHT CALLS FOR LIFTING OF SECTION 907<br>
     <br>
     WASHINGTON, D.C. _ In her testimony before the Senate Foreign <br>
     Relations Committee, January 8, Secretary of State-designate Madeleine <br>
     Albright called for the lifting of the prohibition on <br>
     government-to-government aid to Azerbaijan, known as Section 907 of <br>
     the Freedom Support Act.  Below are her comments on this subject made <br>
     at her confirmation hearing:<br>
     "Another dispute tangled by history and geography concerns Armenia, <br>
     Azerbaijan and the status of Nagorno Karabagh.  The good news here is <br>
     that the cease-fire has now held for more than two years.  The bad <br>
     news is that progress under the O.S.C.E.'s Minsk process has been <br>
     agonizingly slow.  We have very substantial economic, political and <br>
     humanitarian interests in this region, and are prepared to play a more <br>
     visible role in helping to arrange a settlement.  One step that <br>
     Congress could take to increase our influence would be to lift <br>
     restrictions on nonmilitary assistance to Azerbaijan, while <br>
     maintaining support for our generous aid program in Armenia."<br>
     <br>
        Armenian Assembly of America Executive Director Ross Vartian <br>
     reacted to the statement:  "The prohibition on non-military <br>
     government-to-government aid to Azerbaijan is a principled response to <br>
     that country's illegal, six-year blockade of Armenia and Nagorno <br>
     Karabagh.  We are deeply distressed that the Clinton administration <br>
     has once again called for the lifting of Section 907, while failing to <br>
     address the serious humanitarian needs of Armenians in Nagorno <br>
     Karabagh.  We hope the administration responds to a January 7 <br>
     community-wide request to meet with the president, to discuss how U.S. <br>
     impartiality can be restored in negotiations to peacefully resolve the <br>
     Karabagh conflict."                The Armenian Assembly is a <br>
     nationwide nonprofit organization which promotes public understanding <br>
     and awareness of Armenian issues.<br>

TURKEY IS BUYING MISSILES<br>
<p>
By Alexander Reutov<br>
<p>
Confrontation<br>
<p>
Defense News, an American magazine, has reported recently that Turkey<br>
intends to purchase 18 Hawk missile systems of the ground-to-air class in<br>
Belgium and the Netherlands. France is said to be a go-between in this deal.<br>
This information was confirmed by an official spokesman of the Ministry of<br>
National Defense of Belgium who stated that such negotiations were indeed<br>
under way. Moreover, he opined that negotiations would be completed in the<br>
next couple of weeks.<br>
<p>
American Hawk class missiles were delivered to some NATO countries until<br>
recently. Now these countries need to get rid of them as they no longer meet<br>
modern standards. Turkey's intentions to purchase anti-aircraft systems was<br>
rather timely. The cost of the deal is estimated at $150 million. The cost<br>
includes expenses on modernization of the systems by a French company<br>
Thomson. The obsolete systems will require modernization of means of<br>
electronic security and targeting. It is planned that 10 systems each with 3<br>
missile launching capacity equipped with radars will be sold Belgium, and<br>
the remaining eight by the Netherlands. Turkey will be paying through a<br>
credit provided by France.<br>
<p>
It is noteworthy that this information is disclosed now that Ankara is<br>
making decisive protests against Russian-Cypriot deal on AA S-300 PMU-1<br>
systems. The Turkish leadership thinks that it is an offensive weapon and<br>
presents threat to the security of Turkey. According to Minister of Defense<br>
of Turkey Turhan Tayan (AM:transliterated from Russian) S-300 will enable<br>
armed forces of Cyprus to destroy targets on the southern shore of Turkey.<br>
He also stated that Ankara may be forced to repeat the scenario of 1974 when<br>
the Turkish army occupied the northern part of Cyprus. Now he is speaking<br>
about the southern part of the island populated by Greeks.             <br>
<p>
Situation in that part of the world is rather heated. Russia played a role<br>
in that by providing Cyprus with several dozens of modern tanks T-80U and<br>
armored personnel carriers BMP-3 which, according to the Cypriot leadership,<br>
are deployed to deter the 30 thousand strong Turkish expeditionary corps in<br>
the northern part of the island. Nonetheless it is difficult to imagine that<br>
the sides will end up in another military clash. Senior NATO brothers will<br>
do everything in their power to prevent the confrontation of Turkey and<br>
Greece, two NATO member countries. Last year Athens and Ankara were on the<br>
verge of a head on clash for a small uninhabited island which both countries<br>
claim to be theirs.  Then too passions were running high in both capitals,<br>
but the clash was prevented due to the pressure on them by NATO partners. (end) <br>

<p>
1. HAKOBIAN MEETS WITH US REPS.<br>
YEREVAN-Armenian Revolutionary Federation Executive Council <br>
of Armenia member Rouben Hakobian met with US Embassy <br>
representatives Susan Thornton and David Franzin Wednesday <br>
afternoon following his meeting with Justice Minister Marat <br>
Alexanian.<br>
	At the request of the US Embassy, Hakobian briefed the <br>
officials on his earlier meeting at the Justice Ministry to <br>
discuss the reinstatement of the ARF in Armenia, which has <br>
been banned since Dec. 28, 1994.<br>
	Hakobian and the embassy officials also discussed the <br>
National Accords future projects and the domestic political <br>
climate.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. FRANCE SUPPORTS AZERBAIJAN'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY<br>
PARIS-The Karabakh conflict must be resolved quickly and <br>
peacefully without compromising the territorial integrity of <br>
Azerbaijan or undermining the autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh, <br>
the press secretary of the newly-elected French co-chairman <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <br>
Minsk Group, Jacques Blott, told a Radio Liberty <br>
correspondent Thursday.<br>
	De Trio said France has always been interested in <br>
resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, and has actively <br>
pursued avenues to that end. The French Foreign Minister <br>
visited the region two months ago to hold high-level talks <br>
on stability and conflict resolution, he said.<br>
	There are already key principles that the OSCE membership <br>
has agreed upon regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, De Trio said, <br>
adding that a compromise is necessary between the sides to <br>
the conflict and the members of the mediating group in order <br>
to get out of the current stalemate in negotiations.<br>
	"However, it is too early to speak of a new settlement," <br>
De Trio told Radio Liberty, "but we must make sure that the <br>
talks continue."<br>
	Responding to whether Karabakh should be included in <br>
reaching a compromise solution, De Trio said, "We are not <br>
alone at the negotiations. We must not forget Russias co-<br>
chairmanship or the participation of the other members."<br>
<p>
<p>
3. DECISION ON ARF REINSTATEMENT EXPECTED<br>
YEREVAN-Armenias Justice Ministry was expected to announce <br>
its decision on the reinstatement of the Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation in Armenia on Friday.<br>
	Representatives of the ARF Executive Council in Armenia <br>
Rouben Hakobian, Gagik Mkrtchian and Roland Sharoyan met <br>
with Minister Marat Alexanian on Tuesday and Wednesday to <br>
discuss the request filed with the ministry by the Executive <br>
Council in August 1996.<br>
	The media had also been invited to attend the Wednesday <br>
session, during which Hakobian expressed disappointment <br>
regarding inconsistencies in Armenian law.<br>
	Minister Alexanian said Tuesday that the documents <br>
filed by the Executive Council were not sufficient to lift <br>
the ban on activities of the ARF in Armenia.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. AN OPENING ON KARABAKH?<br>
BY PAUL GOBLE<br>
<i>&gt;From Radio Liberty</i><br>
PRAGUE-The decision of the Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe on Tuesday to name France rather than <br>
the United States as the new co-chairman of talks on the <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute could provide an opening for <br>
progress on the long-deadlocked talks on the status of that <br>
disputed territory.<br>
	That cautious conclusion reflects three things: the <br>
problems that a joint Russian-American chairmanship would <br>
have created, the current state of play of the conflict <br>
itself, and the possibility that France may be able to <br>
introduce some new elements into the talks.<br>
	Had the United States succeeded Finland as co-chairman-and <br>
American diplomats actively campaigned for the <br>
position-Washington would have had to find a modus vivendi <br>
with Moscow, the other co-chairman of the OSCE-organized <br>
negotiations. <br>
	To the extent that Moscow and Washington were prepared to <br>
act together, they might have been able to impose a <br>
settlement on the long-simmering conflict. But there are <br>
several reasons why their joint leadership of the talks <br>
would have been more likely to lead to further deadlock than <br>
to a resolution.<br>
	On the one hand, even though Washington and Moscow are <br>
committed to the three OSCE principles on the resolution of <br>
the conflict-territorial integrity, self-determination for <br>
Karabakh within Azerbaijan, and international protections <br>
for ethnic Armenians living there-the two powers have very <br>
different agendas for the region as a whole.<br>
	And by introducing the Iranian element into the talks at <br>
least behind the scenes and thus seeking to establish a new <br>
balance of forces in the post-Soviet Caucasus, France might <br>
be able to move them off dead center, albeit at a price some <br>
in Washington and elsewhere might see as too high.<br>
	Unfortunately, there is also the all too real possibility <br>
that precisely these apparent prospects for peace may re-<br>
energize those in the region who benefit from conflict or <br>
the current standoff. And these forces could block any <br>
progress in the talks or even seek to create conditions <br>
leading to a resumption of the fighting.<br>

5. ANCA RENEWS CALL FOR PRINCETON TO REMOVE HEATH LOWRY<br>
WATERTOWN, Mass.-The Armenian National Committee of America <br>
Eastern Region has renewed its call for Princeton University <br>
to remove Professor Heath Lowry as Ataturk Chair of Turkish <br>
Studies, and for the schools administration to conduct a <br>
thorough review of the hiring practices which led to Lowrys <br>
selection to this post.<br>
	Lowrys controversial tenure at Princeton was highlighted <br>
in a front page article in the Dec. 9 issue of the New York <br>
Times.<br>
	The article, entitled "Donations to Universities Sometimes <br>
Carry a Price," stated that "At Princeton University, the <br>
controversy this year was over the endowment of a chair in <br>
Turkish studies that some scholars feared could be used by <br>
the government of Turkey to whitewash its role in the <br>
massacre of a million Armenians in World War I."<br>
	The Turkish government has provided more than $750,000 to <br>
endow the Princeton chair.<br>
	Earlier this year, a group of prominent scholars and <br>
leading academics issued a petition condemning efforts by <br>
the Turkish government to discredit scholarship on the <br>
Armenian Genocide and specifically cited Professor Lowry for <br>
his unethical campaign to deny this crime against humanity.<br>
	The statement read, in part, "Scholars who deny genocide <br>
lend their considerable authority to the acceptance of this <br>
ultimate human crime."<br>
	The statement, which was initiated by Colgate University <br>
professor Peter Balakian, was signed by distinguished <br>
scholars Deborah Lipstadt and Robert Jay Lifton and authors <br>
Norman Mailer and Arthur Miller, among many others.<br>
	The controversy surrounding Prof. Lowry was reported at <br>
length by the New York Times in a May 22, 1996 article, <br>
entitled, "Princeton is Accused of Fronting for the Turkish <br>
Government."<br>
	In that article, the New York Times reported that Lowry, <br>
who had previously worked at the Turkish government funded <br>
Institute for Turkish Studies, had been accused of creating <br>
a "center for propaganda about Turkeys role in the massacre <br>
of a million Armenians during World War I."<br>
	Additional stories appeared in the Boston Globe, the <br>
Bergen Record and the Chronicle for Higher Education. A <br>
comprehensive account of Lowrys revisionist activities was <br>
published by the Journal for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.<br>
	"We seek to highlight the circumstances which led to the <br>
hiring of a confirmed Genocide revisionist by Princeton <br>
University," said ANC-ER chairman Harry Derderian. <br>
"Professor Lowrys record of unethical conduct is clearly <br>
apparent, as are the links between his hiring and the <br>
$750,000 in donations provided to Princeton by his past <br>
employer, the government of Turkey."<br>
	"Princeton University needs to answer a number of <br>
extremely troubling questions about its hiring practices, <br>
not just to the Armenian-American community but to the <br>
academic community at-large," continued Derderian.<br>
	Last year the ANCA-ER issued a statement which documented <br>
Professor Lowrys unethical conduct, including his past work <br>
for the Turkish government. That statement read in part, <br>
"His service to the Turkish government was revealed, by <br>
accident, in private correspondence between Lowry and <br>
Turkish Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir. These letters, which <br>
were published in the Journal of Genocide and Holocaust <br>
Studies, revealed that Lowry actively conspired with the <br>
Turkish Embassy to discredit scholarship which mentions the <br>
Armenian Genocide. His activity in this area alone should <br>
serve as sufficient cause for Princeton University to <br>
disassociate itself with Dr. Lowry and his brand of false <br>
scholarship."<br>
<p>
<p>
6. INCREASE IN STATE BUDGET EXPECTED<br>
YEREVAN (Azg)-Armenias Minister of Finance, Levon <br>
Barkhoudarian, said that, according to a revised state <br>
budget for 1997, a 31 percent increase is expected when <br>
compared to last years budget.<br>
	Barkhoudarian said that the same deficiency as last year <br>
is expected in 1997 when considering a six percent increase <br>
of the Gross National Product.<br>
	The first version of the budget, proposed in November, <br>
provided for a 40 percent increase in income, which the <br>
Central Bank considered unreal.<br>
	Barkhoudarian said that the income of the state budget for <br>
1996 was implemented by 96-97 percent. At the same time, 8.7 <br>
percent inflation was reported, instead of the expected 14 <br>
percent. The inflation rate will probably be within 9.5-10.5 <br>
percent range in 1997.<br>
	A $250 million income is expected in 1997, with $326 <br>
million in expenses. The money will mainly be used for the <br>
development of the social sphere and particularly <br>
healthcare. A 31 percent increase of wages is expected in <br>
the coming year. Salaries of teachers will increase by 30 <br>
percent. The minister said that the increase of income will <br>
mainly be provided by taxes. It is expected that the income <br>
tax payments will increase by 30 percent as a result of the <br>
changes in the taxation system.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. ARMENIA PARTICIPATES IN COMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS<br>
YEREVAN (Lragir, Noyan Tapan)-According to a spokesperson <br>
for Armenias Ministry of Communications, Noune Ohanian, <br>
Armenia participated in two international projects on the <br>
development of telephone communications, Trans-Asia-Europe <br>
and BSFOCS-a fiber optic line connecting the cities of Poti, <br>
Odessa and Varna.<br>
	The TAE program will establish direct telephone <br>
communications with all Asian republics of the former USSR <br>
along with China and Iran. A fiber optic line will be laid <br>
out connecting Yerevan, through Meghri, to Marand, Iran. The <br>
construction of the line will be financed by the Greek OTF <br>
company.<br>
	The BSFOCS program will help to improve telephone <br>
communications with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the <br>
Baltic states and Eastern Europe.<br>
	Ohanian said that the Ministry of Communications is <br>
currently in negotiations with the Danish Grestnordic <br>
company to help finance the construction.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. RUSSIA WANTS JOINT DECISION-MAKING WITH NATO<br>
MOSCOW (Reuter)-Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov <br>
urged NATO on Wednesday to step up efforts to work out a <br>
special relationship with Moscow and set out Russian demands <br>
for the right to joint decision-making on some issues.<br>
	Primakov told Itar-Tass news agency in an interview that <br>
Russia remained firmly opposed to the Western alliances <br>
plans to expand eastwards.<br>
	But, indicating there was still some room for maneuver, he <br>
made clear that some of its fears would be eased if a new <br>
deal was reached governing conventional arms and a mechanism <br>
was created to make joint decisions on issues involving <br>
Russia.<br>
	Primakov said NATO had made some efforts to address <br>
Russias concerns and work out a special relationship, but <br>
they had not gone far enough.<br>
	"They are steps in the right direction, but they are <br>
partial and insufficient, he told Tass.<br>
	Russia says NATOs enlargement to take in former members <br>
of the Soviet bloc countries would threaten its security and <br>
create new divisions in Europe.<br>
	NATO is expected to issue invitations to some countries in <br>
June. Diplomats say Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic <br>
will probably all be members by 1999 and that Russia is <br>
seeking as many concessions as possible before enlargement <br>
goes ahead.<br>
	Primakov said Moscow would measure the seriousness of <br>
NATOs proposal to work out a special relationship with <br>
Russia by the progress made in renegotiating limits <br>
governing non-nuclear arms under the Conventional Forces in <br>
Europe treaty.<br>
	"If we manage to reach agreement on the modernization of <br>
CFE in order to dispel our concerns about a possible <br>
advancement of NATOs military infrastructure and to create <br>
a mechanism for making joint decisions with NATO concerning <br>
Russias vital interests and other issues, we will sign the <br>
appropriate document (on a special relationship), he said.<br>
	"The main indicator of the seriousness of our partners <br>
intentions will be...first of all, NATOs willingness to <br>
take into account our concerns at the talks on adjustments <br>
to the CFE treaty.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. BAKU, MOSCOW CALL FOR EXPANDED RELATIONS <br>
BAKU (Itar-Tass)-Azeri Prime Minister Artur Rasizade and <br>
visiting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov said on <br>
Monday that the two countries would strengthen cooperation <br>
both within the guidelines of the Commonwealth of <br>
Independent States and on a bilateral basis.<br>
	The state of bilateral relations does not correspond with <br>
Azerbaijans and Russias national interests and needs to be <br>
improved, Rasizade and Serov said, adding that trade <br>
cooperation should be boosted.<br>
	Serov said a "good team" was accompanying him to help <br>
solve problems  which had come afloat after the breakup of <br>
the Soviet Union. The Russian delegation included diplomats, <br>
border guards, military men, as well as transport, <br>
communications and oil industry officials.<br>
	The issue of limited transport communications between the <br>
two countries is a major problem which will be discussed at <br>
the talks. The limits were imposed by Russia about two years <br>
ago because of the events in Chechnya.<br>
	The Russian side also intends to restore railway <br>
communications between the station of Culfa in Nakhichevan <br>
and stations in Armenia and Iran. The sides may discuss the <br>
transit of Azerbaijani oil through the Russian territory.<br>
	During his meeting with Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev, <br>
Serov called for an increase in bilateral trade, which is <br>
presently only 10 percent of the 1991 level.<br>
	Aliyev and Serov also discussed the restoration of <br>
transport communications between the two countries.<br>
	There is no need to set up enterprises or industries <br>
making the same goods in the two countries, Aliyev said, <br>
adding that Azerbaijan was ready to supply Russia with oil-<br>
producing equipment, petroleum products, vegetables, cotton, <br>
wine and receive goods which were not produced in the <br>
republic in return.<br>
	The development of bilateral economic cooperation will <br>
serve the interests of both nations, Aliyev and Serov said.<br>
	According to them, Azerbaijan and Russia have similar <br>
viewpoints on cooperation both within the guidelines of the <br>
CIS and on a bilateral basis.<br>
	What is important now is to pass from declarations to <br>
action, they said. Aliyev described as an economically <br>
important step the operation of a 1411 km-long pipeline from <br>
Baku to Novorossiisk, which is ready to transport Azeri oil <br>
to international markets.<br>
	Both sides supported attempts to reach peace and stability <br>
in the Caucasus including a peaceful resolution of the <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. They expressed hope that 1997 <br>
might be a year of major breakthroughs in Azerbaijani-<br>
Russian relations.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. DENMARK PROTESTS OVER TURKEY TORTURE<br>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Denmark has complained to the European <br>
Commission of Human Rights about reports of torture of a <br>
Danish citizen of Kurdish origin in custody in Turkey last <br>
year, the Turkish foreign ministry said on Wednesday.<br>
	Danish officials applied on Tuesday on behalf of Kemal <br>
Koc, a naturalized Dane charged in July with giving economic <br>
support from Denmark to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).<br>
	Turkey said the Danish complaint was the first time one <br>
country had taken another to the commission on behalf of an <br>
individual. Ankara protested at the Danish governments <br>
action.<br>
	"This decision goes against the well-intentioned efforts <br>
and the cooperative understanding shown by Turkey in trying <br>
to shed light on the claims in this application, foreign <br>
ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters.<br>
	The Danish Embassy confirmed that Copenhagen had <br>
complained to the commission, which screens possible cases <br>
for the European Court of Human Rights.<br>
	Koc was expelled from Turkey but a trial against him for <br>
links to the PKK is continuing. Turkish police also <br>
detained, fined and expelled a member of the Danish <br>
parliament sent to observe the trial.<br>
	Turkey is often under fire from Europe for its human <br>
rights record.<br>
	Spokesman Akbel said the Danish move was unfair because <br>
legal action in the case was still continuing in Turkey.<br>
	"This application does not obey the condition of waiting <br>
until Turkish domestic legal processes have been exhausted <br>
and is contrary to the European human rights agreement and <br>
the universal rules of international law, Akbel said.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 6, Part I, 9 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN HOSPITALIZED AGAIN. President Boris Yeltsin was taken to the
Central Clinical Hospital with symptoms of pneumonia in the evening of 8
January, Russian media reported. Yeltsin's surgeon Renat Akchurin said
the current illness has no connection to the president's 5 November
heart surgery. The Kremlin continued to downplay Yeltsin's condition by
quoting American doctor Michael DeBakey to the effect that Yeltsin will
be better in a week. Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin for the first time
following his surgery on 23 December. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
decided to begin a one-week vacation despite the president's illness.
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits was also
hospitalized right after the 8 January government session with flu
symptoms. -- Anna Paretskaya in Moscow
<p>
REACTION TO YELTSIN ILLNESS. While presidential aides tried to minimize
the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness, former Security Council Secretary
Aleksandr Lebed saw the latest events as more proof that the president
should step down for the good of the country. Lebed told Ekho Moskvy on
8 January, "Our country is headed by a very sick and elderly man. He
needs to retire, since he can neither govern due to the state of his
health nor lead a normal life." Lebed and Communist Party leader
Gennadii Zyuganov, who would be among the leading contenders should an
early presidential election become necessary, have frequently expressed
doubt that Yeltsin is well enough to run Russia and have called for him
to resign (see OMRI Daily Digest, 30 December 1996). -- Laura Belin
<p>
PREPARATIONS ADVANCE FOR CHECHEN ELECTIONS. OSCE mission chief Tim
Guldimann said that the U.S. and EU have raised some $350,000 to finance
the 27 January Chechen elections, NTV reported on 8 January, while
Russian TV (RTR) noted that they have turned down offers of
organizational and financial help from the Russian Central Electoral
Commission. Momadi Saidaev, the head of the Chechen Electoral
Commission, said they expect 70 OSCE observers. Guldimann said "there is
a good chance that these elections will be free, fair, and democratic,"
despite the limited opportunities for refugees to vote, Ekho Moskvy
reported. Ruslan Kutaev, Chechen minister for CIS affairs, said that it
is now likely that Chechens living outside the republic will have to
travel back to vote, and voting facilities will not be arranged in
Dagestan and Ingushetiya. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
NEW CHECHEN PROCURATOR. The Chechen administration has appointed
Khavazha Sergbiev Procurator General of the republic without consulting
Moscow, NTV noted on 8 January. Russian Procurator General Yurii
Skuratov commented that while they want to cooperate with the Chechen
authorities, the appointment violates Russian law since procurators must
be nominated by Moscow. On 7 January RIA Novosti quoted Sergbiev as
saying that the 1995 raid on Budennovsk, led by presidential candidate
Shamil Basaev, was not a terrorist act but was intended to bring about
peace. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
PRIMAKOV REVIEWS FOREIGN POLICY IN 1996 . . . In an interview with ITAR-
TASS on 8 January marking his first year as foreign minister, Yevgenii
Primakov emphasized that domestic factors drive current Russian foreign
policy, saying its principal goal remains the creation of international
conditions which facilitate internal democratization and economic
reform. Moscow aims for "equal partnership" with its partners around the
globe, he added, emphasizing that he wanted to steer a middle course
between the extremes of Soviet-style anti-Westernism and what he termed
the romantic pro-Western approach of his predecessor, Andrei Kozyrev.
Using a favorite theme, he said the emerging multipolar world order gave
Russian diplomacy room for maneuver, and he lauded Russian successes
during 1996 in building ties with China and pushing forward with CIS
integration. But he also admitted that Russia's economic and military
problems often undermine its international position. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
. . . AND LINKS CFE REVISION TO RUSSIA-NATO CHARTER. Primakov cited the
December 1996 NATO statement that the alliance has no intention of
deploying nuclear weapons in new East European members as evidence that
firm Russian opposition to NATO expansion was delivering results. He
described the pledge as "insufficient," however, adding that Russia
would use NATO's approach to planned talks on revising the 1990
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty to evaluate whether the
alliance was serious about negotiating a substantive Russia-NATO
charter. Hinting that Moscow wants the revised CFE treaty to strictly
limit NATO deployments, Primakov said it could serve as the basis for
"mutual security," and address Russian concerns about the eastward
expansion of NATO military infrastructure. He also insisted that any
charter provide for joint decision-making on important issues,
presumably including NATO enlargement. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SLAM WESTERN OBJECTIONS TO CYPRUS MISSILE DEAL. A wide
range of Russian officials and parliamentarians condemned Western
criticism of the recently announced Russian sale of air defense missiles
to Greek-controlled Cyprus on 8 January, Russian and Western media
reported. Expressing the most common viewpoint, Duma Defense Committee
Chairman Lev Rokhlin said the criticism stems from Western efforts to
"oust Russia from the world arms market." Denying that the sale would
jeopardize peace on Cyprus, foreign policy analyst and presidential
council member Sergei Karaganov said the Western reaction to the sale
reflected the "dishonest" competitive tactics used by Western
governments in the struggle for weapons contracts. Gennadii Khormov, a
Ministry of Defense Industry official, told ITAR-TASS the vocal American
objections aimed to deflect attention from Washington's intention to
violate the 1972 ABM treaty. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
ST. PETERSBURG READIES FOR OLYMPIC BID. Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin on 8 January held a meeting of the organizing committee to
prepare St. Petersburg's bid to host the 2004 summer Olympics. Eleven
cities are participating in the first round of bidding on 7 March which
will reduce the list to five, with the final selection to be announced
in September. The cost for the city to hold the games is estimated at
$2.2 billion, with proceeds in the $2-3 billion range, RIA Novosti
reported. St. Petersburg Governor Vladimir Yakovlev said that the
federal government promised to provide full organizational and financial
support. The 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg were marred by an
algae-infested swimming pool and low attendance. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CHARGES GEORGIAN DIPLOMAT. The U.S. State
Department has formally requested Georgia to waive immunity for diplomat
Georgi Makharadze, who was involved in a car accident in which an
American girl died (see OMRI Daily Digest, 7 January 1997), ITAR-TASS
and AFP reported on 9 January. The move follows a letter to the State
Department from the U.S. attorney's office that says there is "enough
evidence" of Makharadze's guilt to press charges against him. The last
time diplomatic immunity was waived in such a serious case was that of a
Belgian diplomat in 1989. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
ALIEV ON GEORGIA. Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Ukleba held
talks in Baku with Azerbaijani President Haidar Aliev on 8 January,
RFE/RL reported the same day. Aliev, who termed Georgia a strategic
ally, declared Baku's full support for Tbilisi's position on Abkhazia,
noting that Azerbaijan opposes separatism, aggression, ethnic cleansing,
and instability. It appears Georgia is seeking Azerbaijani backing to
push for a toughened stance on Abkhazia among CIS states in advance of
the 17 January CIS summit in Moscow. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
DASHNAK LEADERS MEET WITH ARMENIAN JUSTICE MINISTER. During a meeting
with leaders of the banned Dashnak party (HHD), Armenian Justice
Minister Marat Aleksanyan said that documents submitted by the HHD are
"not sufficient" for the party to be legalized, Noyan Tapan reported on
8 January. Ruben Hakobyan, a HHD leader, complained that the authorities
have not specified the steps that his party should take in order to
resume its activities. The meeting comes amid speculation that the party
might soon be legalized following a 10 December court verdict that found
no connection between the HHD and the alleged terrorist group Dro. The
HHD's activities in Armenia were suspended in January 1995 by the
Supreme Court on the grounds that it violated Armenian law on political
parties by having foreign members. In a bid to overcome the legal
deadlock, the HHD in November 1995 made significant changes in its
structure, granting its Armenia organization a substantial degree of
autonomy. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
FIGHTING BREAKS OUT IN TURSUN ZADE. Despite a presidential order to
withdraw his forces from the Tursun Zade area, elements of Col. Mahmud
Khudaberdiyev's First Brigade attacked outlaw forces in the city on 8
January, international media reported. Khudaberdiyev had moved his force
close to the city claiming that Tursun Zade's criminal band, loyal to
former Popular Front commander Kadyr Abdullayev, raided the First
Brigade's headquarters on 29 December to steal weapons, in the process
killing one officer. Khudaberdiyev said the attack was sparked by the
government's refusal to do anything about the situation. He is demanding
Abdullayev return the weapons and vacate the city. Efforts by the Tajik
government, Russian forces in Tajikistan, and the UN observer mission to
mediate the isolated conflict have not met with any success. Both
government and opposition representatives say the fighting in Tursun
Zade will not have an impact on peace talks being held in Tehran. --

TURGUNALIYEV FOUND GUILTY. A Bishkek municipal court on 8 January found
Topchubek Turgunaliyev, the chairman of the Erkin Kyrgyzstan Party,
guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to 10 years in prison and
confiscation of all his property, RFE/RL reported. Co-defendant Timur
Stamkulov received a six-year sentence but his property will not be
confiscated. The charges stem from a 1994 incident when Turgunaliyev was
the rector of Bishkek's Humanitarian University and approved a request
by Stamkulov, then the deputy director of the university, to withdraw
$10,000 from university funds. Stamkulov claims he was robbed and lost
all the money, but he still returned $2,300 and later attempted to
return an additional $3,000, which the university refused to accept.
Lawyers for Turgunaliyev and Stamkulov have claimed from the beginning
of the trial that it was politically motivated. -- Bruce Pannier and
Naryn Idinov

UZBEK GAS-CHEMICALS COMPLEX. A foreign consortium will help develop a
chemical complex, with an estimated value of $1 billion, in Uzbekistan's
Kashgadarya province, according to a 6 January report in Rossiiskaya
Gazeta monitored by the BBC. The paper, citing sources in Uzbekneftgaz,
noted the complex will be built by a consortium comprising three
subsidiaries of the Swiss-Swedish ABB group, Japan's Mitsui, and Nissho
Iwai. The complex at the Shurtan gas-condensate field is to produce
125,000 metric tons of polyethelene, 137,000 metric tons of liquefied
gas, and 37,000 metric tons of unstable condensate. It is estimated $600
million will be spent on the technological side of the project and $400
million on construction to be carried out by Uzbek contractors. --

WORLD BANK PROTESTS CORRUPTION IN UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT. World Bank
President James Wolfenson sent a letter to President Leonid Kuchma at
the beginning of the year criticizing corruption within the Ukrainian
government, Ukrainian Radio reported on 8 January. The same day, Deputy
Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk admitted that the problem of government
corruption exists, noting that international criticism has begun because
of increased foreign investment in the country. He said budgetary laws
currently under review would limit the opportunities for corruption in
the government. He also called for the implementation of tax reform. --

HUNGARY, TURKEY SIGN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. Industry and Trade Minister
Szabolcs Fazakas and Turkish state minister Ayfer Yilmaz signed a free
trade agreement in Budapest on 8 January, Hungarian media reported. The
accord abolishes import duties on 90% of Hungarian industrial products
shipped to Turkey. It also stipulates that import duties on Turkish
products entering Hungary are to be gradually phased out by 2001. The
agreement does not apply to agricultural goods, for which preferential
duties have been set. Yilmaz noted that Hungary is the first East
European state with which Turkey has concluded a free trade agreement.

SERBIAN GOVERNMENT CONCEDES LOSS OF NIS. Official Serbian media on 8
January ran a statement from the Ministry of Justice admitting that the
opposition Zajedno coalition won control of the city council in the 17
November local elections. Nis is Serbia's second largest city, and the
statement is a major concession from the authorities. But Zajedno says
it will keep up its protests until the authorities restore all its
election victories. The current wave of demonstrations began in Nis,
where a local government-run radio station had self-confidently carried
live coverage of the election returns. Listeners were able to hear from
regime journalists themselves how the opposition was winning in precinct
after precinct. Also in Nis, army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic
visited the 63rd Parachute Brigade, Nasa Borba reported on 9 January.
The elite unit has allied itself with the protests, but the army said
there was no political purpose to the "routine" visit. -- Patrick Moore

CHAOTIC PROTESTS IN BELGRADE. The opposition launched a campaign on 8
January to paralyze the government by blocking its telephones, RFE/RL
reported. Meanwhile, slow-moving or supposedly broken-down cars blocked
traffic, while some 50,000 demonstrators converged on central Belgrade
to surround riot police. Zajedno leader Vuk Draskovic moved about in a
van with a loudspeaker to address the police, whom he is trying to win
over. He told them: "It is only a matter of a few days now, our brother
policemen. The ruling powers will go," AFP quoted him as saying. --

FRESH SPECULATION OVER TUDJMAN'S HEALTH. Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman has disappeared from public view, which has revived speculation
that he may not have long to live, RFE/RL reported on 8 January. He
spent a week at Washington's prestigious Walter Reed Army Hospital in
November, when U.S. sources told the media that Tudjman has inoperable
stomach cancer and at most a year to live. Croatian spokesmen downplayed
the reports, saying that he was treated for an ulcer, but the
government's secretiveness only served to heighten suspicions that
Tudjman is seriously ill. The normally publicity-minded president was
last seen on government television at New Year's, looking "pale and
gaunt," Reuters wrote. His office says only that "the president is in
the country and performing his duties." Tudjman's next scheduled public
appearance is in mid-January, when he is scheduled to receive the
diplomatic corps. The speculation over Tudjman's health coincides with
reports that he plans to turn over some of his duties to parliament,
where his party has a majority. -- Patrick Moore

ARMENIA TO TAKE MEASURES TO <br>
CANCEL DEATH PUNISHMENT<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 8 (Noyan Tapan). At a recent meeting in<br>
Yerevan between Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian and<br>
deputy of Swiss parliament, head of Swiss delegation to the<br>
Council of Europe Ernst Muleman the two mainly discussed the<br>
problem of Armenia's affiliation to the Council of Europe.<br>
Mr.Muleman said that in the near future two delegations will<br>
visit Armenia to find out whether Armenia's legislation meets<br>
Council of Europe's requirements, presidential spokesman Levon<br>
Zourabian said at a Wednesday briefing. Armenian President<br>
voiced willingness to reconsider all those normative acts that<br>
does not meet the requirements of the Council of Europe.<br>
     According to Levon Zourabian, as for the death punishment<br>
Levon Ter-Petrossian informed the guest that "since the time<br>
when democratic forces came to power no capital punishment has<br>
been executed". It was noted that the Armenian Constitution<br>
envisages cancellation of the death punishment and "in the near<br>
future the process of adoption of a relevant decision will be<br>
initiated".<br>
     Presidential spokesman noted that Armenia attaches much<br>
importance to the integration to the european structures, as<br>
well as involvement of the neighboring newly-born states into<br>
these structures. According to him, that will create new<br>
responsibilities and mutual obligations to promote the<br>
development of cooperation and democracy in the Caucasus and<br>
strengthen the stability.<br>
     "We are confident that affiliation to the Council of Europe<br>
will become an additional stimulus for Armenia to develop into a<br>
democratic and lawful state, and will help to raise the level of<br>
human rights protection and development of democratic<br>
establishments", Levon Zourabian said.<br>

ARMENIA WAS POSITIVE TOWARD EVERY <br>
CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE POST <br>
OF OSCE MINSK GROUP CO-CHAIRMAN<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 8 (Noyan Tapan). Armenia had a positive<br>
stance toward candidacies of Germany, France and USA running for<br>
the post of OSCE Minsk Group co-Chairman, Presidential Spokesman<br>
Levon Zourabian said at a briefing on Wednesday.<br>
     As was reported, OSCE managing Chairman, Swiss Foreign<br>
Minister Flavio Conti took a decision to appoint France<br>
co-Chairman of the OSCE Minsk Group.<br>
     "Generally, Armenia would agree to any state, except Turkey<br>
which cannot be impartial", Levon Zourabian said.<br>
<p>
ARA SAHAKIAN SAYS THAT ARMENIAN <br>
ALL NATIONAL MOVEMENT SHOULD GO <br>
ON PLAYING THE BALANCING ROLE<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 8 (Noyan Tapan). "From the political point<br>
of view the past year was remarkable by three events:<br>
presidential election, formation of the new government and local<br>
self-government election. And Armenian All National Movement<br>
(AANM) was in the center of these three events, as well as in<br>
the course of the past several years", Deputy Parliament Speaker<br>
Ara Sahakian said at an extended session of the state council.<br>
According to him, "the past year was also marked by dramatic<br>
events that found their climax in a violent act against National<br>
Assembly on September 25".<br>
     Ara Sahakian says that opposition does not want to obey the<br>
laws. "What is the difference between us and them. The basic<br>
difference is that we, having discussions, taking decisions<br>
assume the responsibility for our people and republic. And they<br>
again choose the streets to calm their political ambitions and<br>
drive our political struggle to the streets. It is natural that<br>
the streets dictate street methods of struggle, hence, a<br>
relevant counteraction", Ara Sahakian said.<br>
     "Those destructive steps that are taken by the opposition<br>
(or a part of it), as well as unlawful steps and their<br>
consequences make us to go on playing the balancing role", he<br>
said.<br>
<p>
LACK OF LEGAL MECHANISM IMPEDES <br>
REOPENING OF DASHNAK PARTY<br>
IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 8 (Noyan Tapan). Armenia's Justice<br>
Minister Marat Alexanian said that documents which had been<br>
submitted to the Ministry by the Dashnak Party's Supreme<br>
Authority are not sufficient to lift the ban on activities of<br>
the Party in Armenia. "We do not oppose the reopening of the<br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation -- Dashnaktsutiun in Armenia,<br>
if this is done within the law in effect," Alexanian said<br>
Tuesday after a meeting with representatives of the Dashnak<br>
Party's Supreme Authority. <br>
     Supreme Authority's political representative Rouben<br>
Hakobian said that Party's representatives had repeatedly<br>
applied to the Ministry of Justice in hopes of receiving<br>
explanations of how to lift the ban on Party's activities in<br>
Armenia. "However, we were only told what should not be done,<br>
and nobody explained us what we should do," he stressed. Up to<br>
present the Ministry of Justice has not officially responded to<br>
Supreme Authority's August 11 1996 letter related to resumption<br>
of Party's activities in Armenia.<br>
     The major opposition party, ARF-Dashnaktsutiun, was banned<br>
in Armenia for six months on orders of the Supreme Court of<br>
Armenia. The main reason of outlawing the Party was that the<br>
Party's Ruling Authority included foreign citizens.  In six<br>
months the Ministry of Justice again appealed to the Supreme<br>
Court, requesting to extend the ban for next six months.<br>
However, the Court rejected the suit.<br>
     The meeting of the Armenian Justice Minister with<br>
representatives of Dashnak Party's Supreme Authority was held in<br>
camera. Minister told journalists that "the agreement has been<br>
broken" and a half-and-hour-long meeting was held without<br>
participation of mass media representatives.<br>

BUDGET REVENUES TO INCREASE BY <br>
31% UNDER REVISED DRAFT <br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 8 (Noyan Tapan). Under the amended draft<br>
budget for 1997 budget revenues should increase by 31% as<br>
compared with last year, while expenditures are supposed to<br>
increase by 22%, Armenia's Finance Minister Levon Barkhudarian<br>
announced.<br>
     Presenting the draft budget at a joint session of National<br>
Assembly's committees, Mr Barkhudarian reported that the budget<br>
deficit would not change, thus totaling 34 billion drams<br>
(approx. $75,500,000). Taking into consideration the expected 6%<br>
growth of GDP, the budget deficit will make up 4.4% of the GDP. <br>
     The first draft budget submitted in November to the<br>
National Assembly envisaged the growth of revenues by 40%, which<br>
then was described by the Central Bank as unrealistic. <br>
     Mr Barkhudarian said that according to preliminary<br>
assessments the revenue collection was completed at 96%-97% in<br>
1996. Inflation rate totalled 8.7% instead of projected 14%. The<br>
inflation rate projected for 1997 will be within 9.5%-10.5%.<br>
     The priority of budget financing will be given to the<br>
social sector (28% growth). Average salary is planned to be<br>
raised by 30%. <br>
     According to the Minister, the growth of budget revenues<br>
will be mainly ensured thanks to increase in tax assignments.<br>
For this purpose it is planned to move a number of amendments<br>
into Armenia's tax legislation. <br>
     The discussion of the draft budget in National Assembly's<br>
committees will be continued until late January. It is planned<br>
to present the draft budget at the plenary session of the<br>
Parliament on 3 February.<br>

Nezavisimaya Gazeta 9 January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Dmitriy Gornostayev:  "The First Year of Primakov's<br>
   Diplomacy Has Passed Without Breakdowns or Breakthroughs.  Has a<br>
   New Foreign Policy Evolved in Russia?"<br>
<p>
  A year ago, when the first foreign minister of the Russian<br>
  Federation was finally kicked out of Smolenskaya Square, [ministry<br>
  headquarters] many posed this question:  Will the parting with the<br>
  Kozyrev course in foreign policy be just as long as the eviction of<br>
  Andrey Kozyrev himself from the Foreign Ministry?<br>
 Practically nobody disagreed with that the course had to be changed: <br>
 Its pro-western, especially pro-U.S. orientation, which brought<br>
 certain dividends in the first years of the new Russian statehood,<br>
 eventually resulted in a series of debacles by Moscow diplomacy in<br>
 many parts of the world and many spheres of international activity.<br>
 The president's choice fell on Yevgeniy Primakov, who was head of the<br>
 Foreign Intelligence Service [SVR] at the time.  First commentaries<br>
 after the appointment predicted a speedy U-turn in Russia's foreign<br>
 policy, "a strengthening of imperial ambitions," and a deterioration<br>
 of relations between Moscow and the West. A year later it can be said<br>
 that these forecasts have been fulfilled, but not entirely.  There<br>
 has certainly been no 180 degree turn -- maybe a 90 degree one at<br>
 best, and Primakov did it quietly, without giving western politicians<br>
 cause to accuse him of a confrontational mood.  Moreover, during this<br>
 year he has clearly shown that he will not -- at least that he does<br>
 not intend -- to go beyond these 90 degrees. The refusal of<br>
 passionate love with the West manifested itself immediately at the<br>
 protocol level:  The new minister made his first foreign trips to CIS<br>
 republics, and it was not until February that he held negotiations<br>
 with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher.  Generally speaking,<br>
 the relations between the heads of the two countries' diplomatic<br>
 departments are fairly indicative, largely reflecting the state of<br>
 things in the Russian-U.S. dialogue. Instead of the old "friend<br>
 Andrey" and "friend Warren" they use only "Mr." and address each<br>
 other by family name.  According to U.S. diplomats it has become far<br>
 more difficult to conduct negotiations:  The Russians have toughened<br>
 their positions, and on some issues they can even be described as<br>
 intransigent.  At the same time Primakov continuously stresses that<br>
 Russia does not wish to relapse into the confrontation of the Cold<br>
 War era.  Naturally, these words are pure rhetoric, but even so, they<br>
 need to be pronounced, and quite often too.  Such tactics gradually<br>
 -- very, very gradually -- began to produce results.  True,<br>
 oftentimes belated results.  A good case in point is the dialogue on<br>
 the issue of NATO expansion.  The tough and sharply negative position<br>
 on the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance has after all played<br>
 its role, and the final document of the recent OSCE summit did not<br>
 include a U.S. proposed passage on the role of NATO as the crux of<br>
 European security.  It is also noteworthy that after numerous<br>
 negotiations the bloc -- thus far in word only -- is talking about<br>
 the possibility of giving Russia guarantees of the nondeployment of<br>
 nuclear weapons on the territory of newly admitted member states. <br>
 True, these guarantees are not worth a cent today, and after the<br>
 admission of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary to the alliance<br>
 they can turn into pure  fiction.  The most terrible thing, however,<br>
 is that we talk about all these achievements by Russian diplomats<br>
 knowing that in half a year, in Madrid, three or maybe four East<br>
 European countries will receive official invitations to join NATO. So<br>
 the joy over the shifts in the relations with the North Atlantic<br>
 alliance can be compared only to the joy of a team hopelessly losing<br>
 a match and repulsing a series of attacks at its gate minutes before<br>
 the end of the match. On the other hand, there is an opinion abroad<br>
 that the game will end not in July at the Madrid NATO summit, but<br>
 only in 1999, when the expansion actually goes ahead.  Until then,<br>
 Foreign Ministry  leaders assure, there is still time to find a<br>
 solution to the problem of alliance enlargement.  Possibly Yevgeniy<br>
 Primakov has a couple of unexpected options up his sleeve.  But even<br>
 if he uses the most crafty one, he will find it extremely difficult<br>
 to conduct the dialogue with NATO.  What matters here is not at all<br>
 Primakov, but the legacy that he inherited from his predecessor. This<br>
 legacy is unenviable.  Weak positions not only in relations with the<br>
 West, but also in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Asian Pacific<br>
 region.  Serbs, Muslims, and Croats are reconciled by a U.S.<br>
 diplomat; peace agreements on Bosnia are signed in Dayton and Paris;<br>
 a Palestinian-Israeli peace declaration is signed in Washington; and<br>
 a nuclear reactor for the North Koreans is built not by their former<br>
 allies, the Russians, but by their perennial enemies, the Americans.<br>
 Primakov assumed the post of foreign minister under extremely<br>
 difficult conditions.  Apart from the purely political difficulties<br>
 there were also huge personnel problems:  The central apparat of the<br>
 Foreign Ministry was not in a battle-ready condition, and was<br>
 inefficient in dealing with the task of foreign policy coordination. <br>
 Personnel turnover in the Foreign Ministry was very high while the<br>
 diplomats' salaries very low.  To sum up, diplomacy was degrading.<br>
 And this affected the new minister's performance. A year ago Primakov<br>
 began to lead foreign policy from the crisis.  What has he achieved?<br>
 Perhaps the main achievement of Yevgeniy Primakov is that during the<br>
 past year he has not made new mistakes and managed to retain the good<br>
 that remained before his advent.  To be sure, such an appraisal of<br>
 performance will not flatter not only a minister but any ordinary<br>
 person.  And still this is the first thing that jumps to the eye, if<br>
 we talk in general terms.  Yet if we go into details, Primakov's year<br>
 has left a mixed impression.<br>
   Liabilities [subhead]<br>
 1.  Inability to comprehensively resolve the problem of boosting<br>
 integration within the CIS.  Intensifying centrifugal trends within<br>
 the Commonwealth. 2.  An evident worsening of relations with Ukraine<br>
 -- the main target of Russian foreign policy in the post-Soviet<br>
 region.  It is drifting further away toward the West, and utterances<br>
 can already be heard about Ukraine's possible NATO membership,<br>
 something that no one could even think of a year ago. 3.  A weakening<br>
 of contacts and understanding with Georgia. 4.  Differences with<br>
 Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan on a number of economic matters, in<br>
 particular, over the problem of Caspian oil. 5.  The weakening of<br>
 [Russian] influence on Moldova and the withdrawal of troops from the<br>
 Dniester Region (the latter, of course, might be assessed in a<br>
 variety of ways, but it has negatively affected Russian positions in<br>
 South East Europe). 6.  The loss of former positions in Tajikistan<br>
 after the signing of inter-Tajik accords (see also assets). 7.  An<br>
 increase in Turkey's economic, ideological, and information expansion<br>
 to the regions of southern Russia and the Turkic republics of the<br>
 CIS. 8.  The impotence of Russian diplomacy in the question of<br>
 liberating Russian pilots from Afghan captivity (if the Foreign<br>
 Ministry was involved in their escape, it would be no sin to admit<br>
 that). 9.  The impossibility of stopping NATO expansion. 10. The<br>
 inadequate level of work in the parliament.  The treaties on START<br>
 II, chemical weapons, biological weapons, and a number of other<br>
 international documents have not been ratified up to this day.  The<br>
 Foreign Ministry is largely responsible for that. 11. Increasing<br>
 shrinkage in [Russian] influence on the Balkans and the Near East.<br>
 One can foresee objections:  Much of what is listed above can be<br>
 attributed to objective difficulties that do not depend on diplomats'<br>
 professional qualities.  Yes, that is true.  But the leadership of<br>
 the ministry is called upon precisely in order to overcome these same<br>
 difficulties.  By the way, it succeeded in so doing in a number of<br>
 areas. Assets [subhead] 1.  The level of foreign policy coordination<br>
 has increased substantially.  Primakov is one of the few cabinet<br>
 members who has direct access to President Yeltsin since his stint as<br>
 Foreign Intelligence Service [SVR] director.  For this reason he<br>
 carries greater clout with members of the Russian leadership who are<br>
 involved in foreign policy matters one way or another, including<br>
 secretaries of the Security Council and the Defense Council; the<br>
 ministers of defense and foreign economic relations; directors of the<br>
 SVR, Federal Security Service [FSB], and Federal Border Service<br>
 [FPS]; as well as parliamentarians.  It has all contributed to better<br>
 foreign policy collaboration between the branches of power and<br>
 various agencies. 2.  The personnel situation has improved.  The<br>
 ministry is no longer plagued by the hectic personnel turnover that<br>
 was characteristic of it under Kozyrev.  Perhaps, the Foreign<br>
 Ministry's only subdivision where this problem has not yet been<br>
 resolved is the disarmament department. The reason for numerous<br>
 staffers' reluctance to stay -- and graduates's unwillingness to<br>
 apply for jobs at the Russian Foreign Ministry -- has remained<br>
 unchanged; the problem is low pay. Among personnel policy<br>
 achievements one should point out the fact that Primakov has<br>
 effectively refrained from reshuffling the ministry's top echelon,<br>
 limiting himself to several changes, such as "deputy<br>
 minister-ambassador" or "department director-deputy minister," which<br>
 is commonplace in diplomatic practice.  This made it possible not to<br>
 break the former pattern of operation, but simply to adjust it. <br>
 Access-the-board personnel changes would have undoubtedly had a<br>
 negative impact on the operation of the foreign policy agency. 3. <br>
 The signing of a treaty with Belarus, which, even though Russia has<br>
 not yet got any specific benefits from it, has become the only<br>
 example of translating into life integrationist trends within the<br>
 CIS.  The Union of Four -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and<br>
 Kyrgyzstan -- is an even more amorphous entity, which, perhaps, does<br>
 not deserve to be ranked among successes of Russian diplomacy in the<br>
 CIS. 4.  An improvement in relations with China.  This is a fairly<br>
 important achievement of both the Foreign Ministry and personally<br>
 Yevgeniy Primakov.  Boris Yeltsin's visit to the PRC in April of last<br>
 year, the arrival of State Council Premier Li Peng in Moscow, the<br>
 creation of a permanent commission at the level of chiefs of<br>
 government, increasingly vibrant military-technical cooperation,<br>
 preparations for a Russian-Chinese summit in Moscow, which is<br>
 expected to yield serious results in terms of bilateral and<br>
 international relations -- it can all fully justifiably be called an<br>
 accomplishment of Russian diplomacy. 5.  The signing of inter-Tajik<br>
 accords in Moscow.  The Russian foreign policy agency should<br>
 undoubtedly be given credit for that. 6.  Some successes, albeit<br>
 small, in the dialogue with NATO, which might in the future help<br>
 Russia obtain more advantageous terms in its relations with the<br>
 alliance, even in its new lineup.  Unfortunately, there have been<br>
 much more setbacks than achievements in this area, which has been<br>
 mentioned above.  Yet it is essential to follow up on the results<br>
 achieved, insisting on the signing of a full-scale and detailed<br>
 treaty between Russia and NATO, which would lay down the principles<br>
 of the two sides' special relationship, including legally binding<br>
 guarantees to each other.  To all appearances, the current leadership<br>
 of the Russian Foreign Ministry intends to proceed in approximately<br>
 the same vein.  Yet it is also possible that Primakov has more<br>
 far-reaching plans.  All the more so because the solution to the<br>
 problem of relations with the North Atlantic Alliance -- judging by<br>
 Yeltsin's recent talks with Kohl and also the Kremlin meeting on<br>
 NATO-related matters -- will become Russia's priority during this<br>
 year and, possibly, for the remainder of this century. 7.  Progress<br>
 in the settlement of border disputes with the Baltic states,<br>
 particularly, with Lithuania. 8.  Reaching agreement with the United<br>
 States on one of the ABM Treaty's components -- low-speed means. 9. <br>
 Active efforts to compel the UN Security Council to lift sanctions<br>
 from Yugoslavia and to partially lift the embargo on Iraq's oil<br>
 sales. 10. The dismantlement of ideological stereotypes in foreign<br>
 policy is one of Primakov's accomplishments.  Now, as it should be,<br>
 you can no longer hear from the foreign minister during his visits<br>
 abroad harsh critical words about both left-wing or right-wing<br>
 opposition.  Such words as "the reds and the browns" or<br>
 "fascism-mongering," which used to be hurled at deputies of the<br>
 parliament of one's own country, have disappeared from the vocabulary<br>
 of Russian diplomacy.  It will be recalled that Primakov said at his<br>
 first news conference as Russia's new foreign minister:  "I do not<br>
 want to be a weathercock."  Ideological winds might blow in various<br>
 directions, but national interests stand over and above any idea,<br>
 whether democratic, Communist, or matriarchal for that matter. * * *<br>
 At the moment Yevgeniy Primakov is probably the best possible,<br>
 although not the ideal figure at the post of foreign minister.  He<br>
 is, without doubt, an experienced man, who is well known and<br>
 respected on the international circuit.  He belongs to a group of<br>
 unsinkable ministers who have no fears lest they should be dismissed.<br>
  He has personal contact with the president.  It is considered bad<br>
 manners among members of the political elite to criticize him.  He<br>
 suits virtually everyone, but... It is just this absence of criticism<br>
 and control -- within reasonable limits, of course -- that could play<br>
 a nasty trick on him.  Minor mistakes that go unnoticed at the<br>
 beginning tend to end up as blunders.  Thank God, last year was not<br>
 marked by failures of Russian diplomacy or its chief.  But,<br>
 unfortunately, no serious breakthroughs were achieved either. <br>
 Weighing setbacks against successes, the latter turn out to be less<br>
 numerous. This year will be very difficult for Russian diplomacy. <br>
 Primakov has so far only managed to hold up the slide of Russia's<br>
 foreign policy indicators.  Now his objective is to ensure their<br>
 growth.<br>

Moskovskiy Komsomolets 9 January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Yulia Kalinina:  "We Shall Always Find a Cyprus To Put<br>
   Against Their NATO"<br>
<p>
  The scandal that has developed around the decision of "Greek" Cyprus<br>
  to buy Russian S-300 surface to air missiles can be regarded as<br>
  nothing short of a "worldwide" recognition.  The West thus sings<br>
  praise to Russian arms traders.<br>
 The righteous wrath over the prospect that the SAM complexes will<br>
 necessarily disturb the balance of forces in Cyprus means that our<br>
 weapons have not only gained a good and firm foothold on the world<br>
 arms market, but have also gradually turned into a real threat for<br>
 the western arms market, including the U.S. market. The fact is that<br>
 the current contract with Cyprus is not the first in the history of<br>
 Russian-Cypriot trade relations.  Approximately a year ago<br>
 Rosvooruzheniye [state company for the export and import of arms and<br>
 military equipment] sold to the island a substantial amount of armor,<br>
 including BMP-3 armored vehicles and T-80U tanks.  The Americans<br>
 missed the contract, but when they woke up, it was too late:  They<br>
 failed to prevent the appearance of Russian armor on Cyprus.  As a<br>
 result the military attache of the U.S. Embassy had to leave Cyprus: <br>
 The appropriate services apparently deemed his slip unpardonable. As<br>
 concerns the latest "SAM" contract, our western competitors learned<br>
 about it in good time and immediately tried to scuttle it.  In<br>
 mid-December Cyprus was visited by British Foreign Secretary Rifkind,<br>
 who thoroughly tried to persuade the government to give up the deal. <br>
 In late December Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Chiller came to<br>
 Moscow.  She tried to work on the Russian side but to no avail<br>
 either.  All the efforts proved futile, and on 4 January the<br>
 multi-million contract for the delivery of S-300's was signed. True,<br>
 not everything has yet been lost for the Americans because before the<br>
 contract takes effect it is to be confirmed by a session of the<br>
 Cypriot parliament.  It is quite possible that such a strong pressure<br>
 will be exerted on the lawmakers that they will give in, respond to<br>
 the appeals "not to disturb the balance of forces," and the contract<br>
 will not be ratified. Rosvooruzheniye, whose hyperactivity brought<br>
 about the entire scandal, refuses to comment on it because "the whole<br>
 story from a purely commercial turned into a purely political one." <br>
 The only thing that we managed to learn from company experts is that<br>
 U.S. Patriot complexes (analogues of our S-300's) are obviously<br>
 inferior to the Russian systems on many characteristics, and if the<br>
 Americans do not stop the realization of the contract now, soon our<br>
 SAM complexes will naturally begin to squeeze U.S. products from the<br>
 "Mediterranean" market.<br>

Nezavisimaya Gazeta 9 January 1997 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Igor Korotchenko:  "It Will Be Safer on Cyprus"<br>
<p>
  Turkey's demarche is not going to change Moscow's principled<br>
  approach to expanding military-technical cooperation between Russia<br>
  and Cyprus, NG was advised at the Rosvooruzheniye state company.  As<br>
  we know, a contract signed in Nicosia 4 January 1997 calls for the<br>
  delivery to Cyprus a batch of mobile S-300 PMU-1 antiaircraft<br>
  missile systems which has sparked Ankara's extremely negative<br>
  reaction.  The S-300 PMU-1 is capable of effectively engaging<br>
  high-speed aerodynamic and ballistic targets up to 100 and 40<br>
  kilometers away and at corresponding altitudes of between 50 meters<br>
  to 25 kilometers.  It takes not more than five minutes to deploy the<br>
  antiaircraft missile system.<br>
 The Rosvooruzheniye state company delivered to Cyprus earlier T-80U<br>
 tanks and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles.  Nicosia has signed the<br>
 C-300 PMU-1 contract despite unprecedented pressure from major<br>
 Western countries.  For example, the island was visited for this<br>
 purpose by a British government delegation led by Secretary of State<br>
 for Foreign Affairs Malcolm Rifkind in December 1996.  The United<br>
 States military attache accredited in Cyprus was relieved of his<br>
 position by the Pentagon for ineffective work to prevent the signing<br>
 of this contract.<br>

<p>
<p>
1. ALBRIGHT AIMS FOR ACTIVE DIPLOMACY<br>
WASHINGTON (Reuter)-Secretary of State-designate Madeleine <br>
Albright promised at her Senate confirmation hearing on <br>
Wednesday to create a strong, active diplomacy and work to <br>
make the United States a "dynamic hub of the global <br>
economy.<br>
	Albright, President Bill Clintons nominee to be the first <br>
woman secretary of state, said Washington would do more to <br>
reduce tensions in Cyprus, India-Pakistan and Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh and maintain its central role in Middle East peace <br>
efforts.<br>
	In testimony presented to the Senate Foreign Relations <br>
Committee, Albright said the United States would increase <br>
its efforts at promoting a resolution in Cyprus, divided <br>
between Greeks and Turks since 1974.<br>
	On India and Pakistan, which both have advanced nuclear <br>
capability, she said, "We will again consider the prospects <br>
for reducing the tensions.<br>
	She said Washington was prepared to play "a more visible <br>
role in bringing a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh <br>
conflict, and suggested Congress could help increase US <br>
influence by lifting restrictions on non-military assistance <br>
to Azerbaijan, while maintaining aid for Armenia.<br>
	Albright backed the long-delayed agreement on Hebron under <br>
negotiation by Israel and the Palestinians saying it would <br>
"serve as a catalyst, strengthening the supporters of <br>
peace.<br>
	Albright, who fled to the United States from her native <br>
Czechoslovakia in WWII, was introduced to the committee by <br>
outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who called <br>
her a "magnificent choice as his successor.<br>
	Senator Jesse Helms, the panels Republican chairman, and <br>
Senator Joseph Biden, the ranking Democrat, welcomed her <br>
warmly, underscoring expectations Albright would receive the <br>
panels endorsement and win easy approval by the full <br>
Senate.<br>
	Albright made an emphatic pitch to Congress, which forced <br>
big cuts in foreign affairs spending in recent years, to <br>
restore funding, saying the United States needed first-class <br>
diplomacy.<br>
	"Force alone can be a blunt instrument and there are many <br>
problems it cannot solve, she said.<br>
	"We must be the authors of the history of our age, <br>
Albright told the committee, adding: "Our leadership must be <br>
sustained if our interests are to be protected around the <br>
world. We cannot have that on the cheap. We must invest the <br>
resources needed to maintain American leadership.<br>
	She said the United States is "the worlds richest, <br>
strongest, most respected nation (yet) provides a smaller <br>
percentage of our wealth to support democracy and growth in <br>
the developing world than any other industrialized nation.<br>
	In the past four years, the State Department cut more than <br>
2,000 employees, closed more than 30 foreign missions and <br>
had to cope with a 30 percent cut in foreign aid, she said.<br>
	But while stressing US leadership must be sustained to <br>
protect US global interests, she also said, "We do not have <br>
unlimited resources, nor do we have unlimited <br>
responsibilities. We have to weigh our commitments <br>
carefully.<br>
	"And we intend to be a very tough team, she said.<br>
	"Our diplomacy will continue to emphasize a high standards <br>
on working conditions, the environment and labor and <br>
business practices. And it is why we will work for a trading <br>
system that establishes and enforces fair rules, she said.<br>
	The proceedings were briefly interrupted when several <br>
protesters stood up and expressed concern about the effect <br>
on Iraqi children of US-led international sanctions. They <br>
were quickly escorted from the hearing room.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. JUSTICE MINISTER DISCUSSES ARF REINSTATEMENT<br>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Armenias Justice Minister Marat <br>
Alexanian said that documents which had been submitted to <br>
the Ministry by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation <br>
Executive Council of Armenia are not sufficient to lift the <br>
ban on activities of the party in Armenia.<br>
	The Ministry of Justice has yet to officially respond to <br>
the Executive Councils August 11, 1996 letter related to <br>
the ARFs reinstatement.<br>
	"We do not oppose the re-opening of the Armenian <br>
Revolutionary Federation in Armenia, if this is done within <br>
the law in effect," Alexanian said Tuesday after a meeting <br>
with ARF Executive Council representatives Rouben Hakobian, <br>
Gagik Mktrchian and Roland Sharoyan.<br>
	A second meeting was held Wednesday, and per Alexanians <br>
request, representatives of media were also invited to <br>
attend.<br>
	Hakobian, the Executive Councils political representative, <br>
said Wednesday that the partys representatives had <br>
repeatedly applied to the Ministry of Justice in hopes of <br>
receiving explanations of how to lift the ban on the ARFs <br>
activities in Armenia. "However, we were only told what <br>
should not be done, and nobody explained to us what we <br>
should do," he stressed.<br>
	"Unfortunately, Armenian law includes a mechanism to <br>
ban a political party, but lacks a mechanism to reinstate <br>
that same banned party," Hakobian said, adding "The ARF, <br>
therefore, must look for a way out of the inconsistencies in <br>
Armenian law."<br>
	"From the beginning, we were convinced that the <br>
banning of the ARF in Armenia was a political act because <br>
other parties, with similar structures and memberships, <br>
continue to operate in Armenia," Hakobian said, casting <br>
doubt on the Supreme Courts Jan. 13, 1995 decision <br>
sanctioning Levon Ter-Petrosyans decree to ban the ARF.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. FRANCE NAMED MINSK GROUP CO-CHAIRMAN<br>
YEREVAN (Combined Sources)-Head of the Political and <br>
Security Department of the French Foreign Ministry Jacques <br>
Blott assumed the co-chairmanship of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group on Tuesday, <br>
replacing the departing Finnish co-chairman.<br>
	Russia will remain as the other co-chairman.<br>
	According to a Radio Liberty correspondent, despite <br>
efforts at the recent OSCE Lisbon summit, the US failed to <br>
secure the co-chairmanship of the mediating group.<br>
	Diplomats said the decision was accepted after discussions <br>
with all 54 members of the OSCE. According to the same <br>
sources, Russia too was willing to have France as co-<br>
chairman.<br>
	US representatives in Vienna told Radio Liberty they were <br>
disappointed by this decision, but refrained from any <br>
comments. Observers in Vienna, pleased with the French <br>
replacement, said Europe should play a larger role in <br>
international organizations.<br>
	According to the Armenian service of Radio Liberty, <br>
Azerbaijan supported the candidacy of the United States.<br>
	Armenia had a positive stance toward the candidacies of <br>
Germany, France and the US, Presidential spokesperson Levon <br>
Zourabian said during a Wednesday briefing.<br>
	"Generally, Armenia would agree to any state, except <br>
Turkey, which cannot be impartial," Zourabian said.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. PRIME MINISTER SARKISSIAN BEGINS UNITED STATES VISIT<br>
WASHINGTON-Armenian Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian arrived <br>
in Washington Sunday for his first working visit to the <br>
United States.<br>
	The main purpose of Sarkissians visit is to meet with the <br>
leadership of the World Bank and the International Monetary <br>
Fund to discuss ways of adjusting the existing cooperation <br>
between them and Armenia for upcoming projects.<br>
	The Prime Minister met with Rear Admiral Paul G. Gaffney, <br>
II, Chief of US Naval Research on Tuesday. Only three CIS <br>
countries, among them Armenia, have so far had successful <br>
working relations with the Naval Research Laboratory, which <br>
conducts scientific research in many high technology areas.<br>
	Issues of further extension of the areas of joint research <br>
were discussed and agreed upon. Admiral Gaffney gladly <br>
accepted Prime Minister Sarkissians invitation to visit <br>
Armenia to get acquainted with its scientific potential <br>
first-hand.<br>
	During an interview with the foreign editors of the <br>
"Washington Times," Sarkissian discussed his position on a <br>
number of issues, including perspective avenues of <br>
development of regional cooperation in the Transcaucasus, <br>
ways of achieving peace and stability in the region and <br>
trade and economic collaboration with Armenias immediate <br>
neighbors.<br>
	Sarkissian also introduced the Armenian governments <br>
agenda of radical reforms in the economic and social <br>
sectors, the main objective of which is to transform Armenia <br>
into a strategic centerpiece of the region by creating a <br>
powerful infrastructure for rapid trade and economic growth, <br>
and by attracting international investment.<br>
	Later in the afternoon, Sarkissian met with Co-Chairman of <br>
the Congressional Caucus, Congressman John Porter. During <br>
their brief meeting, Sarkissian and Congressman Porter <br>
discussed the issue of restoring Armenias image as a <br>
regional role model for a market economy based on democratic <br>
principles. Sarkissian briefed Congressman Porter on the <br>
governments policy of bridging the gap between the <br>
leadership and the opposition by establishing an on-going <br>
dialogue with all political parties and organizations. The <br>
first round of political discussions with the opposition <br>
leaders has already begun, he said.<br>
	Immediately thereafter, the Prime Minister met with <br>
president of the International Foundation for Elections, <br>
Richard Soudriette. During the meeting, Sarkissian presented <br>
his program aimed at strengthening democratic institutions <br>
in Armenia, especially independent media, by providing <br>
favorable economic conditions for expanding the existing and <br>
establishing new operations.<br>
	"The first thing we did, we dissolved the Ministry of <br>
Information that existed before," said Sarkissian, adding <br>
that this was an important step towards removing the <br>
remnants of Soviet mentality.<br>
	In his address to the representatives of the Armenian-<br>
American community at a reception hosted by the Armenian <br>
Embassy, Prime Minister Sarkissian outlined Armenias plans <br>
to consolidate the efforts aimed at sustaining macroeconomic <br>
stability, strengthening the free-market economy and <br>
attracting large international and domestic investments. <br>
Sarkissian also emphasized the fact that the government is <br>
currently working on a set of laws designed to establish a <br>
legal environment to accelerate the privatization and <br>
investment processes in the country.<br>
	"There are a lot of achievements also in our economy-there <br>
are a lot of changes in our country towards a free-market <br>
economy, privatization, but of course, there are a lot of <br>
difficulties as well," Sarkissian said to the 250-plus <br>
gathering of diplomats and public officials.<br>
	"We are a proud nation that can not only survive, but can <br>
fight for its ideas, and who has survived inhumane <br>
conditions for the first five years of our independence," he <br>
said.<br>
	Speaking about Armenia-Diaspora relations, Sarkissian said <br>
that the government encourages more active cooperation <br>
between the Diaspora and Armenia, and specifically <br>
emphasized the importance of strengthening links with <br>
Armenian communities around the world. Such attitude has <br>
been manifested by the creation of a new government body to <br>
specifically address these issues, he said.<br>
	Accompanying the Prime Minister to the January 7 meetings <br>
were Armenian Minister of Trade, Garnik Nanagulian, and <br>
Armenias Ambassador to the US, Rouben Shugarian.<br>
	In addition to his meeting with representative of the <br>
World Bank and the IMF, Prime Minister Sarkissian will meet <br>
with members of the US business community to discuss avenues <br>
of closer cooperation. Sarkissian will also have meetings <br>
with White House and State Department officials, a number of <br>
US Senators and Congressman, as well as with representatives <br>
of the leading policy-making institutions of the United <br>
States.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. PRIME MINISTER TO VISIT LOS ANGELES<br>
BEVERLY HILLS-Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian will speak at <br>
a public gathering on Saturday, January 11 at 6 p.m. at the <br>
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the Consulate-General of the <br>
Republic of Armenia in Los Angeles announced Wednesday.<br>
	The Pasadena Civic Auditorium is located at 300 E. Green <br>
St. <br>
<p>
<p>
6. OPPOSITION BUILDS OVER CYPRUS MISSILE PURCHASE<br>
ATHENS (Reuter)-Greece vowed on Tuesday to campaign <br>
internationally to ensure that Cyprus can proceed with the <br>
purchase of a Russian anti-aircraft missile defense system <br>
despite objections by Ankara, Washington and London.<br>
	"Cyprus is an independent country that has every right to <br>
apply defense program, a foreign ministry statement said. <br>
"Greece will use all means at its disposal with <br>
international bodies and friendly governments so that <br>
Ankaras efforts (to cancel the deal) do not succeed.<br>
	Turkey said on Monday it would not accept a change in the <br>
balance of power on the divided island of Cyprus as a result <br>
of the Cypriot governments decision to buy the surface-to-<br>
air missiles, but did not say what measures it would take.<br>
	In an unusually strong statement, the United States Monday <br>
deplored Cyprus contract to buy the S-300 anti-aircraft <br>
missile system from Russia, saying it would introduce a <br>
destabilizing new military element and complicate peace <br>
moves. Britain also expressed concern.<br>
	The US announced plans to renew this weekend efforts to <br>
reduce tensions between Greeks and Turks on the divided <br>
island, officials said Tuesday.<br>
	They said Carey Cavanaugh, who heads the office of <br>
southern European Affairs, would visit Cyprus on Sunday and <br>
Monday, seeking to advance a political settlement there.<br>
	Before arriving in Cyprus, Cavanaugh will accompany <br>
Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum to The Hague for <br>
a meeting of European Union officials and concerns about <br>
Cyprus will be be a major topic of their discussions, US <br>
officials said.<br>
	Kornblum and Cavanaugh plan to leave Washington Thursday <br>
for The Hague. Cavanaugh plans to meet officials in Greece <br>
early next week and then will visit Turkey at mid-week, <br>
officials said. Arrangements were still being made, they <br>
said.<br>
	But Cyprus shrugged off the criticism as unfair, saying <br>
the system was essential to defend Greek Cypriots on the <br>
island and rejecting what it said was a double standard.<br>
	"Similar criticism has never been raised against the <br>
presence of 35,000 Turkish troops illegally in Cyprus who <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 5, Part I, 8 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN SPENDS ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS IN BED. A cold and fever forced
President Boris Yeltsin to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on 7 January
partially confined to bed at a suburban Moscow residence, Reuters
reported. Yeltsin's temperature was 37.5 C (99.5 F). The president has
no plans to return to the hospital. -- Robert Orttung
<p>
RUSSIANS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. Millions of Russians attended church
services on 7 January to celebrate Orthodox Christmas, Russian and
Western agencies reported. Hours after leading a long Christmas Eve
ceremony, Patriarch Aleksii II led a mass at the newly rebuilt Cathedral
of Christ the Savior in Moscow. Noting that President Yeltsin has
designated 1997 a year of reconcilitation and accord,  the patriarch
said that "now is a time to create" after a period of devastation. In a
Christmas interview with Dom i otechestvo, Aleksii II had warned of the
dangers of "Godless materialistic consumerism" but said he believed the
Russian people had sufficient moral strength to chose "moral
renaissance." On the revival of Orthodox Russia, Aleksii said: "We
should not feel embarassed to call Russia an Orthodox country. We should
remember our kinship and know that the majority of Russians are rooted
in Orthodoxy." -- Penny Morvant
<p>
CHECHEN UPDATE. Abu Masaev, the head of the Chechen State Security
Department, said on 7 January that they have identified the person who
ordered the killing of six Red Cross workers on 17 December, NTV
reported. Masaev refused to name the individual, but said that he was
now outside Chechnya. Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin urged the
Duma to immediately grant a complete amnesty to jailed Chechen fighters,
as the only way to secure the release of Russian captives in Chechnya,
ORT reported on 6 January. There are an estimated 1,500 Chechen
prisoners, while 1,058 Russian servicemen are missing, many thought to
be held captive by private citizens in Chechnya, NTV reported on 6
January. That day, ITAR-TASS reported that acting President Zelimkhan
Yandarbiev has refused to serve in the new government if he is defeated
in the 27 January elections. Presidential candidate Movladi Udugov
dismissed the report as Russian disinformation. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
GERMANY, U.S. DOWNPLAY RUSSIAN THREATS OVER NATO. German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel on 8 January said that, although it will be "very
difficult," Russia will eventually accept the enlargement of NATO, AFP
and RFE/RL reported. He interpreted the latest Russian denunciations of
the alliance's expansion plans as bargaining ploys, saying "Russia knows
that it cannot prevent NATO expansion and wants to obtain a good price
for it." He said Russia should have an "equal and effective" role in
European security, but insisted that "NATO will not make decisions in
concert with Russia" over issues like enlargement. U.S. State Department
spokesman Glyn Davies said that Washington is "aware" of Russian
objections to expansion but will proceed anyway, since the policy is
"not directed against Russia." NTV said on 7 January that President
Yeltsin's recent warnings on the subject were having no effect on
Western policy. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA, BELARUS SLAM NEW YORK POLICE. The Russian and Belarusian
missions to the UN held a joint press conference on 7 January at which
they reiterated allegations that New York police unjustifiably beat two
diplomats over a traffic citation (see OMRI Daily Digest, 2 and 3
January 1997), Russian and Western agencies reported. Russian diplomat
Boris Obnossov and his Belarusian colleague Yurii Oranzh said the police
officers had dragged them from their car and beaten them, despite being
shown diplomatic identification. Obnossov admitted receiving about 400
parking tickets in 1996 and conceded that his car was illegally parked
when the incident occurred, but denied police charges that he was
intoxicated. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani termed the diplomats'
version of events "a pack of lies" on 7 January, saying seven witnesses
corroborated the police officers' account, according to which the
visibly drunk diplomats threw the first punch. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
SPECULATION ON NEW U.S. AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW. Citing anonymous State
Department sources, ITAR-TASS reported on 8 January that J. Stapleton
Roy, currently the American ambassador in Indonesia, will be appointed
as the new U.S. ambassador in Moscow. Roy, 61, is a career diplomat like
his predecessor Thomas Pickering, having previously served as ambassador
in China and Singapore, and holds the top U.S. diplomatic rank of career
ambassador. Although many of his recent postings have been in Asia, the
agency said Roy, a Princeton graduate who speaks Russian, had earlier
served in the U.S. embassy in Moscow and worked at the State
Department's Soviet desk. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIAN ARMS SALES IN 1996 TOP $3 BILLION. Oleg Sidorenko, deputy
director of the state-owned firm Rosvooruzhenie, said on 6 January that
Russia was the world's second leading arms exporter in 1996, selling an
estimated $3.5 billion of weapons abroad, an increase over the $3.1
billion figure for 1995, Interfax reported as monitored by the BBC.
Sidorenko charged the United States, Britain, and France with "actively
obstructing" Russian access to world arms markets, saying Paris, London
and Washington observe "no ethical standards" in the competition for
arms contracts. The same day, Defense Industry Minister Zinovii Pak also
estimated 1996 arms exports would top $3 billion, and said Moscow plans
to triple that figure in the next few years. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
KREMLIN DENIES REPORT ON ROMANOV HEIR. Presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembskii dismissed a report published on 5 January in the British
Daily Telegraph, which claimed that the Kremlin is preparing a
presidential decree to reinstate a 15-year-old descendant of the Romanov
dynasty, Reuters reported on 6 January. The paper said Grand Duke
Georgii Mikhailovich Romanov would play only a ceremonial role and that
plans to bring him back were connected to a Kremlin-sponsored search for
a Russian national idea. Yastrzhembskii said the story would be "funny
if it were not annoying," speculating that the British media "has run
out of its own monarchy stories" and wants to expand onto Russian
territory. -- Laura Belin
<p>
INTERNET PROVIDER CUTS SERVICE TO RUSSIA. Internet service provider
America Online (AOL) is no longer permitting users in Russia direct
access to its services by telephone because of rampant credit card
fraud, ITAR-TASS reported on 8 January. The agency quoted AOL
spokeswoman Susan Porter as saying that many subscribers have been using
stolen credit cards to purchase time on line, leaving the company to
foot the telephone bill. There have also been cases of people using
stolen passwords to access information. AOL, which has more than 6
million subscribers worldwide, has not said when it plans to reinstate
services for users in Russia. Under the new Criminal Code, which went
into effect on 1 January, the illegal manufacture or sale of credit
cards is punishable by two to six years imprisonment. -- Penny Morvant
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
HUNDREDS OF VEHICLES STILL STUCK IN GEORGIAN MOUNTAIN PASS. More than
200 vehicles remain blocked in a mountain pass connecting Georgia and
Russia, ITAR-TASS reported on 7 January. The pass has been closed since
26 December following an avalanche in the Caucasus Mountains (see OMRI
Daily Digest, 2 January 1997). Georgian traffic workers continue to
clear the most difficult section of the road, using tractors and snow-
plows, while rescue helicopters evacuate people trapped in the Georgian
mountain resort of Gudauri. According to ITAR-TASS, Georgian authorities
expect traffic to resume "in the near future." -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
FRANCE BECOMES CO-CHAIR OF KARABAKH NEGOTIATIONS. The OSCE has named
France as the new co-chair of the deadlocked negotiations on the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, RFE/RL reported on 7 January. France, beating
out an active U.S. bid, succeeds Finland, which held the office for 20
months. The other co-chair is Russia, whose post is permanent. The chief
French negotiator will be Jacques Blot. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
RUSSO-AZERBAIJANI TALKS "USEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE." Following two days of
talks, Russia and Azerbaijan agreed to improve trade and economic ties,
signing protocols on trade in major commodities in 1997 as well as the
development of transport and metro building, Russian media reported on 7
January. The head of the Russian delegation, Valerii Serov, termed the
meetings constructive and useful, noting that it was the "first time"
the two sides had agreed on specific joint actions. Serov also noted
that the two sides continue to hold differing views on the Caspian Sea,
and on mutual debts. While both Serov and Azeri officials were upbeat
about moving Azeri oil through Chechnya soon, Chechen sources, cited by
Reuters the same day, claim Russia is dragging its feet in oil
negotiations it was to have completed by 1 December. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
TROUBLE IN TAJIKISTAN'S "WILD WEST." Elements of Tajikistan's First
Brigade moved toward the western city of Tursun Zade during the night of
7-8 January, ITAR-TASS reported. The brigade is under the command of
Col. Mahmud Khudaberdiyev, who last January led one of two mutinies
which for two weeks threatened the capital Dushanbe. The other mutiny
was led by the former mayor of Tursun Zade, Ibodullo Baimatov. Like
Khudaberdiyev, Baimatov returned to his base following concessions by
the government. Since then, control of Tursun Zade, the site of the
largest aluminum plant in Central Asia, has been contested by several
criminal groups. Baimatov was ousted by late summer 1996 but the city
remained outside the jurisdiction of the government. Khudaberdiyev
mended relations with the Tajik government and sources from the
brigade's headquarters say this latest move is an attempt to restore
order in Tursun Zade. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
FLOUR ENTITLEMENTS DOWN IN TURKMENISTAN. The amount of wheat flour
available to Turkmenistan's citizens at subsidized rates has been
decreased by presidential decree, according to a 7 January Interfax
report monitored by the BBC. As of 1 February 1997, citizens whose
average monthly income does not exceed 200,000 manats (about $40) are
entitled to six kilos of flour at 25 manats per kilo. In rural areas the
eight kilo ration will remain in effect. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
LAW ON POLITICAL PARTIES IN UZBEKISTAN. Uzbekistan's law on political
parties came into force on 7 January, according to Uzbek media monitored
by the BBC. The law prohibits parties based on ethnic or religious lines
and those advocating war or subversion of the constitutional order.
Prospective parties must submit details of at least 5,000 members spread
over eight provinces. Applications for registering a party are to be
directed to the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Court has the right to
suspend or ban them if they are found guilty of persistent legal
violations. Parties have the right to take part in elections, publish
newspapers, and establish parliamentary and local groups. -- Lowell

GAZPROM WONT CUT GAS TO BELARUS. Gazprom has denied that it threatened
to cut gas supplies to Belarus because of unpaid debts, Belarusian TV
reported on 6 January. Citing ITAR-TASS, the report noted that Gazprom
officials are continuing to deliver regular gas supplies to Belarus
because the republic has started to pay its debts. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
BELARUS MAY BE EXPELLED FROM COUNCIL OF EUROPE. Belarus may lose its
observer status in the Council of Europe because Belarusian President
Alyaksandr Lukashenka has ignored its protests over the 24 November
constitutional referendum, AFP reported on 7 January. The referendum
gave Lukashenka sweeping new powers, but there were allegations of
irregularities in the voting and the conduct of the campaign to promote
Lukashenka's new constitution. The council's 40-member committee is to
meet later this month to consider the proposal to expel Belarus. Belarus
has had a special guest status in the organization since September 1992,
and applied for full membership in March 1993. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
ESTONIAN RELATIONS WITH COUNCIL OF EUROPE. A law introducing life
imprisonment went into effect in Estonia on 5 January, ETA reported on 7
January. Although the law does not abolish the death penalty, it is seen
as the first step toward phasing out capital punishment, in accordance
with Council of Europe norms. The same day, Estonia's permanent
representative to the Council of Europe, Ambassador Karin Jaani, handed
over the instruments of ratification of the Council of Europe convention
for the protection of national minorities to the secretary general of
the organization, Daniel Tarschys. Apart from Estonia, the convention
has so far been ratified by seven states, and signed by six others. It
will go into effect after 12 states have ratified it. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
SLOVAKIA TO DISCUSS NATO MEMBERSHIP. Foreign Minister Pavol Hamzik on 7
January said the cabinet will officially begin public discussions of the
implications of NATO membership this month, TASR reported. The
government has already announced plans to hold a referendum on NATO
membership, tentatively set for May of this year. Hamzik said Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar and his Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, will
meet in the near future for their first official bilateral meeting in
several years. Hamzik said he is also arranging visits by Meciar to Bonn
and by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to Bratislava, although
dates have yet to be finalized. Meanwhile, speaking on Radio Twist on 7
January, Association of Workers (ZRS) Chairman Jan Luptak asked why
Slovakia should enter NATO, Praca reported. "We do not want to wage a
war, we want to live in peace with our neighbors," Luptak stressed. The
ZRS is a junior partner in the ruling coalition. -- Sharon Fisher

SERBIAN OPPOSITION LAUNCHES CHRISTMAS "CHARM OFFENSIVE." Tens of
thousands of Serbs attended public demonstrations on 7 January, which is
Serbian Orthodox Christmas, AFP and CNN reported. In a new tactic,
people kissed the riot police, who are President Slobodan Milosevic's
last bastion of defense. Opposition leader Vuk Draskovic appealed to the
police: "Even Tito's communist regime did not make its police turn out
onto the streets for Christmas. The young people in police uniforms are
also part of the people. It's Christmas for you too, do you know that?
[The authorities] are sending you here today to provoke bloodshed. But
Christmas is the biggest Christian festival ... and therefore, I say to
the police, divine peace, Christ is born." -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BELGRADE PROTESTS CONTINUE. Opposition representatives and other
observers suspect that the explosion at the headquarters of a tiny party
run by President Milosevic's wife was a provocation by the authorities
themselves (see OMRI Daily Digest, 7 January 1997). Opposition leader
Vesna Pesic likened it to the Reichstag fire incident of 1933, Nasa
Borba reported on 8 January. Protest plans for today center on a
campaign to block government telephone lines by calling officials and
then leaving the phone off the hook. Lists of government phone numbers,
including Milosevic's, have been distributed. Draskovic also appealed to
citizens to stage another protest by traffic jam. In other Serbian news,
a new law has come into effect that allows employers to fire workers at
their own discretion, thereby removing some job protection rights. --
Patrick Moore
<p>
SERBIAN OPPOSITION SEEKS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. Zoran Djindjic of the
opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition has appealed to foreign
countries to put more pressure on President Milosevic to recognize the
17 November local election results. He told a German radio station:
"This is at the moment probably the only thing that can make [Milosevic]
move," AFP reported. EU and U.S. flags are prominent at opposition
rallies, which reflects popular appreciation for foreign support. The
independent media closely follow foreign coverage of Serbian affairs,
and opposition leaders frequently give interviews in English or German
to Western media. All of this is in stark contrast to the xenophobic
tone of the Milosevic regime and its media, which were particularly
anti-U.S. and anti-German in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, in Bonn,
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel endorsed opposition demands and called for
continuing the suspension of EU financial benefits for Serbia, Nasa
Borba wrote on 8 January. He nonetheless warned against any expectations
that Milosevic himself could be ousted soon, AFP noted. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
TEAR GAS THROWN DURING ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS SERVICE IN SARAJEVO . . . The
Interior Ministry of the Bosnian Federation said on 7 January that tear
gas was thrown into a Sarajevo church by an unknown person during a
Christmas day service for Orthodox Serbs the same day, AFP reported.
There were no casualties among some 40 people who attended the service.
Meanwhile, Cardinal Vinko Puljic, the Roman Catholic archbishop, joined
a group of Orthodox Serbs celebrating Christmas in Sarajevo's oldest
church in a show of ecumenical unity. His visit follows that of Serb
Archbishop Nikolai to Sarajevo's Catholic cathedral for the Catholic
Christmas service. In other news, a mosque in the Sarajevo suburb of
Hrasnica was sprayed with machine-gun fire on 6 January by an unknown
person, AFP reported. In news from Mostar, another Muslim has been
evicted from the Croat-held part of the town. The elderly woman, who was
illegally evicted from her home, was found dead in an abandoned
building, while a Croat soldier moved into her apartment. -- Daria Sito
Sucic
<p>
. . . AND EXPLOSION DAMAGES CATHOLIC CHURCH IN EASTERN SLAVONIA. UN
spokesman Philip Arnold said on 7 January that a Catholic church was
damaged by an explosion a day earlier in the town of Ilok in eastern
Slavonia, the last Serb-held part of Croatia, AFP reported. No one was
hurt in the blast. The same church was besieged by Serb demonstrators
&gt;from the area on 24 December as some 200 Croat returnees celebrated
Catholic Christmas eve (see OMRI Daily Digest, 30 December 1996). --
Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
ROMANIAN PRESIDENT VOWS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. Emil Constantinescu on 7
January vowed to combat rampant corruption and organized crime, saying
they pose a direct threat to national security, Romanian media reported.
Constantinescu, who was speaking at an extraordinary meeting of
Romania's Supreme Defense Council, proposed the creation of a national
council to deal with the problem. Also on 7 January, the president's
office rejected the accusations of nepotism that have been leveled
against Constantinescu in the media. A statement said that the prefect
of Arges is not Constantinescu's brother-in-law, as assumed by some
newspapers. The accusations multiplied after the son of Constantinescu's
counselor for foreign and internal affairs, Zoe Petre, was appointed to
the post of presidential counselor. -- Dan Ionescu

     PLANTING  FAST  GROWING  TREES  IN  ARMENIA<br>
     By Areg Gharabegian<br>
     <br>
     The purpose of this project is to grow US developed hybrid fast <br>
     growing trees in Armenia and bring tree genetics improvement expertise <br>
     to the Armenian Academy of Science, Institute of Botany's plantation <br>
     forestry program.  In addition, to develop a source for biomass to <br>
     energy in Armenia and use fast growing hybrid trees for reforestation.<br>
     <br>
     About 10,000 hybrid US and Canadian trees have been already planted in <br>
     Armenia during last three years.  This project is financed by the <br>
     Armenian Engineers and Scientists of America (AESA) and managed by the <br>
     Institute of Botany of the Armenian Academy of Science.  These <br>
     plantations were established to evaluate the best species for <br>
     different locations in Armenia.  Some of the species have shown very <br>
     promising growth.  As of September 1995, which was the end of the 1995 <br>
     growing season, some of the species that were planted in April of 1994 <br>
     had grown by as much as 3 meters 10 centimeters.  As of September 1996 <br>
     these trees where as high as 6 meters.  AESA arranged for the visits <br>
     of three US specialists to Armenia in October 1994 and June 1995 to <br>
     evaluate the potential of the fast growing trees for biomass to <br>
     energy, reforestation, and erosion control purpose.<br>
     <br>
     Government of Armenia has allocated 200 hectares in Ararat Valley for <br>
     planting fast growing hybrid trees.  Planting at this site will start <br>
     spring of 1997.  The purpose of this plantation is to create a <br>
     foundation for developing the tools needed to accomplish necessary <br>
     basic research in developing new fast-growing trees using US hybrids <br>
     which are suitable for Armenia.  During the first two years of this <br>
     project approximately 40,000 trees will be planted on 30 hectares of <br>
     land each year.<br>
     <br>
     The eventual goal is to develop a profitable tree production system <br>
     which can be deployed in the saline and alkaline degraded soils of the <br>
     Ararat Valley in Armenia which are not suitable for agricultural use.  <br>
     As part of this project advanced US forest tree genetics technology <br>
     will be utilized to accelerate tree production systems in some of the <br>
     saline parts of Ararat Valley.  Several tree types have shown very <br>
     encouraging growth rates in alkaline soil which presently is not used <br>
     for agricultural purposes.  If large scale short rotation plantations <br>
     were started in parts of Ararat Valley which has saline soil using the <br>
     selected hybrid trees, it is anticipated that after four or five <br>
     rotation periods (approximately 35 years), some of the alkaline areas <br>
     could be used for selected agricultural purposes.  As a result of this <br>
     project, portions of the Ararat Valley will be covered by trees which <br>
     will have positive environmental impacts.  In addition, these <br>
     plantations could be used in the future as a source for biomass to <br>
     energy production.<br>
     <br>
     Fast growing hybrid trees could also be ideal choice for reforestation <br>
     of the destroyed forest areas.  Reforestation is an urgent issue in <br>
     Armenia.  The near total loss of imported fossil fuel has resulted in <br>
     wide-spread deforestation from 1991 to 1995.  Results of tests <br>
     conducted during last years have reviled that the hybrid poplars will <br>
     grow at least three to four time faster than the native poplars.  <br>
     These hybrid trees can become large mature trees in no more than ten <br>
     years.  Figure 3 shows growth of these hybrid trees in one year.<br>
     The Armenian National Academy of Science headed by Mr. Fadey <br>
     Sarkissian, former Prime Minister has personally agreed to make this <br>

ARMENIA - Human Rights Watch World Report 1997<br>
<p>
The government's crackdown on the political opposition in September<br>
1996 cast a pall on human rights.  Given the 1995 ban on the<br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Armenia's largest<br>
opposition party, and fraudulent 1995 parliamentary elections, the<br>
1996 crackdown accentuated the government's intolerance of any real<br>
political opposition.  This crushing of opposition forces bore out<br>
Defense Minister Vazgen Sarkissian's September 25 warning that<br>
"After [the September 25] events, even if they win 100 percent of<br>
the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior<br>
Ministry would recognize such political leaders."<br>
<p>
In April, the Ministry of Justice attempted to close Azg, the<br>
Ramkavar party daily, claiming that it needed to re-register under<br>
the auspices of the diaspora Ramkavar party, which is pro-Ter-<br>
Petrosian.<br>
<p>
The Ministry of Justice refused to register the Committee for the<br>
Defense of Political Prisoners, basing its decision on its view<br>
that since there were no political prisoners in Armenia, such an<br>
organization was unnecessary.<br>

<p>
MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 December: A delegation of Armenian government officials led by<br>
parliamentary chairman Babken Ararktsian meet with Chinese<br>
parliamentary chairman Qiao Shi and other officials in Beijing. <br>
The meetings review bilateral relations and discuss the expansion<br>
of governmental cooperation in science, education and commerce. <br>
The relations between the two countries have steadily grown since<br>
China first extended diplomatic recognition in 1991.<br>
<p>
4 December: The Armenian government reveals plans to import 1.1<br>
billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1997 under the terms of the<br>
state social and economic developmental program recently ratified<br>
by the parliament.  The state plan also envisions utilizing foreign<br>
expertise to modernize the country's natural gas transport system. <br>
Armenian natural gas transport and supply facilities have remained<br>
idled since their closure in 1992 as a result of the full economic<br>
and transport blockade by Azerbaijan.  The Armenian government is<br>
also planning to privatize its state gas concern, Armgazprom, with<br>
assistance from the European Union.<br>
<p>
5 December: Armenian interior ministry police detain several<br>
leading members of the opposition National Progress party for<br>
questioning.  Although the incident remains unexplained, the<br>
detention is apparently the latest example of the government's<br>
campaign to intimidate and impede the country's political<br>
opposition parties.<br>
<p>
8 December: President Levon Ter Petrosian and National Security<br>
Minister Serge Sarkisian meet in Yerevan with Russian Border Troops<br>
Commander, General Andrei Nikolayev, to discuss the status of<br>
Russian military personnel in Armenia.  The border troops,<br>
stationed along the Armenian-Turkish border, are chronically short<br>
of adequate food supplies, as well as fuel and spare parts for<br>
their equipment.  The Russian troop presence is based on the terms<br>
of a 1992 renewable bilateral accord whereby both countries finance<br>
the troops' deployment and operational needs.<br>
<p>
9-10 December: Newly appointed Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian,<br>
during a visit to the United Kingdom, meets with several leading<br>
European companies to promote greater foreign investment in<br>
Armenia.  The prime minister also meets with several British<br>
government officials and parliamentarians.<br>
<p>
10 December: The Armenian Supreme Court issues sentences in the<br>
"Dro" trial, condemning three defendants to death on charges of<br>
terrorism, drug trafficking and crimes against the state.  The<br>
three defendants are Armen Munjoyan, Arsen Artsrouni and Armen<br>
Grigorian.  The Court also sentences the remaining eight defendants<br>
to terms ranging from three to fifteen years imprisonment and<br>
orders the state confiscation of all the defendants' property.  The<br>
defendants included Artavazd Manoukian who died while in custody<br>
<i>&gt;from internal hemorrhaging and lack of medical attention.  ARF</i><br>
leader and defendant, Hrant Markarian, was found guilty of<br>
possessing multiple passports and an unregistered firearm, but was<br>
not found to have any connection to the "Dro" group, thus<br>
exonerating the ARF.  The prosecution had claimed that Markarian's<br>
participation with "Dro" proved the ARF's involvement as well.<br>
<p>
10 December: On his first formal visit to Moscow, newly appointed<br>
Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander Arzoumanian meets with Russian<br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov.  The meeting reviews the<br>
conflicting positions regarding Nagorno Karabagh during the recent<br>
summit of the organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe<br>
(OSCE).  Although Moscow remains committed to guaranteeing the<br>
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and providing a limited<br>
concession of autonomy for Nagorno Karabagh within Azerbaijan<br>
proper, the foreign minister promised to continue the constructive<br>
dialogue with all sides in their mediation attempt.<br>
<p>
10 December: The representative of the World Bank to Armenia,<br>
Vahram Nersissiants, announces that the multilateral lending<br>
organization is preparing to extend a new loans to the country. <br>
The World Bank assistance, providing credits for the development of<br>
Armenia's legislative and educational sectors, would bring the<br>
total level of World Bank aid to approximately $500 million.<br>
<p>
11 December: In response to the death sentences imposed the day<br>
before on three defendants in the "Dro" trial, the human rights<br>
organization Amnesty International issues a statement demanding<br>
that Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosian immediately commute the<br>
sentences.  The year long trial has been the centerpiece of the<br>
government's campaign against the country's largest opposition<br>
party, the Armenian revolutionary Federation (ARF), and the course<br>
of the trial has been marked by several legal irregularities and<br>
the sporadic violation of the civil liberties of the defendants.<br>
<p>
11 December: In a reflection of the growing level of corruption in<br>
the reforming economies of the former Soviet Union, Armenian<br>
officials announce that some 200 state tax inspectors have been<br>
dismissed amid charges of abuse of power and bribery.  There have<br>
been serious incidents of state corruption, including within the<br>
ranks of the police and law enforcement structures and among<br>
customs and tax inspectors in Armenia.<br>
<p>
11 December: The Turkish foreign ministry announces that Turkey<br>
will no longer open its border with Armenia as earlier promised by<br>
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.  The statement adds that the<br>
border will remain closed until Armenia "respects Azerbaijan's<br>
territorial integrity" and until the withdrawal of Nagorno Karabagh<br>
forces from the occupied areas of Azerbaijan proper.  The Armenian-<br>
Turkish border has been closed since 1992 in an effort to exert<br>
strategic economic pressure over the fragile Armenian economy.<br>
<p>
11 December: The head of the Armenian Church, Supreme Patriarch and<br>
Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin I, meets with Pope John Paul II<br>
at the Vatican.  The Pope states that he hopes the Armenian<br>
Apostolic Church will eventually reunite with the Roman Catholic<br>
Church.  The Armenian church split from Rome during the 5th<br>
century.<br>
<p>
13 December: Armenia's new Prime Minister Armen Sarkisian holds a<br>
meeting with representatives of the banned opposition Armenian<br>
Revolutionary Federation (ARF).  The meeting reviews the prime<br>
minister's plan for the coming year and discusses the importance of<br>
involving all political parties and groups in a constructive<br>
attempt to resolve the country's tense internal political crisis. <br>
<p>
13 December: The Korean electronics company Samsung opens its first<br>
store in Armenia, adding to its presence in the former Soviet<br>
Union.  Samsung maintains distribution outlets and stores in<br>
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The company is also reportedly<br>
considering opening three other stores in Armenia.<br>
<p>
16 December: An official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)<br>
announces that the Armenian government must make corrections to its<br>
economic program.  Specifically, the IMF criticizes the Ter<br>
Petrosian government's plan to allow a rise in inflation from this<br>
year's level of 10 percent to an annual rate of 14 percent for<br>
1997.  The country's fragile commercial banking sector is also<br>
cited as a systemic flaw, calling for immediate attention and for<br>
mergers and closures of some banking institutions.  The IMF also<br>
expresses concern over the government's failure to meet spending<br>
reduction targets set this year and its continued granting of state<br>
credit to the central bank beyond previously agreed upon limits.<br>
<p>
18 December: According to a new report issued by the U.S.<br>
organization Freedom House, Armenia is categorized as being only<br>
"partly free" by virtue of repression of the country's opposition<br>
political parties and their press and the less than democratic<br>
nature of the country's recent parliamentary and presidential<br>
elections.  The report, issued annually, is a world survey of<br>
governments and their patterns of democracy and governance as well<br>
as a review of each country's state of civil and political<br>
liberties.<br>
<p>
20 December: A recently formed U.S.-Armenian joint geological and<br>
prospecting company announces plans to drill three wells outside of<br>
Yerevan and conduct a seismic study of the region over the next<br>
five years.  The U.S. partner in the venture plans to invest some<br>
$10 million for the exploration and will launch oil production if<br>
any significant reserves are discovered.  Based on earlier surveys<br>
done by the Portuguese Parteko company and the British firm SPT,<br>
Armenia is expected to hold reserves of nearly 35 million tons of<br>
crude oil and 80 billion cubic meters of natural gas.  Any energy<br>
reserves found would be beneficial to the Armenian economy which is<br>
stalled by the paralyzing effects of the blockade of the country<br>
imposed five years ago by neighboring Turkey and Azerbaijan and due<br>
to the country's over 90 percent dependence on imports for its<br>
energy needs.<br>

GEORGIA - Human Rights Watch World Report 1997<br>
<p>
Human rights progress in Georgia stagnated in 1996.  Abuses<br>
persisted, especially torture and other forms of mistreatment in<br>
detention, arbitrary detention, appalling prison conditions, use of<br>
the death sentence, corruption of law enforcement officials and the<br>
judiciary, and harassment of some political dissidents. <br>
The year got off to a mixed start.  Monitors from the Organization<br>
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) termed the November<br>
5, 1995, parliamentary and presidential elections and the November<br>
19, 1995 , parliamentary run-offs "relatively open;" the<br>
assessments of the British Helsinki Group and others were generally<br>
less positive.<br>
Press freedom was widely enjoyed, although self-censorship remained<br>
a problem, particularly in the government media.  The September<br>
adoption of a law on state secrets that restricts some freedom of<br>
the media, and the de facto closure of independent TV channel<br>
Rustavi-2 on July 17, apparently for political reasons, raised some<br>
concern over the state of the independent media.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
8 December: The Georgian defense ministry announces the dismissal<br>
of the commander of the Georgian Navy, Rear Admiral Aleksandr<br>
Javakhishvili.  The Georgian naval forces have been undergoing<br>
recent modernization efforts and have moved swiftly in the last two<br>
months to exert a more assertive role in patrolling the waters off<br>
the strategic Georgian port facilities along the Black Sea coast.<br>
<p>
8 December: In a clash with Georgian forces, three Abkhazian<br>
officers are killed and two others are wounded in the Gali border<br>
district.  The Abkhazian government reacts by criticizing the<br>
Russian military peacekeepers stationed in the border region for<br>
their inability to prevent the attack.  The clash is reportedly the<br>
latest in a series of attacks seen as a new military offensive by<br>
the newly formed units of ethnic Georgian within Abkhazia.  The<br>
Abkhazian leadership has accused the Georgian security forces of<br>
having trained and armed theses units.<br>
<p>
9 December: The Ajarian parliament issues a statement protesting<br>
the Georgian refusal to authorize the creation of a free economic<br>
zone for the port city of Batumi.  The Georgian government has been<br>
reluctant to allow such a move, fearing that the economic zone<br>
would "encourage separatism" within the Ajarian Autonomous<br>
Republic.<br>
<p>
10 December: President Eduard Shevardnadze announces a formal<br>
moratorium on capital punishment.  Coinciding with International<br>
Human Rights Day, the announcement further states that the<br>
government will propose amendments to the penal code prohibiting<br>
the death sentence for high treason and other crimes, with the sole<br>
exception of premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances.<br>
<p>
10 December: During the course of a meeting with visiting Russian<br>
Duma chairman Gennady Seleznev, Shevardnadze and State Minister<br>
Niko Lekishvili protest the Russian government's trade restrictions<br>
on Georgian fruit and vegetables, wine and tea products.  The<br>
Georgian government has recently complained of the serious lack of<br>
market access for Georgian exports, citing the decline in bilateral<br>
trade.  Georgia is currently only the seventh leading trading<br>
partner with the Russian Federation.<br>
<p>
11 December: Chairman Seleznev, meets with Georgian officials<br>
during his participation in the summit of the Parliamentary<br>
Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation in Tbilisi.  The<br>
Russian official, in an address to the Georgian parliament, states<br>
that the Russian ratification of the pending bilateral accord on<br>
cooperation and political relations depends on the Georgian<br>
ratification of an agreement on the stationing of Russian troops in<br>
the country and other concessions by Tbilisi.  In protest to the<br>
statements, the Georgian opposition National Democratic<br>
parliamentary bloc walks out on the session.  The Russian official<br>
also states that Moscow would like to open a consulate in Batumi<br>
"to safeguard the interests of the 30,000 ethnic Russian community<br>
in Ajaria."<br>
<p>
14 December: Opposition National Democrats parliamentary bloc<br>
leader, Beso Djugeli, calls for the impeachment of Georgian Defense<br>
Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze for his "destruction of the country's<br>
military-industrial complex."  The defense minister has come under<br>
fire lately in the wake of his dismissal of Georgia's Navy<br>
commander.<br>
<p>
15-16 December: Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalate<br>
following the seizure of a Ukrainian ship by Russian naval forces<br>
near the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi.  Georgia's<br>
parliamentary defense and security commission chairman Revaz Adamia<br>
and border troops commander, Major General Valeri Chkeidze, condemn<br>
the action by the Russian military as a threat to Georgian<br>
sovereignty and warn that it undermines prospects for the<br>
ratification of the 1994 bilateral Russian-Georgian border treaty. <br>
Further complicating the situation, Russian border troops have also<br>
sealed the Russian border with South Ossetia seriously disrupting<br>
commerce and trade.<br>
<p>
17 December: Ajarian parliamentary chairman Aslan Abashidze issues<br>
a communique announcing that Ajarian security forces have secured<br>
the administrative border with Georgia.  The statement explains the<br>
move as an attempt to control the transit of armed groups through<br>
Ajaria into Abkhazia.  The border area has been used by several<br>
armed Georgian groups to enter Abkhazia and despite numerous<br>
complaints to Tbilisi by the Ajarian leadership, these groups have<br>
also targeted Ajarian civilians in the area.<br>

AZERBAIJAN - Human Rights Watch World Report 1997<br>
<p>
The treason trials of President Heydar Aliyev's personal enemies,<br>
brutal treatment in detention, and continued repression of free<br>
speech stood in grim contrast to the Azerbaijan government's<br>
efforts to join international human rights institutions in 1996. <br>
Continued ill treatment in detention demonstrated how far<br>
Azerbaijan has to go in order to conform with Council of Europe<br>
standards and with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel<br>
Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which was ratified<br>
by the Azerbaijani parliament on May 31, 1996.<br>
The government continued to stifle political speech.  Government<br>
censors routinely refused to allow publication of issues of<br>
opposition newspapers that contained articles criticizing Aliyev. <br>
The Ministry of Justice repeatedly refused to register the<br>
Committee for Human Rights and Democracy, citing, among other<br>
things , the organization's failure to provide copies of the<br>
founder's passports, which is not among registration rules.  The<br>
government continued to deny the ICRC access to pre-trial<br>
detainees, but granted unhindered access to prisoners of war.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 December: An official of the Organization for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Tibor Lakatti, is attacked during a<br>
tour of the militarized zone separating Azerbaijani and Nagorno<br>
Karabagh forces near Agdam. Azerbaijani security officials blame<br>
Nagorno Karabagh units for provoking the incident due to the<br>
"difficulty in distinguishing peacekeepers from Nagorno Karabagh<br>
forces."  Such attacks have occurred in the past, for example, when<br>
Azerbaijani forces fired upon a OSCE delegation touring the zone<br>
last April.<br>
<p>
3 December: The international human rights organization Helsinki<br>
Watch sends a letter to Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev<br>
protesting the Azerbaijani government's handling of the criminal<br>
case against former Defense Minister Rakhim Gaziyev.  The former<br>
defense minister, charged with crimes against the state in the<br>
military losses to Nagorno Karabagh forces during the May 1992<br>
defeats in Shushi and Lachin, has been denied visits by relatives<br>
and has been held in isolation without access to his lawyer beyond<br>
an initial meeting.  Gaziyev served as the defense minister under<br>
the government of Azerbaijani Popular Front leader Abulfez<br>
Elchibey, ousted from power in a coup d'etat.  Following the coming<br>
to power by Aliyev in June 1993, Gaziyev fled to Russia but was<br>
extradited to Baku in April 1996 after repeated Azerbaijani<br>
demands.  <br>
<p>
4 December: Speaking at a Baku press conference, Azerbaijani<br>
economic policy advisor Vakhid Akhundov announces that Azerbaijan<br>
plans on shipping 800,000 tons of crude oil through the Baku-<br>
Grozny-Novorossiisk pipeline.  The Azerbaijani official states that<br>
the state oil company SOCAR expects profits of $100 million from<br>
these early exports, estimated to be ready for shipment sometime<br>
next summer.  Azerbaijani officials also reveal that the country<br>
currently produces nine million tons of oil annually and is<br>
planning on annual exports of 1.5-2 million tons.<br>
<p>
5 December: The Azerbaijani ministry of communications announces a<br>
new $43 million project to upgrade the country's aging<br>
telecommunications sector.  The project involves the Azerbaijani<br>
state telecommunications firm with investment by Swedish and<br>
Turkish companies.  To date, the country's telecommunications<br>
sector enjoys significant Israeli and Turkish investment as well as<br>
assistance in its modernization from the European Union's TACIS aid<br>
program.<br>
<p>
5 December: Representatives of the country's main independent media<br>
issue a statement protesting the Azerbaijani government's decision<br>
to revoke the press credentials of the parliamentary correspondent<br>
for the opposition Azeri Popular Front's newspaper "Azadlyg."  The<br>
Aliyev government has a record of continued repression and<br>
censorship of the country's media.<br>
<p>
7 December: Azerbaijani foreign ministry officials announce that<br>
they have requested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization<br>
(NATO) stage a seminar in Baku to examine issues related to<br>
pipeline security and environmental protection.  Azerbaijani state<br>
oil company SOCAR officials have added that the country's<br>
ministries of defense, interior and national security are seeking<br>
European Union assistance in the formulation of a security policy<br>
to effectively guarantee the safety of the pipelines planned to<br>
export Azerbaijan's significant energy reserves from the Caspian<br>
Sea.<br>
<p>
10 December: Azerbaijani security forces arrest a former special<br>
interior ministry forces (OPON) commander, Yelcin Amiraslanov, on<br>
charges of complicity in the March 1995 armed uprising seeking the<br>
overthrow of the Aliyev government.  To date, some nineteen coup<br>
participants have been arrested.  The March 1995 uprising consisted<br>
of members of the elite OMON branch of the interior ministry and<br>
was brutally defeated by regular army troops.  The elite units were<br>
then dissolved by President Aliyev and replaced by a restructured<br>
division, now known as OPON, and returned to direct control by the<br>
interior ministry.  This latest arrest follows a recent arrest of<br>
the leaders of another coup attempt directed against the Aliyev<br>
regime.  The so-called "Generals' coup," was led by three high<br>
ranking Azerbaijani military generals and involved the former aides<br>
to ousted Prime Minister Surat Guseynov and former Azerbaijani<br>
Communist Party boss and president Ayaz Mutalibov.<br>
<p>
12 December: The Azerbaijani parliament formally approves the<br>
country's 1997 budget.  The $758 million budget includes a $163<br>
million deficit, an increase from last year's budget deficit of<br>
$117 million.  The Azeri economic and finance ministries announce<br>
that the deficit will be financed from the signing bonuses paid to<br>
Azerbaijan by Western oil companies involved in energy deals in the<br>
country.  The government also forecasts a two percent rise in the<br>
Azerbaijani Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  In terms of state<br>
spending, education accounts for the largest amount, followed by<br>
military expenditures and social security and health care.<br>
<p>
14 December: In the fourth international contract between<br>
Azerbaijan and a consortium of Western oil companies anxious to<br>
develop the energy fields of the Caspian Sea, representatives sign<br>
a new deal to explore and develop the offshore Ashrafi and Dan<br>
Uluzu oil fields.  This new contract consists of a consortium of<br>
Western companies including the U.S. firm Amoco with a thirty<br>
percent share, an alliance of California-based UNOCAL with 25.5<br>
percent and the Saudi Arabian firm Delta with 4.5 percent, the<br>
Japanese oil company Itochu with twenty percent, and the<br>
Azerbaijani state oil concern SOCAR with the remaining twenty<br>
percent.  This $2 billion deal focuses on the exploitation of the<br>
two fields which hold an estimated 150 million tons of oil and 50<br>
billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves.  The project plans on<br>
yielding its first commercial exports by the year 2003 and a peak<br>
of seven million tons of crude oil annually by 2007.  This fourth<br>
international contract is the first one to exclude Russian<br>
participation and brings the total amount of foreign investment in<br>
the Azerbaijani energy sector to $13 billion.  This project also<br>
stipulates a bonus payment of $75 million from each of the<br>
consortium members to the Azerbaijani government.  The deal must be<br>
subject to parliamentary approval, however. <br>
<p>
16 December: Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan formally mark the<br>
opening of a new Black Sea ferry link between Odessa and Poti.. <br>
The new transport link is an element of a "Euro-Asian Transport<br>
Corridor" plan calling for the formation of a new regional<br>
infrastructure and transport network connecting all countries in<br>
the region.  The ferry link is vital to Ukraine due to its large<br>
dependence on energy imports from Russia.  Georgia and Azerbaijan<br>
hope to utilize the transit link in the export of oil from offshore<br>
Azerbaijani reserves in the Caspian Sea.  Additional elements of<br>
the regional plan include the construction a new railway line from<br>
Azerbaijan through Georgia, a new $300 million project to construct<br>
a 40 million ton-capacity oil terminal facility at the Ukrainian<br>
port of Pivdenny near Odessa, and the completion of the<br>
modernization of the oil terminal at Batumi on the Georgian Black<br>
Sea coast.<br>
<p>
17 December: Meeting in Moscow with Chechen government official<br>
Eduard Khachukaev, Terry Adams, the chairman of the Azerbaijan<br>
International Oil Company (AIOC), the operational arm of the<br>
consortium of Azerbaijani and Western oil companies involved in the<br>
multi-billion dollar project to develop the offshore energy<br>
reserves of the Caspian Sea, discusses the issue of transporting<br>
oil from Azerbaijan through the pipeline transiting Chechenya.  The<br>
Chechen government is now seeking a share of transit tariffs and<br>
fees from the use of the Baku-Chechenya-Tikhoretsk-Novorossiisk<br>
pipeline.  The use of the this so-called "northern route" pipeline<br>
for transporting Azerbaijani oil is essential to the viability of<br>
the multi-billion oil deal and is strongly advocated by Russia. <br>
Recently, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met with the<br>
interim Chechen government led by Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov to<br>
negotiate the secure use of the pipeline.<br>
<p>
20 December: The U.S. oil company Mobil announces a new plan to<br>
develop the Oguz oil and natural gas deposits in the Caspian Sea. <br>
The offshore reserves are estimated to contain 40 million tons of<br>
crude oil and 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas.  Negotiations<br>
on the details of the project are underway between Mobil and the<br>
Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR.  Both the Russians and the<br>
Iranians are interested in gaining a share in this project.<br>
<p>
21 December: The operational arm of the 12-nation consortium of<br>
international oil companies formed to develop and exploit three<br>
offshore oil fields in the Caspian Sea, the Azerbaijan<br>
International Operating Company (AIOC), announces the completion of<br>
initial drilling in the offshore Azeri and Chirag fields.  The<br>
drilling of the fields by a Western firm marks the first direct<br>
Western involvement in Azerbaijan's energy sector since the<br>
beginning of the century.  Early production from the fields are<br>
expected to be ready for export sometime in early 1997 and will<br>
most likely be recovered from the nearby Guneshli field.<br>

<p>
MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 December: As the international summit of the Organization for<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) looms, Azerbaijani<br>
officials begin pressuring Armenian government figures to soften<br>
the Armenian diplomatic position regarding the Nagorno Karabagh<br>
conflict.  Azerbaijan promises Armenia a share in the revenue from<br>
the multi-billion dollar oil deals underway between Baku and<br>
Western oil companies.<br>
<p>
2-3 December: A summit of the member states of the Organization for<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) convenes in Lisbon to<br>
review the international security group's structure, charter and<br>
agenda of diverse conflict mediation and preventive diplomacy.  The<br>
54-nation OSCE summit places the Nagorno Karabagh conflict high on<br>
its agenda in accordance with its long standing attempt at<br>
mediation over the past several years.  A preliminary mediation<br>
effort is launched by a working group of eleven OSCE nations led by<br>
Finland and Russia preceding the full summit with talks between<br>
Armenian and Azerbaijani officials failing to reach any significant<br>
accord.  The summit's handling of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict<br>
remains deadlocked over Azerbaijan's adamant demand for full<br>
recognition and endorsement of its territorial integrity despite<br>
the Armenian call for a guarantee of the right of self-<br>
determination for Nagorno Karabagh.  The Karabagh position regards<br>
its need for effective security guarantees and the articulation of<br>
its legal and diplomatic status as its priorities.  To date,<br>
Azerbaijan has conceded to offer Nagorno Karabagh a "high degree of<br>
autonomy" within Azerbaijan proper, contingent on the return of the<br>
occupied areas of Azerbaijan currently held by Karabagh forces and<br>
the return of the Azerbaijani refugees to those areas.  <br>
<p>
3 December: The Nagorno Karabagh Central Electoral Commission<br>
announces the final results of the November 24th election in which<br>
President Robert Kocharian was reelected to the presidency. <br>
According to the official final results, Kocharian garnered 88.9<br>
percent of the vote, followed by Boris Aroushanian with 7.05<br>
percent and Hrand Melkoumian with four percent.  Total voter<br>
turnout reached 70,058, or 80 percent of the eligible electorate.<br>
<p>
5 December: The Nagorno Karabagh ministry of health appeals for<br>
medical personnel due to the critical shortage of doctors and other<br>
medical staff in the republic.  According to the ministry, many<br>
qualified medical specialists are serving in the defense forces and<br>
that the shortfall of doctors is not being met by the small number<br>
of trained doctors coming to Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia.<br>
<p>
7 December: Recently reelected Nagorno Karabagh President Robert<br>
Kocharian announces that he is retaining Prime Minister Leonard<br>
Petrosian.  The prime minister is now empowered to form his new<br>
government within the next ten days.  The new government is<br>
reportedly adding new emphasis on the need for introducing more<br>
comprehensive systemic economic reforms and the challenges posed by<br>
the republic's unemployed and pensioners.<br>
<p>
10 December: The Nagorno Karabagh foreign ministry and parliament<br>
issue statements sharply critical of the recent summit of the<br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in<br>
Lisbon.  The statements threaten a review of Nagorno Karabagh's<br>
participation in the OSCE-brokered mediation attempt in light of<br>
the summit's acceptance of the Azerbaijani position regarding the<br>
Nagorno Karabagh conflict.  The Nagorno Karabagh position<br>
specifically faults the OSCE's endorsement of the principle of<br>
territorial integrity over the right of self-determination.  This<br>
conflict of principles is the fundamental diplomatic dispute<br>
deadlocking the mediation of the Karabagh question. <br>
<p>
10 December: Nagorno Karabagh President Robert Kocharian arrives in<br>
France leading a delegation of government officials and ministers. <br>
President Kocharian meets with French Senator Rene Rouquet, the<br>
head of the French Assembly's France-Armenia friendship group.  The<br>
French parliamentarian, speaking at a community gathering with the<br>
Karabagh delegation, commends the will of the Karabagh population<br>
in seeking their independence from Azerbaijan and recognizes the<br>
right of self-determination of Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>
12 December: Arriving in Stepanakert on a working visit,<br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)<br>
representative Anjey Kasprchik meets with Nagorno Karabagh<br>
officials to review the situation in the region and to discuss<br>
further mediation efforts by the international security group in<br>
the wake of the recent summit in Lisbon.  The meetings also discuss<br>
the security needs of the Karabagh population.<br>
<p>
25 December: The Russian co-chairman of the OSCE Minsk group for<br>
Nagorno Karabagh Yuri Yukalov meets with Nagorno Karabagh officials<br>
in Stepanakert during a visit to the region.  The OSCE official<br>
also met with the Azerbaijani president and some Armenian officials<br>
earlier in the trip.  During the meetings, the OSCE representative<br>
favored continuing the mediation talks aimed at reaching a<br>
settlement of the Karabagh conflict.  In a statement made at the<br>
OSCE summit meeting in Lisbon, the current OSCE chairman, Swiss<br>
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, adhered to a strict set of<br>
principles to settle the Karabagh conflict.  These principles<br>
consisted of the recognition of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity<br>
by the international community, the granting of autonomy to Nagorno<br>
Karabagh and the guarantee of the security of the Nagorno Karabagh<br>
population.<br>
<p>
29 December: By the terms of a presidential decree, President<br>
Kocharian announces the new members of the Nagorno Karabagh<br>
cabinet.  Gerard Poghossian is appointed deputy prime minister;<br>
Minister of Health Care, Julia Logorian; Minister of Foreign<br>
Affairs, Arkady Ghoukasian; Minister of Agriculture, Valery<br>
Alexanian; Minister of Economy and Finance, Spartak Tevossian;<br>
Minister of Education and Science, Hamlet Assatrian; Minister of<br>
Internal Affairs, Garen Babayan; Minister of Construction, Edward<br>
Shahramanian; Minister of Defense, Samvel Babayan; Minister of<br>
Social Security, Serge Aroushanian; Minister of Justice, Yuri<br>
Hayrapetian; and Head of the Department for Statistics, State<br>
Register and Analysis, Oleg Yessayan.<br>

<p>
In 1981 the ensemble took part in the Transcaucasian Festival of<br>
ensembles and got the first prize. It was on tours in Russia,<br>
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The ensemble's performing style is<br>
greatky influenced by such great masters as Alexey Lubimov and Tatiana<br>
Grindenko. Since 1994, the ensemble bears the name "Kem" and enjoys<br>
the patronage of various church organizations.  The program of the<br>
ensemble usually includes works of the Armenian, German, French,<br>

MISAK MEDZARENTS REMEMBERED IN ISTANBUL - <br>
<p>
(ISTANBUL - "Lraper" 8/Jan/1997) The 110th birth anniversary of the<br>
Western Armenian poet Misak Mezarents was celebrated in Istanbul.<br>
<p>
On 21 December a commemorative event had been organized in the<br>
Bezciyan Hall in Kumkapi by the joint efforts of the Armenian<br>
Patriarchate of Istanbul, the Parish Council of the Surp Astvadzadzin<br>
Cathedral in Kumkapi and the Getronagan Alumni Association in<br>
Istanbul. By 18.00 hours all 600 seats in the hall were occupied by<br>
the admirers of Medzarents, and many others followed the event,<br>
standing.<br>
<p>
The two MCs were Miss Carolyn Sariboyajian and Mr Hagop Mamigonian,<br>
both teachers in the Getronagan Lycee where Medzarents studied.The<br>
Headmistress of the Getronagan Lycee read a paper, in which she<br>
highlighted the place of Medzarents in Western Armenian<br>
literature. The second and main paper was delivered by an<br>
intellectual, Mrs Armine Yazdanian, who also taught in the Get-<br>
ronagan. Mrs Yazdanian presented a literary analysis of some of<br>
Medzarents' poems. Two very poignant letters addressed to Medzarents<br>
and written by the present students of the Lycee were read by Miss<br>
Narod Nayirian and Mr Mihran Tovmasian.  Mrs Ovsanna Kalender,<br>
director of the Getronagan Choir, and accompanied by pianist Mr Sevan<br>
Agoshian, sang two songs arranged from Medazrents' poems. Mrs Silva<br>
Gomigian then recited some 10 poems of Medzarents.<br>
<p>
The program ended with the final words of His Beatitude Patriarch<br>
Karekin II of Istanbul who presided over the event. Also present were<br>
His Graces Archbishops Tirayr Mardikian of Romania and Mesrob Mutafyan<br>
of the Patriarchal Religious Council.<br>

FIRE IN THE ARMENIAN PATRIARCHATE OF ISTANBUL - <br>
<p>
(ISTANBUL - "Lraper" 8/Jan/1997) Midnight of 30 December 1996 fire<br>
broke in the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul. The fire which began<br>
in the roof was caused by the storm which hit the chimney of the<br>
wooden structure. The Fire department of Istanbul was on the site in<br>
less than 10 minutes, and aided by the security officials, it was soon<br>
put out successfully. The damages are minor.<br>
<p>
His Beatitude Patriarch Karekin II of Istanbul, who was resting in his<br>
room on the third floor of the building suffered a minor bruise on his<br>
left shoulder as his head spinned because of the heavy smoke and fell<br>
on the floor.  The members of the Brotherhood of the Patriarchate were<br>
also in the building but were spared any injuries.<br>
<p>
The Armenian community once again felt it necessary to reconstruct the<br>
structure as it is but of stone. The church authorities decided to<br>
apply to the government for the necessaru permission.<br>

PILGRIMAGE TO TOMB OF MEDZARENTS - <br>
<p>
(ISTANBUL - "Lraper" 8/Jan/1997) The students from various Armenian<br>
schools in Istanbul paid a pilgrimage to the tomb of Misak Medzarents<br>
in the historic Balikli cemetery, on the occasion of the 110th birth<br>
anniversary celebrations of the famous poet.<br>
<p>
The pilgrimage started from the Saint Gregory the Illuminator's Church<br>
adjacent to Getronagan Lycee in Ghalatia, where lies Patriarch<br>
Hovhannes Golod, the patron par excellence of Western Armenian<br>
literature. Approximately 100 students then walked all the way along<br>
the Sea of Marmara, past the Golden Horn, the Topkapi Palace, the<br>
Armenian Patriarchate and finally arrived at the Balikli cemetery<br>
after a walk that lasted nearly five hours. The students also fasted,<br>
and decided to have on them nothing but flowers for Medzarents and<br>
booklets of Medzarents poems.<br>
<p>
The Patriarchal Vicar Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan joined the young<br>
pilgrims at the Zeytinburnu gates of the old city walls and walked<br>
with them towards the cemetery. Fr Varujan Terterian of Yerevan also<br>
joined the pilgrims.<br>
<p>
A memorial service was held at the grave site. The MC was Miss Silva<br>
Kuyumjian, headmistress of the Getronagan Lycee. Quite a few poems<br>
were recited here by the students. Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan<br>
delivered a heartfelt message in which he characterized Medzarents as<br>
a remarkable student, who received education at foreign schools<br>
founded by Protestant missionaries from abroad, but who remained loyal<br>
to his people's traditions, culture and faith.<br>
<p>
A religious service was then held at the end of which the students<br>
laid hundreds of flowers on the tomb of Medzarents.<br>
<p>
The youths also visited the tombs of poet Garbis Janjikian, educator<br>
Verjin Deoshemejian, Catholicos Toros of Cilicia, artist Hagop Arad<br>
and others.<br>

Armenia/Azerbaijan: France To Co-Chair Nagorno-Karabakh Talks<br>
<p>
By Roland Eggleston<br>
<p>
Vienna, 7 January 1997 (RFE/RL) - The Organization for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has named France the new<br>
co-chair of the deadlocked negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.<br>
The other co-chair is Russia, whose post is permanent. <br>
<p>
An OSCE spokesman today told RFE/RL that France had won the post over the<br>
United States. The United States had campaigned<br>
actively for the co-chair post during last month's OSCE summit in Lisbon.<br>
U.S. diplomats in Vienna today told an RFE/RL<br>
correspondent that they were "disappointed," but made no other comment. <br>
<p>
France succeeds Finland, which surrendered the co-chair in December after<br>
20 months in office. OSCE said the chief French negotiator<br>
will be the Director-General of Political and Security Affairs at France's<br>
Foreign Ministry, Jacques Blot. He replaces Finland's<br>
Ambassador, Heikki Talvitie. <br>
<p>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an enclave inside Azerbaijan largely populated by<br>
ethnic Armenians. Fighting erupted in 1988 after the ethnic<br>
Armenians declared sovereignty. The OSCE arranged a ceasefire in May 1994,<br>
but has been unable to convert this into a permanent<br>
settlement or arrange the return of refugees. Azerbaijan continues to<br>
insist that Nagorno-Karabakh remain under its control, although<br>
Baku says it is willing to grant a considerable degree of autonomy. <br>
<p>
Negotiations are conducted by an 11-state group under the co-chairs.<br>
France and the United States are members of this group, and<br>
Finland will continue to participate in it. <br>
<p>
The appointment of France as co-chair was made by the outgoing chairman of<br>
the OSCE, Switzerland's Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti.<br>
Diplomats said Cotti had canvassed the opinions of all 54 active members<br>
of OSCE. The appointment took effect January 1. <br>
<p>
Diplomats in Vienna tell our correspondent that France had sought the<br>
position in keeping with its policy that Europeans should have a<br>
greater share of top posts in international organizations. The diplomats<br>
said Russia also preferred to have France as the other co-chair,<br>
rather than the United States. <br>
<p>
Nagorno-Karabakh was a major issue at the December Lisbon summit. A public<br>
quarrel between Armenia and Azerbaijan prevented<br>
the summit from reaching agreement on a statement to be included in the<br>
summit's final document. A declaration outlining possible<br>
principles for a settlement was issued separately by OSCE chairman Cotti,<br>
but was immediately rejected by Armenia in a formal<br>
statement. <br>
<p>
The chairman's declaration said three principles, which should form part<br>
of the a settlement, had been recommended by Russia and<br>
Finland as co-chairs of the negotiating group. Cotti said these principles<br>
were supported by all members of the international negotiating<br>
group -- but not accepted by Armenia. They were: <br>
<p>
  Maintenance of the territorial integrity of Armenia and Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
  A definition of the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh in an agreement<br>
based on self-determination, allowing Stepanakert the highest<br>
degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
  Guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole population --<br>
including mutual obligations to ensure that all parties<br>
complied with the settlement. <br>
<p>
Immediately afterward, Armenia issued its own declaration, which was<br>
included in the summit's final document as an annex. It said the<br>
chairman's statement "does not reflect the spirit or the letter" of the<br>
mandate of the international group trying to achieve a political<br>
agreement. Armenia complained that the chairman's statement pre-determined<br>
the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, in contradiction to<br>
agreements reached by the OSCE when negotiations first began in 1992. <br>
<p>
Despite their differences, both Armenia and Azerbaijan said they were<br>
ready to continue negotiations on a settlement. An OSCE<br>
spokesman said today a meeting would "probably" be arranged soon, but<br>
could not say whether it would be this month. <br>

        4,000 PEOPLE SICK WITH ALCOHOLISM REGISTERED IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 8, ARMENPRESS.<br>
Today more than 4,000 people are registered in Armenia as chronic<br>
alcoholics, and unfortunately this number grows each year. According<br>
to Director of Republican Narcological Center Seda Djamalian, the main<br>
reason for this is the difficult social situation in which the<br>
population lives. Ms. Jamalian thinks that the Government should work<br>
out an antialcoholic program, take under its control the production of<br>
drinks, as well as their import to the Republic.<br>
Around 60 patients are undergoing a course of treatment in<br>
narcological center of Yerevan. According to the observations of the<br>
experts only 20% of those undergone treatment gives up drinking<br>
forever.<br>

1996 WAS A TURNING-POINT FOR ARMENIAN <br>
SCIENCE, NAS PRESIDENT SAYS<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 7 (Noyan Tapan). The year of 1996 was a<br>
turning-point in the work of the National Academy of Sciences,<br>
NAS President Fadey Sargssian said at a recent news conference<br>
in Yerevan.<br>
     He pointed out to some priorities in Armenia's science<br>
which are mainly related to energy, ecology, history,<br>
archaeology, geology, defense industries, seismic-resistant<br>
construction, etc. <br>
     Armenia has intensified its scientific relations with<br>
Russia and other CIS-member countries. For instance, a joint<br>
scientific center for parasitology founded on the basis of the<br>
Armenian Zoology Institute and Russian Institute for<br>
Parasitology started to operate in 1996. Another joint<br>
scientific center set up on the basis of the Armenian and<br>
Russian Biochemistry Institutes will start to operate soon.<br>
     The Armenian Academy of Sciences has also established ties<br>
with major scientific establishments of the USA, United Kingdom,<br>
France, Iran and China. Surveys for mineral resources as well as<br>
research aimed at creating new cheap compositional materials are<br>
being conducted within the framework of various joint scientific<br>
projects. A project on transmission of medical consultations via<br>
video system has been worked out jointly with the US Public<br>
Health Institute. Also a project on cultivation of quick-growing<br>
poplars is being implemented in association with the California<br>
University. The Academy also signed an agreement with Hungarian<br>
party on exchange of scientists.<br>
     Last year Armenian scientists participated in a number of<br>
international scientific conferences. In Armenia NAS organized<br>
13 sceintific forums with participation of foreign scientists.<br>
     Fadey Sargssian said that the intensive development of<br>
international ties helped to maintain not only scientific<br>
potential but also ensured the development of scientific trends<br>
which are of paramount importance for the Republic and for which<br>
separate funds have been earmarked. Sarkissian noted that the<br>
presidential decree on the National Academy of Sciences issued<br>
in 1993 had been actually realized in a new provision on<br>
providing funds to the Academy. Under the new provision NAS will<br>
be financed through special funds, which include basic financing<br>
and grants earmarked under implementation of concrete projects. <br>
     "We'll do everything so as to maintain and even multiply<br>
the achievements of the Armenian science," President of NAS<br>
said.<br>

JAN QEZHUN: "OUR RELATIONS <br>
WILL HAVE PROGRESS"<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 7 (Noyan Tapan). In 1996 the relations<br>
between China and Armenia were marked by a number of very<br>
important events, that are first of all the mutual visits of top<br>
officials of the two countries. In April Deputy State Council's<br>
Premier, Foreign Minister of China Xiang Xicheng paid a visit to<br>
Armenia. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian and Parliament<br>
Speaker Babken Ararktsian visited China. The same year Armenia<br>
opened an embassy in China.<br>
     Below is an interview with Ambassador of China to Armenia<br>
Jan Qezhun, in which he expressed his opinion about the<br>
development of relations between the two states.<br>
<p>
     Q. How can you characterize the relations between China and<br>
Armenia? What does Armenia mean for China?<br>
     A. People's Republic of China was among the first states to<br>
recognize Armenia's independence and established diplomatic<br>
relations with it on April 6, 1992. China's only wish is to<br>
contribute to the stability and peace in the whole<br>
Transcaucasian region to ensure its progress and prosperity.<br>
China pursues independent policy of development of relations<br>
with all countries. There are no political discords between<br>
China and Armenia. China backs Armenia's efforts aimed at<br>
protecting its sovereignty and independence. We are glad to see<br>
Armenia as our strategic partner and are ready to cooperate with<br>
her in solving international problems on the level of the<br>
biggest international organizations, such as UN. This was<br>
contributed by President Levon Ter-Petrossian's visit to China<br>
last May, during which Mr.Ter-Petrossian confirmed that Armenia<br>
would never recognize other Chinese state but only the People's<br>
Republic of China.<br>
<p>
     Q. What are the agreements that were and that will be<br>
signed between our two states?<br>
     A. Armenia and China concluded agreements on cooperation in<br>
practically all spheres of trade, economy, science and culture. <br>
     During a visit to China in 1992 Vice President and Premier<br>
Gagik Haroutiunian signed a number of governmental agreements:<br>
on extension and mutual protection of investments, in field of<br>
science and technique, culture, health care, tourism etc. There<br>
was also signed an agreement under which China was to give<br>
Armenia $4-million credit that has been already fulfilled by<br>
China.<br>
     During a visit by President Levon Ter-Petrossian, he and<br>
Chinese leader Xiang Xeming signed a communigue which set a base<br>
for further relations. They also concluded agreements on mutual<br>
evasion of double taxation, on cooperation in banking sphere and<br>
aviatransport.<br>
     For the years of 1997-1998 there have been signed protocols<br>
on concrete plans of cooperations in field of culture and<br>
tourism.<br>
<p>
     Q. Is your country going to invest in Armenia or open joint<br>
ventures? Do you see a chance to cooperate in developing new<br>
technologies?<br>
     A. Economic cooperations between China and Armenia have<br>
ancient traditions. Our countries were linked by the Great Silk<br>
Route. We have a high potential to develop trade-economic<br>
relations. The major obstacle to develop trade is the<br>
transportation problems. More favorable is the situation with<br>
the establishment of joint ventures that is encouraged by the<br>
Chinese government.<br>
     Upon improvement of the legislative base there can be<br>
expected growth of China's investments in Armenia.<br>
     In conclusion Mr. Qezhun said: "I am an optimist and I am<br>
confident that thanks to joint efforts our relations will have a<br>
progress and majority of problems will be solved in the near<br>
future.<br>

NDU LEADER CONGRATULATES <br>
DEFENDANTS<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, January 7 (Noyan Tapan). Leader of the<br>
National-Democratic Union Vazgen Manoukian congratulated Vahan<br>
Hovhanessian accused in connection with the 31 case on occasion<br>
of the New Year and Christmas.<br>
     "I would like to wish you and all our friends in custody a<br>
Happy New Year and Merry Christmas. I wish that the year of 1997<br>
be the year of freedom for you and our people. Despite their<br>
tragic nature last year's events showed that we have a wonderful<br>
people (the opinion of our leaders that the population is<br>
disappointed and broken down did not prove to be true) and<br>
nothing should be spared for the sake of our people. Be strong,"<br>
the message reads. <br>
     NDU Board member Vladimir Hakhverdian reported that<br>
Manoukian addressed congratulatory messages to other defendants,<br>
accused in connection with the case of 31, as well as to those<br>

4. PRELACY HOSTS ANNUAL CHRISTMAS DINNER<br>
MONTEBELLO-The Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic <br>
Church hosted its annual traditional Christmas dinner on <br>
Monday, January 6 in Montebellos Bagramian Hall, with more <br>
than 650 people in attendance.<br>
	Following a formal procession into the hall by Prelate <br>
Moushegh Mardirossian and members of the clergy representing <br>
the various prelacy churches in the Southland, Master of <br>
Ceremonies, Rev. Vicken Vassilian of Holy Martyrs Church in <br>

<p>
<p>
5. CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST LIBARIDIAN TO CONTINUE IN <br>
ARMENIAN COURTS<br>
NEW YORK-On December 19, 1996, the plaintiffs in the class-<br>
action suit against Armenian Presidential Advisor Gerard <br>
Libaridian sought to withdraw their case from the United <br>
States federal district court in order to attempt to pursue <br>
their cases in Armenian courts, according to a statement <br>
issued by the Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-<br>
profit human rights group based in New York.<br>
	The suit charged Libaridian with legal responsibility for <br>
his role in the violent government crackdown against <br>
ordinary citizens and various members of opposition <br>
political parties and their families and neighbors, <br>
following the September 21, 1996 presidential election in <br>
Armenia, which was judged by election observers to be <br>
neither fair nor free.<br>
	The plaintiffs sought remedy for the injuries they <br>
suffered during the crackdown, when government forces <br>
rounded up more than 175 men and women, including members of <br>
the National Assembly, subjected them to beatings, torture <br>
and interrogation, and kept them captive in jails and <br>
isolation wards around the country for extended periods of <br>
time.<br>
	Many were held for over two weeks and suffered <br>
severe injuries requiring hospitalization. During <br>
their imprisonment, they had no contact with their <br>
families, and were not allowed access to counsel. At <br>
the same time, the government attacked a number of <br>
opposition political party offices, destroying or <br>
confiscating all of the parties records, equipment <br>
and property.<br>
	Sarah Leah Whitson, CESRs general counsel and an adviser <br>
on the case, commented: "The plaintiffs in this case are <br>
exceedingly brave, and have a sincere hope that they can <br>
move their country back on a democratic path. They are <br>
taking an enormous risk by choosing to pursue their cases in <br>
Armenian courts, where they have virtually no assurance that <br>
they will receive a fair trial. By bringing their cases in <br>
Armenia, they are giving the courts there another <br>
opportunity for redemption as an independent judicial body <br>
committed to protecting the rights of Armenias citizens and <br>
to seeing that justice is done."<br>
	"We will stand behind the plaintiffs in this case with <br>
every resource at our disposal. We will continue to provide <br>
them with legal assistance on questions of international law <br>
and to coordinate our efforts with local human rights groups <br>
in Armenia," she said. <br>
	Roger Normand, executive director of CESR, said: "We <br>
believe that several of the cases primary objectives have <br>
been achieved.  This case has sent a strong message to the <br>
government of Armenia that those responsible for violating <br>
international law and abusing the rights of other citizens <br>
can be held personally liable and brought to justice even in <br>
courts outside their country."<br>
	"The international community is watching the Armenian <br>
government very closely; we know the government knows that," <br>
he added.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 4, Part I, 7 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN CATCHES "COLD," CANCELS MEETINGS . . . Presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembskii announced on 6 January that, owing to a "serious
cold" and a slightly high temperature, President Boris Yeltsin had
postponed the scheduled 8 January session of the Defense Council and
several other meetings, including a scheduled visit by Bulgarian
President-elect Petar Stoyanov, Russian and Western agencies reported.
Yastrzhembskii denied that Yeltsin's illness was connected with his 5
November heart surgery, and said the president had probably caught the
influenza virus which is currently sweeping Moscow. Yastrzhembskii
refuted reports that a special "medical council" of top doctors had
convened to discuss the president's condition. Last July, before the
second round of the presidential election, administration officials
blamed a cold for Yeltsin's failure to appear in public, although later
it was revealed that the president had suffered a heart attack. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
. . . ORDERS PREPARATION OF COUNTERMEASURES TO NATO ENLARGEMENT. Earlier
On 6 January, Yeltsin chaired a special meeting to discuss Russia-NATO
relations which was attended by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
presidential Chief of Staff Anatolii Chubais, and other top officials,
Russian and international agencies reported. Yastrzhembskii said the
meeting had "unanimously confirmed" Moscow's "explicitly negative
position" on NATO enlargement. He added that Yeltsin had directed
Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov to devise a flexible "action plan" of
various measures which Russia might take if the alliance accepts new
Eastern European members. Meanwhile, Western diplomatic sources told
Reuters that in his 4 January meeting with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Yeltsin took a hard line, insisting that before NATO invites new
members to join, it offer Russia a legally binding consultation
agreement granting Moscow a voice in alliance decisions like
enlargement. NATO officials have consistently rebuffed such suggestions
in the past. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
SPLIT IN MILITARY LEADERSHIP OVER REFORM PLANS? The Russian military
leadership is divided over how to approach the issue of military reform,
according to a 6 January Interfax report monitored by the BBC. The
agency said that the next session of the Defense Council had been
postponed largely because of disagreement among military leaders over
whether to move ahead with reform at current funding levels, or delay it
until additional funds are budgeted. Many military leaders, including
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, have insisted that additional funding
beyond the 104 trillion rubles ($18.9 billion) contained in the 1997
draft budget is needed to begin reform, while the agency said others
believe that waiting for additional funds is "unrealistic," and argue
that the collapse of the military will accelerate unless the limited
budget funds available are used to immediately begin downsizing the
military. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA REJECTS CRITICISM OF CYPRUS MISSILE DEAL. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Grigorii Tarasov rejected as "groundless" criticism by the
United States, Britain, and Turkey of the contract under which Moscow
will supply S-300 air defense missiles to Greek-controlled Cyprus (see
OMRI Daily Digest, 6 January 1997), Russian and Western agencies
reported on 6 January. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has filed a protest
note with Moscow, saying the missile deal "creates a threat to peace on
Cyprus," while the U.S. State Department termed the weapons sale "a step
in the wrong direction." Tarasov insisted that the purchase of the
"defensive armaments" by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot
government does not threaten anyone, adding that Russia "does not see
any reason to curtail its military-technical cooperation with Cyprus."
-- Scott Parrish
<p>
CHECHEN SECTION OF PIPELINE MAY NOT BE READY. The president of
Chechnya's Southern Oil Company, Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, complained to
ITAR-TASS on 7 January that the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy had
not signed an agreement on use of the Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline
crossing Chechnya by the 1 December deadline which had been agreed by
Chernomyrdin and Aslan Maskhadov when they met in Moscow on 23 November.
Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev recently ordered his own personal
battalion to take steps to shut down all the republic's illegal oil
producers, Rossiiskaya gazeta reported on 6 January. Apart from
operating their own wells, they also siphoned off oil from the pipeline,
when it was functioning. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
INFLATION HITS NEW LOW. The annual inflation rate for 1996 was 21.8%,
down from 131% in 1995 and the lowest since 1990, ITAR-TASS reported on
6 January. In December, prices rose just 1.4%, and the 1997 budget sets
an inflation target of 11.8% for the year. Some analysts question the
relevance of the inflation figures, noting the growing use of barter and
money surrogates. However, another positive sign is that nominal annual
interest rates on new six-month government bonds have fallen to around
35%, down from a peak of 150% a year ago. (Foreign purchasers of the
bonds are limited to a dollar interest rate of 13%). ITAR-TASS reported
on 6 January that the federal budget deficit for the first 10 months of
1996 was 63.3 trillion rubles, which was 24% of total budget spending
and 3.5% of GDP. It was financed by the sale of government securities
(61%--38 trillion rubles) and external borrowing (39%). -- Peter Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
U.S. TO SEEK PROSECUTION OF GEORGIAN DIPLOMAT . . . The United States
will ask the Georgian government to waive immunity for a diplomat to
allow his prosecution in the U.S. for a car accident in Washington that
caused the death of a 16-year-old American girl, Western agencies
reported on 6 January. Georgi Makharadze, 35, reportedly triggered a
five-car crash while drunk. The U.S. State Department said it is
awaiting police reports and a decision from the attorney general,
expected on 7 January, on whether to begin criminal proceedings against
Makharadze. An unidentified White House official told AFP that if the
Georgian government declines the request "we will ask the government to
remove the diplomat from the country." Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze has sent a letter of condolence to the family of the dead
girl and said Makharadze "should take responsibility." -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
. . . AMID CALLS TO SUSPEND U.S. AID TO GEORGIA. A Republican senator
urged President Bill Clinton to suspend aid to Georgia unless the latter
strips Makharadze of diplomatic immunity, Reuters reported on 6 January.
In a letter to Clinton, Senator Judd Gregg said that would be the only
"strong" and "appropriate" action for the U.S. government. A spokesman
for the Georgian embassy in Washington did not comment on Gregg's letter
but said any decision on a waiver of immunity will be a "decision
between the two governments." Georgia is slated to get $30 million in
financial aid from the United States for the 1997 fiscal year. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the United States expressed
"very, very serious" concern to the Georgian ambassador, but defended
diplomatic immunity "as a concept." -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
RUSSIA, AZERBAIJAN TALKS. A Russian delegation led by Deputy Prime
Minister Valerii Serov is in Baku for talks on a wide range of
bilateral, as well as CIS-related, issues, Russian media reported on 6
January. Talks are expected to focus on bilateral trade and economic
cooperation, the repayment of Azerbaijan's debts to Russia, and the
time-frame and volume for Azeri oil to be transited via Russian
territory. Both Azerbaijan and Russia have announced that their
respective segments of the 1411 km-long Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline are
ready to carry Azeri oil to international markets, Russian agencies
reported. Azerbaijan wants to start pumping some 30,000 metric tons of
oil in February. -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
TAJIK TALKS OPEN IN IRAN. With a ceasefire agreed in Moscow in December
by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and United Tajik Opposition (UTO)
leader Said Abdullo Nuri still holding, delegations from both sides met
in the Iranian capital Tehran on 6 January, international media
reported. The talks, delayed by one day, are to discuss the formation of
a National Reconciliation Commission which is to help pave the way for
new parliamentary elections within 12-18 months. Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati welcomed members of the delegations and
called on them to "be forgiving and show understanding." AFP reports
that the formation of the commission dominated the first day of the
talks, with the government delegation rejecting a proposal for 40% of
the commission to be made up of UTO representatives. Talks are scheduled
to continue all this week. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
TRIAL OF TURGUNALIYEV CONTINUES IN KYRGYZSTAN. The case against
Topchubek Turgunaliyev, chairman of the Erkin Kyrgyzstan Party,
continued in Bishkek municipal court on 6 January, RFE/RL reported.
Turgunaliyev is facing embezzlement charges for the misappropriation of
$10,000 from the Bishkek Humanitarian University when he was its rector
in 1994. State prosecutor Marat Kenjakunov asked the court to seize all
Turgunaliyev's property and sentence him to a 12-year term in prison.
Timur Stamkulov, the former commercial director of the university, is a
codefendant and Kenjakunov asked for him to be sentenced to seven years
in jail. Turgunaliyev's lawyers argue that Turgunaliyev is a political
victim, noting that the trial is taking place in a criminal not a civil
court and pointing out that Turgunaliyev was taken into custody at a
December demonstration where a new movement "For Deliverance from
Poverty" was founded. -- Bruce Pannier and Naryn Idinov

BABY-THEFT SCANDAL IN UKRAINE. The trial over the illegal adoption of
babies in Ivano-Frankivsk has had political reverberations, NTV and
Intelnews reported on 6 January. The deputy head of the Lviv regional
administration, Yurii Zyma, was dismissed from his post by President
Leonid Kuchma. Zyma was charged with complicity in the illegal
adoptions, along with the chief doctor of the Lviv Oblast state hospital
Bohdan Fedak; another doctor, Volodymyr Droshenko; and the former head
of the oblast administration, Zinovii Ursul. Between 1992 and 1994, over
130 newborns from the west Ukrainian hospital were sold to Westerners
for $6,000-13,000 each, while the mothers were told their babies had
been stillborn. In all of Ukraine, 802 babies were sold without their
parents' consent. The fate of 630 is still unknown, and Interpol has
been looking into the cases. -- Ustina Markus

SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
HUGE ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS EVE MARCH IN BELGRADE. A crowd of at least
200,000 people walked through the Serbian capital to St. Sava's
cathedral to mark Orthodox Christmas Eve in yet another day of protests
against the cancellation of the 17 November local election results. The
protest was typically good-natured and peaceful, except for a reported
small explosion at the headquarters of JUL, the small left-wing party
led by Mirjana Markovic, the wife of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, AFP noted on 7 January. After Patriarch Pavle said mass at
the cathedral, opposition leaders made speeches outside and presented
5,000 gift boxes for the children of their supporters. The usually
uncommunicative police had earlier assured the demonstrators that they
would not interfere with Christmas processions. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
WILL FEDERAL YUGOSLAV ARMY UNITS MOVE AGAINST MILOSEVIC? Following
discussions between army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic and student
leaders on 6 January, the army issued a letter saying the military will
not allow itself to be used against peaceful protesters (see OMRI Daily
Digest, 6 January 1996). The text stated that problems must be solved by
peaceful and constitutional means, Nasa Borba wrote on 7 January,
thereby ruling out the possibility that Milosevic could rely on the army
to crush dissent as he did in March 1991. The London daily The
Independent, moreover, reported on 7 January that at least some units
may be ready to turn on Milosevic if he tries to declare a state of
emergency, AFP wrote. The Serbian leader has never gotten on well with
the military, which resents his building up a powerful police force as
his own Praetorian Guard. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BOSNIAN SERB LEADERS OPPOSE MILOSEVIC. Aleksa Buha, who succeeded
Radovan Karadzic as head of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), in his
Christmas message on 6 January called on Milosevic to avoid bloodshed
and respect the election results. Buha said: "It is stupid to stubbornly
refuse to recognize what the laws of civilization dictate," AFP and Nasa
Borba reported. Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic repeated her
earlier declaration of support for the students. There has long been
little love lost between Milosevic and the Pale leadership, which feels
that the Serbian president has repeatedly betrayed vital Bosnian Serb
interests for his own political purposes. Milosevic backed opponents of
the SDS in last September's Bosnian elections. -- Patrick Moore

          Carnegie Corp. Picks a Chief in Gregorian<br>
<p>
          By JUDITH MILLER<br>
<p>
          The Carnegie Corporation has chosen Vartan Gregorian, the<br>
exuberant scholar who revitalized the New York Public Library and led<br>
Brown University for the last eight years, as its new president.<br>
<p>
          Mr. Gregorian will replace David A. Hamburg, a 71-year-old<br>
educator and scientist, as head of the foundation, based in midtown<br>
Manhattan.  Last year, it gave away $59 million to more than 335<br>
organizations in the United States and abroad for projects aimed at<br>
promoting education and peace. <br>
<p>
          Spokesmen for the 86-year-old Carnegie Corporation, the nation's<br>
16th largest foundation, said the board was expected to approve the choice<br>
of Mr. Gregorian at its annual meeting on Thursday. <br>
<p>
          During the 14-year-tenure of Dr. Hamburg, Carnegie's assets<br>
quadrupled, thanks largely to the soaring value of its investments, and<br>
now total $1.4 billion.<br>
<p>
          In an interview, Mr. Gregorian said he needed time to learn<br>
Carnegie's culture before deciding what his priorities would be, but he<br>
spoke of the need for foundations to cooperate more in carrying out social<br>
goals.<br>
<p>
          At its meeting on Thursday, the Carnegie board is also expected<br>
to elect Thomas H. Kean as its new chairman. Mr. Kean is the president of<br>
Drew University and a former Governor of New Jersey. Mr. Kean has been a<br>
Carnegie board member since 1991. He would succeed Newton N.  Minow, a<br>
member of the Sidley &amp; Austin law firm.<br>
<p>
          Mr. Kean said Mr. Gregorian's expertise in both education and<br>
the promotion of peace and conflict resolution "are a perfect fit" with<br>
Carnegie's mandate.<br>
<p>
          Under Dr. Hamburg's tenure, Carnegie greatly expanded its<br>
programs, not only in education, adding commitments in child and<br>
adolescent development, but also its activities aimed at defusing cold war<br>
tensions and ethnic conflicts abroad, expanding Andrew Carnegie's original<br>
mandate to "promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and<br>
understanding."<br>
<p>
          Carnegie's staff also increased to more than 100, from 10, and<br>
its grants rose to almost $60 million a year, from $10 million. <br>
<p>
          For his part, Mr. Gregorian helped strengthen Brown academically<br>
and raised its profile in the Ivy League. Brown's current freshman class<br>
of 1,482, was drawn from the largest applicant pool, 15,009, in the<br>
university's history, and was its most highly rated group of freshmen.<br>
<p>
          Brown's trustees were informed of Mr. Gregorian's departure via<br>
phone calls from Mr. Gregorian this weekend and a letter from Alva O. <br>
Way, chairman of Brown's board, circulated yesterday. <br>
<p>
          He will leave in July. <br>
<p>
          Several trustees called Mr. Gregorian's departure a loss, but<br>
not unexpected. Mr. Gregorian, 62, had pledged to stay at Brown at least 5<br>
years, but no more than 10.<br>
<p>
          "He exceeded my expectations," said Mr. Way, who said in his<br>
letter to Brown trustees that Mr. Gregorian's departure "would not be<br>
welcome to those of us who care deeply about Brown." <br>
<p>
          Friends and colleagues said that though he had long desired to<br>
return to New York, Mr. Gregorian refused to leave Brown until the end of<br>
its capital campaign. After being extended by six months, the campaign<br>
exceeded its goal of $450 million in May 1995, reaching $534 million by<br>
last July.<br>
<p>
          "It will be wonderful to give money away rather than raise it," <br>
said Mr.  Gregorian, a scholar and educator who more than doubled Brown's<br>
endowment to over $800 million, expanded its library to three million<br>
volumes, from two million, and brought 270 new faculty members to Brown<br>
after assuming the presidency in 1989. Mr. Gregorian said he was thrilled<br>
to be returning to New York, but that he would miss friends, colleagues<br>
and students in Providence.<br>
<p>
          In his letter of resignation, Mr. Gregorian referred to the<br>
enormous personal and professional toll paid by university presidents, now<br>
required to be not just institutional and community leaders but full-time<br>
fund-raisers as well. <br>
<p>
          "I believe presidents of major nonprofit institutions,<br>
especially our universities, need periodic renewals, and the institutions<br>
need new leadership," he wrote. "I have decided that nine years of service<br>
is enough." <br>
<p>
          In an interview, Mr. Gregorian spoke of his frustration at<br>
having to abandon most of his scholarly pursuits as Brown's 16th<br>
president.  Though he taught a course last semester on de Tocqueville's<br>
vision of democracy in America, "I was depressed by staring at the eight<br>
filing cabinets worth of research I had collected with no time to write,"<br>
he said.<br>
<p>
          Mr. Gregorian is the first Carnegie president to be chosen from<br>
outside the foundation. The post paid $450,000 last year, compared with<br>
his $225,000 salary at Brown. Mr. Gregorian said that he had not yet<br>
negotiated his salary, but that compensation was not an important<br>
priority.<br>
<p>
          "To be a university president or a foundation head requires a<br>
sense of mission," he said. <br>
<p>
          In his letter, Mr. Gregorian also noted that he had "declined<br>
many attractive opportunities" to fulfill his commitments to Brown. <br>
<p>
          Mr. Gregorian has a reputation as a visionary educator and an<br>
energetic fund-raiser. In his eight years as president and chief executive<br>
at the New York Public Library, Mr. Gregorian, with Andrew Heiskell, the<br>
library's former chairman, revitalized a neglected cultural institution<br>
whose budget had been slashed and staff was demoralized. <br>
<p>
          Together, they organized imaginative and colorful appeals to<br>
foundations, corporations and wealthy New Yorkers that raised $270 million<br>
toward a $307 million fund-raising campaign. Using a mix of badgering,<br>
guilt and charm, Mr. Gregorian persuaded Mayor Edward I. Koch and other<br>
city leaders to restore half of the funds eliminated by the city during<br>
the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. <br>
<p>
          Mr. Gregorian has been an unpaid adviser to Walter H. Annenberg<br>
and the Annenberg Foundation, and is known as an architect of the<br>
Annenberg $500 million Challenge the Nation program, an initiative to<br>
finance projects that promote school reform. As a board member of the J. <br>
Paul Getty Trust and the Aaron Diamond Foundation, he has helped give away<br>
hundreds of millions of dollars.<br>
<p>
          Mr. Gregorian is also known for his commitment to human rights<br>
and interest in foreign affairs, especially conflict resolution and<br>
intellectual freedom. An Armenian born in Tabriz, Iran, Mr. Gregorian<br>
speaks seven languages and is the author of "The Emergence of Modern<br>
Afghanistan,"  and two other books and many articles on Middle Eastern and<br>
Armenian history. <br>
<p>
          The Carnegie Corporation gives money to another, separate<br>
foundation started by Andrew Carnegie, the Carnegie Endowment for<br>
International Peace, a Washington research institution that does not give<br>
grants.  The corporation also helped initiate the Children's Television<br>
Workshop, which produces "Sesame Street." <br>
<p>
          Under Dr. Hamburg, the corporation invested heavily in the<br>
special needs of young adolescents. He also founded, with former Secretary<br>
of State Cyrus R. Vance, the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly<br>
Conflict, on which Dr. Hamburg will continue as a co-chairman.  Conflict,<br>
on which Dr. Hamburg will continue as a co-chairman.<br>

The following news report may not be republished or redistributed, in whole or<br>
in part, without the prior written consent of United Press International.<br>
  <br>
   NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- Brown University President Vartan Gregorian will<br>
step down at the end of the academic year to head a large non- profit<br>
foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York.<br>
   Gregorian has been at the helm of the Ivy League school in Providence, R.I.,<br>
for eight years. Before that, he was the president of the New York Public<br>
Library.<br>
   An Armenian who was born in Iran and educated in Lebanon, Gregorian came to<br>
the United States in 1956. He got his bachelor's degree and doctorate at<br>
Stanford and launched a career as a university teacher and administrator.<br>
   Carnegie Chairman Newton Minow says Gregorian was selected because of his<br>
"abiding concern for the protection and extension of equality of opportunity, in<br>
this country and abroad, and for addressing the problems of urban communities."<br>
   At Brown, Gregorian is credited with hiring 270 new faculty members,<br>
expanding its library, and establishing 11 new departments.<br>
   He's also considered a tireless fund-raiser. The foundation notes that since<br>
Gregorian's arrival at Brown, the university's endowment has swelled from $373<br>
million to more than $800 million. He also added $400 million to the library's<br>
coffers during his tenure.<br>
   The Carnegie Corporation has assets of $1.4 billion and is the nation's 16th<br>
largest foundation. Educational programs and public television are the biggest<br>
beneficiaries of its grants.<br>
   The Board of Trustees is expected to approve Gregorian's appointment<br>
Thursday. Gregorian will replace David Hamburg as Carnegie president.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 3, Part I, 6 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
SPECULATION OVER POSSIBLE DEFENSE MINISTER RESIGNATION. The Defense
Ministry on 5 January denied rumors that Igor Rodionov would use a 6
January meeting with President Boris Yeltsin to resign over insufficient
funding of the military, NTV reported. Rossiskaya gazeta on 6 January,
however, speculated that there might be "some substance" to the rumors,
since Rodionov listed "normal financing" of the military as one of his
conditions for taking the post last July. The same day, ITAR-TASS
reported that Rodionov's meeting with Yeltsin had been postponed,
although the President will chair a session of the Defense Council on 8
January. The armed forces only received 56.6 trillion rubles ($10.2
billion) of the 68.8 trillion rubles awarded them in the 1996  budget,
Moskovskii komsomolets reported on 6 January, and of that only 37
trillion was paid in cash, the remainder in credits and securities. A
Duma staffer told ITAR-TASS that the 104 trillion rubles allocated to
the military in the 1997 draft budget falls short of the minimum 160
trillion requested by the Defense Ministry. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
YELTSIN, KOHL DISCUSS NATO ENLARGEMENT. After meeting with Yeltsin at
the Russian president's Zavidovo country residence on 4 January, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted that "some differences" divide Bonn and
Moscow on NATO enlargement, but he expressed the hope that a mutually
acceptable compromise solution would be found this year. Yeltsin's
spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembskii, later said that the Russian president
had laid out Russian objections to enlargement "fairly toughly." Kohl
hailed Yeltsin's speedy recovery from his 5 November heart operation,
but urged his "friend Boris" to return to work only gradually. Yeltsin
agreed to visit Germany in April to accept a media award, and accepted
Kohl's suggestion to meet with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who
currently holds the rotating EU presidency, in The Hague on 4 February.
-- Scott Parrish
<p>
LEBED: RUSSIA BECOMING AN OLIGARCHY. Former Security Council Secretary
Aleksandr Lebed warned that Russia is evolving toward "oligarchy" rather
than democracy, AFP reported on 3 January. He argued that half the
Russian economy is controlled by "a small group of banks and financial-
industrial groups, while the other half is controlled by criminal
clans." Lebed added, "Ordinary Russians are now as far from the real
levers of power as they were during Soviet Communist Party rule."
Meanwhile, 65% of 5,000 Russians surveyed by the Russian Sociological
Studies Center named Lebed "man of the year," Ekho Moskvy reported on 30
December. The electronic media remains generally unfriendly to Lebed,
despite his popularity. For instance, a 5 January commentary on Russian
TV (RTR) acknowledged that Lebed was one of the most notable politicians
of 1996 but downplayed his role in ending the war in Chechnya. -- Laura
Belin
<p>
CHECHNYA FREE OF RUSSIAN TROOPS. Lt.-Gen. Pavel Maslov, chief of staff
of the Interior Ministry troops, stated to Interfax on 5 January that:
"I officially announce that as of today not one soldier of the Interior
Ministry or Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation remains in
Chechnya," Reuters reported. Earlier reports of the withdrawal had been
confusing: on 29 December it was announced that all combat units had
left but some elements were still in place. Maslov said details of the
withdrawal were kept obscure "to avoid possible provocations," and
stated that all combat troops left by 31 December. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
CHECHEN GOVERNMENT PLANS . . .  Deputy Interim Prime Minister Ruslan
Kutaev said on 3 January that the new Chechen president will not take up
his seat in the upper house of the Russian parliament which is
automatically granted him by the Russian constitution, ITAR-TASS
reported. However, Chechnya will send a commissioner to the Russian
parliament for the next five years, who will have a right to vote. The
same day Kutaev said the government intends to try ousted pro-Moscow
Chechen leader Doku Zavgaev for treason (in absentia). He also explained
that 14 Chechen field commanders "had a serious conversation" with
maverick Salman Raduev to dissuade him from provocative acts. -- Peter
Rutland
<p>
. . . AND ELECTION PREPARATIONS. On 3 January the 16 presidential
candidates were sworn in by Chechnya's leading mufti, Akhmed-Khodzha
Kadyrov, and promised to accept the results of the elections, ITAR-TASS
reported. Tim Guldimann, the head of the OSCE mission in Chechnya, said
Russian officials assured him that international observers will be
granted visas to visit Chechnya without delay, RIA reported on 6
January. The OSCE is providing some financing for the Chechen Electoral
Commission: the OSCE will decide on 16 January whether to send its own
observers. The Russian Duma has already decided not to send observers.
-- Peter Rutland
<p>
RUSSIA, CYPRUS CONCLUDE ARMS DEAL. Cypriot officials and a
Rosvooruzhenie delegation concluded a contract for the delivery of S-300
air defense missile systems on 4 January, international agencies
reported. The number of missiles involved and the exact value of the
deal was not revealed by either side, nor has a delivery date been
specified. Unconfirmed Cypriot sources suggest Nicosia has purchased 20
missile systems for $660 million. The Turkish Foreign Ministry protested
the deal, saying it undermines "regional peace," while Western diplomats
cited by AFP said the S-300 missiles, which have a range of 150 km,
would alter the military balance on Cyprus by neutralizing the air
superiority which Turkey has enjoyed since the 1974 division of the
island into Turkish and Greek enclaves. Rosvooruzhenie spokesman Valerii
Podgrebnikov, however, termed the missiles "purely defensive," and
dismissed Turkish concerns. Russian officials had pledged during the
recent visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller to deliver only
"defensive" weapons to Greek-controlled Cyprus. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA TO CLAIM ARCTIC TERRITORIES? Natural Resources Minister Viktor
Orlov said in an interview with Trud-7 of 4-9 January that in 1997
Russia will prepare documents in order to stake claim to 1.5 million
square kilometers of the Arctic shelf. He said the U.S. and Canada are
also contemplating such action. Orlov underlined that exploitation of
Russia's mineral resources is the key "that will help us enter the group
of the world's most developed countries." He stressed that except for a
brief period in 1992 all resource development projects must be licensed
in Moscow. A "dual key" system is in operation: projects must be
approved both by Orlov's ministry and by the government of the
federation subject (region or republic). He admitted that problems can
arise - for example, development of the Timan-Pechora oil fields has
been delayed for four years due to failure to reach agreement with the
Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Only 4% of the 10,867 licenses issued
since 1992 have gone to ventures with foreign participation. -- Peter
Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
RUSSIAN RED TAPE HINDERS REMOVAL OF GEORGIAN URANIUM. American officials
blame Russian indifference and foot-dragging for the failure of their
year-long efforts to have about 2 lbs (0.8 kg) of used reactor fuel and
9.5 lbs (4.3 kg) of highly-enriched uranium transferred to Russia from a
poorly-guarded research institute outside Tbilisi, The New York Times
reported on 5 January. Although in 1994 Washington addressed a similar
problem by directly purchasing Kazakstani uranium and flying it to the
United States, the Clinton administration asked Russia in early 1996 to
accept the Georgian uranium for storage and reprocessing. However,
months of talks on the issue have hit repeated legal, financial, and
bureaucratic snags, despite American offers to pay for the transport and
provide necessary equipment. The uranium remains at the Georgian
Institute of Physics under improved, but still inadequate, security. --
Scott Parrish
<p>
TERRORISM IN TAJIK CAPITAL. The bodies of two Tajik military officials
were found on the outskirts of Dushanbe on 3 January, RFE/RL reported.
Both were killed, in separate incidents, by a shot from a pistol. On 4
January two bombs went off in downtown Dushanbe, killing one and
injuring five, Russian sources reported. The first blast occurred near a
market when four servicemen from the CIS peacekeeping force and 201st
Motorized Rifle Division attempted to start their car after buying goods
at the market. One serviceman was killed, the others were wounded along
with two civilian passers-by. The other bomb went off two hours later,
destroying a police post near the presidential palace. No casualties
were reported. Just prior to these latest attacks the Russian Foreign
Ministry had expressed its alarm at the increase in attacks on
peacekeepers, noting that between 27 December and 2 January six Russian
soldiers were killed and eight wounded in or near Dushanbe. -- Bruce
Pannier
<p>
NEW BORDER TARIFFS FOR KAZAKSTAN. A decision by the Kazakstani
government to allow so-called "shuttle traders" more weight when
arriving from foreign countries went into effect on 5 January, ITAR-TASS
and Radio Rossii reported. The previous limit without a fine was 20 kg
per passenger but under the new rule the limit is 70 kg per passenger
and the first 270 kg after that is subject to a reduced tariff. The
government is hoping that this new freedom to bring goods into the
country will increase products on the domestic market. However, planes
are often overloaded and Kazakstan has a poor history of air safety,
highlighted by the November mid-air collision of a Kazakstani plane with
one from Saudi Arabia over India which killed more than 300 people. --
Bruce Pannier
<p>
STRENGTH OVER JUSTICE IN UZBEKISTAN. A coat of arms for Uzbekistan's
capital, Tashkent, was issued on 4 January, ITAR-TASS reported the same
day. The emblem's components are an open gate topped by an oriental dome
on a background of a mountain and rivers framed by flowers, a grape vine
and a plane tree in blossom. Encircling all of this are the words "In
Strength is Justice" [Kuch Adolatadir], a mis-translation of the words
"Rasti Rusti" [In Justice is Strength] from Firdausi's Persian epic The
Book of Kings [Shah Namah]. Since the late October celebration of the
birth of Tamerlane, the improperly rendered text has increasingly been
associated with him and is to be found on numerous billboards, the wall
of a museum erected to lionize the great conqueror-builder, as well as
the star of Samarkand state medal in Uzbekistan. -- Lowell Bezanis

NOISY, CARNIVAL-LIKE WEEKEND IN BELGRADE. Opposition protesters continue
to devise novel ways to circumvent the police ban on marches, which was
imposed following violence between opponents and supporters of President
Slobodan Milosevic on 24 December. On 3-4 January, the protesters once
again made much noise by blowing whistles and beating pots and other
implements during Serbian TV's evening newscast. On 5 January, they
staged a "protest by traffic jam," in which drivers of all sorts of
vehicles blocked Belgrade streets amid a carnival atmosphere,
international media reported. Protesters plan to extend the traffic jam
tactic throughout Serbia should the government fail to recognize the
results of the 17 November local elections within a few days. -- Patrick
Moore
<p>
SERBIAN OPPOSITION STICKS TO ITS DEMANDS. The opposition Zajedno
coalition has rejected the authorities' latest offer to accept part but
not all of those election returns, CNN reported on 4 January. This time,
the government proposed to acknowledge opposition victories in Belgrade
and two smaller towns but called for a new vote in Nis. Zajedno says it
will keep up its protests until the government unconditionally respects
the 17 November results. Meanwhile, Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle
gave a radio address in which he repeated the Holy Synod's recent
condemnation of the Milosevic regime, the BBC stated on 4 January. The
U.S., for its part, is also keeping up the pressure on Milosevic, who is
increasingly isolated both at home and abroad, Nasa Borba wrote on 6
January. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
BELGRADE DEMONSTRATORS APPEAL TO POLICE. The Zajedno leadership has
called on people to stage a protest in the form a large "religious
procession" on 6 January, which is the Orthodox Christmas Eve.
Meanwhile, the students have appealed to the police not to block their
marches, AFP reported on 6 January. One of their leaders said: "We
appeal to those installing police cordons to withdraw them before
January 9, so we don't have to do it for them." On a more diplomatic
note, Zajedno issued a proclamation to the police as "dear friends,"
Nasa Borba wrote. The text stated: "Do not let yourselves be abused by
the [Socialist Party of Serbia] thieves and do not allow yourselves to
be pushed into a conflict with the people, whose lives are as difficult
as yours. Think hard before obeying the orders of the thieves." The
police are one of Milosevic's main pillars of support. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
FEDERAL YUGOSLAV ARMY WILL NOT OPPOSE STUDENTS. One of the reasons
Milosevic has relied on the police is that his relations with the army
(JNA) have never been particularly good. On 6 January, Chief of Staff
Gen. Momcilo Perisic told a delegation of students that the JNA will not
oppose them, AFP reported. Army support was crucial to Milosevic in
crushing protests in March 1991, which constituted the most direct
challenge from the streets to his rule prior to the current unrest. --
Patrick Moore
<p>
NEW BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT CONVENES. Bosnia's new government convened for
the first time on 3 January in Serb-run Lukavica, near Sarajevo,
international media reported. Earlier the same day, deputies in the
lower house of the Bosnian parliament approved the government and the
nomination of the two joint prime ministers--Boro Bosic, a Serb, and
Haris Silajdzic, a Muslim. Silajdzic said the cabinet discussed who
should take part in a delegation to a conference in Brussels on 9-10
January aimed at raising funds for the reconstruction of Bosnia.
Meanwhile, Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serbian member of Bosnia's three-man
presidency, has said he wants to see "reconciliation and acceptance of
the characteristics of all the peoples" in Bosnia, AFP reported. --
Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
BOSNIA'S MUSLIM RULING PARTY CONFIRMS RECEIVING FUNDS FROM IRAN. The
Party of Democratic Action (SDA), headed by President Alija Izetbegovic,
has confirmed that it received $500,000 from Iran in mid-1996,
Oslobodjenje reported on 4 January. But it added that the money was used
for scholarships and not for the party's election campaign. Last week,
the Los Angeles Times reported that Iran gave Izetbegovic that sum for
use in the run-up to the September elections (see OMRI Daily Digest, 2
January 1996). In other news, Drazen Erdemovic, the first war criminal
to be sentenced by the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Former
Yugoslavia, has appealed his 10-year prison term, AFP reported on 3
January. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
CROATIA MAKES OFFER TO SERBS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA. The Croatian
government has drafted a Memorandum on the Completion of the Peaceful
Reintegration of eastern Slavonia and handed it over to Jacques Klein,
the head of the UN Transitional Administration for eastern Slavonia,
Vecernji List reported on 4 January. The document attempts to resolve
the contentious issue of voting rights for those living in eastern
Slavonia, as well as cultural and educational rights. Ivica Vrkic, the
government official in charge of the region, said Croatian Serbs who
were not living there in 1991 but had lived in another part of Croatia
will be able to vote in eastern Slavonia if they choose. Previously, the
government had insisted that only Croatian Serbs who had lived in
eastern Slavonia before the war would be allowed to vote in local
elections. The memorandum also offers the Serbs several senior posts in
the government and gives Serbian men the option of not performing
compulsory military service in the Croatian Army. -- Daria Sito Sucic

 UN observers hostage in Tajikistan<br>
	Seven foreign U.N. military observers and a number of<br>
ethnic Tajiks are being held hostage after gunmen abducted the<br>
group on a road east of the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe. A<br>
source at the U.N. mission in the Central Asian nation says the<br>
attackers are militants loyal to a warlord who has vacillated<br>
between support for the opposition and the government. The<br>
source says the gunmen are demanding that they and their fellow<br>
militants be allowed to move freely from their base in<br>
Afghanistan to Tajikistan. They also want opposition forces to<br>
free the brother of their commander, Rizvon Sadirov. Among the<br>
hostages are two Bulgarians, an Austrian, a Dane, a Jordanian, a<br>
Ukrainian and a Uruguayan. Two Tajik U.N. workers and several<br>
members of a government- opposition peace commission are also<br>
being held. U.N. observers have been in Tajikistan since 1994<br>
monitoring an ineffective cease-fire between the government and<br>
opposition forces. Tajik opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri and<br>
President Emomali Rakhmonov are now in Moscow.  They are<br>
scheduled to meet Saturday to try to agree on a plan to end<br>
years of conflict in the former Soviet republic.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Ratings agency downgrades Turkish debt<br>
	The European credit rating agency IBCA Friday downgraded<br>
long-term foreign currency ratings for about $50 billion of<br>
Turkey's foreign debt, citing "economic mismanagement and a<br>
lack of political will." IBCA said its rating for Turkey's<br>
senior and unsecured debt was reduced from BB minus to B plus,<br>
but a short-term B rating for debts up to a year remained<br>
unchanged. The London-based agency's officials were not<br>
available to comment on the ratings move, which was seen by<br>
financial experts as a setback to Islamist Prime Minister<br>
Necmettin Erbakan's coalition government in Ankara. IBCA said it<br>
still saw "many" strengths in the Turkish private<br>
sector. "However, these attributes continue to be undermined by<br>
economic mismanagement and a lack of political will to tackle<br>
public sector reforms," it added. It said that Erbakan, who<br>
formed a government after the collapse of a center-right<br>
coalition last year, "has not done nearly enough to arrest"<br>
the drift in Turkey. "Serious macro-economic imbalances have<br>
continued to develop: inflation, the fiscal deficit and the<br>
current account deficit all now rival or exceed the levels<br>
prevailing at the time of the last crisis in 1993-94." IBCA<br>
warned that unless Erbakan accepted structural reforms he ran<br>
the risk of becoming ensnared in a domestic debt trap.  "Turkey<br>
cannot afford a repetition of 1994 when it was shut out of<br>
international bond markets," said the agency.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Iranian, Turkish presidents go on tour<br>
	The presidents of Iran and Turkey flew together Friday<br>
to a Kurdish- dominated province in southeastern Turkey, Turkish<br>
officials said. The solidarity tour on the second day of Iranian<br>
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's four days in Turkey was<br>
unmistakable in its symbolism: Turkey has been fighting since<br>
1984 with Kurdish insurgents trying to carve an independent<br>
Kurdistan out of Turkey's southeast. At least 21, 000 people<br>
have been killed and many more wounded in Turkey's<br>
insurgency. Iran, which has a province called Kurdistan, also<br>
fights Kurdish separatists and opposes an independent Kurdish<br>
state that could include regions of Iran, Iraq, Syria and<br>
Turkey. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who made the unusual<br>
gesture Thursday of meeting Rafsanjani at the Ankara airport<br>
Thursday, accompanied the Iranian leader to Turkey's Anatolian<br>
province of Sanliurfa. The presidents were scheduled to tour the<br>
Southeast Anatolian Development Project, made up of 19<br>
hydroelectric plants and 22 dams along the Euphrates and Tigris<br>
rivers. The irrigation project also produces 130 billion<br>
kilowatts of electricity.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Iran said to offer Syria-Turkey mediation<br>
	Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in<br>
a bid to improve their strained ties, Turkish sources said<br>
Friday. There was no word on whether either country has accepted<br>
the offer. Iran was calling on Syria to stop aiding Turkey's<br>
Kurdish rebels, in return for Turkey's taking a more hostile<br>
stand against Israel, the Damascus-based sources told United<br>
Press International. Turkey has a military cooperation accord<br>
with Israel. Syria has denied aiding Kurdish insurgents trying<br>
to carve an independent Kurdistan out of southeastern Turkey and<br>
has jailed some Turkish separatists. The sources said such<br>
mediation would result in a "unified stand by the three<br>
countries" with regard to regional developments , particularly<br>
with regard to Israel. Iran wants to contain the Kurdish issue<br>
within "a tripartite framework," the sources said.  Turkey,<br>
Iran, Iraq and Syria all have large Kurdish regions and their<br>
governments oppose an independent Kurdistan. Iranian President<br>
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani made his mediation offer at the<br>
start of his visit to Turkey this week, the sources said.<br>

Priority One for new Apple OS boss: Shipping<br>
<p>
By Clifford Colby (clifford_colby@zd.com)<br>
and David Morgenstern (david_morgenstern@zd.com)<br>
<p>
Avedis Tevanian has just been handed the reins for the future modern Mac OS.<br>
<p>
Apple last week tapped the former NeXT Software Inc. vice president of<br>
engineering to lead a team of NeXT and Apple engineers in producing the<br>
successor to System 7.x. In a conversation today with MacWEEK, Tevanian<br>
said, "My overriding goal is to get our team and their team working<br>
together as one team moving forward."<br>
<p>
According to Tevanian, the working model of the forthcoming OS will be<br>
NeXTstep, with Apple technologies grafted on where they make sense. Hoping<br>
to avoid pitfalls that plagued Copland, the new OS meister said a primary<br>
concern will be to get the OS out the door.<br>
<p>
"We are focused on shipping product," Tevanian said. The new OS chief said<br>
Apple will now take a "pragmatic approach" to system software and add only<br>
features that can be accomplished in several months. "[NeXTstep elements]<br>
will not change unless there's added value."<br>
<p>
Initially, the forthcoming Mac OS will have most of the look and feel of<br>
its NeXTstep parent, with some minor changes, Tevanian said. The two user<br>
interface teams will then, "do the right thing and make it easy for<br>
existing users of Mac machines," he said.<br>
<p>
While NeXTstep is multithreaded, it does not support symmetrical<br>
multiprocessing. Tevanian said this feature will be finished in "a short<br>
number of months."<br>
<p>
According to Tevanian, NeXT built a machine with a pair of PowerPC 601<br>
processors several years ago, with a version of NeXTstep tuned for it. The<br>
company never shipped the hardware or software.<br>
<p>
After the company got out of the hardware business in 1993, the design was<br>
used by Mountain View, Calif.-based FirePower Systems Inc., which last year<br>
was bought by Motorola Inc.'s Computer Group.<br>
<p>
Although he would not give specifics, Tevanian hopes to ship versions of<br>
the NeXT-Mac OS to developers and customers by the end of 1997.<br>

           _Eurasia Letter: Russia and the New Transcaucasus_<br>
<p>
                          by David E. Mark<br>
<p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
DAVID E. MARK, a retired career U.S. Foreign Service officer with the<br>
rank of ambassador, served one year in 1994-95 in Tbilisi, Georgia, as <br>
a member and later as deputy chief of the OSCE mission to Georgia. He<br>
now teaches occasional classes in international affairs at New York <br>
University.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
	The transformation in December 1991 of the 15 constituent republics <br>
of the former Soviet Union into 15 sovereign states produced three newly <br>
independent countries in the Transcaucasus -- Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. <br>
Over the past five years, the three countries have experienced political and <br>
economic turmoil.  Indeed, the first two bloodily battled each other from 1988 <br>
to mid 1994 over the still unsettled fate of the "autonomous region" of<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan, whose predominantly Armenian population <br>
wishes to become part of Armenia. Georgia has experienced episodes of civil <br>
war, as well as the de facto "secession" of two ethnic minority territories-<br>
Abkhazia and South Ossetia-both of which are wedged up against the southern<br>
side of the towering Caucasus mountain range. On the northern<br>
slopes, inside the Russian Federation, there has been much<br>
discontent_but only in Chechnya has military action erupted.<br>
<p>
	In addition to providing humanitarian aid to impoverished popu-<br>
lations and to about 1.3 million refugees in the Transcaucasus, the<br>
international community has sought to restore a degree of political<br>
stability, based on the principles of territorial integrity and the de jure<br>
authority of the recognized states (Azerbaijan and Georgia). More<br>
concretely, the United Nations has established a military observer<br>
force in Abkhazia and led international negotiations to settle that<br>
dispute. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe<br>
(OSCE) has a large mission in Tbilisi to focus on Georgia's problems,<br>
and, early in 1995, it fielded a smaller "assistance group" in Chech-<br>
nya to facilitate contacts there among all sides. The OSCE has strug<br>
gled over several years with the various parties in Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
to work out an accord on the framework of a political settlement,<br>
which would then perhaps enable the OSCE to deploy its first-ever<br>
peacekeeping force in a crisis area. The September 1995 creation of<br>
a second OSCE mission in "neutral" Tbilisi was supposed to facilitate<br>
these efforts.<br>
<p>
	While these innately handicapped multinational organizations<br>
have attempted their good works in the region, there has been only<br>
modest effort by individual governments, other than Russia's, to ex-<br>
ert political influence beyond whatever arises from humanitarian aid,<br>
support for economic reform, cultural relations, and the occasional<br>
review of the foregoing conflictive issues in the UN. Security Coun-<br>
cil. To be sure, Turkish commercial activity has been considerable in<br>
Georgia and Azerbaijan, and diaspora support for Armenia -- espe-<br>
cially from groups in the United States and France -- has been criti-<br>
cal to that nation's survival. Petroleum reserves in and around the<br>
Caspian Sea have lately drawn substantial investment commitments<br>
from the transnational oil industry. This development has increased<br>
worldwide interest in Azerbaijan's fate, but not much external<br>
political engagement. Even the participation of Georgia's embryonic<br>
military and Armenia's and Azerbaijan's slightly more developed<br>
armed forces in the NATO-sponsored "Partnership for Peace" has<br>
tended to be limited, pro forma, considerate of skeptical Russian at<br>
titudes, and constrained by the determination of NATO member states<br>
to avoid overextension into the former USSR.<br>
<p>
	Almost by default, the preeminent political-military player in the<br>
Transcaucasus has been Russia itself. Despite the Chechnya embar-<br>
rassment, Russia's territorial base in the Caucasus (north of the<br>
mountains) and its varied involvements in the Transcaucasus are<br>
grounded on the availability of innumerable levers of influence and<br>
pressure, including Russia's sheer size, its relative power, and its close<br>
and dominant connections with the neighboring region over the last<br>
two centuries. These links have been much more intimate than those<br>
in Central Asia (even allowing for Russian military involvement in<br>
Taiikistan) and reflect the proximity of the Transcaucasus to other<br>
major regional actors in western Asia and Eastern Europe. Given this<br>
background, the nonpartisan observer of the local scene might ask<br>
several questions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia capable of becoming more</i><br>
  than formally independent and sovereign?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does Moscow feel the urge to recreate a dominant hegemony in</i><br>
  the region_both bilaterally and through the Commonwealth of<br>
  Independent States (CIS)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does Russian behavior in the Transcaucasus provide clues to its</i><br>
  future global security policies toward the West and neighboring<br>
  states? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do Western states, especially NATO member states, have much in-</i><br>
  centive to resist current patterns of political evolution in the<br>
  Transcaucasus?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should or can international organizations do more to bolster the</i><br>
  viability of the three Transcaucasian states?<br>
<p>
	The answers to these questions will help interested governments<br>
to judge underlying Russian motivations, policies, and practices to<br>
ward other former Soviet republics.<br>
<p>
A VIEW FROM MOSCOW<br>
<p>
	Since 1991 an array of differing opinions has been voiced in Rus-<br>
sia about its future relations with the West and about Russia's<br>
role in the 21st century. These opinions reflect divergent visions<br>
of the country's destiny. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement<br>
among all groupings that Russia should retain at least the Trans-<br>
caucasus within an effective sphere of influence, if not within some<br>
even more demanding and constrictive relationship.<br>
<p>
	Almost all Russians seem to have the visceral feeling that the<br>
Transcaucasus is, and ought to remain, politically inseparable from<br>
Russia. This belief reflects its presence within the domains of czars<br>
and commissars for the past 115 to 200 years, and the connection is<br>
seen as no less normal and natural than the continuing incorpora-<br>
tion of the (north) Caucasus in the Russian Federation. There has<br>
been a substantial influx of ethnic Russians into the northern Cau-<br>
casus since it became pacified almost 150 years ago. Russians now<br>
make up 20 to 25 per cent of the overall population. The remainder<br>
consists of peoples of other ethnic groups -- mostly from the distinct<br>
Caucasian language family, but with a mixture of ancient Turkic and<br>
Persian elements. Only one group, the Ossetians, is Christian (Or-<br>
thodox); the others are partially, or almost fully, secularized Muslims.<br>
However, all of the latter remember a history of resistance to Russ-<br>
ian rule in the first half of the 19th century (which the Chechens<br>
have lately renewed) and have enough residual grievances to cause<br>
Moscow concern about their susceptibility to transnational Islamic<br>
movements. Russia must also worry about the influence of Caucasian<br>
unrest on the stability of the neighboring Russian populated territo-<br>
ries of Krasnodar and Stavropol.<br>
<p>
	This widespread Russian apprehension spills over into contem-<br>
plation of the contiguous Transcaucasus. The Armenians and Geor<br>
gians -- both Christians -- speak distinct and unique languages, and<br>
the Azeris use a cousin of Turkish; but all three peoples have become<br>
partly Russified over the years. Moscow has not forgotten Turkish<br>
and, to a lesser extent, Persian territorial ambitions in the Trans-<br>
caucasus in the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as Turkish-Russian<br>
(and Turkish Soviet) tensions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Turkey<br>
today is viewed as both a rival in the region and a surrogate for NATO.<br>
<p>
	There is also a widely prevalent belief among Russians that none<br>
of the three Transcaucasian states will prove viable entirely on its<br>
own. Armenia is viewed as a landlocked and psychologically isolated<br>
enclave subject to Turkish, Iranian, and Azeri pressures; the new Re-<br>
public of Azerbaijan incorporates only perhaps one quarter of the<br>
Azeri people -- the rest of whom live under Iran's fundamentalist ls-<br>
lamic regime; and Georgia is thought to be too politically and eth-<br>
nically fragile. Although Muslim Turkey is constitutionally secular,<br>
most Russian officials involved in these questions believe it is prone<br>
to a relapse into politicized lslamism over the next decade or two.<br>
Russians thus foresee potential threats to their security in the cur-<br>
rent configuration of the Transcaucasus and its southern neighbors.<br>
lt is no wonder then that the old Soviet military command there has<br>
stayed on -- legitimated by treaties with Tbilisi and Yerevan -- with<br>
the barely changed name of the "Russian Group of Forces in the<br>
Transcaucasus." The generals' vision of regional stability and their<br>
support of the status quo ante seem to be shared by their diplomatic<br>
colleagues.<br>
<p>
SEPARATISM IN THE THREE REPUBL1CS<br>
<p>
In South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Nagorno Karabakh -- the three<br>
most turbulent zones of the Transcaucasus -- secessionist adminis-<br>
trations have assumed de facto authority behind ceasefire lines set<br>
under agreements brokered by Russian authorities in 1992 and<br>
1994. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia (both within Georgia), Russian<br>
peacekeeping forces ensure physical separation between ex combat-<br>
ants. In Nagorno Karabakh, where there are no peacekeepers, the<br>
OSCE is trying to arrange for their introduction under its auspices once<br>
the outline of a peace settlement has been determined. Everyone<br>
hopes that Azerbaijan, which has been rebuilding its still very weak<br>
armed forces, will not be tempted to restart combat in an effort to re-<br>
store the territorial status quo ante against Armenia. On the other<br>
hand, perpetuation of the three ceasefires tends progressively to con-<br>
solidate and normalize the de facto existence of the secessionist<br>
regimes. In between these extremes, the three countries are trying to<br>
achieve an economic and political revival within boundaries recon-<br>
figured by war.<br>
<p>
	All three secessionist zones are outgrowths of Soviet era nation-<br>
ality policies in the Transcaucasus. While the USSR existed, Western<br>
observers generally decried nationality policies as a sham that, under<br>
the guise of recognizing the diverse cultural traditions and political<br>
ambitions of the scores of ethnic groups within Soviet frontiers, in<br>
fact allowed Moscow to use "divide and rule" tactics to impose uni-<br>
form totalitarian policies and Russification on all citizens. The situ-<br>
ation in the Caucasus Transcaucasus region essentially confirms this<br>
evaluation by providing examples of how arbitrary Soviet decisions<br>
since the 1920s have complicated the problems of peaceful cohabi-<br>
tation and contiguous development among the diverse ethnic groups<br>
that are now unexpectedly living in four independent states.<br>
<p>

years especially facilitated today's Armenian-Azerbaijani confronta-<br>
tion. Under decrees from Moscow, the Armenians in Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh were left in an autonomous region within Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Azeris in the nearby enclave of Nakhichevan, which<br>
looks on the map as if it should have been part of Armenia, were in<br>
fact also integrated into Azerbaijan, although they were separated<br>
from it by Armenian territory. (Over the following decades, almost<br>
all of the 40 per cent of Nakhichevan's population that had been Ar-<br>
menian emigrated.) Once central authority began to loosen under<br>
Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s, the Armenians saw a chance<br>
to rectify what they perceived to be the Soviet wrong of the 1920s.<br>
In 1988, supported by materiel and manpower from authorities in<br>
Yerevan and backed energetically by emigre communities in the<br>
United States and Western Europe, local Armenian forces in<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh began their progressively expanding military ac-<br>
tion to abolish Azerbaijan's authority in that territory. In the inter-<br>
vening years, the victors have not only attained this political goal but<br>
have, in the process, expanded Nagorno Karabakh's borders far into<br>
Azerbaijan proper -- creating up to 1 million Azeri refugees. Indeed,<br>
since the ceasefire in 1994, the insurgents have been successfully re-<br>
building Nagorno-Karabakh's economy. The region is now virtually<br>
a part of Armenia and includes a new highway over the seven-mile<br>
formerly Azerbaijani "Lachin Strip," which once separated Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh from Armenia. Soviet and subsequently Russian military<br>
equipment, supplies, training, and advice -- nominally covert, but<br>
barely disguised -- have been crucial to the Armenians' success over<br>
the last eight years. This history, in turn, has enhanced both Arme-<br>
nia's ever greater reliance on Russia and Azerbaijan's animosity to-<br>
ward Moscow, on which it ironically also still depends.<br>
<p>
	Under these circumstances, some normalization of Armenian<br>
political and economic life has started. President Levon Ter Pet-<br>
rosyan's political machine, though backed by somewhat oppressive<br>
security ministries and nourished by gross corruption and favoritism<br>
to economic "in-groups" and local mafias, has begun to relax con-<br>
trols on political expression. Despite a Soviet-era statist mentality,<br>
the mid 1995 parliamentary elections were more or less procedurally<br>
fair on election day, although access to the ballot by independent<br>
candidates was closely controlled, and a major opposition party was<br>
disenfranchised. Ballot fraud in Ter-Petrosyan's reelection in Sep-<br>
tember 1996 was apparently at least as serious. The Turkish blockade<br>
of Armenia continues, but transport links through Georgia and Iran<br>
have been upgraded, and growing Armenian confidence in geopolit-<br>
ical security has led to greater entrepreneurship and economic sta-<br>
bilization.<br>
<p>
	_Azerbaijan_. Since 1988, Soviet and then Russian policy toward<br>
Armenia has clearly been favorable. The same cannot be said of<br>
Moscow's relations with Azerbaijan or Georgia. Both have had more<br>
complicated domestic political experiences than Armenia, and var-<br>
ious events have provoked not only shifts in Russian policies, but also<br>
divergent and contradictory operational guidelines from military ele-<br>
ements, the civilian bureaucracy, and Boris Yeltsin's presidency. Un-<br>
doubtedly influenced by the battles in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azeris<br>
have exhibited greater nationalism and a more conscious demand for<br>
real independence. These stirrings are fostered by strengthened<br>
political ties to Turkey and growing commercial links with both Iran<br>
and Turkey. In 1990, riots against Russians living in the capital<br>
(Baku) were followed by the evacuation of all but one of the Russian<br>
military bases in 1992 and by the election of a populist (and moder-<br>
ately Islamist) regime soon thereafter. That regime, however, was<br>
overthrown in mid-1993 by Geidar Aliyev, a former Soviet Politburo<br>
member turned nationalist, who had the backing of local Commu-<br>
nist era elites_and perhaps the Kremlin as well.<br>
<p>
                &lt;&lt;Almost by default, the preeminent political-<br>
                  militaly player in the Transcaucasus has been<br>
                  Russia itself.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
	Moscow's long-term concerns over the ultimate interrelationship<br>
between Azerbaijan and Turkey, and over that between Azerbaijan<br>
and the numerous Azeris inside Iran, have lately been supplemented<br>
by anxieties over oil. Moscow fears the birth of a world-class petro<br>
leum complex in the Caspian Sea region, free of its influence, and is<br>
determined to hamper any such independent evolution. Moscow at<br>
first exercised blatant political muscle to try to halt the export of Az-<br>
eri oil via any route that bypasses Russia -- specifically by a pipeline<br>
through Georgia and Turkey -- but has had to relent, due to blockage<br>
of its own route through Chechnya. Transnational oil firms, caught<br>
up in these politics, have authorized two pipelines -- one through<br>
Russia and the other through Georgia. The former option is, as noted,<br>
being delayed, while the latter is in the feasibility study stage.<br>
<p>
	Russia has placed further pressure on Baku by restricting the traf-<br>
fic of goods between it and Azerbaijan (along the Daghestan-<br>
Caspian Sea road and rail routes) on the pretext of heightened Russ-<br>
ian security needs arising from the nearby Chechnyan conflict.<br>
Meanwhile, in the interminable negotiations on a political settle-<br>
ment framework and on the establishment of an OSCE peacekeeping<br>
force around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Russians have retained control<br>
over any arrangements by holding a veto wielding cochairmanship of<br>
the main political negotiating body. Recognizing Russia's key influ-<br>
ence in this situation, and in anticipation of President Bill Clinton's<br>
April 1996 visit to Russia, the United States approached Moscow in<br>
March to try to work out an overall deal on both Nagorno Karabakh<br>
and the oil pipeline issues, but the initiative ended inconclusively.<br>
<p>
	The Azerbaijani economy is poverty stricken and will likely re-<br>
main so until the flow of oil money begins some time in the future.<br>
Of the small and declining earnings from petroleum facilities left over<br>
from Soviet days, much is dedicated to rebuilding the shattered armed<br>
forces. There has been little structural reform or private entrepre-<br>
neurship, and basic needs are met largely through European Union<br>
(EU), Iranian, and Turkish assistance. Meanwhile, even though the<br>
November 1995 parliamentary elections that "confirmed" President<br>
Aliyev's regime were only questionably fair, there can be no doubt<br>
about his current authoritarian mastery of national politics. Unlike<br>
in Georgia and Armenia, no Russian frontier troops are present in<br>
Azerbaijan -- but it is still a member state of the CIS.<br>
<p>
	_Georgia_. Just as Soviet nationality policy on Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
created mutual Azeri and Armenian dependency on Moscow, its<br>
treatment of ethnic minorities in Georgia produced the same result<br>
vis-a-vis the regime in Tbilisi. A South Ossetian Autonomous Re-<br>
gion was set up in the early 1920s within Georgia, across the Cauca-<br>
sus mountains from the Federative Republic of North Ossetia-Ala-<br>
nia within the Russian Federation, where the great bulk of ethnic<br>
Ossetians live. This region's existence ensured constant friction<br>
within Georgia that could at any time require Soviet arbitration and<br>
thus allow Moscow's manipulation.<br>
<p>
	In the 1980s, a mountain highway tunnel was built between the<br>
two Ossetias, ostensibly for military reasons. However, by facilitating<br>
year round contacts and greater closeness among all Ossetians (in-<br>
cluding the 125,000 who then lived in Georgia proper, plus the 75,000<br>
in the autonomous region itself), the tunnel increased the opportu<br>
nities for Ossetian nationalist agitation in the south. When the ex-<br>
treme nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to power in 1990, his<br>
government responded to South Ossetian agitation for broader au-<br>
tonomy by abolishing the autonomous region altogether. In response,<br>
the South Ossetians proclaimed their independence from Georgia<br>
and received armed support in 1991 and 1992 from North Ossetia --<br>
through the mountain highway tunnel. Their insurgent regime has<br>
been in de facto control of the area since 1992, though Moscow has<br>
rejected its pleas for incorporation into the Russian Federation and<br>
has intermittently generated strong pressures for its return to Geor-<br>
gian jurisdiction -- so far without result. However, Georgian President<br>
Eduard Shevardnadze and South Ossetian leader Ludvig Chibirov<br>
met in August 1996 in Vladikavkaz and agreed to future talks on sta-<br>
tus problems and interrelationships.<br>
<p>
	Abkhazia is another region that threatens Georgian integrity. Lo-<br>
cated along the northwestern section of Georgia's Black Sea coast,<br>
the predominantly Christian Abkhaz -- a linguistically Caucasian<br>
ethnic group -- became an ever smaller minority in their own land<br>
during Soviet times; by 1989, the Abkhaz made up only 18 per cent<br>
of the region's 540,000 people. Through conscious Soviet resettle<br>
ment policies in the 1940s and 1950s, which Tbilisi supported, the<br>
Georgian share of the population grew to 46 per cent, while Russian<br>
and Armenian communities accounted for most of the remaining 36<br>
per cent. Thus, even though Abkhazia had the status of an au-<br>
tonomous republic within Georgia, many in the Abkhaz minority felt<br>
that they had little cultural or political independence from Tbilisi's<br>
decrees_except when Moscow could be induced to intervene.<br>
<p>
	Gamsakhurdia's heavy-handed nationalistic approach in Georgia<br>
sharpened tensions from 1989 on and gave new legitimacy to a pre-<br>
viously semiquiescent Abkhaz nationalist movement, whose leaders<br>
were fighting for enhanced Abkhaz statutory privileges and eventual<br>
independence from Georgia. In 1991, a political crisis was averted by<br>
Tbilisi's concessions to the militant Abkhaz on election arrangements<br>
for the territory's legislature. Tensions again came to a head in Au-<br>
gust 1992, when Georgian troops entered the territory to fight rebels<br>
in Georgia's own civil war. Almost 14 months of battles ensued be<br>
tween intermittent ceasefires. In September 1993, Abkhaz fighters<br>
supplied largely with equipment and manpower from within Russia<br>
itself -- much of it from government sources but some from north<br>
Caucasian mercenaries_bloodily drove out Georgian forces, along<br>
with 230,000 Georgian refugees.<br>
<p>
	The 1992-93 civil war in Georgia was the result of Gamsakhur-<br>
dia's January 1992 ouster from Tbilisi by a Moscow-backed faction,<br>
which two months later invited former Soviet foreign minister (and<br>
former Georgian Communist Party chief) Shevardnadze to take<br>
power. Gamsakhurdia and his followers took over a western zone of<br>
Georgia (Mingrelia) bordering Abkhazia. Then, when Georgia's army<br>
collapsed in Abkhazia in September 1993 (as a result of major Russ-<br>
ian assistance to the Abkhaz), Gamsakhurdia's forces began a drive<br>
eastward from Mingrelia into Georgia's heartland. Shevardnadze was<br>
forced to turn to Moscow for help. Moscow responded favorably but,<br>
in return, required that Georgia become a member of the CIS -- some-<br>
thing that Moscow (but almost no Georgians) had long wanted.<br>
Once Russia intervened, Gamsakhurdia's men began a rapid retreat,<br>
and he almost certainly committed suicide in Chechnya around<br>
Christmas 1993.<br>
<p>
	The net effect of these 1993 events was to reinvigorate Russia's<br>
dominant influence in Georgia. Russia has remained the arbiter of<br>
the Abkhaz and South Ossetian insurrections, but it has no longer<br>
needed those issues as levers to pressure Shevardnadze. In mid-1995,<br>
Russia announced its full political support for the reintegration of the<br>
two secessionist regimes into Georgia with self-rule status. Although<br>
the 1995 initiative fell apart after Russia failed to exert real muscle<br>
to meet its proclaimed goal, Shevardnadze had no option but to stick<br>
with Moscow. As a result, Russia can use Georgia as a point of lever-<br>
age to exert influence over the entire Transcaucasus. Through Geor-<br>
gia's port of Batumi, oil and other supplies could be delivered to Ar-<br>
menia. And, via Armenia and direct Russian economic and transport<br>
levers, pressure could be kept on Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
	In this situation, Moscow was able to limit severely Georgia's<br>
room for geopolitical maneuver and to gain predominant influence<br>
over Georgia's security organs. Russia began slowly to recreate a mod-<br>
est Georgian army from the ground up and, in the process, placed<br>
many Russian (formerly Soviet) officers with Georgian ethnic con-<br>
nections into top positions. Similarly intimate links were reinforced<br>
between the two state security (intelligence) establishments. Russia<br>
and Georgia also signed the treaty, mentioned earlier, that legalized<br>
the presence of some 15,000 Russian troops on Georgian soil and ap-<br>
proved an agreement that grants Russian frontier troops lengthy con-<br>
trol over Georgia's border with Turkey and along the Black Sea.<br>
Moreover, Georgia's overall foreign policy orientation was coordi-<br>
nated at periodic CIS summits.<br>
<p>
	Behind the "protection" of these Russian security arrangements,<br>
Shevardnadze was free to restore Georgia as a functioning state and<br>
society. Moscow provided modest amounts of economic assistance<br>
and facilitated the reestablishment of select Soviet-era economic<br>
links between the two countries. Furthermore, Russia did not object<br>
to a host of bilateral economic agreements that Georgia signed with<br>
Western countries and international organizations, including the<br>
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank<br>
for Reconstruction and Development, the U.N. Development Pro<br>
gram, and the EU. Consequently, considerable economic stabiliza-<br>
tion has taken hold, but Georgia is still far from experiencing a full<br>
economic revival. Shevardnadze has tried to encourage private en-<br>
trepreneurship, but he recognizes that this will occur on a significant<br>
scale only when the economy has been substantially freed from the<br>
tight grip of criminal elements and a corrupt officialdom.<br>
<p>
	Shevardnadze has shown great political skill in weakening his op-<br>
ponents. By mid-1995, he had capitalized on gross errors by various<br>
mafia leaders to break up their groups and had begun to establish a<br>
hierarchy of regional officials loyal to him. This stronger position en-<br>
abled him in August 1995 to induce more than two-thirds of the once<br>
hopelessly fractious Parliament into a "give and take" process of ne-<br>
gotiating a new constitution. The approved charter establishes a pow-<br>
erful presidency; a U.S.-style separation of legislative, executive, and<br>
judicial powers; a full bill of rights; and a constitutional court. On<br>
November 5, 1995, Shevardnadze received almost three-quarters of<br>
the votes in the presidential election, while his parliamentary allies,<br>
under voting arrangements judged fair and honest, gained a func-<br>
tional majority in a legislature that had been reduced to only three<br>
parties. It is fair to say that Shevardnadze's commitment to the even-<br>
tual building of a democratic society in Georgia stands in substantial<br>
contrast with the authoritarian political propensities of the other two<br>
Transcaucasian regimes, especially the one in Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT<br>
<p>
Although the major powers of Europe, Asia, and North Amer-<br>
ica are intensely interested in the fate of the former Soviet<br>
Union as a whole --and of Russia and Ukraine in particular --<br>
the Transcaucasus does not draw much foreign policy focus, even<br>
though the U.N. and the OSCE are fitfully involved there. Indeed, the<br>
Transcaucasus has been largely ignored by the West for the last 300<br>
years, except for brief spurts of attention during the Crimean War<br>
(1853-56) and during the First and Second World Wars. Even then,<br>
the Transcaucasus was viewed only in the context of much broader in-<br>
ternational competition involving the fates of the Balkans, Iran,<br>
Turkey, and the Middle East, as well as of the British-Russian rivalry<br>
in South-Central Asia. Today, developments in the Transcaucasus--<br>
though of considerable strategic and psychological importance to Rus-<br>
sia, Turkey, Iran, and perhaps Ukraine -- are hardly likely to elicit<br>
much activism from distant powers that can barely bring themselves<br>
to address the instabilities of the former Yugoslavia and North Korea.<br>
<p>
	This semi-indifference is in marked contrast with Russia's giant<br>
role in the Transcaucasus. The rest of the world has not yet sought<br>
any effective counterweight but has merely issued modest advisories<br>
and admonitions on how to end bloodshed and reinforce the inde-<br>
pendence of the three new states. Implicit in this approach is a mod-<br>
icum of Western concern over preventing either the de facto or the<br>
de jure reincorporation of the Transcaucasus into Russia, lest this be<br>
the start of an effort to reconstitute the USSR as a whole in some non-<br>
Soviet guise.<br>
<p>
	Russia's actual motivations on future geopolitical arrangements<br>
are not yet clear. Some politicians accept the demise of the USSR;<br>
others seek that empire's resurrection in a new form. Foreign Minis-<br>
ter Yevgeny Primakov urges greater Russian leadership in the other<br>
new republics, without indicating his eventual aims. In any case, the<br>
sheer mechanics of reinventing the USSR would be daunting, given<br>
the international climate, Russia's weakness, and the formal institu-<br>
tionalization of the new states. Besides, an interim collaborative<br>
mechanism -- the CIS -- is already available to Moscow, and it requires<br>
no immediate definition of its ultimate shape.<br>
<p>
	_The CIS_. The conventional Western wisdom has been that the<br>
CIS is an ineffectual mechanism devised in haste in December 1991<br>
to soften the impact of the Soviet collapse. This view is true enough<br>
historically, but it does not take into account that the Russian gov-<br>
ernment has since made a major effort to breathe substance into the<br>
organization. Thus, the CIS now has a formal institutional framework<br>
that allows Moscow to seek to consolidate its regional preeminence<br>
without challenging accepted international legal norms.<br>
<p>
	All of the non-Baltic former republics are now members of the<br>
CIS, albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Concurrently, Moscow<br>
maintains a network of special contacts with its former republics. For-<br>
mally, there are two or three CIS summit sessions each year at which<br>
regional themes are discussed and backroom deals are negotiated.<br>
Similar assemblages occur regularly at ministerial levels in every field<br>
of policy and administration. At these meetings, set agendas are ad-<br>
dressed, and many bilateral and multilateral accords are signed --<br>
even though implementation is spotty, and some Russian initiatives,<br>
such as a mutual security treaty, have not yet gained approval. She-<br>
vardnadze himself used the January 1996 summit to gain overall CIS<br>
backing for a reassertion of Georgian authority over the two seces-<br>
sionist regions and for a partial blockade around Abkhazia, though<br>
realization of these efforts will again depend on Moscow's own fol-<br>
low-through (which has been erratic).<br>
<p>
	Cynical observers, who note the lack of formal institutional ma-<br>
chinery for enforcement, the weakness of administrative implemen-<br>
tation, and the partial marginalization of the weak CIS coordinating<br>
secretariat, doubt that the CIS will permit Moscow to assert effective<br>
control over the former republics. Yet this view fails to grasp the dy-<br>
namics of the growing Russian governmental commitment to, and ac-<br>
tivism in, the CIS. A large Ministry for Cooperation with the States<br>
Participating in the CIS is heavily involved with all the ex-union re-<br>
publics and coordinates nondiplomatic interministerial contacts<br>
among them, as well as between the former republics and the de-<br>
centralized entities of the Russian Federation, such as (autonomous)<br>
republics and oblasts (large regions). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br>
has active new divisions that radiate outward to the newly indepen-<br>
dent states and that generally oversee bilateral commissions dealing<br>
with those states. Defense Ministry ties are also significant to most<br>
CIS mernbers. A ministry for Nationalities and Regional Affairs is sup-<br>
posed to operate only within the Russian Federation but, in fact, is<br>
active as well in addressing ethnic questions in the other new re-<br>
publics (the "near abroad"). The presidential staff attempts overall<br>
coordination of these efforts, but the presidency's clout is reduced by<br>
its own inefficiencies and by Yeltsin's many distractions, as well as by<br>
the absence of a national political consensus on foreign and domes-<br>
tic policy options.<br>
<p>
	In this light, the long term results of Russia's institutional thrusts,<br>
both unilaterally and through the CIS, toward the former Soviet re-<br>
publics remain uncertain. Nonetheless, the potential for Moscow's<br>
leverage is clear: If Russia recovers its power and wishes to pursue<br>
hegemonic aspirations, it may do so.<br>
<p>
	_The United Nations_. Since the U.N. has not been a key organi-<br>
zation for dealing with most consequences of the USSR's collapse, it<br>
has also shied away from playing a conspicuous geopolitical role in<br>
the Transcaucasus (although the Security Council has undertaken<br>
periodic discussions of trouble spots and has given its blessing to the<br>
OSCE'S involvement). The only instance of direct U.N. activity has<br>
been in Abkhazia, where the U.N. deployed a modest observer mis-<br>
sion early in 1993 when the war between the Georgians and the Abk-<br>
haz separatists was still undecided. Following Georgia's defeat, an ef-<br>
fort was made to expand the mission into a peacekeeping force, but<br>
member nations failed to agree on such a U.N. mandate. After Rus-<br>
sia established its own force in June 1994, the U.N. observer mission<br>
was enlarged to become a military group of 136 officers charged with<br>
monitoring the situation and observing Russian peacekeeping activ-<br>
ities. An agreement brokered by Russia in April 1994 between Geor-<br>
gians and Abkhaz had already provided for U.N. sponsorship of in-<br>
ternational negotiations among the parties to reach a peaceful<br>
settlement, and those talks began in August 1994 and continued into<br>
1996. The Abkhaz regime has insisted upon both its own sovereignty<br>
and its coequal international status with Georgia, however, and this<br>
point has prevented any significant progress. This impasse makes<br>
continued reauthorizations of the U.N. military observer mission in<br>
Abkhazia uncertain, but threats by Georgian militants to resort again<br>
to the use of armed force are not very credible.<br>
<p>
	All parties are aware that, in the case of Abkhazia, as in all other<br>
Transcaucasian disputes, the real determinant of peace (other than<br>
the outcome of a possible renewal of hostilities) will be the degree<br>
and nature of Moscow's policy intervention. Only Moscow possesses<br>
the means to generate real pressures on the combatants. As events in<br>
1995 showed, though, even Moscow's pressure will be ineffectual un-<br>
less it is constant, coherent, and intense enough to convince all sides<br>
of Russia's determination to impose a solution. To date, Moscow has<br>
not given believable evidence of its level of commitment to early res-<br>
olution in any of the three Transcaucasian battle zones (Abkhazia,<br>
South Ossetia, and Nagorno Karabakh); it has only probed with half<br>
measures, which, as internal Russian divisions and the course of the<br>
war in Chechnya imply, may be all that Moscow is currently capable<br>
of contributing. Thus, all secessions remain unresolved, and cynical<br>
observers will maintain that this confusion coincidentally serves Rus-<br>
sia by increasing the dependence of all other players on Moscow.<br>
<p>
	_The OSCE_. The OSCE is still feeling its way as an active regional<br>
security organization in Europe that has as members all European<br>
states, all former Soviet republics, the United States, and Canada.<br>
Nonetheless, through decisions in its Permanent Council in Vienna,<br>
diplomatic activity by its member states, and its two field missions for<br>
Georgia and Nagorno Karabakh (both of which are headquartered<br>
in Tbilisi), the OSCE has had an active role in seeking to mediate con-<br>
flicts in the Transcaucasus.<br>
<p>
                 &lt;&lt;Georgia's Shevardnadze has shown great<br>
                   political skill in weakening his opponents.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
	The OSCE mission has been entrenched in Georgia since Decem-<br>
ber 1992. Its periodically renewed and general mandate calls for the<br>
promotion of human rights, democratization, and an end to the two<br>
secessionist regimes. Through members who are military officers, it<br>
also monitors the Russian led peacekeeping operation in South Os-<br>
setia. It has excellent access to all Georgian governmental and par-<br>
liamentary institutions from the chief of state on down, close links<br>
with the Russian embassy, and broad relations with the rest of the<br>
diplomatic corps. It consults with all major political groups, the me-<br>
dia, and academia, and it has significant grassroots links. OSCE mem-<br>
bers travel almost daily to the secessionist area of South Ossetia and<br>
monthly to Abkhazia. In both places, mission members have estab-<br>
lished repeated contacts with leading figures and keep in touch with<br>
the influential authorities of the Federative Republic of North Osse-<br>
tia-Alania within Russia.<br>
<p>
	The chief of mission (a position that has been held of late by a<br>
succession of very able German ambassadors) regularly exercises his<br>
wide latitude for initiatives under the mandate. Besides his work in<br>
Georgia, he travels regularly to Moscow for consultations and is a<br>
member of the four party Joint Control Commission for South Os-<br>
setia. The OSCE also participates in the already noted sporadic,<br>
United Nations-led, international negotiating sessions regarding the<br>
Abkhazian conundrum.<br>
<p>
	All of the foregoing involvements have given the mission con-<br>
siderable scope for imaginative approaches to the myriad issues in-<br>
volving Georgia. Certainly it has facilitated contacts among the dis-<br>
putants in South Ossetia and put human rights abuses in Abkhazia<br>
on the international agenda. The mission has also become an ac-<br>
cepted participant in all relevant bilateral and multilateral diplomatic<br>
efforts, though Russia remains the only player able to alter the con-<br>
text and thrust of the negotiations. The mission can be useful in a<br>
carefully delineated role, but it is hardly independently decisive,<br>
since, barring maximum Russian pressure, the secessionist regimes<br>
have no inclination to self destruct by agreeing to subordinate them<br>
selves to Georgian sovereignty.<br>
<p>
	The OSCE mission on Nagorno-Karabakh has yet to find a firm<br>
role in addressing that conflict, because the main action continues<br>
to revolve around multilateral diplomacy at OSCE headquarters in Vi<br>
enna and in major capitals, rather than on the ground in Armenia<br>
and Azerbaijan. Still, the mission has been able to improve contacts<br>
with ofhcials of the three regimes involved (Azerbaijan, Armenia,<br>
and Armenian insurgents in Nagorno-Karabakh).<br>
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIAN FUTURES<br>
<p>
As long as Russia maintains sufficient internal cohesion, it will<br>
be able to dominate the Transcaucasus politically and militar-<br>
ily. The three Transcaucasian states will probably preserve<br>
their formal sovereignty, develop a panoply of domestic policies, and<br>
carry on a broad range of international relationships, with one another<br>
and with the West. However, a Shevardnadze initiative on February<br>
28, 1996, to go further by forging closer collaboration among the three<br>
and, collectively, with neighboring Iran, Russia, and Turkey, is now<br>
quiescent in the face of local antagonisms, the great weight of Russia,<br>
and the lack of any counterweight from currently weak Iran and<br>
Turkey. Yet, on June 3, 1996, Yeltsin was able to convene in the Russ-<br>
ian city of Kislovodsk the three Transcaucasian chiefs of state and the<br>
heads of all (north) Caucasian political entities within the Russian<br>
Federation (without the participation of Iran and Turkey) to empha-<br>
size implicitly Russia's de facto hegemony and, explicitly, its large<br>
"peacekeeping role." They will not form a collaborative entity for re-<br>
gional selfSassertion, however, nor do they have the potential indi-<br>
vidually to resist Russia's de facto hegemony, which is exercised bilat-<br>
erally and through the CIS.<br>
<p>
	Whereas Georgian leaders in 1992 were saying bravely to foreign<br>
diplomats that they were willing to cooperate with Moscow on the<br>
basis of mutual respect to realize reasonable and shared objectives,<br>
their current line is quite different. Now they accept that their coun-<br>
try is largely subject to Russian geopolitical decisions. They merely<br>
hope that wise Russian leadership will recognize that Moscow's long<br>
run interests will be better served by a "loyal" Georgia that has been<br>
treated respectfully than by an embittered Georgia that has been<br>
forced to kowtow to Russian demands.<br>
<p>
	Armenia is in the same situation, though perhaps more willingly<br>
and enthusiastically than Georgia. This attitude stems from Arme-<br>
nia's historical hope for Christian Russia's protective embrace and<br>
from its need to overcome its partial isolation in a region of Muslim<br>
states. Moreover, as a country with military problems, it needs the<br>
backing of the large Russian armed forces (however disrupted the lat-<br>
ter may now be).<br>
<p>
	Azerbaijan seems not yet to have reached this conclusion about<br>
links to Russia, perhaps because it is still exploring the benefits of<br>
ties with Iran and Turkey. But Azerbaijan will very likely end up in a<br>
position similar to its neighbors because it is too weak by itself to re-<br>
sist Russian economic and commercial leverage (especially on petro-<br>
leum development). It cannot afford to depend on Iran, which has<br>
its own hegemonic aspirations regarding Azeris; and Turkey, though<br>
politically supportive, is not powerful enough to be decisive.<br>
<p>
	The conclusion that there are no local or external forces able to<br>
galvanize Transcaucasian stability, self-assertiveness, and collabora-<br>
tion flows from the geopolitical stance taken by the major Western<br>
powers. While they may have their own preferences for the region's<br>
evolution, Western states have not publicly identified any vital in<br>
terests there. Hence, no state has felt strongly enough about this mat-<br>
ter to make it an issue in its own relations with Moscow as part of an<br>
effort to keep Moscow from reestablishing its sphere of influence in<br>
the Transcaucasus. Indeed, judging by the West's conciliatory and<br>
compromising approach to Moscow in 1995 regarding an Azeri deal<br>
that would bring oil from the Caspian Sea area via a pipeline through<br>
Russia, the West seems to be accepting such a Russian sphere. Thus,<br>
given the lack of indigenous strength and the West's vacillation, the<br>
future of the Transcaucasus will depend essentially on which politi-<br>
cians become Russia's leaders in the next years and on which poli-<br>
cies they adopt toward the "near and far abroad."<br>
<p>
	A relatively hegemonic Russian approach to the Transcaucasus<br>
need not be interpreted in the West as the harbinger of a confronta-<br>
tional external policy in Moscow toward the West or of a desire to<br>
reconstitute the USSR in a new guise. There is simply too much his-<br>
torical baggage in the Transcaucasus for Moscow to refrain from vig-<br>
orous involvement in the region. In Russia's mindset, instability in<br>
the Transcaucasus, combined with troubles in its own Caucasus, im-<br>
pels the Kremlin to be particularly assertive along the former USSR'S<br>
borders with Iran and Turkey. The U.N. and the OSCE can have use<br>
ful but only limited functions in a region where a local big power<br>
moves instinctively to predominate.<br>
<p>
	America has tried, along with the EU, to implement a policy that<br>
would increase the stability of each regime in the Transcaucasus and<br>
of the region as a whole, without challenging Russia's evident para-<br>
mountcy and without undertaking policy commitments of its own.<br>
This policy seems eminently correct in the interim. What the United<br>
States should do if Moscow ever asserted a much more intensive<br>
sphere of influence would have to be determined on the basis of the<br>
overall U.S. and European stakes in the relationship with Moscow<br>
rather than strictly on the merits of the particular situation in the<br>
Transcaucasus. The realities of international politics may well mean<br>
that the three Transcaucasian states never attain the "justice" that<br>
their peoples objectively deserve, which is just the fate that has be<br>
fallen Kurds, Bosnians, and many other nationalities.<br>

ANC Renews Call for Princeton to Remove Heath Lowry<br>
<p>
New York Times Reports That Scholars Fear Turkey is Using its Endowment <br>
to "Whitewash its Role in the Massacre of a Million Armenians in World <br>
War I"<br>
<p>
Watertown, MA  -  The Armenian National Committee of the Eastern United <br>
States has renewed its call for Princeton University to remove <br>
Professor Heath Lowry as Ataturk Chair of Turkish Studies, and for <br>
the school's administration to conduct a thorough review of the hiring <br>
practices which led to Lowry's selection to this post.<br>
<p>
Lowry's controversial tenure at Princeton was highlighted in a page-one <br>
article in the December 9th New York Times.  The article, entitled <br>
"Donations to Universities Sometimes Carry a Price," stated that "At <br>
Princeton University, the controversy this year was over the endowment <br>
of a chair in Turkish studies that some scholars feared could be used <br>
by the Government of Turkey to whitewash its role in the massacre <br>
of a million Armenians in World War I."  The Turkish government has <br>
provided more than $750,000 to endow the Princeton chair.<br>
<p>
Earlier this year, a group of prominent scholars and leading academics <br>
issued a petition condemning efforts by the Turkish government to <br>
discredit scholarship on the Armenian Genocide and specifically <br>
cited Professor Lowry for his unethical campaign to deny this crime <br>
against humanity.  The statement read, in part, "Scholars who deny <br>
genocide lend their considerable authority to the acceptance of this <br>
ultimate human crime."  The statement, which was initiated by Colgate <br>
University professor Peter Balakian, was signed by distinguished <br>
scholars Deborah Lipstadt and Robert Jay Lifton and authors <br>
Norman Mailer and Arthur Miller, among many others.<br>
<p>
The controversy surrounding Prof. Lowry was reported at length by the <br>
New York Times in a May 22, 1996 article, entitled, "Princeton is <br>
Accused of Fronting for the Turkish Government."  In this article, the <br>
New York Times reported that Lowry, who had previously worked at the <br>
Turkish government funded Institute for Turkish Studies, had been <br>
accused of creating a "center for propaganda about Turkey's role <br>
in the massacre of a million Armenians during World War I."  Additional <br>
stories appeared in the Boston Globe, the Bergen Record, and the <br>
Chronicle for Higher Education.  A comprehensive account of Lowry's <br>
revisionist activities was published by the Journal for Holocaust and <br>
Genocide Studies.<br>
<p>
"We seek to highlight the circumstances which led to the hiring of a <br>
confirmed Genocide revisionist by Princeton University," said <br>
ANC-Eastern Region chairman Harry Derderian.  "Professor Lowry's record <br>
of unethical conduct is clearly apparent, as are the links between his <br>
hiring and the $750,000 in donations provided to Princeton by his past <br>
employer, the government of Turkey."<br>
<p>
"Princeton University needs to answer a number of extremely troubling <br>
questions about its hiring practices, not just to the Armenian American <br>
community but to the academic community at-large," continued Derderian.<br>
<p>
Last year the ANC-Eastern United States issued a statement which <br>
documented Professor Lowry's unethical conduct, including his past work <br>
for the Turkish government.  That statement read in part, "His <br>
service to the Turkish government was revealed, by accident, in private <br>
correspondence between Lowry and Turkish Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir.  <br>
These letters, which were published in the Journal of Genocide and <br>
Holocaust Studies, revealed that Lowry actively conspired with the <br>
Turkish Embassy to discredit scholarship which mentions the Armenian <br>
Genocide.  His activity in this area alone should serve as sufficient <br>
cause for Princeton University to disassociate itself with Dr. Lowry <br>
and his brand of false scholarship."<br>
<p>
Individuals who are interested in learning more about this issue are <br>
urged to contact Grace Kulegian at the offices of the Armenian National <br>
Committee - Eastern Region at (617) 923-1918.<br>
<p>
The Armenian National Committee of the Eastern United States is a grass <br>
roots public affairs organization that has worked for decades with <br>
public officials to voice the deep and abiding concerns of the Armenian <br>
American community.  The ANC-ER, which is part of a larger network of <br>
ANC chapters and offices situated throughout the United States, has <br>
affiliates around the world.<br>

1. RUSSIAN GENERAL FAVORS A MORE PRO-AZERI POLICY<br>
2. US AID TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN ARMENIA<br>
3. TURKEY TO GIVE AID TO NORTHERN CYPRUS<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
1. RUSSIAN GENERAL FAVORS A MORE PRO-AZERI POLICY<br>
ISTANBUL-The chairman of the Russian Federations <br>
parliamentary defense committee, General Lev Rokhlin, said <br>
that Russia, until now, has defended Armenias interests at <br>
the expense of losing Azerbaijan to NATO and the West, <br>
Istanbul-based Marmara reported, quoting the Baku <br>
correspondent of Zaman newspaper, Farouk Aslan.<br>
	According to Aslan, Rokhlin was concerned that Russia <br>
would lose Azerbaijan unless policy changes are adopted <br>
soon.<br>
	"Armenia must recognize the territorial integrity of <br>
Azerbaijan, and must withdraw from the occupied territories. <br>
We give Armenia until April to resolve the Karabakh issue," <br>
Rokhlin was quoted as saying during an ORT television <br>
broadcast.<br>
	Rokhlin warned that in case Armenia fails to meet the <br>
April deadline, Russia would pull out its forces as well as <br>
any military equipment from Armenia.<br>
	According to Rokhlin, Russian policy in this matter is <br>
wrong. In addition, the balance continually shifts in the <br>
region and as a result of its policy Russia is left out, <br>
Rokhlin said.<br>
	Commenting on Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionovs <br>
recent visit to Baku which did not result in any specific <br>
military agreement, Rokhlin said, "Our policy of siding with <br>
Armenia has alienated the Azeris. As long as the Karabakh <br>
issue remains unresolved, healthy economic, military and <br>
political relations between Russia and Azerbaijan cannot be <br>
forged."<br>
	"We will not enter into war with Turkey for Armenia. <br>
Our relations with Turkey are progressing on a daily basis <br>
and have reached a beneficial stage. If we continue our <br>
harsh policy, then Azerbaijan will gravitate toward the West <br>
and we will bear the loss," Rokhlin said.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. US AID TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN ARMENIA<br>
WASHINGTON-The Clinton administration continues to expand <br>
its assistance programs in Armenia designed to promote <br>
democratic pluralism, strengthen the rule of law, expand the <br>
independent media, support parliamentary and political party <br>
development and facilitate free and fair elections, reported <br>
the Armenian National Committee of America.<br>
	"We welcome the increased attention that the Clinton <br>
administration has placed on democratic development in <br>
Armenia and encourage the expansion of these programs during <br>
the coming year," said Aram Hamparian, Executive Director of <br>
the ANCA.  "This assistance continues to serve as a strong <br>
signal to the people of Armenia that the United States will <br>
stand with them as they seek to overcome the legacy of an <br>
authoritarian political system and fully realize their <br>
democratic aspirations."<br>
	The ANCA supports high levels of US assistance for <br>
Armenia and direct aid to Karabakh.  Since 1991, the US has <br>
provided more than $600 million to Armenia to help offset <br>
the effects of blockades and to promote economic and <br>
political reform.  The ANCAs broad-based grassroots <br>
advocacy, legislative strategy, and long-standing relations <br>
with congressional leaders and Administration officials have <br>
all contributed significantly to the high level of aid <br>
Armenia has received, currently the second highest per-<br>
capita in the world.  Listed below are democracy programs <br>
administered by the Agency for International Development; <br>
the US Information Service, the Department of Defense and <br>
the Department of Agriculture.<br>

3. TURKEY TO GIVE AID TO NORTHERN CYPRUS<br>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Turkey and Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus <br>
on Friday signed an economic cooperation accord envisaging <br>
financial aid of $250 million to the northern part of the <br>
divided island, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.<br>
   Turkeys Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said at a <br>
signing ceremony in Ankara that the aid would primarily be <br>
used in the fields of tourism, education and industry.<br>
	The signing ceremony was also attended by Dervis <br>
Eroglu, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Turkish <br>
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is only recognized <br>
by Turkey.<br>
	Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops <br>
occupied the northern third of the island in response to a <br>
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup engineered by a junta then <br>
ruling Greece.<br>
	The Mediterranean island is the site of a heavy military <br>
build-up with 30,000 Turkish troops stationed in the north <br>
and an 11,500-strong Greek Cypriot national guard in the <br>
south.<br>
	Erbakan and Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller brushed <br>
off reports that the Greek Cypriot government was close to a <br>
deal to buy surface-to-air missiles from Russia.<br>
	"The arming of southern Cyprus does not make us concerned, <br>
because we can protect the Turkish Republic of Northern <br>
Cyprus with ease," Ciller told reporters.<br>
	She said that Greek Cypriots would be the ones harmed most <br>
by the arming of the Greek Cypriot military forces.<br>
	The Greek Cypriot government has kept an official silence <br>
on reports it will buy the Russian S300 missile system, also <br>
known as SA-10c.<br>
	A Cypriot defense source said on Friday the deal <br>
still had to go to parliament for approval, but the <br>
semi-government-run Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation <br>
reported that a deal will be signed on Monday.<br>

     ANTI-DEFAMATION ALERT<br>
     <br>
     January 3, 1996<br>
     <br>
     NEW YORK TIMES CLAIMS ARMENIA IS DRIFTING TOWARDS DICTATORSHIP<br>
     <br>
     On the front-page of the January 3 New York Times, journalist Michael <br>
     Specter, after having been denied an interview by President <br>
     Ter-Petrossian, claims Armenia is drifting towards a dictatorship.<br>
     <br>
     The article, while accurately portraying improving living conditions <br>
     in Armenia, contains many contradictions, inaccuracies, and misleading <br>
     statements. The tone of the article is anti-Ter-Petrossian and <br>
     anti-government -- giving neither any credit for the improving <br>
     economy. In so doing, the author fails to meet New York Times <br>
     standards of fairness and accuracy.<br>
     <br>
     The author states "They [Armenians] want to be compared with the West <br>
     [not their neighbors]." True -- Armenia is striving to become a <br>
     western-style democracy. In just over 5 years of independence, Armenia <br>
     is doing reasonably well compared with its neighbors. According to its <br>
     December 18, 1996 annual report, U.S. based Freedom House rates <br>
     Armenia, Russia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine as "partly free" -- <br>
     ahead of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, <br>
     Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, rated as "not free". These ratings are <br>
     based on a check-list of political rights and civil liberties <br>
     including the status of opposition, nature of electoral laws, and the <br>
     degree of freedom of assembly and the media. Other neighbors include <br>
     Turkey -- a secular democracy with an internationally recognized <br>
     abysmal human rights record -- and Iran -- a nation which America <br>
     considers a terrorist country.<br>
     <br>
     The author attributes the combined daily press run of 31,000 copies <br>
     for all Armenian newspapers to a lack of free press, neglecting to <br>
     take into account excessive expenses associated with purchasing paper <br>
     and printing.<br>
     <br>
     Democracy is not established overnight -- changes are many and <br>
     sometimes slow in coming. As the author states, positive changes are <br>
     occurring: inflation is decreasing, electricity is abundant, the birth <br>
     rate is rising, and real incomes, while still low, are rising, <br>
     However, the author overlooks recently begun implementation of <br>
     government reforms, including restructuring and new appointments. He <br>
     dismisses the experience brought to the new government by people who <br>
     have served Armenia in the West as diplomats and are now in such <br>
     high-level positions as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Minister <br>
     of Trade.<br>
     <br>
     The author neglects to mention that charges of election tampering and <br>
     violence during the September 1996 presidential elections were made <br>
     against both the government and opposition. He fails to mention the <br>
     opposition's storming of the Parliament and the attacks against the <br>
     Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Parliament.<br>
     <br>
     The author falsely claims that the United States declined to offer <br>
     congratulations to President Ter-Petrossian after the recent <br>
     elections.<br>
     <br>
     The author's attacks notwithstanding, the United States continues to <br>
     display faith in Armenia by past, present and continued humanitarian <br>
     aid and development support to Armenia including democracy and <br>
     governance programs, NGO sector development, media, and educational <br>
     programs. Congress approved $95 million in U.S. aid to Armenia for <br>
     fiscal year 1997. This amount of aid is second only to Israel (on a <br>
     per capita basis).<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     As Armenian-Americans, proud of both our countries, we should ensure <br>
     that articles written about Armenia are complete, thorough, and <br>
     accurate. Equally important, we must ensure that articles not meeting <br>
     these criteria are not left unanswered.<br>

     The Armenian-American Action Committee (ARAMAC) is the grassroots arm <br>
     of the Armenian Assembly of America and  supports grassroots activism <br>
     and anti-defamation. Providing accurate information regarding Armenian <br>
     issues as well as responding to inaccurate information is critical <br>
     today given that greater attention is being given to Armenian issues <br>
     in Congress. Mobilizing, encouraging, and supporting the one million <br>
     Armenians throughout the United States in disseminating information, <br>
     contacting members of Congress, and impacting legislation concerning <br>
     Armenian-American issues is an integral part of improved U.S.-Armenia <br>
     relations as well as improved conditions in Armenia and <br>
     Nagorno-Karabagh.<br>

     Drift to Dictatorship Clouds Armenia's Happiness By Michael Specter <br>
     <br>
     The New York Times -- January 3, 1997<br>
     <br>
     YEREVAN, Armenia --This should have been a glorious winter for the <br>
     troubled people of Armenia. For the first time in years peace has <br>
     taken root. It is no longer necessary for anyone to burn furniture or <br>
     park benches to keep warm. The longest lines at stores are of shoppers <br>
     clamoring to buy microwave ovens to use in kitchens that last year had <br>
     no electricity and little food. <br>
     <br>
     Suddenly there are cafes, restaurants, banks and a currency worth <br>
     holding for more than an hour. Inflation is plummeting and real <br>
     incomes, while still low, are slowly on the rise. Boutiques sell <br>
     French shoes and Italian suits. After years of decline, the birth rate <br>
     --a raw indicator of hope and determination --has started to edge up. <br>
     <br>
     But there are no celebrations this season. Once regarded as an oasis <br>
     of civility and democracy among former Soviet republics, Armenia has <br>
     drifted toward dictatorship. <br>
     <br>
     Presidential elections this fall were found to be so deeply flawed <br>
     that the United States, which provides more foreign aid to Armenia per <br>
     person than to any country except Israel, declined to offer routine <br>
     congratulations to the winner, Levon Ter-Petrossian. It has been a <br>
     year of diminishing press freedom and rising human-rights violations. <br>
     Most of all, it has been a year in which Mr. Ter-Petrossian, once <br>
     revered as the man who brought democracy to Armenia, appears to have <br>
     completed a journey from liberal intellectual to stony autocrat.<br>
     <br>
     Mr. Ter-Petrossian rarely speaks in public. He has no tolerance for <br>
     opposition. His meetings are few and many of his decisions are made in <br>
     secret. Despite the large and influential Armenian diaspora in the <br>
     United States, he has not given an interview to a Western reporter for <br>
     at least two years because, Gerard Libaridian, his senior adviser, <br>
     said, "They only use a short quote and they take him out of context." <br>
     (Mr. Ter-Petrossian, a philologist who was jailed by the Soviets as a <br>
     dissident and speaks 10 languages with relative fluency, initially <br>
     agreed to be interviewed for this article. He then said through an <br>
     aide that he was too busy.) <br>
     <br>
     "We had a marvelous dream of freedom a few years ago," said Berj <br>
     Zeytountsian, a prominent writer who was the independent country's <br>
     first Culture Minister. "And here we believe in our dreams. But now <br>
     they are gone and we are left wondering what we have in their place. <br>
     Peace is nice; we all love it. But peace of mind, that is even <br>
     better." <br>
     <br>
     Long animated by a sense of justice and idealism that Armenians say <br>
     set it apart from its neighbors, the country today is fighting simply <br>
     to keep a grasp on the unique sense of solidarity it once held dear. <br>
     <br>
     Not everyone cares of course: Working people want food on their table, <br>
     and this year, for the first time in recent memory, most Armenians are <br>
     able to buy it. But politically and emotionally, a country that had <br>
     been remarkably unified is now split. <br>
     <br>
     Leading opposition members of Parliament usually don't even bother to <br>
     attend sessions. Opposition politicians and members of the press were <br>
     beaten and jailed after the disputed elections that Mr. Ter-Petrossian <br>
     won by a few percentage points -- and the man he narrowly defeated, <br>
     former Prime Minister Vazgen Manoukian, has only recently emerged from <br>
     hiding. <br>
     <br>
     Armenia may be more open and accessible than Azerbaijan, the <br>
     oil-producing neighbor that Armenia has been fighting since the Soviet <br>
     Union started to crumble. But people here do not want to be compared <br>
     with their neighbors. They want to be compared with the West. And even <br>
     at the highest levels there is anger and fear that this has become a <br>
     country where the Defense Minister could state on national television <br>
     that he would never have accepted Mr. Manoukian's victory, "Even if he <br>
     won 100 percent of the vote." <br>
     <br>
     Armen V. Sarkisyan, the new Prime Minister, who openly and with regret <br>
     acknowledges the frailty of his country's democracy, said, "We cannot <br>
     tolerate people like that." "We must now move back from the <br>
     precipice," he continued in an interview. "Somebody has to speak to <br>
     the opposition rather than blaming them for everything that is wrong <br>
     with Armenia. Somebody has to say that the press is truly free and <br>
     then stand by to guarantee it. Somebody has to convince our enormous <br>
     diaspora that they are welcome and needed here, not just once for a <br>
     visit but as often as they can come. Somebody has to make it clear <br>
     that we will not just tolerate dissent, we will welcome it."<br>
     <br>
     They are noble words, and by all accounts he means them. But only one <br>
     man rules Armenia today and while he insists in speeches and <br>
     statements that democracy is sacred to him, Mr. Ter-Petrossian does <br>
     not act as if it is. <br>
     <br>
     The President's turn away from democracy began in 1994, when he banned <br>
     a major opposition party and imposed restrictions on the press. Even <br>
     now, with many of those restrictions lifted, there is a combined daily <br>
     press run of only 31,000 copies for all newspapers in the country, <br>
     which has a population of 3 million. The fairness of Parliamentary <br>
     elections last year was questioned sharply by international observers, <br>
     and a new Constitution gives the President unusually sweeping powers. <br>
     <br>
     "The situation in our country has become better," said Nagor <br>
     Avedikian, editor of Azg, which means The Nation, an independent daily <br>
     paper. "The economy is not as desperate as it once was. There is no <br>
     war. But as that has happened, our president has become more remote <br>
     and autocratic. The truth is that he is a democrat only in the most <br>
     Platonic sense." <br>
     <br>
     For more than six years Armenia has been unofficially at war with <br>
     Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian mountain enclave of <br>
     Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is much bigger, <br>
     far richer and backed by its Muslim ally, Turkey. Yet the tenacious <br>
     Armenians won in a rout. While a fragile peace holds, the political <br>
     questions have never been settled, and most countries officially <br>
     oppose Armenia's position. <br>
     <br>
     "Many countries think we are being unreasonable about Karabakh," said <br>
     Mr. Libaridian, who has taken an energetic lead in trying to negotiate <br>
     a settlement. "But I would rather have a problem of perception, and <br>
     even of being isolated, than the problem of 1915. We had one genocide <br>
     in this century. It was enough for us. It will never happen again." <br>
     <br>
     He was referring to the event that still defines the nation: In 1915 <br>
     vast numbers of Armenians, perhaps more than a million, died at the <br>
     hands of the Ottoman Turks, through forced resettlement, starvation <br>
     and massacres. It is the fundamental fact of modern Armenia and it <br>
     still governs the people's complex political and psychological world <br>
     views. Many are defensive, combative and convinced that the moment <br>
     they relax they will again be annihilated. <br>
     <br>
     Today, Turkey and Azerbaijan have imposed a total import blockade on <br>
     Armenia. That leaves Iran and Georgia as neighboring trading partners. <br>
     Iran is an ally, but not an ideal one. Its economy is not very strong <br>
     and any relationship with Iran angers Armenia's most powerful patron, <br>
     the United States.<br>
     <br>
     Not that any of that matters to average people. Many are beginning to <br>
     have what they care about: food, energy (after the recent reopening of <br>
     a nuclear power station that sits on a geological fault line) and the <br>
     sense that maybe their children won't die in a war for their survival. <br>
     <br>
     "I don't really care what the president does," said Armina Nagosian, <br>
     28, a saleswoman in the Samsung electronics store in downtown Yerevan. <br>
     "Look at this place. People are buying things they never even thought <br>
     they would see in this country."<br>
     <br>
     All around her, men and women were choosing among color televisions, <br>
     microwaves, and fancy new vacuum cleaners. <br>
     <br>
     "This store didn't even have electricity until a few months ago," she <br>
     said. "And that is what people care about. Not who sits in <br>
     Parliament."<br>
     <br>
     Although the economy has improved in the last two years -- real annual <br>
     growth was up 7 percent in 1995 and has been growing at almost the <br>
     same rate this year according to the International Monetary Fund <br>
     --trade accounts for the improvement. There is no robust banking <br>
     system, so nobody earns interest, few people pay taxes and nobody has <br>
     money to invest in long-term projects like factories and <br>
     communications systems. <br>
     <br>
     Despite an official monthly average income of about $20 and few <br>
     natural resources, Armenia has one of the highest literacy rates in <br>
     the world. It is a society of talkative, independent people. <br>
     <br>
     "When we were part of the Soviet Union, we had no voice or vote," said <br>
     Vahan Barseghian, 47, a shepherd who lives outside the capital but <br>
     often comes to the bustling central market to sell his meat. "The <br>
     point of independence was really to give us the right to live the way <br>
     we want. Now we have an Armenian leader who treats us like the <br>
     Russians did. I don't really know if that is better or worse than <br>
     before."<br>

		 Itar-Tass domestic news digest of January 3: 4.<br>
<p>
OTC  1/3/97 11:17 AM  <br>
<p>
         BAKU, January 3 (Itar-Tass) - The filling of an export oil pipeline,<br>
intended for the pumping of oil from Baku to Novorossiisk, began on the  first<br>
days of the new year in the capital of Azerbaijan, Sayad Ibragimov,  First Vice<br>
President of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR),  told Tass today. <br>
   According to Ibragimov, ten days are given to conducting that important<br>
operation, which will precede the beginning of the transportation of  Azeri oil<br>
to the world market across the Russian territory. In order to  create the needed<br>
pressure in the oil pipeline at the 255-kilometre-long  section connecting Baku<br>
and the Azeri border with Daghestan (a total  length of the pipeline is 1,411<br>
kilometres), it is necessary to pump  into it 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of oil,<br>
Ibragimov said. Oil  transportation, planned for February and March, will amount<br>
to 30,000  and 40,000 tonnes respectively. An order for that has already been<br>
received by the Transneft company of Russia. It will handle the  transportation<br>
of Azeri oil to Novorossiisk, where it will be loaded to  tankers and exported<br>
to other countries. <br>
   The Azeri International Operation Company (AIOC) developing the Caspian<br>
off-shore oil fields is also satisfied with the pace of putting into  operation<br>
of the Baku-Novorossiisk export oil pipeline, intended mostly  for the<br>
transportation of early oil from the Caspian oil fields of  Azerbaijan. It is<br>
planned to start oil production at those oil fields  late in August, this year.<br>
Its president Terry Adams gave an interview  to the Zerkalo newspaper on the New<br>
Year eve, in which he said that he  was very much pleased with the results,<br>
achieved so quickly after the  signing of a contract on the development of three<br>
Azeri oil fields on  September 20, 1994. Foreign shareholders of AIOC, including<br>
the Russian  LUKoil company, are proud of the results achieved. According to<br>
Adams,  the speeding up of the implementation of the programme of early oil<br>
production resulted in the increase of the company's allocations for  that<br>
purpose from 600 million to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, which makes  about one<br>
sixth of total investments in the project. <br>

   V L A D I K A V K A Z -- The Transcaucasian highway is being cleared of<br>
snow. All transit passengers have been evacuated by helicopter to  Vladikavkaz,<br>
North Ossetian Minister for Emergency Situations Nikolai  Makoyev told<br>
Itar-Tass. Several dozens of trucks remain on the highway.  The truck drivers<br>
refused to leave, and were given warn clothing, food  and medicines. The North<br>
Ossetian Ministry for Emergency Situations is  closely watching developments on<br>
the highway, which connects the  Caucasus with southern Russia. A week ago<br>
snowslides blocked the highway  in several places and locked in over 300 transit<br>
passengers, who were  heading for Vladikavkaz and Transcaucasia, and 120 buses,<br>
cars and  trucks near the Rokskiy tunnel. <br>

          Drift to Dictatorship Clouds Armenia's Happiness<br>
<p>
<p>
          By MICHAEL SPECTER<br>
<p>
               EREVAN, Armenia -- This should have been a glorious winter for<br>
the troubled people of Armenia. For the first time in years peace has taken<br>
root. It is no longer necessary for anyone to burn furniture or park benches to<br>
keep warm. The longest lines at stores are of shoppers clamoring to buy<br>
microwave ovens to use in kitchens that last year had no electricity and little<br>
food. <br>
<p>
          Suddenly there are cafes, restaurants, banks and a currency worth<br>
holding for more than an hour. Inflation is plummeting and real incomes, while<br>
still low, are slowly on the rise. Boutiques sell French shoes and Italian<br>
suits. After years of decline, the birth rate -- a raw indicator of hope and<br>
determination -- has started to edge up. <br>
<p>
          But there are no celebrations this season. Once regarded as an oasis<br>
of civility and democracy among former Soviet republics, Armenia has drifted<br>
toward dictatorship. <br>
<p>
          Presidential elections this fall were found to be so deeply flawed<br>
that the United States, which provides more foreign aid to Armenia per person<br>
than to any country except Israel, declined to offer routine congratulations to<br>
the winner, Levon Ter-Petrossian. <br>
<p>
          It has been a year of diminishing press freedom and rising<br>
human-rights violations. Most of all, it has been a year in which<br>
Ter-Petrossian, once revered as the man who brought democracy to Armenia,<br>
appears to have completed a journey from liberal intellectual to stony autocrat.<br>
<p>
<p>
          Ter-Petrossian rarely speaks in public. He has no tolerance for<br>
opposition. His meetings are few and many of his decisions are made in secret.<br>
Despite the large and influential Armenian diaspora in the United States, he has<br>
not given an interview to a Western reporter for at least two years because,<br>
Gerard Libaridian, his senior adviser, said, "They only use a short quote and<br>
they take him out of context." <br>
<p>
          (Ter-Petrossian, a philologist who was jailed by the Soviets as a<br>
dissident and speaks 10 languages with relative fluency, initially agreed to be<br>
interviewed for this article. He then said through an aide that he was too<br>
busy.) <br>
<p>
          "We had a marvelous dream of freedom a few years ago," said Berj<br>
Zeytountsian, a prominent writer who was the independent country's first culture<br>
minister. "And here we believe in our dreams. But now they are gone and we are<br>
left wondering what we have in their place.<br>
          Peace is nice; we all love it. But peace of mind, that is even<br>
better." <br>
<p>
          Long animated by a sense of justice and idealism that Armenians say<br>
set it apart from its neighbors, the country today is fighting simply to keep a<br>
grasp on the unique sense of solidarity it once held dear. <br>
<p>
          Not everyone cares of course: Working people want food on their table,<br>
and this year, for the first time in recent memory, most Armenians are able to<br>
buy it. But politically and emotionally, a country that had been remarkably<br>
unified is now split. <br>
<p>
          Leading opposition members of Parliament usually don't even bother to<br>
attend sessions. Opposition politicians and members of the press were beaten and<br>
jailed after the disputed elections that Ter-Petrossian won by a few percentage<br>
points -- and the man he narrowly defeated, former Prime Minister Vazgen<br>
Manoukian, has only recently emerged from hiding. <br>
<p>
          Armenia may be more open and accessible than Azerbaijan, the<br>
oil-producing neighbor that Armenia has been fighting since the Soviet Union<br>
started to crumble. But people here do not want to be compared with their<br>
neighbors. They want to be compared with the West. <br>
<p>
          And even at the highest levels there is anger and fear that this has<br>
become a country where the defense minister could state on national television<br>
that he would never have accepted Manoukian's victory, "even if he won 100<br>
percent of the vote." <br>
<p>
          Armen Sarkisyan, the new prime minister, who openly and with regret<br>
acknowledges the frailty of his country's democracy, said, "We cannot tolerate<br>
people like that." <br>
<p>
          "We must now move back from the precipice," he continued in an<br>
interview. "Somebody has to speak to the opposition rather than blaming them for<br>
everything that is wrong with Armenia. Somebody has to say that the press is<br>
truly free and then stand by to guarantee it.<br>
          Somebody has to convince our enormous diaspora that they are welcome<br>
and needed here, not just once for a visit but as often as they can come.<br>
Somebody has to make it clear that we will not just tolerate dissent, we will<br>
welcome it." <br>
<p>
          They are noble words, and by all accounts he means them. But only one<br>
man rules Armenia today and while he insists in speeches and statements that<br>
democracy is sacred to him, Ter-Petrossian does not act as if it is. <br>
<p>
          The president's turn away from democracy began in 1994, when he banned<br>
a major opposition party and imposed restrictions on the press. Even now, with<br>
many of those restrictions lifted, there is a combined daily press run of only<br>
31,000 copies for all newspapers in the         country, which has a population<br>
of 3 million. <br>
<p>
          The fairness of parliamentary elections last year was questioned<br>
sharply by international observers, and a new constitution gives the president<br>
unusually sweeping powers. <br>
<p>
          "The situation in our country has become better," said Nagor<br>
Avedikian, editor of Azg, which means The Nation, an independent daily paper.<br>
"The economy is not as desperate as it once was. There is no war. But as that<br>
has happened, our president has become more remote and autocratic. The truth is<br>
that he is a democrat only in the most Platonic sense." <br>
<p>
          For more than six years Armenia has been unofficially at war with<br>
Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which<br>
is in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is much bigger, far richer and backed by its Muslim<br>
ally, Turkey. Yet the tenacious Armenians won in a rout. <br>
<p>
          While a fragile peace holds, the political questions have never been<br>
settled, and most countries officially oppose Armenia's position. <br>
<p>
          "Many countries think we are being unreasonable about Karabakh," said<br>
Libaridian, who has taken an energetic lead in trying to negotiate a settlement.<br>
"But I would rather have a problem of perception, and even of being isolated,<br>
than the problem of 1915. We had one genocide in this century. It was enough for<br>
us. It will never happen again." <br>
<p>
          He was referring to the event that still defines the nation: In 1915<br>
vast numbers of Armenians, perhaps more than a million, died at the hands of the<br>
Ottoman Turks, through forced resettlement, starvation and massacres. <br>
<p>
          It is the fundamental fact of modern Armenia and it still governs the<br>
people's complex political and psychological world views. Many are defensive,<br>
combative and convinced that the moment they relax they will again be<br>
annihilated. <br>
<p>
          Today, Turkey and Azerbaijan have imposed a total import blockade on<br>
Armenia. That leaves Iran and Georgia as neighboring trading partners. Iran is<br>
an ally, but not an ideal one. Its economy is not very strong and any<br>
relationship with Iran angers Armenia's most powerful patron, the United States.<br>
<p>
<p>
          Not that any of that matters to average people. Many are beginning to<br>
have what they care about: food, energy (after the recent reopening of a nuclear<br>
power station that sits on a geological fault line) and the sense that maybe<br>
their children won't die in a war for their survival. <br>
<p>
          "I don't really care what the president does," said Armina Nagosian,<br>
28, a saleswoman in the Samsung electronics store in downtown Yerevan. "Look at<br>
this place. People are buying things they never even thought they would see in<br>
this country." <br>
<p>
          All around her, men and women were choosing among color televisions,<br>
microwaves, and fancy new vacuum cleaners. <br>
<p>
          "This store didn't even have electricity until a few months ago," she<br>
said. "And that is what people care about. Not who sits in Parliament."<br>
<p>
          Although the economy has improved in the last two years -- real annual<br>
growth was up 7 percent in 1995 and has been growing at almost the same rate<br>
this year according to the International Monetary Fund -- trade accounts for the<br>
improvement. <br>
<p>
          There is no robust banking system, so nobody earns interest, few<br>
people pay taxes and nobody has money to invest in long-term projects like<br>
factories and communications systems. <br>
<p>
          Despite an official monthly average income of about $20 and few<br>
natural resources, Armenia has one of the highest literacy rates in the world.<br>
It is a society of talkative, independent people. <br>
<p>
          "When we were part of the Soviet Union, we had no voice or vote," said<br>
Vahan Barseghian, 47, a shepherd who lives outside the capital but often comes<br>
to the bustling central market to sell his meat. <br>
<p>
          "The point of independence was really to give us the right to live the<br>
way we want. Now we have an Armenian leader who treats us like the Russians did.<br>
I don't really know if that is better or worse than before." <br>

1996 In Review: Relative Peace Comes To Armenia, Azerbaijan, And Georgia<br>
<p>
By Lawrence Holland<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Prague, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - In the three Caucasian nations, 1996 <br>
brought continued ethnic tensions and concerns over a lack of respect <br>
for democratic practices. But Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia also <br>
escaped any return to the fighting of earlier years, and in many <br>
respects living conditions improved. <br>
<p>
Armenia <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The only nationwide poll took place in Armenia, where President Levon <br>
Ter-Petrosyan was initially expected to win with ease. But as the <br>
September election approached, much of the opposition united behind <br>
Vazgen Manukyan and the race tightened. <br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosyan's rhetoric became increasingly heated. Two days before the <br>
vote he told a national television audience that the country risked <br>
fascism if Manukyan prevailed. Observers, including a mission from the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OCSE), reported <br>
serious irregularities during the voting. But the country's electoral <br>
commission claimed that the president had been re-elected with just <br>
under 52 percent of the vote -- enough to avoid a runoff. <br>
<p>
The opposition responded with demonstrations which in one instance <br>
turned violent. The government cracked down, jailing six opposition <br>
legislators after stripping them of immunity from prosecution. Manukyan <br>
temporarily went underground. <br>
<p>
In what may prove to be the year's other main political development, <br>
Armenia's Supreme Court in December issued a verdict in a closely <br>
watched trial which included members of the banned Dashnak party (HHD). <br>
The court sentenced three defendants to death, but found no evidence <br>
that the HHD had ties to a terrorist movement. The alleged link had been <br>
used to justify the party's banning in 1994. It remains to be seen <br>
whether the ban will be lifted. <br>
<p>
Analysts say that while the year's events demonstrated Ter-Petrosyan's <br>
control of the political apparatus, they also showed that his popular <br>
support is very fragile. And while international criticism of his <br>
government's handling of the election was mild, a price may yet be paid. <br>
The Council of Europe is expected to consider Yerevan's application to <br>
join the human rights body in 1997, and Ter-Petrosyan may have <br>
difficulty proving his commitment to democratic principles -- a key <br>
requirement for membership. <br>
<p>
While Armenia's democracy suffered a serious setback, its economy showed <br>
signs of improvement. The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction <br>
and Development (EBRD) released projections in November which predicted <br>
growth at some 7 percent for both 1996 and 1997. <br>
<p>
The man widely credited by international financial organizations with <br>
engineering Armenia's economic growth resigned as prime minister in <br>
November. Hrant Bagratyan had headed the government since early 1993, <br>
pursuing tight money and economic reform policies. He stepped down after <br>
criticism from the chairman of the ruling party, who blamed his policies <br>
for Ter-Petrosyan's election troubles. <br>
<p>
Internationally, Armenia's relations with other nations were complicated <br>
by the continuing dispute over neighboring Azerbaijan's mostly <br>
ethnic-Armenian enclave of Nagarno-Karabakh. Most damaging, Turkey <br>
maintained its economic blockade, demanding that Armenia recognize the <br>
enclave as Azerbaijani territory. <br>
<p>
Negotiations over Nagorno-Karabakh showed little progress in 1996. Talks <br>
sponsored by an international group and including Azerbaijani and <br>
Armenian officials and officials from the separatist enclave concluded <br>
for the year in December with little progress reported. They are set to <br>
resume next year with either France or the United States expected to <br>
join Russia as co-chair. <br>
<p>
Diplomats say an agreement may eventually be reached keeping the enclave <br>
within Azerbaijan while granting it considerable autonomy. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In the rest of Azerbaijan, an economic contraction continued. The EBRD <br>
estimated that for the year, Azerbaijan would experience a fall in gross <br>
domestic product of some 3 percent. However, the EBRD projected that it <br>
would experience growth of some 6 percent in 1997. <br>
<p>
One explanation for the country's poor economic performance is the <br>
continued closure of the border with Russia, which Moscow sealed in late <br>
1994 after it invaded the breakaway republic of Chechnya. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan's long-term economic prospects are tied in part to efforts to <br>
develop gas and oil reserves in the Caspian and to establish routes for <br>
shipping energy products to the West. <br>
<p>
An international consortium decided in 1996 to develop two pipeline <br>
routes, one north from Azerbaijan to Russia's Black Sea port of <br>
Novorossiisk and a second running west through Georgia and on to Turkey. <br>
Russia has demanded to keep part of the trade and the revenue and <br>
influence that goes with it. Azerbaijan, as well as Turkmenistan and <br>
Kazakhstan, are anxious to develop the alternative route. <br>
<p>
Complications persist. The route through Russia would travel through <br>
lands -- including Chechnya -- where political instabilities are acute. <br>
And Azerbaijan in 1996 remained involved in a remained involved in a <br>
dispute with Russia over the legal definition of the Caspian which has <br>
implications for how its resou<br>
<p>
Beyond oil politics, shake-ups during the year affected the country's <br>
economic management. Several officials responsible for economic affairs <br>
were fired and Prime Minister Faud Kuliev resigned. <br>
<p>
Trials continued during the year against those the government has <br>
accused of either attempting a coup or of planning to assassinate <br>
President Heydar Aliyev. The international group Human Rights Watch, in <br>
its annual report in December, criticized conduct of the trials and the <br>
treatment of those being detained. It also criticized what it said were <br>
continuing efforts to "stifle political speech" and accused authorities <br>
of moving against independent media. <br>
<p>
Georgia <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In Georgia in 1996, observers noted a greater degree of stability as the <br>
government demonstrated increased cohesiveness and as political violence <br>
eased. The economy also performed better. The EBRD estimated growth at <br>
some 10 percent in 1996 -- highest in the Commonwealth of Independent <br>
States. The EBRD expects GDP to increase even more in 1997. However, <br>
unemployment is still estimated at 20 percent or more. <br>
<p>
International observers expressed concerns regarding freedoms during the <br>
year. Human Rights Watch said in its annual report that freedom of the <br>
press was generally respected, but noted concerns over moves to close an <br>
independent television channel for what appeared to be political <br>
reasons. A court later ruled it could remain on the air. Human Rights <br>
Watch also said that the harassment of some Georgian political <br>
dissidents continued. <br>
<p>
Negotiations continued during the year on the status of South Ossetia <br>
and Abkhazia, and ceasefires between Georgian forces and those from the <br>
two breakaway regions continued to hold. <br>
<p>
In May, OSCE-sponsored talks resulted in the signing of an agreement <br>
between Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and South Ossetia's <br>
parliament chairman Lyudwig Chibirov. It committed the two sides to <br>
peacefully resolving their dispute on the region's political status. <br>
<p>
Less progress was made in talks on Abkhazia and Human Rights Watch says <br>
that some returning ethnic Georgians were met with violence. Conflict <br>
over the region, from which Georgian troops fled in 1994, also strained <br>
relations with Moscow which has deployed troops there to maintain the <br>
ceasefire. Tbilisi has been angered by Russia's unwillingness to order <br>
its troops to more actively protect returnees. <br>
<p>
Elections were held in both of Georgia's breakaway regions late in the <br>
year, as they were in Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. In no <br>
instance were they recognized as legitimate by outside states. But the <br>
votes demonstrated the effective autonomy of local leaders. <br>

NEWS RELEASE, December 23, 1996<br>
<p>
VICTIMS OF ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br>
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES TO PURSUE DOMESTIC REMEDIES<br>
<p>
EMERGENCY OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED, CASE AGAINST<br>
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER LIBARIDIAN TO BE REMOVED<br>
<i>&gt;FROM U.S. COURTS TO ARMENIA</i><br>
<p>
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS TO MAINTAIN<br>
VIGILANT WATCH ON GOVERNMENT'S CONDUCT<br>
<p>
	On December 19, 1996, the plaintiffs in the class-action suit against <br>
the Republic of Armenia's Senior Presidential Adviser Gerard Libaridian sought <br>
to withdraw their case from the United States federal district court in order <br>
to attempt to pursue their cases in Armenian courts.  The suit charged <br>
Libaridian with legal responsibility for his role in the violent government <br>
crackdown against ordinary citizens and various members of opposition <br>
political parties and their families and neighbors, following the September <br>
21, 1996 presidential election in Armenia, which was judged by election <br>
observers to be neither fair nor free.  The plaintiffs sought remedy for the <br>
injuries they suffered during the crackdown, when government forces rounded up <br>
more than 175 men and women, including members of the National Assembly, <br>
subjected them to beatings, torture and interrogation, and kept them captive <br>
in jails and isolation wards around the country for extended periods of time.  <br>
Many were held for over two weeks and suffered severe injuries requiring <br>
hospitalization.  During their imprisonment, they had no contact with their <br>
families, and were not allowed access to counsel.  At the same time, the <br>
government attacked a number of opposition political party offices, destroying <br>
or confiscating all of the parties' records, equipment and property.  <br>
<p>
	With little hope for remedy in Armenia, victims of these human rights <br>
violations, with the assistance of the Center for Economic and Social Rights <br>
(CESR), a non-profit human rights group based in New York, sought to pursue <br>
their case in the United States against Libaridian, alleged in the complaint <br>
to be one of the principal architects of the crackdown, for his violations <br>
under international law. The case attracted a great deal of media attention <br>
both in Armenia and internationally.<br>
<p>
	Since the suit was filed on October 5, 1996, most of those detained <br>
have been released, and only 17 persons remain in custody.  In addition, the <br>
government has allowed two of the political parties that were closed down by <br>
the government, the National Democratic Union and the National Union for <br>
Self-Determination, to reopen their offices.  <br>
<p>
	In these circumstances, and as an expression of hope and good faith in <br>
the widely discredited Armenian courts, several of the victims, including the <br>
named plaintiffs in the U.S. action, decided to withdraw their case in the <br>
United States in favor of initiating proceedings in Armenia against those <br>
government officials responsible for the violations of their human rights.  <br>
<p>
	Sarah Leah Whitson, CESR's general counsel and an adviser on the case, <br>
comments:  "The plaintiffs in this case are exceedingly brave, and have a <br>
sincere hope that they can move their country back on a democratic path. They <br>
are taking an enormous risk by choosing to pursue their cases in Armenian <br>
courts, where they have virtually no assurance that they will receive a fair <br>
trial.  By bringing their cases in Armenia, they are giving the courts there <br>
another opportunity for redemption as an independent judicial body committed <br>
to protecting the rights of Armenia's citizens and to seeing that justice is <br>
done."<br>
<p>
	"We will stand behind the plaintiffs in this case with every resource <br>
at our disposal.  We will continue to provide them with legal assistance on <br>
questions of international law and to coordinate our efforts with local human <br>
rights groups in Armenia.  We also pledge to follow the proceedings closely, <br>
and immediately inform the international community of any attempts by the <br>
government to deny these people a fair procedure for vindicating their rights. <br>
 We hope that the Armenian government acts wisely this time to show the <br>
international community that it can in fact respect the rules of democracy and <br>
freedom."<br>
<p>
	Roger Normand, executive director of CESR, states: "We believe that <br>
several of the case's primary objectives have been achieved.  This case has <br>
sent a strong message to the government of Armenia that those responsible for <br>
violating international law and abusing the rights of other citizens can be <br>
held personally liable and brought to justice even in courts outside their <br>
country.  The international community is watching the Armenian government very <br>
closely; we know the government knows that.  Most of the opposition members <br>
who were detained in violation of international law have been released, and <br>
the headquarters of the NDU and NSDU have been permitted to reopen.  We want <br>
to encourage that sort of progress."<br>
<p>
	Adds Ms. Whitson, "The courageous men and women who brought this suit <br>
in the United States have set an example to the people in Armenia in seeking <br>
to speak out and hold their government accountable.  We want the people of <br>
Armenia to know that human rights groups and ordinary people all around the <br>
world will support their struggle to build a democratic state in Armenia."<br>

GOOD EVENING,<br>
ARMEPRESS NEWS AGENCY OFFERS YOU THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE<br>
JANUARY 3, 1997, NEWS BULLETIN.<br>
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ISSUE - MARINE GEVORKIAN<br>
<p>

                ARMENIAN PRESIDENT'S NEW YEAR MESSAGE<br>
<p>
"1997 TO BE A YEAR OF IMPROVEMENTS IN ECONOMIC LIFE, PARTIAL<br>
RELIEF OF SOCIAL SITUATION, ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER AND<br>
LEGALITY"<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
On this festive occasion, I would like to make several necessary<br>
comments that may help to correctly perceive the reality and<br>
contribute to the realization of the ideas aimed to improve the<br>
reality. Lately, attempts are being made to create a frame of mind<br>
that the Presidential elections resulted in a split in our nation. In<br>
case of judging so, we should refuse from democracy, since the<br>
democratic states are to hold presidential and parliamentary elections<br>
each four-five years to find out the people's priorities. In case of<br>
judging so, we should also consider all the democratic states as<br>
split since during the elections the votes are divided between<br>
40-60 percents. So we should feel very confident that during the<br>
elections the votes of the people are approximately divided equally.<br>
For democratic states it is both natural and necessary, and by no<br>
means it can mean a split of the nation. The elections pass away,<br>
passions calm down, and the nation goes back to its ordinary way of<br>
life till the next elections, and so on.<br>
On the occasion of New Year, I do not find it needless to repeat my<br>
decisive statement on realizing all the programs aimed to improve<br>
the moral and legal atmosphere of the state, the policy of<br>
appointing officials, to launch a campaign against the corruption and<br>
administrative illegalities, to establish discipline in taxation.<br>
The new Government begins its activity by stimulating production, by<br>
involving foreign investments, and with serious intentions to develop the<br>
foreign trade. In this respect, I would like to tell you that in the<br>
first half of 1997, one or two international organizations crediting<br>
small and middle businesses, will start their activities here. We are<br>
also taking steps to provide also the big business with circulating<br>
assets.<br>
We look at the year 1997 as a year of improvements in the economic life<br>
of the Republic, a year of partial relief of the social situation of the<br>
population, and also a year of establishment of order and legality.<br>
If we also add the overcoming of the blockade, the necessity of<br>
opposing<br>
the international pressure on the issue of Artsakh, we may imagine<br>
what efforts will be required from the authorities, as well as from<br>
the people to provide the ordinary development of our country. As<br>
difficult it may seem, but I consider it a solvable problem, provided<br>
that we can ensure solidarity of our people and stability inside the<br>
country, for which I promise to put all my efforts.<br>
And now I want to express my best wishes to our people and wish them<br>
peace, happiness and prosperity.<br>
Happy New Year!<br>

         US FEDERAL JUDGE GRANTS REQUEST TO WITHDRAW LAWSUIT<br>
AGAINST LIBARIDIAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
On December 20, 1996, United States District Judge Michael B. Mukasey<br>
of the Southern District Court of New York granted plaintiffs' motion<br>
to withdraw their complaint against Jirair Libaridian before the case<br>
could even be heard by the Judge. This brought to an abrupt end a<br>
lawsuit which was started against the Senior Advisor to President<br>
Levon Ter-Petrossian of Armenia last October with much noise and<br>
vindictiveness.<br>
In early October, Jennifer Green, plaintiffs' attorney of record,<br>
supported by two attorneys from the Center for Economic and Social<br>
Rights of New York, Sarah Leah Whitson and Michael Herman, had filed<br>
a<br>
civil action lawsuit in New York Federal Court, accusing Libaridian of<br>
"designing, planning, implementing and directing" a two-year terror<br>
campaign against the opposition in Armenia, culminating in alleged<br>
violations of human rights on September 25. The lawsuit, initiated on<br>
October 4, was launched with a full-scale media campaign, including but<br>
not limited to newspapers as well as the Internet, with vicious<br>
personal attacks on Libaridian.<br>
"The attorneys who brought the lawsuit had no choice but to withdraw<br>
the case; they must be quite embarrassed," said an expert close to the<br>
lawsuit. "The lawsuit was frivolous, had no merits, and had<br>
political and personal motivations, rather than any concern for human<br>
rights or democracy. Besides, it was done unprofessionally and in a<br>
manner that reflected viciousness and a political agenda," she added.<br>
The class action suit was initially brought in the name of Aramazd<br>
Zakarian, a citizen of Armenia and a member of Parliament. In<br>
November, Jean-Marie Atamian, an attorney with the prestigious<br>
international law firm of Mayer, Brown &amp; plant representing<br>
Libaridian, filed with the Court a memorandum of law asking the Court<br>
to dismiss the case on a number of jurisdictional and other grounds.<br>
The alleged acts of human rights violations were not deemed worthy of<br>
a response.<br>
Among the papers filed by Attorney Atamian in support of Libaridian's<br>
dismissal motion was an affidavit by Aramazd Zakarian, where Zakarian<br>
stated that he had never authorized the lawsuit. In his affidavit,<br>
Zakarian also expressed his outrage at the behavior of the attorneys<br>
in New York, for having proceeded with the lawsuit without his<br>
permission.<br>
Indeed, such irresponsible and unprofessional conduct by plaintiff's<br>
counsel continued unabated until they finally realized that they had<br>
no choice but to withdraw their meritless action. For example,<br>
Attorney Atamian and Attorney Green had been scheduled to appear<br>
before the Court on November 20 for the first time for a scheduling<br>
hearing. But Green failed to appear in Court without any notice to<br>
either the Court or opposing counsel. This outrageous behavior prompted<br>
the Court to issue an order which set a new hearing date on December 3<br>
and threatened to impose sanctions should plaintiff's attorney fail<br>
to appear a second time. Incredibly, Ms. Green again failed to appear<br>
before the Court on December 3. At the same time, rather than withdraw<br>
the case, Green and her associates proceeded to file an equally<br>
baseless "amended" lawsuit in the name of 13 new plaintiffs that<br>
included opposition figures Davit Vardanian, Shavarsh Kotcharian,<br>
Seyran Avakian, Filaret Berigian, Vova Hakhverdian, Gagik Mkrtchian,<br>
Karine Stepanian and others of Armenia.<br>
A new Court hearing was scheduled for December 23. However, Green<br>
and<br>
her associates once again failed to appear in Court. Instead, they<br>
filed papers to have their own case dismissed against Libaridian. One<br>
of the reasons given by Green was that at least some of the new<br>
plaintiffs in whose name the lawsuit now stood had refused to<br>
acknowledge the case and stated that they did not want their names<br>
associated with the case.<br>
The Judge immediately granted Green's request to withdraw the case,<br>
on December 20, 1996.<br>
Most observers consider the lawsuit a personal attack against<br>
Libaridian, who is a Diaspora Armenian and has held several key<br>
positions in the foreign policy area since he started working in<br>
Armenia in 1991 and has little to do with domestic politics. Some<br>
observers think the attack against Libaridian was part of the<br>
campaign launched internationally against President Ter-Petrossian to<br>
weaken Armenia's position before the OSCE Lisbon Summit. Libaridian<br>
has been one of the chief negotiators for Armenia in the<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the personal representative of President<br>
Ter-Petrossian in the direct dialogue with Azerbaijan.<br>
Observers have also characterized the lawsuit as "frivolous," "lacking<br>
in substance," "abusive of the American legal system," and "a vicious<br>
attack that was seen as possible in the poisonous atmosphere created<br>
in the Diaspora against President Ter-Petrossian and his policies."<br>
Indeed, neither the original complaint nor the "amended" complaint<br>
contained a single factual allegation, much less any evidence, to<br>
support plaintiffs' irresponsible contention that Libaridian was in<br>
any way  involved in domestic affairs or in the alleged events.<br>
Observers have also noted that the pattern of behavior by the group<br>
backing the lawsuit is a form of manipulation of Armenian citizens,<br>
who are not entirely knowledgeable in the American legal system, by<br>
outsiders who misrepresented their actions in pursuit of personal and<br>
political gain.<br>
U.S. legal observers believe that Green and her associates have<br>
violated the legal code of conduct and are subject to Rule 11<br>
sanctions applicable in such cases where attorneys file a lawsuit<br>
without the clear and explicit consent of a plaintiff or plaintiffs<br>
whose names are listed in the lawsuit.<br>
Libaridian has refused to comment on the case. But an associate to the<br>
Senior Advisor believes that Libaridian does not hold any animosity<br>
against the citizens of Armenia, whom he believes were manipulated by<br>
forces outside Armenia. The associate also expressed doubts whether<br>
those who launched the vicious lawsuit against Libaridian were indeed<br>
concerned with democracy or human rights in Armenia or elsewhere.<br>
"Libaridian will probably not take any action against anyone," stated<br>
the associate, "he has more important things to do in life. But if<br>
these attorneys and those backing them have any civility or integrity<br>
they would issue a public apology to Libaridian for the disruption<br>
they have caused in his work, his personal life and the life of his<br>
family."<br>
<p>
        NEW YEAR GREETINGS OF CATHOLICOS OF ALL ARMENIANS<br>
<p>
  JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
  On the occasion of New Year, Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin I<br>
<p>
  greeted all the heads of the Armenian Apostolic Sees: the Catholicos<br>
  of the Armenian Church in Cilicia, the Patriarchs of Jerusalem and<br>
  Istanbul, the heads of all the Dioceses in Armenia and abroad. He<br>
  called upon unification for encouraging and making fruitful the<br>
  Armenian Apostolic Church, the celebration of the 1700th anniversary<br>
  of which we have already started and will continue till 2001.<br>
  In his greetings the Catholicos expressed his best wishes to President  <br>
  of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian, to the three branches of authority:<br>
  the legislative, executive and judicial, to the Armenian army, the<br>
  people of Karabakh, the whole Armenian people.<br>
  The Catholicos said that this year, like any other year, we will<br>
  start with the behest of Jesus Christ's birthday. "Christ's name is<br>
  Emmanuel. Emmanuel means 'God stay with us,' let us stay with God,"<br>
  the Catholicos concluded.<br>
<p>
              CHANGES IN LAW ON EXCISE TAX<br>
<p>
   YEREVAN, JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
   From January 1, 1997, the law on making changes in the law on<br>
   "Excise Tax" came into force. In an interview with an Armenpress<br>
   correspondent, First Deputy of the Chief of Tax Inspection Dadayan<br>
   said that according to the new law, tires and carpets are taken out<br>
   from the list of the goods to be taxed, they will be considered as<br>
   goods of necessity, besides, taxes on some goods are raised: wine<br>
   and vodka by 125%, sprawn by 200%, cigarette by 100%. The new<br>
   law states that for the goods imported to Armenia the object for<br>
   taxation is the importing cost of the good without the value added<br>
   taxes. According to Dadayan, because of the rise of excise tax on<br>
   wine and vodka, the costs of these products may temporarily go up.<br>
<p>
                     YEAR BEGAN WITHOUT SHOOTINGS<br>
<p>
    YEREVAN, JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
    According to the press center of the Armenian Defense Ministry, on<br>
    the New Year night and during the next two days, there have not<br>
    been registered any violations of cease-fire on the Armenian-Azeri<br>
    border.<br>
<p>
                    ARMENIAN PRESIDENT SIGNED LAWS<br>
<p>
     YEREVAN, JANUARY 3, ARMENPRESS.<br>
     On December 30, 1996, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian<br>
     signed laws passed by the Armenian National Assembly on<br>
     "ratifying the annual report on the state budget of the Republic<br>
     of Armenia for 1995," "program for 1995 about privatization and<br>
     denationalization of state enterprises and incomplete<br>
     constructions in the Republic of Armenia," "on making changes in<br>
     the decision of the National Assembly and in the 'program for<br>
     1996-97 about privatization and denationalization of state<br>
     enterprises and incomplete constructions in the Republic of<br>
     Armenia'."<br>

<p>
        PROBLEMS OF THE LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT BODIES DISCUSSED<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, DECEMBER 30, ARMENPRESS.<br>
On December 27, in the American University of Armenia, a meeting<br>
the main problems of the local self-government bodies took place.<br>
The meeting was organized by the Armenian National Movement<br>
party. The President of the National Assembly of the Republic of<br>
Armenia Babken Ararktsian, Vice President of the National<br>
Assembly Ara Sahakian and Karapet Roubinian, Ministers and other<br>
officials participated in the meeting.<br>
The leader of the Armenian National Movement Ter Husik Lazarian<br>
pointed out in his speech that the purpose of the meeting is to<br>
discuss specific problems of the local self-government bodies.<br>
The participants of the meeting pointed out in their speeches<br>
that the imperfections in the law on local self-government. They<br>
also discussed financial and other problems of the local<br>
self-government bodies.<br>
The Vice President of the National Assembly of the Republic of<br>
Armenia Karapet Roubinian pointed out that the local<br>
self-government bodies are in their initial phase of development,<br>
which explains the numerous problems they encounter.<br>
Talking about the budget of the local self-government bodies, Mr.<br>
Roubinian said that the sources of income in the local budgets<br>
are not clearly defined, the state and community property is not<br>
separated.<br>
Talking about the law on local self-government bodies, Mr.<br>
Roubinian stated that the law does not define the powers of the<br>
local authorities in terms of the struggle against violations of<br>
laws. The actions of the local authority figures are governed by<br>
the presidential decrees, and not by the law. That could cause<br>
certain disagreements between the governors of the marzes<br>
(provinces) and the local authorities.<br>
The Minister of Local Self-Government Galust Gamazian in his<br>
speech pointed out that the documents regulating the local<br>
self-government bodies had not been passed before the November 10<br>
local self-government elections. Now, the government of the<br>
Republic of Armenia has established a committee which will work<br>
on these documents. He also informed that in order to get<br>
acquainted personally with the situation, the Prime Minister of<br>
the Republic of Armenia Armen Sargissian will visit various<br>
regions of the country until February 1997.<br>
The speech of the Vice President of the National Assembly of the<br>
Republic of Armenia Ara Sahakian had more political flavor to it.<br>
Mr. Sahakian pointed out the important political events which<br>
took place in Armenia this year: presidential elections, new<br>
government, and local self-government elections. Mr. Sahakian<br>
also emphasized the role of the Armenian National Movement in<br>
these processes and pointed out the differences between the<br>
party and the opposition. According to Mr. Sahakian, the Armenian<br>
National Movement has a high sense of responsibility for the<br>
destiny of the country and the nation, while the opposition,<br>
whose formal leader is the head of the National Democratic Union,<br>
and the real leader is the Armenian Revolutionary Federation,<br>
preferred to violate the laws and the Constitution of the<br>
Republic of Armenia. These leaders throw their political<br>
ambitions to the street, and the street dictates its own ways of<br>
political struggle.<br>
In this situation, the local self-government bodies should<br>
involve the people in the process of local self-government and<br>
have high sense of responsibility for the people. He called on<br>
local authority figures to cooperate with all their opponents<br>
in the election.<br>
At the end of the meeting, Ter Husik Lazarian introduced the text<br>
of the resolution. The resolution includes all the points and<br>
suggestions voiced during the meeting. The resolution points out<br>
that the local self-government is a necessary condition for the<br>
development of democracy. The resolution also informed about the<br>
creation of the Association of Communities of Armenia.<br>

In Caucasus, Democracy Can Rise From the Ashes <br>
 <br>
     By Lorelei Kelly <br>
<p>
     An assessment of the former Soviet world seven years after the<br>
crumbling of the Berlin Wall finds a region suffering from ethnic <br>
violence, urban chaos, failed elections, rampaging<br>
separatist militia groups, and philosopher kings gone mad. Competent<br>
pluralistic regimes are lacking.<br>
	I spent two months last summer working on a civilian peacekeeping<br>
project in the Caucasus - an area made up of three small countries, <br>
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. This former Soviet vacationland <br>
lies just south of the ash heap of Russian Chechnya - where six Red <br>
Cross workers were recently murdered. Throughout the Caucasus, <br>
civilian populations have suffered deadly nationalist violence.<br>
<p>
     These collapsed societies daily offer up a serving of Darwin on the<br>
half-shell, rank and raw. The entire population is engaged in a <br>
struggle to change. International intervention weighing in on the <br>
side of democratic progress is vital. The ability to wreak <br>
significant violence is readily available. Yet even in the<br>
face of such horror, we should also recognize that the ability<br>
to make significant peace is also at hand.<br>
 <br>
      In the second half of the 1990s, we are entering perhaps the<br>
most critical time for post-communist reconstruction.<br>
<p>
      Our public peace process in the Caucasus is based on the belief<br>
that the outside recognition of democratic moderates will bolster <br>
their voices. We worked with citizen teams in Armenia and Azerbaijan, <br>
convened meetings, and helped the participants learn negotiation <br>
skills. Our efforts centered around Nagorno Karabakh, a territory <br>
populated by Armenians but within the borders of Azerbaijan. The two <br>
sides fought a war over the territory in the early '90s. Although <br>
violence has subsided during a two-year ceasefire, political <br>
polarization and suffering continue.<br>
<p>
     Back in 1990, most Westerners thought that mere exposure to the<br>
world through travel and television would change things for the <br>
better in the reforming Eastern bloc. Six years later, exposure has <br>
opened some minds and confirmed many prejudices. We in the West <br>
need to recognize that it's going to take much more than cable <br>
television to get these countries on their feet.<br>
<p>
     Helping to create a home-grown crop of democrats will take an<br>
intensive, long-term effort. It will take more than money. Indeed, <br>
it will require an entirely new framework for US engagement in the <br>
world - one that recognizes how human interaction has become a<br>
touchstone <br>
for international activities.<br>
 <br>
     Listen carefully when you hear policymakers talk about "conflict<br>
resolution." The most important part of this foreign-policy strategy <br>
is the cultivation of human relationships for national violence <br>
prevention. Prevention is the operational word. Conflict resolution <br>
comes in many guises. It's preventive diplomacy in the<br>
State Department and preventive defense in the Pentagon, preventive <br>
peacekeeping at the United Nations, and participatory development <br>
at the World Bank.<br>
 <br>
     The shift toward preventive strategies reflects changes close <br>
to home for many Americans: peer mediation on your child's playground, <br>
team management at work, and alternative dispute resolution in the <br>
courthouse. Abroad and at home, interaction that democratically <br>
empowers individuals is increasingly recognized as a strategy for <br>
peace, stability, and, we hope, prosperity.<br>
<p>
     One blessing of the communications revolution is that interveners<br>
can more quickly identify people who are willing to work for <br>
reconciliation. After two years of shuttling back and forth and<br>
six months in the Caucasus region, the teams convened a joint meeting <br>
last September. Four days of intense dialogue produced five action <br>
plans: two are designed to help children from war zones, one seeks <br>
to reunite academics at regional universities, one intends to <br>
improve regional public health, and one lays out a strategy to teach <br>
social peace. These are not formal, traditional security items, but <br>
they are the only game in town that's moving forward. And they are <br>
a start.<br>
 <br>
     In the second half of the 1990s, we are entering perhaps the most<br>
critical time for post-communist reconstruction. The societies have <br>
evolved beyond the capabilities of semi-reformers. Now native-born<br>
democrats <br>
have a societal stake.  They've observed different norms of behavior and <br>
have sophisticated expectations. We from the West can help lay out<br>
options, being there while they take the risks.<br>
 <br>
     After spending time in a part of the world struggling to change, I<br>
have a simple message for all Americans: We matter so much more to the <br>
world than the world matters to us. We must stay involved.<br>
 <br>

FAPSI CONTROLS GOVERNMENT, COMMERCIAL NETWORKS. In a 24 December
interview with Krasnya zvezda marking the fifth anniversary of the
founding of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and
Information (FAPSI), the agency's chief of staff, Maj.-Gen. Ivan
Shepotkov, said FAPSI's main purpose is to provide a "reliable" and
"independent" communications network for the Russian president. He said
the experience of the August 1991 coup, when the KGB cut off
communications links to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, showed
the need for an independent communications agency. He also said FAPSI
protects government secrets from the "information war" which Western
countries are waging against Russia. Emphasizing the importance of
economic secrets, he added that FAPSI runs and is developing secure
networks over which electronic commercial, financial, and banking
transactions in Russia are conducted, and angrily denied suggestions
that the agency might eavesdrop on confidential business transactions.

WHAT SOME JOURNALISTS WERE AFRAID TO WRITE IN 1996. The year-end issue
of the weekly newspaper Kommersant asked 16 journalists what they had
been afraid to write in 1996. One Kommersant reporter was afraid
colleagues would accuse him of taking bribes, another mentioned that he
was afraid of provoking libel suits, and a third had feared for his
physical safety after writing one article about business dealings,
adding that to protect himself he shaved off his beard and did not
answer the phone for a week. Aleksandr Loktev, chief editor of
Kommersant-Daily, said, "Most of all we were afraid that we would have
to write, '[Communist Party leader Gennadii] Zyuganov became president
of Russia.'" Kseniya Makhnenko, chief editor of the glossy magazine
Domovoi, said her magazine did not publish a feature about presidential
Chief of Staff Anatolii Chubais, because "there are too many emotions
surrounding his personality, and our magazine tries to avoid openly
scandalous subjects." Nataliya Gevorkyan of Kommersant said she had been
tempted to criticize fellow journalists for engaging in what she called
"brainwashing" but decided to adhere to the principle, "don't touch your
own." * Laura Belin
<p>
MASKHADOV STEPS DOWN. On 2 January, Aslan Maskhadov stepped down as
Chechen prime minister in order to run in the 27 January presidential
race, AFP and ITAR-TASS reported. He will be temporarily replaced by
Ruslan Gelaev, a former field commander. President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev
will continue serving in office until the election results are known.
Also on 2 January, 16 candidates were formally registered for the
presidential election, ITAR-TASS reported, citing the press secretary of
the Chechen Central Election Commission, Shaaman Akbulatov. * Peter
Rutland
<p>
NEW YORK MAYOR DEMANDS RECALL OF RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT. New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has sent letters to the Russian and Belarusian UN
missions demanding that two diplomats involved in a recent altercation
with New York police be sent home, Reuters reported on 2 January.
Rejecting Russian demands for an apology over the incident (see OMRI
Daily Digest, 3 January 1997), Giuliani said he is "very proud of what
the police officers did," adding that they "did their job trying to stop
drunk people from driving." The incident began when police officers
attempted to ticket the diplomats for illegal parking. Giuliani said
that in the first six months of 1996, 122 vehicles registered with the
Russian UN mission received 14,437 traffic citations. Under the 1961
Treaty of Vienna, foreign diplomats are obligated to observe U.S. law
but have diplomatic immunity from prosecution * Scott Parrish
<p>
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT UPDATE. In recent months, Afghans have become the
largest group of illegal migrants to Russia, ITAR-TASS reported on
2 January, citing Yurii Arkhipov of the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
Arkhipov estimated that 150,000 illegal Afghan migrants live in the
Moscow area. Like many Russian officials who blame illegal immigrants
for crime, Arkhipov complained that Afghan migrants bring their
political disputes with them to Russia, often sparking violent
conflicts. Overall, he estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million
illegal migrants from some 52 countries are currently on Russian
territory, many hoping to move on to Western Europe. Arkhipov predicted
that illegal immigration would increase in 1997 but said recently passed
legislation on refugees would help the FMS deal with the situation.

<p>
POPULATION DECLINE CONTINUES. Between January and December of 1996,
Russia's total population declined by 430,000, to reach 147.5 million at
the end of the year, AFP reported on 2 January, citing data released by
the State Statistics Committee. The natural decrease of the population,
the difference between the number of deaths and births, was even greater
(661,600), but the net inflow of migrants partially offset the
population loss. Although the death rate fell from 15.0 to 14.4 per
1,000 in the course of the year, it continued to exceed the birth rate,
which also dropped from 9.5 to 9.0 per 1,000. The birthrate is even
lower in St. Petersburg and Moscow: 6.7 and 7.2 per 1,000, respectively.
The State Statistics Committee predicted in 1995 that the Russian
population would decrease by 5.1 million by the year 2005. * Nikolai
Iakoubovski
<p>
DE BEERS DIAMOND CONTRACT LAPSES. . . De Beers has announced that from 1
January 1997 it will no longer adhere to its previous arrangement for
handling Russian diamonds, international media reported. The contract
between De Beers and the Russian government, which gave the former the
right to sell 95% of Russian diamonds, lapsed in December 1995. In 1995,
Russia accounted for about $1.1 billion, or 26%, of De Beer's global
sales. Through 1996, De Beers continued to adhere to the old
arrangement, and in February 1996 they negotiated a new three-year
contract, under which Russia would sell 87.5% of its diamonds through De
Beers. The new deal included letting the pick of $650 million worth of
stones go to Russia's own cutting industry. However, in 1996 Russian
producers began independently selling large amounts of diamonds on the
world market, perhaps as much as $500 million worth. In June, the
Australian firm, Argyle-a small-stone producer like Russia-quit the
cartel, so De Beers cut prices for small stones, causing the market to
collapse, the Independent reported on 29 December. * Peter Rutland
<p>
. . . ALMAZY ROSSII-SAKHA ARGUES IN FAVOR OF DE BEERS CONTRACT.
Vyacheslav Shtyrov, the head of Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS), Russia's main
diamond producer, has argued in favor of signing the De Beers contract,
but he has reportedly been blocked by government officials who want
Moscow to reap more benefits from the diamond trade. In what may be an
unrelated incident, on 30 December Lev Safronov, the vice-president of
ARS, was beaten on a Moscow street by two assailants. Earlier that day,
he was quoted by ITAR-TASS as saying that a deal with De Beers would be
signed soon. * Peter Rutland

AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENT ON 1996. In his New Year's Day address, Heidar
Aliev described 1996 as a year of peace and stability, RFE/RL reported
on 1 January. He highlighted the effectiveness of the1993 Nagorno-
Karabakh ceasefire and termed the OSCE Lisbon summmit last month as very
important to the conflict's ultimate resolution. He said the country has
survived "attempts mounted by internal and foreign forces" to
destabilize it and said much work had been accomplished in building a
democratic, secular, and law-abiding state. Aliev said the economy grew
for the first time since the collapse of the USSR (albeit by only 1.2%),
the decline in the rate of production slowed, and agricultural output
rose by 3%. He also noted that monthly inflation was less than 1% and
foreign investments doubled last year. * Lowell Bezanis
<p>
TURKISH PRESIDENT TO FURTHER SUPPORT AZERBAIJAN. In a televised New
Year's Day interview, Suleyman Demirel said Turkey will stand behind its
"brother," Azerbaijan, at all future international negotiations,
Asbarez-on-line reported on 2 January, citing Cumhuriyet and Turkiye.
Demirel claimed that Azerbaijan occupies an "extremely important and
exclusive place" in Turkey's foreign policy. Demirel excluded the
possibility of "forcible" border changes in the disputed Nagorno-
Karabakh region. Demirel praised President Heidar Aliev for managing to
"achieve internal stability" and stop the war in Nagorno-Karabakh.
* Emil Danielyan
<p>
MANUKYAN ON 1996, NEED FOR NATIONAL FRONT. The leader of Armenia's
opposition National Democratic Union, Vazgen Manukyan, said the
"Armenian state" failed a crucial test last year, pointing to what he
termed the undemocratic presidential elections which took place last
September. According to a 30 December Interfax report monitored by the
BBC, Manukyan harshly criticized the governemnt's social and economic
policy while applauding the high political activity of the Armenian
population. He said he is willing to maintain a dialogue with the
authorities only to discuss new presidential elections and a new
constitution; he also called for the establishment of a "national front"
of "political parties and various public forces" to effect change.
* Lowell Bezanis
<p>
TURKMENBASI TO CONTINUE ECONOMIC REFORMS IN 1997. In his New Year's Day
address, Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov said he his pleased with
the accomplishments of 1996, RFE/RL reported on 1 January. He argued
that Turkmenistan's ties with neighboring countries have been
consolidated. While acknowledging that Turkmenistan's agricultural
output was below the desired level (the cotton and grain harvests were
disastrous in 1996), he said living standards were starting to improve.
Niyazov vowed to press on with economic reform and pledged to invest
more than 2 trillion manats (about $400 million) in social programs.
* Lowell Bezanis
<p>
GEORGE SOROS NAMED "MAN OF THE YEAR" IN KYRGYZSTAN. The Rukhaniyat
organization of Kyrgyzstan has awarded its 1996 Man of the Year award to
philanthropist George Soros, RFE/RL reported on 2 January. In 1996,
Soros donated more than $4 million to fund programs helping educational
and cultural programs in Kyrgyzstan. The award's previous winners are
Kazakstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Uzbek President Islam
Karimov, and the head of the UNDP office in Kyrgyzstan, Erjan Murat.
* Bruce Pannier and Naryn Idinov
<p>
NEW MUFTI FOR KYRGYZSTAN. The controversial Muslim Congress held in
Bishkek on 26 December elected Absatar-Agy Majitov as the head mufti of
Kyrgyzstan, RFE/RL reported. Majitov replaces Kimsanbai-Agi
Abdurakhmanov, who did not take part in the congress, claiming the
schedule agreed to in 1993 stated the congress would meet every four
years. Abdurakhmanov, however, has been accused of corruption, a
possible reason for convening the congress early. The new mufti named
his four top deputies,. representing four different ethnic groups, on
2 January. They are: Abdylda Aslankulov-Kyrgyz, Lukmar Agi-Dungan,
Abdymajit Kary-Uyghur, and Rakhmatulla Kary-Uzbek. * Bruce Pannier and
Naryn Idinov
<p>
NEW RULE ON RAISING PRICES IN KAZAKSTAN. The chairman of Kazakstan's
Anti-Monopoly Committee, Nikolai Radostovets, announced on 1 January
that the country's businesses will only be allowed to raise their prices
on a quarterly basis, RFE/RL reported. Prices for heating and
electricity will remain at 1996 rates and in some areas will be reduced.
He also said that the cost of cargo transportation services is expected
to rise in 1997. * Bruce Pannier and Merhat Sharipzhan
<p>
TERRORISM IN TAJIK CAPITAL. The ceasefire agreed to by Tajik President
Imomali Rakhmonov and United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri
in Moscow on 23 December appears to be holding, although the number of
terrorist attacks on Russian soldiers and support personnel in Dushanbe
has increased since 23 December, according to Russian media reports. On
28 December, five soldiers were wounded when their vehicle was attacked:
on 2 or 3 January, a Russian soldier was shot and killed in Dushanbe's
Sakhovat district and the bodies of a Russian doctor and nurse were
found on a Dushanbe street on 3 January. Both the Tajik government and
opposition are blaming the attacks on groups that are trying to derail
the peace agreement. * Bruce Pannier

UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT INCREASES CONTROL OVER ARMS EXPORTS. President
Leonid Kuchma has issued a decree aimed at increasing control over
defense-related exports, Ukrainian Radio reported on 28 December. The
decree transforms the State Export Commission into the State Commission
for Export Control Policy. The Export Technical Committee will be
renamed the State Export Control Service under the cabinet of ministers.
The reorganization is meant to establish strict control over
international transfers of arms and military technology as well as raw
materials and skills that may be used for the production of weapons and
other military technology. * Ustina Markus

UKRAINIANS SAY THEIR LIVING STANDARDS CONTINUE TO DECLINE. An opinion
poll asking 1,200 Ukrainians about their living standards in 1996 showed
the majority still feel their standards are declining, Den reported on
31 December. Of the respondents, 37% said their living standards
declined significantly in 1996, 33% said they declined somewhat; and 23%
said their standards did not change. Only 6% said their standards
improved somewhat; and 1% said they improved significantly. The average
wage in the first 11 months of 1996 was 144.76 hryvnyas ($77), but real
wages fell by 23% over the same period owing to inflation. Official
unemployment levels remained at a low 1.1%, but real unemployment is
believed to be at least nine time higher. Prices rose by 38.5% over the
first eleven months of the year. * Ustina Markus

SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH BLASTS MILOSEVIC. Thousands of Belgrade
protesters on 2 January continued their latest tactic of making noise
with pots, whistles, and other implements during Serbian TV's 7:30 p.m.
newscast, CNN reported. Also in the capital, the bishops of the Serbian
Orthodox Church issued a declaration blasting President Slobodan
Milosevic for "pitting Serb against Serb." They noted that, "Force has
been used by the regime with the intention of stifling the freely
expressed will of the people. The blood of the innocent [had flowed
because the regime was] trying to sow discord and provoke bloodshed just
so it can hang on to power. The Holy Synod condemns the authorities who
have not only ignored the wishes of the electorate, but...have crushed
underfoot our glorious and painful history...[and] national and moral
values. Only the respect of democratic principles and human rights, the
recognition of the November 17 elections, can bring hope of a better
future" to Serbia, AFP and Nasa Borba reported. The bishops also accused
him of betraying the cause of the Krajina Serbs. * Patrick Moore
<p>
SERBIAN WRITERS SAY MILOSEVIC USES "STATE TERRORISM." Yet another
prestigious Serbian body, the writers' association, has slammed the
president. Reflecting the same themes as the Synod, the writers told
Milosevic in an open letter that: "By senseless vote stealing, your
party has hit a blow against the state, the constitution and the law,
and by your incomprehensible decisions you have led Serbia to the verge
of civil war. You have deliberately provoked battles in the streets of
Belgrade between peaceful demonstrators and people, led astray, whom you
brought here [on 24 December]," AFP reported on 3 January. Meanwhile,
the U.S. has urged the OSCE to condemn the Serbian authorities if they
continue to drag their feet on accepting an OSCE report upholding the 17
November local elections results, Nasa Borba wrote. * Patrick Moore
<p>
NATO TO SEIZE UNREGISTERED BOSNIAN ARMY MUNITIONS. The NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) said on 2 January it will confiscate tank
ammunition donated to the Bosnian army through a U.S.-sponsored "Train
and Equip" program because the munitions were not properly registered,
Reuters reported. NATO spokesman Maj. Tony White said the force in
Bosnia strictly insists on peace-time rules requiring armies to fully
document all weapons or ammunition stored at designated depots. SFOR
troops have confiscated 474 unregistered tank rounds out of a total of
11,000 shipped to the Bosnian federation under the U.S.-sponsored aid
program. In other news, NATO announced the same day that at least a
dozen houses formerly inhabited by Bosnian Muslims and Serbs were
destroyed over the past week in a Croat-held area near Mostar. The
attacks are aimed at discouraging non-Croatian refugees from returning
to their homes south of Mostar, Reuters reported. * Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
CROATIA INDICTS SOROS FOUNDATION FOR TAX EVASION. Zagreb's public
prosecutor is pressing charges against three senior officials at the
local branch of the Open Society Institute for alleged financial
malpractice and tax evasion, international agencies reported on 2
January. After storming the foundation's premises in Zagreb, Croatian
police said they had found evidence of "illegal financial transactions."
The prosecutor charged that since December 1995, employees at the OSI's
Zagreb office have been receiving two salaries: one in Croatian kuna and
another in U.S. dollars. The latter, he said, was not reported to the
Croatian tax authorities. Unpaid taxes are said to total 2.7 million
kuna ($490,000). But the Soros Foundation in New York implicitly denies
the charges, saying there was every reason to believe that its Croatian
affiliate complied with local laws. The foundation has spent some $15
million in Croatia since 1992 on humanitarian and cultural projects.

GREECE PLEDGES TO LEGALIZE ALBANIAN IMMIGRANTS. The Greek government has
said it will issue work permits to illegal Albanian immigrants this
month, Deutsche Welle's Albanian-language service reported on 2 January.
Immigrants will be given a time-frame in which to register. Those who
fail to report to the authorities will risk expulsion. * Fabian Schmidt

	President Rafsanjani, in his message, hoped that Christians all over the world would collaborate with followers of other religions and "breathe a new life into the body of the Christian communities and open a new chapter for the Christian world."<br>
	It is a good sign that this year Christmas coincided with the birthday anniversary of the Hazrat Mahdi, the Twelfth Imam, Rafsanjani said in his message.<br>
<p>
2. DEMIREL PLEDGES SUPPORT TO AZERBAIJAN<br>
ISTANBULTurkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey will stand by  Azerbaijan at all future international negotiations during a New Year's television interview, Istanbul-based Jumhuriyet and Turkiye newspapers reported.<br>
  Responding to Azeri correspondent Ibrahim Nebioghlu's questions, Demirel assured Azerbaijan that it occuppies an extremely important and exclusive place within Turkish foreign policy.<br>
	"Reaching a just and lasting peace is impossible as long as Azeri lands remain occuppied," Demirel said, adding that "Turkey always and on every occassion stands behind its brother Azerbaijan."<br>
  "As long as Azeri territories remain occuppied and millions of refugees remain homeless during yet another winter, a just and last peace cannot be expected," Demirel repeated.<br>
	In recapping 1996, Demirel pointed to the five-year independence of Azerbaijan, saying that for the Azeri people independence is more important than bread, water and air. Demirel noted that despite the numerous injustices hurled at Azerbaijan, it has struggle to defend its independence.<br>
	"Azerbaijan, under the leadership of Gaidar Aliyev, has secured internal stability, and for at least two years, has succeeded in putting a stop to the bloodshed and improve its economy," Demirel said.<br>

According to Demirel, the Armenian side has asked Turkey to reach some kind of settlement on the issue which can be "honorably presented" to both the Armenian and Azeri peoples.<br>
	Demirel told the Azeri people that Aliyev's presence in Azerbaijan is a blessing. "Azerbaijan has achieved stability. The elections are over and I stand behind Aliyev," Demirel concluded.<br>

	The loan of approximately $16.8 million will fund just over 40 percent of the cost to create a Private Investment Finance Corporation of Armenia to promote enterprise development.

<p>
5. SENATE CANDIDATE MEETS WITH ARMENIAN-AMERICAN LEADERS<br>
NEW YORK--Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, a leading candidate for the US Senate in 1998, held talks recently with representatives of the Armenian-American community. The meeting, which took place in the New York offices of Corum Capital, was attended by one of the firm's principals, Robert Setrakian, as well as by Harry Derderian, the Chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America Eastern Region.<br>
	Ranked by Time magazine as one of America's most promising leaders under the age of 40, Evan Bayh is currently the leading Democratic candidate to replace retiring Senator Dan Coats (R-IN).<br>
  During the meeting, which lasted more than an hour and a half, a range of issues were discussed, including increased aid to Armenia, self-determination for Nagorno-Karabakh, the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide and the lifting of the Turkish blockade. The participants shared memories of the principled stand taken by Gov. Bayh's father, Indiana's senior Senator Birch Bayh, during the mid-1960s, in defense of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide.<br>
	"Long ago, before our community was fully mobilized on the issue of the Armenian Genocide, a lone Senator from the state of Indiana raised his voice in defense of the 1.5 million Armenians murdered earlier in this century," remarked Derderian after the meeting. <br>
	"His was not an act of political expediencythere was no sizable Armenian community in Indiana. His motivation was based on the historical record because he knew the difference between right and wrong, just and unjust. His son Evan knows our history and he appreciates the Armenian experience. He understands where our people have been and knows where we plan to go," Derderian concluded.<br>
	A special feature article in The Wall Street Journal on December 20th highlighted Evan Bayh's race for the United States Senate and identified him as the clear front-runner. As evidence of his popularity, the article noted that Bayh was re-elected in 1992 by the largest margin in modern Indiana gubernatorial history.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 1, Part I, 2 January 1997
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
ZYUGANOV FORECASTS EXPLOSIVE YEAR. "It feels now like August 1917. No one
saw the revolution coming, but it came in three months. By March 1997,
things could blow up," Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov told
Reuters on 1 January. Zyuganov also noted that while Russia has been calm
of late, an 11-year cycle of sun spot activity would soon bring the country
to a "very disturbed period. By 1999, it will be very tough." In writings
and speeches, Zyuganov frequently draws historical analogies; he has
compared present-day Russia to the "time of troubles" at the beginning of
the 17th century and the unstable months before the October Revolution of
1917. However, he has firmly rejected the revolutionary aspirations of
marginal left-wing radicals, calling instead for compromise and dialogue
between the government and opposition. -- Laura Belin
<p>
CHECHNYA PREPARES FOR ELECTIONS. Aslan Maskhadov resigned as Chechen prime
minister on 1 January in order to run in the 27 January presidential
election, NTV reported. Chechen election law requires all government
officials running for office to step down by 2 January. As of that date, 19
candidates had submitted the required 10,000 nomination signatures to enter
the presidential race, and some 10 candidates had been nominated for each
of the 63 parliamentary seats. Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan
Rybkin told ITAR-TASS on 31 December that Russia would not interfere in the
elections, although he said he hopes that all 350,000 refugees from
Chechnya will be allowed to take part. So far, voting facilities are only
being arranged for refugees living in neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetiya.
-- Peter Rutland
<p>
DUMA PASSES LAW ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS DESTRUCTION.  The Duma on 27 December
passed a bill regulating the destruction of Russia's estimated 40,000
metric ton stockpile of chemical weapons, ITAR-TASS reported. The law
charges the president and government with laying out a schedule for the
destruction of the stockpile, and codifies safety standards. It also
attempts to soften local opposition to the destruction of chemical weapons
at the depots where they are currently stored (see OMRI Russian Regional
Report, 4 December 1996) by granting federal subsidies to neighboring
regions. Russia, like the U.S., has signed but not ratified the 1993
Chemical Weapons Convention, which will enter into force this April. The
lack of appropriate legislation has hindered efforts to begin liquidating
the Russian stockpile. The bill now goes to the Federation Council for
consideration. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RUSSIA PROTESTS OVER ARREST OF DIPLOMAT IN NEW YORK. The Russian Foreign
Ministry on 31 December called in the U.S. charge d'affaires to protest a
29 December incident in which it claims a Russian diplomat was beaten by
New York police, international agencies reported. Moscow wants an apology
&gt;from Washington over the incident, involving Yurii Obnosov, first secretary
at the Russian mission to the UN, and his Belarusian colleague, Yurii
Oranzh. New York Police spokeswoman Eve Serrano, however, said Obnosov and
Orange, who appeared intoxicated, assaulted police who tried to cite them
for illegal parking. As they failed to identify themselves, she added, they
were taken into custody following a "slight struggle" but quickly released
after their identities were verified. The State Department is withholding
comment pending a full investigation, but New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
rejected the Russian charges, and urged Moscow and Minsk to recall the two
diplomats. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
YELTSIN TO EMPHASIZE BLOCKING NATO EXPANSION IN 1997. Presidential foreign
policy aide Dmitrii Ryurikov said on 1 January that "overcoming the concept
of NATO expansion eastwards" will be a "major goal" of Yeltsin's foreign
policy during 1997, RFE/RL reported, citing Interfax. Ryurikov said the
NATO issue would be at the center of Yeltsin's scheduled 4 January meeting
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Ryurikov added that Moscow views NATO
expansion as "as a kind of offense," arguing that "it was Russia that won
the Cold War by doing away with military confrontation for the good of all
countries." Writing in Segodnya on 31 December, military commentator Pavel
Felgengauer said Russian officials anticipate no "practical benefits" from
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana's scheduled mid-January visit to
Moscow; they expect him to offer only "general theses" rather than address
specific Russian concerns about enlargement. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
NEW RUBLE EXCHANGE CORRIDOR. The Central Bank intends to keep the ruble's
value within a corridor set at 5,500-6,100 rubles/$1 as of 1 January,
declining to 5,750-6,350 rubles/$1 by 31 December 1997. This will amount to
a ruble depreciation of 9% over the year--less than the expected 12%
domestic price inflation. In 1996 while inflation was 22% the ruble rose by
19.8%, from 4,640 rubles on 3 January to 5,560 rubles on 31 December 31.
This mere 2% real appreciation in the ruble in 1996 contrasts with a 43%
real appreciation in 1995, when the 130% annual inflation outstripped the
nominal fall in the ruble/dollar exchange rate. The Central Bank introduced
the managed currency corridor in July 1995 and switched to an inclined
corridor, allowing gradual devaluation, in July 1996. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
GEORGIAN PRESIDENT CALLS FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. In his New Year's
address to the nation, Eduard Shevardnadze said he hopes 1997 will be a
year of reconciliation among Georgians, Abkhaz, and South Ossetians,
ITAR-TASS reported on 31 December. Shevardnadze condemned the calls by some
Georgian politicians to resolve the Abkhaz conflict by force as
"thoughtless" while adding that Georgia will never agree to Abkhazia's
outright independence. Shevardnadze called for a "more active" Russian
mediation in the Abkhaz conflict and said despite "certain difficulties and
problems" in relations with Russia, his government will continue the
strategic partnership policy with the latter. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
GEORGIA HIT BY NATURAL DISASTERS. Rescue workers on 30 December managed to
clear a path into a 4 km-long tunnel connecting Georgia and Russia that had
been blocked off by an avalanche in the Caucasus Mountains on 26 December,
international agencies reported. Some 300 people, including one newborn
baby who died of hypothermia, were trapped in the tunnel. Some 60 truck
drivers, fearing that their vehicles and cargoes could be stolen, decided
not to leave the tunnel until traffic is resumed. The avalanche followed
floods in West Georgia that, according to ITAR-TASS, washed away more than
50 bridges and destroyed several hundred houses and buildings, causing an
estimated $10 million in damages. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
ARMENIAN PRESIDENT ON 1997. Speaking on national TV, Levon Ter-Petrossyan
said that in 1997 Armenia will have to end the trade-route blockade and
deal with international pressure due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
ITAR-TASS reported on 1 January. The president said the two challenges can
be successfully overcome if people maintain solidarity and the country
remains stable. He also said that the new year will be marked by an
economic revival, an improvement in living standards, and a stronger rule
of law. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
KYRGYZ PRESIDENT SEES ECONOMIC GROWTH. Askar Akayev on 28 December told
government officials that while living standards had not improved during
1996, "new dynamic sectors of the national economy" would correct that
trend in 1997. Akayev was alluding to the Kumtor gold mining operation
which is scheduled to begin production in 1997. Akayev said the government
will take measures to keep the national currency, the som, stable at the
present rate of 15-17 some/$1, cut annual inflation to 15%, and raise the
minimum wage and pensions by 30%. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
TAJIK-IRANIAN RELATIONS. Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi arrived in
Tajikistan on 30 December at the head of an 80-member delegation, the
largest Iranian group to visit the Central Asian state so far,
international press reported. Habibi on 31 December signed agreements with
Tajik Prime Minister Yakhye Azimov on double taxation, cooperation in
education, culture, trade, and industry, and a memorandum on developing
auto and rail transportation. ITAR-TASS reported on 30 December that
Tajikistan is seeking help in exploiting its gas reserves, estimated at 800
billion cubic meters, and its 130 million tons worth of oil reserves. In
Tehran, United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri met with Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on 30 December to discuss the recently
signed Tajik peace agreement. -- Bruce Pannier

UKRAINE'S BUDGET DEFICIT TWICE AS LARGE AS FORECAST. Ukraine's budget
deficit in 1996 totaled 8.6 billion hryvnyas ($4.57 billion), Reuters
reported on 31 December. That is double the figure forecast when the budget
was drawn up.  Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko said that GDP fell for the
fifth consecutive year and that, according to  the most optimistic
forecasts, it is not expected to reach the 1990 level for another 11 years.
Lazarenko said wage arrears have not been paid because of  "other
commitments." On a more positive note, he added that Ukraine has paid off
all its accumulated gas debts to Russia and Turkmenistan. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
UKRAINIAN NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL APPROVES MILITARY PLAN. Secretary of
the National Security Council Volodymyr Horbulin said the council has
approved a program for the development of Ukraine's armed forces until the
year 2005, UNIAN reported on 28 December. Horbulin said the program took
all foreign-policy factors into account and was based on the state's
financial resources. Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk noted that three
operational and command directorates would be established on the model of
the Carpathian and Odessa military districts and the Northern Command. The
program envisages a new structure made up of mobile rapid-reaction units.
The ground forces, air force, air-defense force, and navy will all remain
part of the Ukrainian army. Kuzmuk also said this was the first time that
the state has specified that the task of the armed forces is to ensure
national security. -- Ustina Markus

SERBIAN OPPOSITION RINGS IN NEW YEAR. At least 200,000 people braved the
bitter cold to attend a gala open-air New Year's Eve party in central
Belgrade, international media reported. Leaders of the Zajedno movement
congratulated their followers and predicted victory over President Slobodan
Milosevic, whom they accuse of having stolen the 17 November local
elections. The crowds were entertained by some of the country's leading
rock groups, and the once ubiquitous riot police were nowhere to be seen.
The next day, demonstration organizers urged their followers to stay home
and make as much noise as possible with pans, drums, and other implements
during Serbian TV's main evening newscast to protest its biased coverage.
The event was a success, although some 5,000 students also demonstrated on
the streets of the city center. The protests show no sign of losing
momentum. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
MILOSEVIC PROMISES ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. Meanwhile, the Serbian
president made a New Year's speech on television but did not directly refer
to the protests, VOA noted. However, he mentioned in passing internal and
external attempts to destabilize the country. He also promised a new
economic program that would "change the face of Serbia." Such grandiose
rhetoric has long been typical of his political style, but it is doubtful
whether his promises will meet with the eager popular approval they did in
the late 1980s. On 31 December, Dutch diplomat Minno Censtro discussed the
question of the election results with federal Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
officials, who said they would "respect the will of the people," the BBC
reported. It is unclear, however, what this will mean in practice. On 1
January, Montenegrin parliament speaker Svetozar Marovic urged Serbian
authorities to accept an OSCE report that backs the opposition's position
on the elections. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH ADDRESSES POLITICAL SITUATION. Patriarch Pavle
opened a two-day synod of 30 bishops on 2 January, AFP noted. Only the five
bishops from Bosnia-Herzegovina did not attend the session aimed at
discussing the ongoing protests. The church has openly embraced Serbian
nationalism since the disintegration of the communist system, but many
believers and some of the bishops feel it has been too close to the
political authorities both under the communists and under the ex-communist
Milosevic. Such persons identify more readily with the Bosnian Serb
leadership under Radovan Karadzic, who does not have a communist past. In
any event, Pavle called on the authorities not to use violence against the
demonstrators, Vatican Radio reported on 1 January. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
CIA SAYS BOSNIA HAS BROKEN MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE TIES WITH IRAN. The
Clinton administration on 31 December said that Bosnia-Herzegovina has
severed intelligence and military ties with Iran,  international agencies
reported. The statement followed a story published the same day in the Los
Angeles Times claiming the CIA has evidence that Iranian agents secretly
delivered some $500,000 in cash to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
before his party's campaign for the September general elections in Bosnia.
The newspaper said the story was based on classified documents it had
obtained. Meanwhile, the CIA has provided U.S. Congressional committees
with a classified report on Iranian activities in Bosnia. An unclassified
version is expected to follow soon. State Department spokesman John Dinger
said Izetbegovic recognizes his relationship with the U.S. is more
important than that with Iran. As a result, the U.S. will go ahead with a
plan to train and equip the Bosnian Federation forces with military gear,
Dinger added. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
STEINER VOTED BOSNIA'S "FOREIGN PERSONALITY" OF 1996. Michael Steiner, who
is deputy to the international community's High Representative for
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Carl Bildt, has been chosen Bosnia's foreign
personality of the year, Dnevni Avaz reported on 31 December. The poll was
organized by Bosnian publications. The biweekly magazine Dani said
Steiner's work "brings back the almost-lost credibility of international
diplomacy and the existence of morality." In other news, Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic has said that 1997 will be a year of consolidation for
the country, AFP reported. But Izetbegovic also said he is dissatisfied
with the slow progress of peace implementation in Bosnia, adding that time
is running out. He added that he hoped the current situation would soon be
eased. But if it is not, "it will be time for us to wonder if we want a
peace of this nature," he commented. -- Daria Sito Sucic

TITLE=96: NAGORNO-KARABAKH<br>
BYLINE=HASAN JAVADI<br>
DATELINE=WASHINGTON<br>
CONTENT=<br>
VOICED AT: <br>
<p>
INTRO:  THE CONFLICT IN NAGORNO-KARABAKH, ONE OF THE LONGEST AND <br>
BLOODIEST IN THE CAUCASUS, REMAINED UNRESOLVED IN I996.  THE <br>
ENCLAVE, POPULATED MOSTLY BY ETHNIC ARMENIANS, HAS BEEN FIGHTING <br>
FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM AZERBAIJAN SINCE 1988.  THOUGH A CEASEFIRE <br>
HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE MAY 1994, NO POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IS IN <br>
SIGHT.  V-O-A'S HASAN JAVADI LOOKS INTO THE DISPUTE IN THE YEAR <br>
THAT JUST ENDED.<br>
<p>
TEXT:  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS  NO  BREAKTHROUGH IN THE <br>
NAGORNO-KARABAKH CONFLICT, THREE IMPORTANT EVENTS HAPPENED: <br>
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NAGORNO-KARABAKH, SOME RELAXATION IN <br>
U-S AID TO AZERBAIJAN AND MORE INVOLVEMENT BY EUROPEAN NATIONS TO<br>
RESOLVE THE CONFLICT.<br>
<p>
NAGORNO-KARABAKH'S DECISION TO HOLD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS NEAR <br>
THE END OF 1996 (NOVEMBER 24) BROUGHT CRITICISM, NOT ONLY FROM  <br>
AZERBAIJAN, WHICH CONSIDERS THE ENCLAVE PART OF ITS TERRITORY, <br>
BUT ALSO FROM RUSSIA.  A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN <br>
MINISTRY SAID THAT THIS DECISION RAN COUNTER TO INTERNATIONAL <br>
EFFORTS TO SECURE A LASTING PEACE SETTLEMENT FOR THE REGION. <br>
HOWEVER, THE  ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE AS SCHEDULED, AND ROBERT <br>
KOCHARIAN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH.<br>
<p>
ROBERT BARYLSKI OF SOUTH FLORIDA UNIVERSITY, AN EXPERT ON THE <br>
CAUCASUS, SAYS BOTH SIDES IN THE CONFLICT HAVE OBLIGATIONS.  HE <br>
SAYS THAT WHILE THE STATE SHOULD RESPECT THE TERRITORIAL <br>
INTEGRITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES, MINORITIES <br>
HAVE CORRESPONDING OBLIGATIONS:<br>
<p>
                         BARYLSKI ACT// <br>
<p>
         ETHNIC MINORITIES ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO  RESPECT<br>
         THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WITHIN WHICH THEY<br>
         RESIDE. UNLESS THE MINORITIES RESPECT THE STATE IN WHICH<br>
         THEY LIVE, IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE IN THE GREATER CASPIAN <br>
         REGION TO EXPECT POLITICAL STABILITY IN ANY COUNTRY.<br>
<p>
                            END ACT//<br>
<p>
IN NOVEMBER, U-S DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE STROBE TALBOT AND <br>
SANDY BERGER, ANOTHER TOP OFFICIAL IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION,<br>
TRAVELED TO THE REGION TO TALK WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, <br>
PARTICULARLY IN ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN, ABOUT REACHING PEACE IN <br>
THE REGION.  THEY ALSO DISCUSSED ISSUES RELATING TO DEVELOPING <br>
ENERGY SOURCES IN AND AROUND THE CASPIAN SEA.   <br>
<p>
 /// OPT /// ON JUNE 6, PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN HELD A REGIONAL <br>
SUMMIT IN THE SOUTHERN RUSSIAN CITY OF KOSLOVODSK.  IT WAS THE <br>
FIRST SUMMIT IN REGION SINCE THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION.    <br>
YELTSIN AND HIS COUNTERPARTS FROM ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN AND GEORGIA<br>
SIGNED A DECLARATION OF MUTUAL COOPERATION IN SETTLING  REGIONAL <br>
CONFLICTS. BUT THIS, LIKE MANY EARLIER ATTEMPTS, HAS NOT PRODUCED<br>
ANY RESULTS. /// END OPT.// <br>
<p>
SOME COUNTRIES IN THE REGION HAVE BENEFITTED MORE FROM OUTSIDE <br>
AID THAN OTHERS. THOUGH A U-S AID BILL FOR THE FORMER SOVIET <br>
STATES -- THE "FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT" -- ALLOWED AID TO ALL FORMER <br>
SOVIET STATES,  ONE OF ITS SECTIONS (907A) BANNED ALL <br>
GOVERNMENT-TO- GOVERNMENT AID TO AZERBAIJAN.  SINCE 1992, <br>
AZERBAIJAN HAS RECEIVED 92 MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH <br>
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS,  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA <br>
HAS RECEIVED 625 MILLION DOLLARS OF DIRECT AID FROM THE UNITED <br>
STATES.<br>
<p>
IN JUNE 1996 A BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN THE U-S CONGRESS THAT  <br>
SOMEWHAT MODIFIED THE LANGUAGE OF THE 907 BILL, AND ALLOWED  THE <br>
USE OF AZERI GOVERNMENT FACILITIES TO STORE AID MATERIALS.  BUT <br>
THE BILL ALSO SPECIFIED THAT FOR EVERY SEVEN DOLLARS IN U-S AID <br>
TO AZERBAIJAN IN 1997, ONE DOLLAR MUST GO TO NAGORNO-KARABAKH. <br>
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION CRITICIZED THIS PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT <br>
IT "INJECTED  DAMAGING POLITICAL LANGUAGE" INTO THE ATTEMPT TO <br>
ENHANCE THE U-S GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN <br>
ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY INDIVIDUALS IN AZERBAIJAN.  ULTIMATELY THE <br>
BILL DID NOT PASS, BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS <br>
ALTERED. IT NOW GIVES THE U-S GOVERNMENT SLIGHTLY MORE LATITUDE <br>
IN ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN AID.<br>
<p>
THE O-S-C-E (ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE)<br>
SENT SEVERAL DELEGATIONS TO ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN IN AN EFFORT <br>
TO WORK OUT A RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT. THESE EFFORTS <br>
CULMINATED IN THE O-S-C-E LISBON CONFERENCE.  BUT THE CONFERENCE <br>
DEADLOCKED IN A DISPUTE OVER THE WORDING OF ITS FINAL STATEMENT. <br>
<p>
ARMENIA REFUSED TO AGREE TO LANGUAGE STATING THAT <br>
NAGORNO-KARABAKH IS PART OF AZERBAIJAN.  AND PRESIDENT HEYDAR <br>
ALIYEV OF AZERBAIJAN THREATENED TO BLOCK THE WHOLE DOCUMENT IF <br>
THE LANGUAGE ABOUT NAGORNO-KARABAKH BEING PART OF AZERBAIJAN <br>
WASN'T INCLUDED IN A FINAL STATEMENT.  SINCE A SUMMIT DECLARATION<br>
HAD TO BE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED, THE AZERBAIJAN PRESIDENT'S <br>
OPPOSITION MEANT THAT NO FINAL STATEMENT WOULD BE ISSUED.  AT THE<br>
LAST MINUTE, MR. ALIYEV AGREED TO A COMPROMISE THAT REMOVED THE <br>
LANGUAGE, BUT HAD IT INCLUDED IN A SEPARATE DOCUMENT. HE ALSO <br>
RECEIVED A STRONG STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.<br>
<p>
IN RECENT YEARS AN ECONOMIC FACTOR HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE <br>
SITUATION. WESTERN OIL COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS OF <br>
DOLLARS IN THE OIL FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN, AND THEY ARE KEENLY <br>
INTERESTED IN A SETTLEMENT OF THE CONFLICT SO THAT THEIR OIL <br>
PIPELINES TO THE BLACK SEA WILL BE SAFE FROM ATTACK. <br>
<p>
WHILE THERE ARE MANY FORCES INTERESTED IN BRINGING PIECE TO THE <br>
REGION, LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THE LIVES OF MORE THAN  ONE   <br>
MILLION AZERI REFUGEES WHO HAVE FLED THE FIGHTING. THEY LIVE <br>
UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN BAKU AND IN VARIOUS CAMPS <br>
AROUND THE COUNTRY.<br>

Armenia: Prime Minister Divulges Details Of Chernomyrdin Talks<br>
<p>
By Hrair Tamrazian<br>
<p>
Yerevan, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - Armenia's newly-appointed Prime<br>
Minister, Armen Sarkissian, has disclosed details of his meeting in<br>
Moscow last week with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,<br>
including plans to restore rail links between the two countries.<br>
<p>
Sarkissian told reporters in Yerevan today that he and Russian leaders<br>
agreed that a new gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey should pass<br>
trough Armenian territory. He says he reached an agreement with<br>
Russian leaders to restore the railway connecting Russia and Armenia<br>
via Georgia and its separatist region of Abkhazia.<br>
<p>
Sarkissian quotes Russian officials as saying that if the Abkhaz<br>
conflict bars restoration of the old railway line a new line would be<br>
built further to the east, bypassing Abkhazia.<br>
<p>
Before returning to Yerevan, Sarkissian gave an exclusive interview to<br>
our correspondent in Moscow in which he stressed the importance of<br>
strengthening economic ties between Moscow and Yerevan.<br>
<p>
Sarkissian told our correspondent that during his talks with Russian<br>
officials the two sides agreed to increase Russian investments in<br>
Armenia's economy. Sarkissian says maintaining a strong relationship<br>
with Russia is strategically important for Armenia.<br>

Armenia: President Signs Memo Of Understanding With Iran<br>
<p>
By Hrair Tamrazian<br>
<p>
Yerevan, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) -- Our correspondent in Yerevan<br>
reports that Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi and Armenian<br>
President Levon Ter-Petrossian on Saturday signed a memorandum of<br>
understanding between the two countries. The signing ceremony took<br>
place in the presidential palace in the Armenian capital.<br>
<p>
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Ter-Petrossian called<br>
Habibi's visit a turning point in relations between the two<br>
nations. He said Iran is a stabilizing factor in the region and<br>
praised Tehran for its balanced role in the Nagorno-Karabakh<br>
conflict. He also said Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian will visit Iran<br>
early next year.<br>
<p>
In addition to the memorandum of understanding, the leaders also<br>
signed several documents covering economic cooperation, trade,<br>
customs, transportation and communications. Habibi said one of the<br>
joint agreements signed focuses on finding financing for an<br>
Iran-Armenia gas pipeline project.<br>
<p>
Habibi -- who addressed the Armenian Parliament on Thursday -- is the<br>
highest-ranking Iranian official to visit Armenia since it gained<br>
independence five years ago.<br>

Armenia: World Bank Loan To Build Market Institutions, Credit<br>
<p>
By Robert Lyle<br>
<p>
Washington, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - The World Bank's International<br>
Development Association (IDA) has approved a long-term, no-interest<br>
loan to help Armenia build market-based institutions and provide lines<br>
of credit to private enterprises.<br>
<p>
The loan, of around $16.8 million, will fill just over 40 percent of<br>
the costs to create a Private Investment Finance Corporation of<br>
Armenia to promote enterprise development. It will also provide<br>
training and technical services to banks, other financial institutions<br>
and a series of Armenian funds and agencies implementing economic<br>
reforms.<br>
<p>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Germany's<br>
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, and private investors are expected to<br>
provide another $14 million for the project with additional<br>
co-financing to come from the U.S. Agency for International<br>
Development (USAID) and others.<br>
<p>
The overall Enterprise Development Project, according to the World<br>
Bank, aims to increase the creditworthiness of Armenian companies<br>
through improved planning and development of export links and joint<br>
venture deals to enhance investment, trade, and technology.<br>
<p>
The bank says it also aims to strengthen the lending capacity of the<br>
banking system, especially for export-oriented projects.<br>
<p>
The IDA loan charges only a small annual fee and runs for 35 years<br>
with no repayment required for the first ten years.<br>

Dear Groong and Hayastan readers,<br>
<p>
I'm happy to announce that we have pledged enough to fund a year's<br>
worth of Noyan Tapan news on Groong, plus a little more.<br>
<p>
Many of the 143 contributors have requested anonymity. For this reason<br>
I'll keep the rest of the details off the lists, and we will hopefully<br>
see Noyan Tapan posts on Groong as soon as the financial details<br>
progress.<br>
<p>
I'll contact those who came forward with pledges off the lists, and<br>
I'll communicate further details separately.<br>
<p>
Thank you all who came forward to help. I shall not close the fund drive<br>
officially, because I'd like to continue the funding process further, in<br>
order to extend our ability to receive news-for-pay for many more months,<br>
and not go through another fund-drive 9-10 months from now. Therefore, I<br>
include the original pledge for help below.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, Shnorhavor Nor Dari yev Sourp Dznount to all, may you<br>
all live long and prosper in 1997 and beyond.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Asbed<br>

	Proposal for funding of Noyan Tapan Acquisition.
<p>
Dear Hayastan and Groong readers,
<p>
We've been in touch with Noyan Tapan (NT) to acquire their news on a daily
basis for Groong. As you may already know, NT is based in Armenia and
sells its news service for a fee.
<p>
NT came forward voluntarily during September's elections in Armenia and
informed us with up-to-the-minute news and events for altruistic reasons.
We appreciated their work; we think that their news service is very
informative and timely, and we'd like to read more of it, and regularly.
<p>
Noyan Tapan has requested a fee of $250/month for a specially prepared
"Groong Edition" daily bulletin, and has sent us many days' worth of
samples. I'm attaching one day's worth below for your perusal and
judgement. I feel the fee is reasonable and well worth it.
<p>
In addition to improving our quality of news here on Groong, and being
better informed on Armenia and the Caucasus region in general, our
subscription to Noyan Tapan will be an explicit statement of support
and approval for free and independent media in Armenia.
<p>
As the daily readers of Groong News, there's only you to turn to, to fund
such a project. Therefore I'm asking all interested parties to come
forward with any amount of donation to fund the next 12 months' worth of
Noyan Tapan reception on Groong.
<p>
We need to raise $3000 for this. Groong has 1100 members and Hayastan
has 350. If 100 members come forward with $30 each, we're there! If
more members come forward, then we will arrange to receive as many
more months of daily Noyan Tapan as we have money for.  And if we
don't come up with the required funds, then I will assume that we're
not interested in receiving Noyan Tapan daily.
<p>
I ask that you send me email, with your pledge amount, which I will
tally. The deadline for this initial drive is December 25. If we're
well on the way, I'll extend the deadline a bit and continue reminding
very often, as I feel that this is a very worthy service and would
enhance our news from Armenia greatly.  I will of course update the
list very regularly of our progress. In fact, I can tell you that we
already have $260 from just 4 Groong readers!
<p>
My goal at the moment is to receive NT news daily for all of 1997.
<p>
Send no money now. Once final amounts are tallied, I'll inform the lists
where to send checks and who to write it out to. As far as trusting that
your (our) funds will be well used, I assure you that every penny will
be spent on this project, and there will be not a penny of administrative
overheard (I'll deal with that).
<p>
I hope to hear from you very soon. Please help if you can.
<p>
Regards,
<p>
Asbed

CC RESOLUTION REGARDING ELECTION RESULTS ADOPTED BY
MAJORITY OF VOTES
     YEREVAN, November  26   (Noyan  Tapan). "This was the first
attempt  to  raise a  dispute   between  the  opposition and the
authorities  onto  a   civilized   level,"   Chairman   of   the
Constitutional Court (CC) of Armenia Gagik Haroutiunian  said at
a Monday news conference.
     Haroutiunian said that the Constitutional Court had  chosen
the right way -- a search for a final decision  through thorough
scritiny and analysis of all available documents.
     Haroutiunian  reported  that the  Constitutional Court  had
charged  lawenforcement    agencies   to   institute    criminal
proceedings in connection with a number of violations and  carry
out a probe into those cases. Haroutiunian was  astonished  over
the fact   that  a  person who  had   stolen a ballot box from a
polling station was sentenced to 10  days  in  jail.  Meanwhile,
according to him, that was a serious crime.
     CC Chairman said that the law on the  Constitutional  Court
of the Republic  of Armenia bans publicising the results of  the
discussions.  He only said  that  the resolution  was adopted by
the majority of votes. Constitutional Court  Chairman noted that
under  the  legislation in  effect, protocols of closed  meeting
were immediately sealed and sent to  state  archives.  "Pethaps,
in some years they will be accessible,  and everybody will  have
an opportunity to know what had happened," he said.
     Haroutiunian said  it   was  not right   to  form electoral
commission by   party  representation principle, since, he said,
the commissions should be made up  of professionals, whose  work
must be supervised.
     Haroutiunian highly appreciated a worthy  behavior  of  the
aggrieved party representatives at  the Court.  He  said that it
thanks to  them  that  the  proceedings  were held  on  a really
civilized level. "Our  country  needs opposition as we have  the
Parliament,  Government   and   the  Constitutional  Court,"  CC
Chairman said.
<p>
<p>
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN KARABAKH AROUSED AZERBAIJAN'S
ANGER
     YEREVAN,  November 26   (Noyan Tapan).  The   November   24
presidential election  in  the   Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  were
held, despite statements from  a  number of countries that  they
will not recognize the election results.
     On the   same  day   rallies,   protesting   the   Karabakh
presidential   election  were    staged   in  Azerbaijan.    The
Instanbul-based  Armenian  "Marmara"  daily  reports  that Azeri
Culture Minister Polad Bul-Bul ogly said, addressing  a rally in
Baku,  that  the  elections  in Karabakh  were   nothing but  "a
politcal irritator". He said that  Azerbaijan  was  against  any
bloodshed, but,  if   necessary, they were ready  to  shed their
blood to liberate the occupied Azeri territories.

<p>
ECONOMIC REVIEW (NOVEMBER 17-24)
<p>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).
<p>
     NATIONAL CURRENCY
     Dollar rate did not practically  change for the  week.  The
average cost of 1 USD decreased by 1 point and was equal to  434
drams during   the week.  At   the  same  time, the  margin (the
difference between sale and purchase prices) is still very  low.
Maximal sale  price   (433 drams against 1  dollar) dropped by 2
points, and minimal purchase price (436  drams) decreased by the
same two points.
     In principle, the  margin size is to  a certain  extent  an
indicator of the health of the national currency. The higher  is
the margin, the more alarming is  the  condition  of  the  given
currency, and vice versa. In our case, drop of the  margin  from
10 drams (2.5%  of the  dollar)  in  early November to  3  drams
(0.7%)  is a sign  of  healthening,  though  its causes are  not
clear.  The Government  did   not take  any efficient  steps  to
protect dram from devaluation , and did  not even  make a formal
statement on it. The Central Bank did only  one  thing:  for the
first time during  two months it  took part  in  tradings at the
Yerevan and Giumri Stock Exchange and purchased a rather  modest
sum of 200,000 dollars.
     But this   circumstance  could  never able  to  relax   the
tension on currency market. Here, we  have  probably  the result
of other factors: restraint from  emission, the  fact  that  the
government used only those sums that are  in circulation, delays
in pension and salary payments, and hence,  low consumer  demand
and  relatively  stable consumer prices.  Anyway,  it should  be
noted that it is not only the dollar rate that  affects consumer
prices, but  also consumer  prices cause changes  in the  dollar
rate.
     Exchange  rate  at the Moscow  Interbank Currency  Exchange
was 5,489 ruble on November 22.
<p>
     CONSUMER BUDGET
     By  the end   of  the  week the  cost  of   the living wage
consumer budget   was  12,900  drams (29.6 dollars). The cost of
the overalkl budget constituted 19,800 drams (45.5 dollars).
     So, the cost of the consumer budget dropped by  200  drams,
and 0.5 dollars.
<p>
     CONSUMER PRICES
     NT-16  index calculated   of  16 staple   food products was
equal  to 1,000,  i.e.  general level of consumer prices  had no
relation to changes in dollar rate and remained unchanged.
<p>
     INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
     Following the "Hrant"  index,  the investment  activity was
9.55 during the week.
<p>
     TREASURY BILLS MARKET
     "Sed  Marced"  index of   profitability of   treasury bills
constituted 0.3996, which is  456 points  lower  if  compared to
the previous   week. The profitability  was 39.96%. According to
President of   the Sed   Marced Firm  Tigran  Jerbashian,   such
decrease  is  conditioned by  the fact that  2,000,000,000-worth
treasury  bills were   used  up by  foreign  investors  two week
before.

<p>
<p>
KARABAKH DISAPPOINTED WITH HELSINKI NEGOTIATIONS, FM SAYS
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).  "We  are  disappointed
with the results of this round of negotiations  on  the Karabakh
conflict", Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady  Ghoukassian said at
a Nov. 26 news conference.
     He  noted that results  of  a  half-and-a-year  work of the
OSCE  Minsk  group  and  principles  of  the conflict settlement
worked out by the Armenian party were left out  of  the  account
at  the   Helsinki    negotiations.   Ghoukassian  said    that,
unfortunately, at the last moment  representatives of Azerbaijan
refused  to participate  in   the work,   insisting   that   the
negotiations  must be  held from the initial position,  i.e. the
principle of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.
     Ghoukassian  said  that  the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic did
not consider   itself to  be   a  part  of Azerbaijan,   and any
decision must proceed from this position.  "We  are  against any
attempts to   predetermine the  results   of  the  negotiations.
Respecting the  territorial  integrity,   Karabakh is  ready  to
discuss this issue only after both  contending sides  hold equal
initial positions at the  negotiations  and the Nagorno-Karabakh
Republic  is  viewed as   a subject  of the  international law,"
Karabakh's FM said. He described  statements by  the Azeri  side
as statements of the  lost party which  demands  capitulation of
its enemy. "If Azerbaijan really viewed Nagorno Karabakh  as its
integral part, it would have  decided this  problem  by  itself,
without turning to international organizations," he noted.
     According to Ghoukassian, Azerbaijan intends  to kick up  a
row at   the  forthcoming  OSCE summit   in Lisbon.  He   voiced
confidence  that if  Azerbaijan  insists  that  the  territorial
integrity be a basic principle of the  conflict settlement, then
Armenia will have to use its right to veto.
     He stressed  that  the  issue of  territorial  integirty is
directly connected with the problem of  Karabakh's  status. "The
fact  that the  Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic  is   independent  is
obvious  and the status of  Karabakh  must be  a  result  of the
negotiations,  and not   a starting   point  for   the  latter,"
Ghoukassian said.
     He emphasized   that  the presidential  election in Nagorno
Karabakh proved that the Karabakh people trusts its leadership.
     Ghoukassian said that the internal political  situation  in
Armenia had played a certain part in toughening of  position  of
Azerbaijan. However, he voiced confidence that  this  would  not
influence the positions of Karabakh and Armenia.
<p>
CONFLICTING SIDES FAIL TO AGREE A COMMON DOCUMENT
     YEREVAN, November  26  (Noyan   Tapan).  No document  to be
submitted at   the forthcoming OSCE summit in  Lisbon  has  been
adopted  at a recent  round of talks  over the Karabakh conflict
held in Helsinki. The positions of the parties  to  the conflict
remained unchanged,   President elect   of the  Nagorno-Karabakh
Republic Robert   Kocharian  said   at  a  news   conference  in
Stepanakert. He noted that no document had  been  adopted during
Libaridian-Guluzade meeting as well.
     Kocharian noted that there  is  still a  chance to  agree a
common  document  in  Vienna, a   document,  which  will then be
presented at   the  Lisbon summit.  But   he was skeptical about
that. He  said Azerbaijan  would stick  to its  position  as  it
hoped to   submit  its  own  document at   the   Lisbon  summit.
According to   Kocharian, the   Azeri side   will be pushing for
territorial integirty of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan counts  that the
document will be supported by all countries-participants of  the
cummit, and if Armenia  uses its rights to  veto  and  does  not
vote for  that  document, it will have  to  confront with  other
OSCE-member  countries.  Azerbaijan   believes  that  this  will
seriously affect Armenia's international image.
     "This is the major  position on  which  Azerbaijan  stakes.
Taking  this    position  Azerbaijan  torpedoes  any  compromise
decision which  might   be  achieved before the Lisbon  summit,"
Kocharian said.

MANVEL EGHIAZARIAN REFUSES TO ATTEND HEARINGS ON CASE OF 31
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan). At a  Nov.  25  hearing
on the case of 31  Manvel  Eghiazarian's nephew Gagik Vanian did
not plead guilty to committing an attempt on policeman's life.
     Vanian  confirmed testimonies  that  he   had  given during
preliminary  probe.   He   said  that  on  the  day  of   arrest
Eghiazarian's house was encircled  by  armed people in masks and
heavy  military  vehicles (Vanian said the house  was surrounded
by tanks).  Armed  people burst  into the yard of the house  and
opened  fire.  Eghiazarian was   crying out: "Don't shoot, there
are small children at the house." Vanian said  he  was  not with
Eghiazarian   and  could   not    remember   precisely   whether
Eghiazarian returned fire or not. Vanian  said he  did not  know
whether the  assailants   were agents   of  the   lawenforcement
bodies.
     Vanian said that out of the arms  seized at his  apartment,
only 15 cartridges really belonged to him. He said he  kept them
as a memory about the Karabakh war. He said he did not  know how
the rest of the arms appeared at his apartment. As to arms  that
had been found at Eghiazarian's, Vanian  said  that  "Manvel has
always kept   arms at  home  and   even   much  more   than  the
lawenforcement agents have found."
     Manvel   Eghiazarian  said  that   he  refuses  to   attend
hearings, whereas   his  wife Mariam Khzyrjian will not  come to
the court as a witness.

ADMINISTRATION INCREASES AID FOR DEMOCRACY IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
Broad Range of "Democracy and Governance" Programs<br>
Initiated During 1996<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC  -  The Clinton Administration continues to expand its <br>
assistance programs in Armenia designed to promote democratic <br>
pluralism, strengthen the rule of law, expand the independent <br>
media, support parliamentary and political party development, and <br>
facilitate free and fair elections, reported the Armenian National <br>
Committee of America (ANCA).<br>
<p>
"We welcome the increased attention that the Clinton Administration has <br>
placed on democratic development in Armenia and encourage the expansion <br>
of these programs during the coming year," said Aram Hamparian, <br>
Executive Director of the ANCA.  "This assistance continues to serve as <br>
a strong signal to the people of Armenia that the United States will <br>
stand with them as they seek to overcome the legacy of an authoritarian <br>
political system and fully realize their democratic aspirations."<br>
<p>
The ANCA supports high levels of U.S. assistance for Armenia and direct <br>
aid to Karabagh.  Since 1991, the U.S. has provided more than $600 <br>
million to Armenia to help offset the effects of blockades and to <br>
promote economic and political reform.  The ANCA's broad-based <br>
grassroots advocacy, legislative strategy, and long-standing relations <br>
with congressional leaders and Administration officials have all <br>
contributed significantly to the high level of aid Armenia has <br>
received, currently the second highest per-capita in the world.  Listed <br>
below are democracy programs administered by the Agency for <br>
International Development (USAID); the U.S. Information Service (USIS), <br>
the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Agriculture <br>
(USDA).<br>

1. LEBED UNVEILS NEW RUSSIAN PARTY<br>
<p>
GOLITSYNO, Russia (Reuter)-Russias controversial former security chief <br>
and would-be president, Alexander Lebed, said on Friday he was launching <br>
a political "third force," which he hopes will one day propel him into <br>
the Kremlin.<br>
	The gravel-voiced former paratroop general, sacked by President Boris <br>
Yeltsin in October for insubordination, said his new party already had <br>
substantial financial backing an would aim to forge a broad alliance <br>
among diverse social groups.<br>
	"We will seek the support of small and medium-sized businesses, big <br>
private industry, the armed forces, the military-industrial complex, the <br>
intelligentsia," Lebed told a news conference at the village of <br>
Golitsyno, outside Moscow.<br>
	He said some banks, companies and wealthy individuals had offered to <br>
fund his organization, which he named the Russian National-Republican <br>
Party.<br>
	Lebed, 46, said the RNRP would draw support from both the left and <br>
right of Russias fractured political spectrum but added it would take <br>
several months to draw up an official program.<br>
	"We must become an alternative to both the communists and the present <br>
democratic apparatchiks," said the charismatic, pug-nosed Lebed, <br>
referring to the opposition and Yeltsins Kremlin administration.<br>
	His new party is closely linked to the "Honor and Motherland <br>
Movement," whose conference in Golitsyno on Friday provided the stage <br>
for Lebeds announcement.<br>
	Lebed, shunned by Russias rulers since being fired as secretary of <br>
the policy-making Security Council, needs to build a strong political <br>
base if he is ever to realize his ambition of succeeding Yeltsin in the <br>
Kremlin.<br>
In an interview published on Friday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily<br>
Lebed said Yeltsin was still a sick man and should resign. The 65-year-<br>
old president returned to the Kremlin on Monday after a heart bypass <br>
operation on November 5.<br>
	Yeltsin says he now feels well and is again in full control of the <br>
vast country, but Lebed told reporters the next few months <br>
<p>
<p>
2. IRANIAN VICE-PRESIDENT CONCLUDES ARMENIA VISIT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Combined Sources)-Irans First Vice-President Hasan Habibi <br>
conluded his four-day visit to Armenia Saturday, after signing a number <br>
of cooperation agreements expanding Iran-Armenia bilateral relations.<br>
	Ter-Petrosyan characterized relations between the two countries as <br>
having undergone "qualitative changes" during a joint press conference <br>
held on Saturday prior to Habibis departure.<br>
	In his address before the National Assembly last Thursday, Habibi <br>
expressed satisfaction with the existing bilateral relations.<br>
	"If until recently Armenia-Iran relations were exclusively focused <br>
on trade, now they are acquiring a nature of economic cooperation," Ter-<br>
Petrosyan said.<br>
	Six bilateral memoranda and protocols on mutual understanding and <br>
cooperation in the communications, energy and industrial sectors, as <br>
well as taxation, were signed between the neighboring countries. A <br>
separate memorandum dealing with the problem of raising funds for the <br>
construction of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline was also signed with the <br>
hope of encouraging Iranian investments in Armenia.<br>
	Ter-Petrosyan highly praised Irans policies in the region, <br>
describing them as "balanced." According to him, although Iran does not <br>
formally participate in the negotiation on the settlement of the <br>
Karabakh conflict, its (Irans) balanced relations with all countries of <br>
the region are in themselves factors of stability in the region.<br>
	"All countries of the region should have a chance to act and <br>
develop freely," Habibi said.<br>
	Habibi expressed hope that the Caucasus would be stable and <br>
peaceful in order to benefit economic development of the individual <br>
countries.<br>
	Vice-President Habibi arrived in Yerevan on Dec. 25 and met with <br>
high-level government officials, as well as addressed Armenias National <br>
Assembly.<br>
	During his meeting with Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian, Habibi <br>
said that time had come to tap the "untapped reservoir" in Iran-Armenia <br>
relations.<br>
	It was announced that the Armenian-Iranian joint committee for <br>
economic cooperation would hold its regular session in March 1997 in <br>
Tehran. The committee was created in 1994. Armenias Prime Minister <br>
Armen Sarkissian is expected to attend the meeting in Tehran.<br>
	In addition, Ter-Petrosyan is scheduled to visit Iran in May 1997 <br>
at the invitation of Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. GANGSTERS USED FOR MISSIONS ABROAD<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-A scandal over Turkeys alleged use of gangsters as <br>
political hitmen deepened on Friday after official testimony that a drug <br>
smuggler wanted for murder had carried out missions abroad for the <br>
security establishment.<br>
	Former interior ministry adviser Korkut Eken told a parliamentary <br>
inquiry that far-right mobster Abdullah Catli had worked with security <br>
officials for years, parliamentary sources said.<br>
	"He said he knew Catli and that (the gangster) had worked for the <br>
state, even before 1980, a source close to the commission of inquiry <br>
told Reuters.<br>
	A top intelligence officer told the same inquiry on Thursday that <br>
Turkeys intelligence service MIT had cooperated with Catli in <br>
unspecified foreign ventures in the 1980s, the source said.<br>
	It was the strongest confirmation of media and opposition reports <br>
that leading officials were closely linked to underworld figures in the <br>
past. The reports say the links may still exist.<br>
	Catli is central to a scandal that erupted on November 3 when he died <br>
in a traffic accident as a passenger in a car also carrying a senior <br>
policeman and a parliament member from Foreign Minister Tansu Cillers <br>
True Path Party.<br>
	The interior minister, also from Cillers party, quit last month amid <br>
accusations that Turkish officials used gangsters into the 1990s to kill <br>
Kurdish rebel sympathizers and business rivals in exchange for ignoring <br>
gangland drug smuggling and money laundering.<br>
	Ciller told members of a crack police unit not to be demoralized by <br>
accusations that some of its members were embroiled in illegal killings <br>
and the drugs trade.<br>
	"There have been unjustified attacks against you recently. I know how <br>
much that has saddened you, Ciller said in an address to a police <br>
academy near Ankara.<br>
	"Keep your heads up high, said Ciller, dressed in a camouflage <br>
special forces jacket. Three members of the unit have been suspended for <br>
allegedly cooperating with Catli in the July murder of Turkeys top <br>
casino owner in a drug money quarrel.<br>
	The Islamist-led coalition government of Prime Minister Necmettin <br>
Erbakan has shown few signs of cracking in the face of media reports <br>
that Cillers businessman husband and several members of her party are <br>
close to the mob.<br>
	Pro-Islam backbench parliamentarians are uneasy about a speech last <br>
month by conservative Ciller in which she indirectly praised Catli as a <br>
patriot.<br>
	Catli, a member of the extreme-right Grey Wolves movement, was wanted <br>
for the killing of seven Turkish leftists in 1978.<br>
	Parliamentary sources confirmed reports in several dailies that the <br>
head of Turkish intelligences anti-terror unit, Mehmet Eymur, testified <br>
on Thursday that the intelligence service had worked with Catli.<br>
	"He told the commission that the state used Abdullah Catli abroad <br>
from 1983, Islamist deputy Mehmet Elkatmis, who chairs the <br>
parliamentary inquiry, told the ATV television station. He did not <br>
specify what tasks Catli may have carried out.<br>
	Catli spent time in jail in France and Switzerland for drug smuggling <br>
in the 1980s. A forged version of a type of passport given only to <br>
leading officials was found on his body after the car crash.<br>
	The Turkish media have said Catli was involved in carrying out a <br>
number of anti-Armenian terrorist acts.<br>
	Eymur told the commission the intelligence service cut its relation <br>
with Catli when it became aware of his drug dealings.<br>
	"We gave him up and national police headquarters took him and began <br>
to use him, Hurriyet newspaper quoted Eymur as saying. The inquiry is <br>
closed to the press but there have been frequent leaks.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. ARMENIAN ORPHANS DIE OF POISON GAS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg/Noyan Tapan)-Eight mentally retarded and disabled children <br>
died as a result of inhaling poisonous coal gas. Four children and a <br>
nurse are recovering  in  the  Erebouni  medical center.<br>
	Noyan Tapan had previously reported that the children had died due <br>
to burns sustained from fire. <br>
<p>
<p>
5. RUSSIA AND ARMENIA SIGN TAX AGREEMENT<br>
<p>
MOSCOW (Itar-Tass)-Armenian Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian and his <br>
Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an intergovernmental <br>
agreement Saturday to avoid double taxation on incomes and property.<br>
	Chernomyrdin noted that he and Sarkissian had reached a mutual <br>
understanding on all questions.<br>
	The Russian Prime Minister expressed hope that the sides to the <br>
conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh would arrive at an early solution next <br>
year.<br>
	He told reporters that relations between the two nations[Russia and <br>
Armenia] "have been built long ago, and there were and should not be any <br>
differences between our peoples."<br>
	Prime Minister Sarkissian expressed hope that 1997 "can be decisive <br>
in strengthening relations between Armenia and Russia." Sarkissian <br>
echoed Chernomyrdins sentiments on the long-standing relations between <br>
the two nations and added, "We in Armenia regard them [the relations] as <br>
strategic."<br>
	Sarkissian pledged that as prime minister, he would do his best to <br>
further strengthen relations with Russia.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. OSCE MINSK GROUP CO-CHAIRMAN ARRIVES IN BAKU<br>
<p>
BAKU (Itar-Tass)-Russian co-chairman of the Organization for Security <br>
and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group, Yuri Yukalov, met with Azeri <br>
President Gaidar Aliyev on Saturday, following his brief stay in <br>
Armenia.<br>
	Yukalov also visited the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, and <br>
met with President Robert Kocharian prior to his arrival in the Azeri <br>
capital Baku.<br>
	Yukalov stressed the importance of continuing efforts to reach an <br>
agreement in the coming year.<br>
	In a statement made at the OSCE summit meeting in Lisbon, current <br>
OSCEchairman-in-office, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti gave an <br>
account of the major principles in the settlement of the Karabakh <br>
conflict-to recognize Azerbaijans territorial integrity by the <br>
international community, to grant a status of autonomy to Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh and to ensure the security of the population.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. FORMER PRIME MINISTER BEGINS NEW PROJECTS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Respublica Armenia, Lragir)-The former Prime  Minister  of  <br>
Armenia,  Hrant  Bagratian, has written the first chapter of his book on <br>
Armenias society.<br>
	According to Armenpress, the first chapters of the book  are ready <br>
to publication. According to the author, the main theme  of the book is <br>
a "discussion about Marxism".  It  touches  upon  the reasons of the <br>
fall of the Soviet  Union,  public-historical problems, historical <br>
evolution of private ownership, problems  of Western  and  Asian  <br>
politics and many other subjects. The  book   considers the historical <br>
experience of the Armenian statehood, economic  policy of the country, <br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 247, Part I, 31 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN ISSUES UPBEAT YEAR-END MESSAGE. While acknowledging that 1996
had been "difficult," President Boris Yeltsin stressed the positive in
his New Year's address in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, Russian
media reported on 30 December. Yeltsin noted that "our hopes came true"
as Russians "chose the path of freedom, strengthening order and
continuing the transformations." He also expressed hope that 1997 would
be a year of "accord and cooperation." In an interview with ITAR-TASS
the same day, Yeltsin cited the presidential and regional elections, the
end of fighting in Chechnya, and the curbing of inflation as the major
events of 1996. He pledged to continue the peace process in Chechnya and
make efforts to improve the economic situation but also urged citizens
to remember that the days of consumer goods shortages and runaway
inflation were past. -- Laura Belin
<p>
POLL SHOWS LEBED STILL MOST POPULAR. The latest VCIOM poll of 1,600
respondents across Russia indicated that Aleksandr Lebed remained the
country's most popular politician at year-end, with 29% support, NTV
reported on 30 December. President Yeltsin finished second with 14%,
followed by Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov with 10%, and
Moscow Mayor Yurii Luzhkov with 6%. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and U.S. President
Bill Clinton were all named by 5% of respondents each. -- Laura Belin
<p>
DUMA TO GET TV SHOW, OFFICIAL NEWSPAPER. Although the government did not
meet all 11 conditions set by Communists in the State Duma in exchange
for supporting the 1997 budget, ministers did accede to opposition
demands for more media exposure. On 20 December, the government promised
that the state-run network Russian TV (RTR) will soon begin airing a
regular parliamentary program and that the official government
newspaper, Rossiiskaya gazeta, will become the joint newspaper of the
government and parliament, Kommersant-Daily reported the next day.
(Rossiiskaya gazeta was the parliament's newspaper until October 1993,
when the Supreme Soviet was forcibly disbanded.) On 25 December, the
Duma passed a bill "on legal guarantees of opposition activities," which
seeks to provide opposition groups with more access to the state-
controlled media. -- Laura Belin
<p>
RYBKIN GIVES INTERVIEW OVER INTERNET. Security Council Secretary Ivan
Rybkin on 30 December gave an interview to NBC that was conducted in
real time over the Internet, Russian and Western agencies reported.
Rybkin said that regional conflicts, organized crime, drug trafficking,
and terrorism are the most significant threats to Russian security.
Rybkin said Russia and NATO should compromise their differences, arguing
that the main threat to Russia comes not from the West but rather from
"nationalist fanatics" and "fundamentalists" to the south. Rybkin
contended that rumors of "military instability" in Russia are "greatly
exaggerated" and said that Russia remains a major military power despite
its "temporary economic difficulties." -- Scott Parrish
<p>
BEREZOVSKII ON CHECHNYA. In an interview with Rossiiskaya gazeta
published on 28 December, Deputy Security Council Secretary Boris
Berezovskii said, "I have no doubts that Chechnya will remain a part of
Russia, and this will be the choice of the Chechen people." He said that
for economic reasons the Chechen leaders "have realized that there is no
alternative to staying together with Russia." He added that "genetically
the Chechens are Russians. They studied in Russia, they worked in
Russia...Today we probably have the last chance to preserve this genetic
unity." Berezovskii also said he has proposed building an automobile
plant in Chechnya to employ the 10,000 idle guerrillas. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
SIX CANDIDATES FOR CHECHEN PRESIDENCY. Six of the 19 candidates for the
Chechen presidency have so far provided the 10,000 signatures to
register for the 27 January election, ITAR-TASS reported on 30 December.
They are interim President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, interim Prime Minister
Aslan Maskhadov, field commander Shamil Basaev, national security
adviser Akhmed Zakaev, former spokesman Movladi Udugov, and Yusup
Soslambekov, the president of the Confederation of Peoples of the
Caucasus. The first five men met on 26 December but failed to nominate a
common candidate for the post of president, although they agreed to
serve together in the newly elected government. Udugov resigned from his
post as deputy prime minister on 27 December in order to run in the
election. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
RUSSIA, CHINA TO SIGN BORDER TROOP REDUCTION AGREEMENT. Russian,
Chinese, Kazakstani, Tajik, and Kyrgyz negotiators announced agreement
on the terms of a five-nation accord reducing troop levels along China's
border with the four CIS states, ITAR-TASS reported on 27 December.
Izvestiya on 31 December said the agreement will limit troops and
weapons in a 100 km-wide zone on both sides of the frontier. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
CIA TO SLASH MEDIA MONITORING? The Foreign Broadcast Information Service
(FBIS), a branch of the CIA, may cease publishing translations of daily
world media broadcasts, possibly including those from the former Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe, The Washington Times reported on 30 December.
CIA officials declined to discuss the budget cuts with the paper since
the agency's budget is classified, but congressional sources said FBIS's
overseas bureaus will probably be closed, meaning that FBIS would
continue to publish only untranslated reports. The Federation of
American Scientists is leading a protest against the proposed cuts,
which reportedly will save $18 million. The U.S. is estimated to spend
about $30 billion annually on all intelligence activities. -- Scott
Parrish
<p>
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASED. The Federation Council on 25 December approved a
law passed by the Duma on 20 December to increase the monthly minimum
wage by 10% to 83,490 rubles (about $15), effective on 1 January, 1997,
Russian media reported. Duma deputies originally wanted to raise the
minimum wage by 25% but reduced the rate of increase to improve chances
for approval by the Council. The law, if signed by the president, would
require substantial additional budget spending, since many other wages
and social benefits are calculated as multiples of the minimum wage.
Also on 25 December, the Duma overrode a presidential veto and passed a
law raising the minimum pension from 69,500 rubles ($12.60) to 76,530
rubles ($13.90). That law has yet to be considered by the upper house
(see OMRI Daily Digest, 19 December 1996). -- Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
IMF TIGHTENS CONDITIONS. The IMF has apparently informed Russian
officials that for 1997 it will insist that the government include
federal wage and pension arrears and interest on government borrowing in
federal-deficit calculations, Segodnya reported on 28 December. That
will make it more difficult for the government to keep the deficit
within the agreed 3.85% limit, since those two items will widen the gap
by an estimated 18 trillion and 87 trillion rubles, respectively, in
1997. The IMF also said that payment of the delayed November and
December loan tranches, each $340 million, has been postponed until
February. On 24 December, however, the World Bank released the delayed
second half of its $500 million loan for coal-industry restructuring,
the first half of which was paid in June. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
GEORGIAN UPDATE. Georgian, Russian, and Abkhaz representatives met in
Sochi on 23-24 December to discuss the impasse over the 250,000 refugees
&gt;from Abkhazia living in Georgia, ITAR-TASS reported. Abkhazian Foreign
Minister Konstantin Ozgan said the return of the refugees could not be
discussed until the economic sanctions on Abkhazia enforced by Russia
had been lifted. Meanwhile, torrential rains and snowfalls in Georgia
destroyed 50 bridges and closed many roads, killing 10 people, ITAR-TASS
reported on 31 December. The Georgian Military Highway which leads to
North Ossetiya has been blocked since 25 December. Three hundred people
were trapped in the Rotskii tunnel, among whom two premature babies were
born. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
ARMENIAN PRIME MINISTER ON RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. Armen Sarkisyan said
he agreed with Russian officials in Moscow on 28 December on the
construction of a pipeline to run from Russia to Turkey via Armenia,
ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL reported on 30 December. Sarkisyan described the
move as "politically important." He added that Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin described the current state of Armenian-Russian ties
as "unsatisfactory for the strategic partners in the region." The two
leaders agreed to restore the railway connection (which has been broken
off since 1992 as a result of the Azerbaijani blockade and the war in
Abkhazia) between Armenia and Russia. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
ANOTHER FRENCH COMPANY TO PARTICIPATE IN AZERBAIJANI OIL CONTRACT. The
French oil company Total will participate in an international
consortium, led by the French group Elf, to develop the Lenkoran Deniz
and Talish Deniz shelf deposits in the southern part of Azerbaijan's
sector of the Caspian Sea, AFP reported on 27 December, citing Interfax.
A representative of the Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR, which has a
25% stake in the project, said that the German Denimex firm and the U.S.
Mobil group are also likely to get involved in the $2 billion deal. The
project is the latest in a series of multibillion-dollar oil contracts
that Azerbaijan has signed with the world's leading oil companies in
recent years. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
RUSSIAN ACTIVIST IN KAZAKSTAN RECEIVES SUSPENDED SENTENCE. The Medeo
regional court gave Nina Sidorova, the former leader of Kazakstan's
Russian Center, a suspended sentence of two years in prison, RFE/RL
reported on 25 December. Sidorova was found guilty of insulting and
physically harming law enforcement officers while they were performing
their duties and insulting the court. The Russian press has been highly
critical of the court proceedings, arguing that they were biased against
Sidorova because she is Russian. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
UZBEK PARLIAMENT ADOPTS 1997 BUDGET. The Uzbek parliament on 27 December
approved the state budget for 1997, according to ITAR-TASS. The budget
deficit for 1997 is set at 26.8 billion som ($515 million), or 3% of
GDP. Revenue will be 124 billion som and expenditure 150 billion. Uzbek
President Islam Karimov claims annual inflation will drop from 60% in
1996 to below 27% in 1997. At a conference of journalists and diplomats
in Tashkent on 27 December, Karimov observed that industrial output had
risen by 6% while foreign trade turnover was at $8.3 billion, an
increase of 40% from 1995. Uzbekistan turned out 60 metric tons of gold
in 1996 and its gold and hard currency reserves grew to $1.5 billion. He
also said about 47% of budget revenue in 1996 went to social programs
and a mere 4.3% was spent on defense. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
TURKMENISTAN CUTS GAS DEALS WITH TURKEY, IRAN. The oil ministers of
Turkmenistan, Turkey, and Iran met in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on 29
December and agreed to a deal to bring Turkmen and Iranian gas to Europe
via Turkey, IRNA and Reuters reported. The new deal revives a 1995 plan
on a pipeline project that was scrapped due to financial problems and
U.S. pressure on Turkey aimed at dissuading it from dealing with Iran.
The first gas between Iran and Turkey is expected to flow in 1998. --

DUDAYEV AIDE MURDERED IN KYIV. Ruslan Badayev, an aide to the late
Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, has been stabbed to death in Kyiv, AFP
reported on 28 December. His assailant has been arrested, but no details
have been disclosed about the motive for the murder, except that it
appeared to be "a settling of accounts." NTV reported that Badayev had
not been involved in politics in recent months and that the murder
seemed to have been connected with his personal business dealings. --

FEDERAL YUGOSLAV ARMY REJECTS POLITICAL ROLE. Chief-of-Staff Gen.
Momcilo Perisic, attending a New Year's reception on 30 December,
repeated his earlier position that the army will ensure the "stability"
of the country, but he gave no details. He also issued a statement
saying that "the chief-of-staff and the army as a whole are unanimous
about fulfilling to the letter their set tasks. Any other interpretation
of the army's role does not reflect its official position,"
international media reported. The remarks are in response to a reported
declaration by some officers or units in support of the anti-government
demonstrators (see OMRI Daily Digest, 30 December 1996). Perisic did
not, however, express backing for President Slobodan Milosevic, who
relies on his 120,000-strong police force rather than on the army for
support. It is unclear if Milosevic can count on the military to help
enforce a state of emergency, which the opposition says he plans to
declare. The army helped crush protests in 1991. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
DRASKOVIC CALLS ON MONTE-NEGRO TO TAKE ACTION. The Montenegrin
parliament passed a resolution expressing concern over continuing
tensions in Serbia, AFP reported on 30 December. The text is weaker than
an original opposition proposal but nonetheless reflects Montenegro's
interest in seeing the full return of federal Yugoslavia to
international political and economic life. The small republic relies
heavily on shipping and tourism. Serbian opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic, however, called on Montenegro to go beyond words: "We don't
care about your telegrams and letters. If you want to help us, withdraw
your deputies from the Yugoslav parliament until the recognition of the
results of the November 17 municipal elections, withdraw your
representatives from the Yugoslav government, show that you are for a
democratic Serbia." Meanwhile, riot police in Belgrade confined "several
thousand" protesters in bitter cold weather to the central pedestrian
zone, Nasa Borba reported on 31 December. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
EU ADMINISTRATION OF MOSTAR ENDS. The European Union's mandate in Mostar
expires today, but the city is as divided now as it was 17 months ago,
when the EU arrived there, AFP reports. Mostar remains split between
Muslims in the eastern half and Croats in the western half. EU spokesman
Dragan Gasic, striking an optimistic note, said that a lot has been done
toward reconstruction and that peace has been politically restored in
Mostar. Croats, however, have continued throughout 1996 to expel Muslims
&gt;from their part of the city. Mostar Mayor Ivan Prskalo, a Croat,
criticized Muslim "terrorist acts" following an incident on 29 December
in which two Croats were robbed, stripped naked, and beaten up in the
Muslim half of the city. The EU administration in Mostar will be
replaced by the Office of the High Representative Carl Bildt. Former EU
envoy Sir Martin Garrod will stay on in Mostar to head the mission. --

<p>
BOSNIA'S NEW CENTRAL GOVERNMENT NAMED. Bosnia's three-man presidency on
30 December agreed that the first session of parliament will take place
on 3 January, international media reported. This will be the first
peace-time session of the Bosnian parliament, which has not convened
earlier because of maneuvering and stalling by former, mainly Serbian
rivals. The parliament is expected to confirm the presidency's
nominations for the central government--which consists of the foreign
affairs, foreign trade, and communication portfolios. One post each has
been given to Bosnia's Muslim, Croatian, and Serbian communities.
Meanwhile, joint Bosnian premiers Haris Silajdzic and Boro Bosic have
sealed a power-sharing agreement and agreed on the lineup of the
cabinet. Silajdzic and Bosic are to rotate the chairmanship of the
Council of Ministers on a weekly basis, AFP reported on 30 December. --

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<p>
IRAN NEWS NATIONAL DESK TEHRAN - President Hojjatoleslam<br>
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Wednesday congratulated world Christians<br>
and especially Iran's Christian community on Christmas. President<br>
Rafsanjani, in his message, hoped that Christians, all over the world would<br>
collaborate with followers of other religions and "breathe a new life into the<br>
body of the Christian communities and open a new chapter for the Christian<br>
world". He also said that he considered a good sign this year the falling of<br>
the Christmas Eve on the birthday anniversary of Hazrat Mahdi (A.S.) the<br>
Twelfth Imam (now in occultation) of the Prophet of Islam Mohammad's<br>
(S) infallible Household which was celebrated Thursday, IRNA reported. <br>

# Habibi Meets Armenian Craftsmen, Traders, Industrialists<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<p>
BY OUR CORRESPONDENT YEREVAN, ARMENIA - Iran's First<br>
Vice-President Hassan Habibi met and conferred with a number of<br>
Armenian industrialists, traders and craftsmen here on Thursday. <br>
Habibi told the Armenians that the fledgling cooperation between <br>
Iran and Armenia stemmed from traditional, historical and cultural<br>
ties of the two countries. He said that the volume of technical and<br>
industrial cooperation between the two countries, especially within <br>
the framework of Tehran-Yerevan Joint Economic Commission, <br>
was favorably growing. He added that Iran was ready to offer<br>
technical and industrial know-how to Armenian craftsmen in<br>
any area that they might be interested. He referred to the Iranian <br>
and Armenian legislation bodies' support for conclusion of bilateral<br>
industrial,trade and economic agreements. Habibi hoped that the<br>
two countries would be capable of taking steps in order to expand<br>
bilateral relations and cooperation by utilizing such a "strong <br>
backbone." Habibi said that solving banking and customs problems <br>
faced by the two parties would pave the ground for an increase in <br>
the volume of mutual transactions. He added that preparing the <br>
ground for joint investments and activating each other's private <br>
sectors could be effective in realizing such an important goal.<br>
Meanwhile, the head of Armenian Craftsmen and Producers'<br>
Association said that members of the association would visit <br>
Iran in future to explore ways of expanding mutual technical <br>
and industrial cooperation. Habibi also inspected the<br>
Armenian tire manufacturing and chemical plant in the suburbs<br>
of Yerevan on Thursday. The Iranian first-vice president arrived <br>
here on Wednesday heading a high-ranking politico-economic<br>
delegation. <br>

# Habibi Inaugurates Iranology Center in Yerevan<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
BY PARISA ALINIA YEREVAN, ARMENIA - Iran's First Vice <br>
President Hassan Habibi on Thursday inaugurated the Iranology<br>
Center of Caucasia.<br>
He also addressed a two-day seminar on Iranology in the Caucasus.<br>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran supports the scientific and research <br>
activities carried out by the center and by those professors and <br>
scholars who are conducting research studies on issues related<br>
to Iran," he said in his inaugural address.<br>
"From the sociological point of view, the main problem with<br>
contemporary Iranology in Europe stems from the fact that it looks<br>
 at phenomena from outside rather than from within." The first vice <br>
president said the study of the Persian language would serve as <br>
an important and fundamental factor in Iranology debates and studies. <br>
He said the Persian language has been used either as a native <br>
and main language or it has been the language of science, <br>
literature and culture throughout the history after Islam not only <br>
in Iran but also in Central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkey, part of<br>
Eastern Europe, the Indian Subcontinent, Mesopotamia and <br>
even in the Far East. <br>
 "Throughout its majestic and great history, Iran has followed<br>
humanitarian culture, love and kindness," Professor Garnic Asatourian,<br>
head of the center and head of the Iranology Department at the Oriental<br>
Institute of Armenian Science Academy said at the ceremony.<br>
 The Armenian minister of culture on his part said at the ceremony that <br>
the Persian language and literature has played a significant role in the <br>
establishment and evolution of human civilization. <br>
"Armenia is for expansion of its cooperation with Iran in the fields of<br>
culture and arts," he stressed. <br>

Senate Candidate Meets With Armenian American Leaders<br>
<p>
ANC Representatives and Gov. Bayh Discuss a Broad Range of Issues<br>
<p>
<p>
New York, NY  -  Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, a leading candidate for <br>
the U.S. Senate in 1998, held talks recently with representatives of <br>
the Armenian American community.  The meeting, which took place in the <br>
New York offices of Corum Capital, was attended by one of the firm's <br>
principals, Robert Setrakian, as well as by Harry Derderian, the <br>
Chairman of the Armenian National Committee Eastern Region (ANC-ER).<br>
<p>
Ranked by TIME magazine as one of America's most promising leaders <br>
under the age of 40, Evan Bayh is currently the leading Democrat <br>
candidate to replace retiring Senator Dan Coats (R-IN).  During the <br>
meeting, which lasted more than an hour and a half, a range of <br>
issues were discussed, including increased aid to Armenia, <br>
self-determination for Nagorno Karabagh, the commemoration of the <br>
Armenian Genocide, and the lifting of the Turkish blockade.  The <br>
participants shared memories of the principled stand taken by Gov. <br>
Bayh's father, Indiana's senior Senator Birch Bayh, during the <br>
mid-1960s, in defense of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide.<br>
<p>
"Long ago, before our community was fully mobilized on the issue of the <br>
Armenian Genocide, a lone Senator from the state of Indiana raised his <br>
voice in defense of the 1.5 million Armenians murdered earlier in this <br>
century," remarked Derderian after the meeting.  "His was not an act of <br>
political expediency -- there was no sizable Armenian community in <br>
Indiana.  His motivation was based on the historical record, because he <br>
knew the difference between right and wrong, just and unjust.  His son <br>
Evan knows our history and he appreciates the Armenian experience.  He <br>
understands where our people have been and knows where we plan to go," <br>
Derderian concluded.<br>
<p>
A special feature article in The Wall Street Journal on December 20th <br>
highlighted Evan Bayh's race for the United States Senate and <br>
identified him as the clear front-runner.  As evidence of his <br>
popularity, the article noted that Bayh was re-elected in 1992 by the <br>
largest margin in modern Indiana gubernatorial history.<br>
<p>
The Armenian National Committee of the Eastern United States is a grass <br>
roots public-affairs organization that has worked for decades with <br>
public officials to voice the deep and abiding concerns of the Armenian <br>
American community.  The ANC-ER is part of a larger network of ANC <br>
offices and local chapters throughout the United States and affiliates <br>
around the world.<br>

Armenia: World Bank Loan To Build Market Institutions, Credit <br>
<p>
By Robert Lyle<br>
<p>
Washington, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - The World Bank's International<br>
Development Association (IDA)<br>
has approved a long-term, no-interest loan to help Armenia build<br>
market-based institutions and provide lines<br>
of credit to private enterprises. <br>
<p>
The loan, of around $16.8 million, will fill just over 40 percent of<br>
the costs to create a Private Investment<br>
Finance Corporation of Armenia to promote enterprise development. It<br>
will also provide training and technical<br>
services to banks, other financial institutions and a series of<br>
Armenian funds and agencies implementing<br>
economic reforms. <br>
<p>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Germany's<br>
Kreditanstalt fuer<br>
Wiederaufbau, and private investors are expected to provide another<br>
$14 million for the project with<br>
additional co-financing to come from the U.S. Agency for International<br>
Development (USAID) and others. <br>
<p>
The overall Enterprise Development Project, according to the World<br>
Bank, aims to increase the<br>
creditworthiness of Armenian companies through improved planning and<br>
development of export links and<br>
joint venture deals to enhance investment, trade, and technology. <br>
<p>
The bank says it also aims to strengthen the lending capacity of the<br>
banking system, especially for<br>
export-oriented projects. <br>
<p>
The IDA loan charges only a small annual fee and runs for 35 years<br>
with no repayment required for the first<br>
ten years. <br>

Armenia: President Signs Memo Of Understanding With Iran<br>
<p>
By Hrair Tamrazian<br>
<p>
Yerevan, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) -- Our correspondent in Yerevan<br>
reports that Iranian Vice President<br>
Hassan Habibi and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian on Saturday<br>
signed a memorandum of<br>
understanding between the two countries. The signing ceremony took<br>
place in the presidential palace in the<br>
Armenian capital. <br>
<p>
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Ter-Petrossian called<br>
Habibi's visit a turning point in relations<br>
between the two nations. He said Iran is a stabilizing factor in the<br>
region and praised Tehran for its balanced<br>
role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. He also said Prime Minister<br>
Armen Sarkissian will visit Iran early next<br>
year. <br>
<p>
In addition to the memorandum of understanding, the leaders also<br>
signed several documents covering<br>
economic cooperation, trade, customs, transportation and<br>
communications. Habibi said one of the joint<br>
agreements signed focuses on finding financing for an Iran-Armenia gas<br>
pipeline project. <br>
<p>
Habibi -- who addressed the Armenian Parliament on Thursday -- is the<br>
highest-ranking Iranian official to visit<br>
Armenia since it gained independence five years ago. <br>

Armenia: Prime Minister Divulges Details Of Chernomyrdin Talks<br>
<p>
By Hrair Tamrazian<br>
<p>
Yerevan, 30 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - Armenia's newly-appointed Prime<br>
Minister, Armen Sarkissian, has<br>
disclosed details of his meeting in Moscow last week with Russian<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,<br>
including plans to restore rail links between the two countries. <br>
<p>
Sarkissian told reporters in Yerevan today that he and Russian leaders<br>
agreed that a new gas pipeline from<br>
Russia to Turkey should pass trough Armenian territory. He says he<br>
reached an agreement with Russian<br>
leaders to restore the railway connecting Russia and Armenia via<br>
Georgia and its separatist region of<br>
Abkhazia. <br>
<p>
Sarkissian quotes Russian officials as saying that if the Abkhaz<br>
conflict bars restoration of the old railway line a<br>
new line would be built further to the east, bypassing Abkhazia. <br>
<p>
Before returning to Yerevan, Sarkissian gave an exclusive interview to<br>
our correspondent in Moscow in which<br>
he stressed the importance of strengthening economic ties between<br>
Moscow and Yerevan. <br>
<p>
Sarkissian told our correspondent that during his talks with Russian<br>
officials the two sides agreed to increase<br>
Russian investments in Armenia's economy. Sarkissian says maintaining<br>
a strong relationship with Russia is<br>
strategically important for Armenia. <br>

                Armenia to Keep Nogorno-Karabakh Region Peaceful<br>
 <br>
COMTEX NewswireSaturday, December 28, 1996 10:23:00 PM<br>
 <br>
 MOSCOW (Dec. 28) XINHUA - Armenian President Levon Ter-Peterosyan <br>
said his country should do its best to keep the Nogorno-Karabakh region <br>
peaceful and stable, Itar-Tass news agency reported today. <br>
   Ter-Peterosyan made the remarks at a joint press conference held with <br>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Ebrahim Habibi. <br>
   Azerbaijan and Armenia reached a ceasefire agreement in May, 1994 after <br>
six years of war triggered by the announcement of independence of the <br>
Nogorno-Karabakh region, whose population is mainly Armenian ethnics. <br>
   Habibi said that he hopes the Caucasian Region will keep stable and <br>
peaceful to benefit the development of economies of the countries <br>
there. <br>
   Habibi arrived in Yerevan, capital of Armenia, on December 25 for his <br>
four-day visit to Armenia. <br>
   During his visit, the two countries signed a mutual understanding <br>
memorandum, and agreements of cooperation on energy, industry, <br>
communication and trade. <br>
   Habibi will visit Tajikistan on December 29 after ending his trip to <br>
Armenia.  Enditem <br>

                  Wind of gale force damages Armenian regions.<br>
 <br>
COMTEX NewswireSunday, December 29, 1996 11:12:00 AM<br>
 <br>
 <br>
         YEREVAN, December 29 (Itar-Tass) -  Wind of gale force and scattered <br>
rains make weather in Yerevan this Christmas. <br>
   Part of the Armenian capital does not have electricity, several <br>
apartment houses are ruined, roofs of hospitals and a kindergarten are <br>
torn off and some monuments are damaged. Fires broke out in four <br>
boroughs of Yerevan and several settlements nearby. Telephone <br>
communication with adjoining settlements is broken. According to <br>
preliminary reports of the Kapan mayor's office, the damage of local <br>
houses is estimated at 16 million Armenian drams (about 40,000 <br>
dollars). <br>
   Electricity supply to Alaverdi, Stepanavan and about 30 populated <br>
localities is broken. Hundreds of power line poles are damaged in <br>
Stepanavan alone. Roofs are torn off, trees are fallen by the wind. <br>
   Measures are being taken to repair the damage, reports the Armenian <br>
governmental press service. There is no loss of life. <br>

Armenia home to 300,000 refugees<br>

SECOND OF A THREE-PART SERIES<br>
<p>
YEREVAN, Armenia - Maria Avakian is a senior citizen. She lives on a pension of<br>
$8 a month. She can't buy much more than bread, but she's luckier than most<br>
Armenian refugees. <br>
<p>
She has her own house. <br>
<p>
Avakian just moved into a cinder-block cottage, one of 70 built this year for<br>
refugees of Nagorno-Karabakh's war of independence from Azerbaijan. The cottages<br>
are a product of German foreign aid; 70 more are planned for 1997. <br>
<p>
Many more are needed.<br>
<p>
Armenia has 300,000 refugees.<br>
<p>
Avakian's cottage has one room. There is no running water. Her husband has taken<br>
the bucket and gone for his daily walk to a tap a kilometre away. But at least<br>
it's a place they can call home.<br>
<p>
The Avakians had a house once before, on a plot of land with apple and lemon<br>
trees in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. They were forced to flee in 1988, when<br>
radical Azeris went on a rampage, killing 68 Armenians; it was the third such<br>
riot in Azerbaijan that year, following Nagorno-Karabakh's declaration of intent<br>
to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia.<br>
<p>
The war is quiet now, but scars remain. <br>
<p>
"The Azeris beat my neighbors and cut them with knives," says Maria Avakian. She<br>
draws a finger, not across but up the length of her wrist; it leaves a white<br>
mark on her skin. Then she offers her visitors glasses of sweet tea; she has<br>
little else but tea.<br>
<p>
<p>
And the view from her front porch - this is, after all, the high Caucasus - a<br>
thin, blue sky with white clouds; those colors, repeated in the mountains rising<br>
in the distance.<br>
<p>
Raya Pogosova doesn't have the luxury of the long view. She is a social worker<br>
who works with refugees, and a refugee herself. Her own grandparents were killed<br>
in front of her in Baku.<br>
<p>
She shrugs as if that's normal and leads me next to a complex of mobile homes,<br>
set up for the Armenians who fled the village of Getashen, Azerbaijan. They live<br>
now in a cluster of mobile homes known as Getashen Camp. <br>
<p>
The mobile homes are Russian-made, rusty and leaky, more like tin cans tipped on<br>
their sides, outfitted with woodstoves and windows. <br>
<p>
Siran Baghramian, 66, was roughed up and deported from Getashen in 1988. Her<br>
husband, Shaliko Maroutian, was a foreman on a collective farm; he had a price<br>
on his head. He escaped on foot and walked for a week through the mountains at<br>
night until he reached safety.<br>
<p>
Today they own a few pots, a few dishes, the clothes on their backs. They do<br>
what they can to eke out their pensions. They keep a few chickens for eggs.<br>
Shaliko dug a garden in the yellow dirt outside their front door.<br>
<p>
Like other refugees, they are allowed 100 litres of kerosene each winter for<br>
heat, but they have to borrow the money to buy it, and most of the heat goes out<br>
the window; the trailer is poorly insulated. How cold does it get? "If you would<br>
spend a night here, you would know," says Siran, sharply. <br>
<p>
What can you tell me about Getashen? Siran begins to cry. She says, "Why do you<br>
have to remind me of that?" Shaliko comforts her.<br>
<p>
The government of Armenia can't provide much comfort for its war refugees; it<br>
wasn't able to cope after the earthquake of 1988, when the disaster made half a<br>
million people homeless.<br>
<p>
The country's a mess, badly polluted and falling apart from years of Soviet<br>
neglect. Its industries are out of date, it has few natural resources.<br>
<p>
Six hundred thousand citizens have left Armenia in the past five years, fed up<br>
with the lack of work, exhausted by the cost of Armenia's continuing support for<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh, weary of the hardships of a Turkish-Azerbaijani blockade.<br>
<p>
Of the 3.5 million Armenians who remain, roughly one in nine is a refugee.<br>
Unemployment is high. The average wage is a bit less than $60 a month; this in a<br>
country where a day's worth of bread is 35c, a kilo of apples costs $4.50, and<br>
gasoline costs what it does in Montreal.<br>
<p>
Armenia has electricity - the nuclear reactor knocked out by the earthquake is<br>
back on line - but few people can afford to pay for power, and there are still<br>
frequent brownouts. <br>
<p>
Yerevan looks dark and grim at night; there are no neon signs. That's not to say<br>
there is no night life. One evening, I watched half a dozen toughs in a downtown<br>
restaurant laughing loudly, locking arms and spending more on one round of<br>
drinks than Maria Avakian spends in a month on bread. <br>
<p>
The young men were muscle for hire. <br>
<p>
They rotated deferentially around their leader, a hard case in a tailored suit<br>
and a freshly laundered shirt. He wore jewelled rings on his hands, and a fat<br>
gold chain around his neck. <br>
<p>
The hired muscle froze when their boss took a moment to fix the foreigner with a<br>
stare so quiet and cold it silenced the room.<br>
<p>
"Who's the guy in the blue suit?" I asked my companions when we'd left and I<br>
felt safe. "Don't worry about him," they said. "We had guys like him under<br>
Stalin. We took care of them before, we'll take care of them again."<br>
<p>
They didn't sound certain.<br>
<p>
The road to capitalism and democracy, like every other road in this country, is<br>
a bumpy ride; last September's election in Armenia was rigged.<br>
<p>
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, expressed deep concern<br>
over the results, and called for a full-scale assessment. The government of<br>
Armenia replied that it was open to working toward democratization. <br>
<p>
Translation? Canada: You can't do that. Armenia: Don't call us, we'll call you.<br>
It may be too late for any calls.<br>
<p>
Vazken Manougian, the man some claim is the country's rightful president, was<br>
forced into hiding after the election. While underground, he received word that<br>
if he'd agree to permanent exile, 20 members of an outlawed faction of his party<br>
would be freed from jail. <br>
<p>
Manougian refused. <br>
<p>
He emerged after five days of seclusion, confident that the world was watching.<br>
The world is not watching very hard; three of those jailed were recently<br>
condemned to death for alleged terrorist activity. <br>
<p>
Those sentences are being appealed. No one has been put to death in Armenia in<br>
the last five years. It could be worse. At least there are courts in which to<br>
launch appeals.<br>
<p>
According to Manougian, Armenia has fallen into the hands of three clans, a kind<br>
of post-Soviet Mafia with a structure based on kinship, muscle and threats<br>
passed along by thugs in blue suits.<br>
<p>
The clans are reputed to have direct connections to the banks and the copper<br>
industry; clans control small and medium business, and have purchased privatized<br>
industries at bargain-basement prices.<br>
<p>
There is a street in downtown Yerevan where old women sell paper cones of<br>
walnuts and pumpkin seeds to earn the equivalent of a few pennies, a primitive<br>
capitalism illegal under communism. <br>
<p>
Thugs in blue suits profit from the sale of nuts and seeds.<br>
<p>
Economic relations with Canada are minimal; bilateral trade between Canada and<br>
Armenia amounts to less than $1 million a year. According to sources at the<br>
Armenian embassy in Ottawa, "We have very little to offer you, and we cannot<br>
afford to buy Canadian goods, which are expensive." <br>
<p>
As a result, Ottawa has little clout in this part of the world. There are only<br>
80,000 Armenians in Canada, nearly half of them in Montreal.<br>
<p>
Although Canada contributes nearly $10 million in developmental and aid money to<br>
Armenia, that's a negligible amount given the scope of the problems. <br>
<p>
And the emergence of the clans in Armenia may be the major reason why it's<br>
difficult to rebuild the country with investment money from abroad: diaspora<br>
Armenians are reluctant to underwrite musclemen and profiteers.<br>
<p>
It's not that there isn't money available. <br>
<p>
Armenians have typically done well for themselves abroad. Armenians in the<br>
United States donated $11 million to rebuild the road from Armenia to<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians in Montreal and Toronto are paying for a $1-million<br>
waterline to supply Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert.<br>
<p>
Kevork Tscharshafdjian, a Toronto businessman who lives half the year in<br>
Yerevan, estimates that as much as $50 million a month comes into Armenia, most<br>
of it in the form of direct donations to families from overseas relatives.<br>
<p>
That figure may be high, but there's no way of knowing for sure. The government<br>
can barely keep track of the number of people who live in Armenia, let alone how<br>
much they receive in the form of private donations.<br>
<p>
If thugs like the man in the blue suit dream of carving up the country, if<br>
refugees like Siran Baghramian dream of a warm bath, and if immigrants dream of<br>
returning home, then the citizens of Armenia dream of an end to the blockade.<br>
<p>
And the resumption of what Hrant Khatchaturian says is Armenia's traditional<br>
role in the region. Khatchaturian, a leading member of Armenia's Union of<br>
Constitutional Rights, says his country should be "an east-west link in the<br>
Caucasus between Turkey and Azerbaijan, and a north-south link between Georgia<br>
and Iran."<br>
<p>
Armenia may be a broker, but Azerbaijan has all the wealth; enormous off-shore<br>
reserves, estimated at more than a billion barrels of oil, and 65 billion cubic<br>
yards of gas, lie offshore in the Caspian Sea.<br>
<p>
Two development deals, worth a total of $3.5 billion U.S., were signed last<br>
month. "Sometimes I think the region would be better off without oil, which is<br>
the source of many conflicts," says member of parliament Rupig Hagopian. <br>
<p>
"The political equation here will change because of oil."<br>
<p>
These latest deals will certainly increase Azerbaijan's political and diplomatic<br>
weight and its military capability, if it so chooses; bad news for the economic<br>
recovery of Armenia, and bad news for the sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
<p>
"That's why international recognition is necessary for us," says Dr. Zori<br>
Balayan, a representative of the government of Nagorno-Karabakh. Now based in<br>
Yerevan, Balayan is one of the original leaders of the Karabakh Movement for<br>
independence, which ignited this region eight years ago. <br>
<p>
Balayan knows he bears a heavy burden, but "diplomatic recognition is our<br>
guarantee of peace." Unfortunately for him, Armenia's current political troubles<br>
are hindering his cause. <br>
<p>
There is a small Canadian irony hidden in the troubles here. While would-be<br>
president Manougian was holed up underground in the aftermath of the election,<br>
his office was sealed and his files removed. <br>
<p>
Hanging on his office wall was a framed copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights<br>
and Freedoms; the charter disappeared along with the files. <br>
<p>
Manougian was eventually allowed to return to his office. He found everything<br>
had been put back. Everything, that is, except the charter. He smiles. "Human<br>
rights are a dangerous thing here." <br>
<p>
At the end of the day, social worker Raya Pogosova attends to the human rights<br>
of two more refugees: Svetlana Perieva and her daughter Gaya share one small<br>
room, barely big enough for two cots, a cupboard and a refrigerator. <br>
<p>
Gaya, 19, has dark hair, big eyes and psychological problems; she and her mother<br>
were beaten before they were deported from Azerbaijan. Gaya smiles readily, but<br>
she is restless and has difficulty looking anyone in the eye. <br>
<p>
Svetlana, 40, is a sewing-machine operator; there is no work for her. She and<br>
her daughter rarely go out. There is no danger of anyone coming to pound on<br>
their door in the middle of the night, and they have nothing of value to<br>
protect.<br>
<p>
But they are afraid to leave their room.<br>
<p>
TOMORROW: The bitter legacy of izgnaniya, the drive to hunt down and expel the<br>
Armenians from Azerbaijan and the parallel effort to rid Armenia of Azeris.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 246, Part I, 30 December 1996
<p>
NOTE: The OMRI Daily Digest was not published from 23 December to 27
December.
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN BACK IN THE KREMLIN. President Boris Yeltsin described himself
as "ready for battle" as he returned to work in the Kremlin on 23
December, seven weeks after his 5 November bypass operation, Russian and
Western media reported. Heart problems had kept him away from the office
for nearly six months. However, Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov
doubted Yeltsin's stamina to withstand a heavy workload, saying Russia's
current condition demanded a president who can work "at least 15 hours a
day." Speaking to Ekho Moskvy on 22 December, Aleksandr Lebed described
Yeltsin as a "sick man" who was incapable of governing and should step
down for the good of the country. On 27 December, Presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembskii said Yeltsin has been working six to eight hours
per day since his return. -- Laura Belin
<p>
LAST RUSSIAN TROOPS LEAVE CHECHNYA. The last Russian combat troops from
the 205th Motorized Rifle Brigade left Chechnya on 29 December, ahead of
the scheduled 27 January departure date set by President Yeltsin earlier
this month, ITAR-TASS and Reuters reported. A small number of logistical
personnel remain in the republic, and Russian commander Maj.-Gen.
Vladimir Sukhoruchenkov said on 28 December that they will withdraw by
22 January, AFP reported.  The departing troops of the 101st brigade are
being housed in unheated barracks and tents near Stavropol, according to
a 29 December NTV report, and are reduced to begging for food from local
residents. On 28 December the Duma passed a resolution condemning the
troop withdrawal as "rash and unthoughtful," arguing that some 1,000
Russian servicemen are still missing in the republic, many of them
thought to be held captive. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
DUMA APPROVES BUDGET . . . The State Duma on 28 December voted in favor
of approving the government's 1997 budget on third reading by 243 votes
to 117, AFP reported. Of the organized factions, only the Liberal
Democratic Party voted against. Those who voted in favor were less than
enthusiastic: Duma Speaker Gennadii Seleznev said "it may be the worst
budget ever," ITAR-TASS reported. The budget, which was approved on
first reading on 15 December, will face a fourth reading in January to
clear up various technical changes. ITAR-TASS reported on 27 December
that federal taxation will raise 25 trillion rubles in December, up from
20 trillion in November. Federal tax collection in 1996 will total 198
trillion rubles, which is only 80% of the target level. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
. . . INTRODUCES NEW TAXES. The Duma on 27 December approved the
introduction of a 0.5% tax on purchases of foreign currency, ITAR-TASS
reported. Russian banks sold 195 trillion rubles worth of foreign
currency in January-October 1996, and the new tax is expected to raise
2.3 trillion rubles ($400 million) in 1997. Critics suggested that the
tax is too low to encourage people to hold their savings in rubles;
others suggested it may encourage black-market operations. The Duma also
introduced a new 20% tax on the interest on ruble bank deposits (15% on
foreign-currency accounts) but only if the interest exceeds the Central
Bank's refinancing rate. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
LEBED ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR NEW PARTY. At a 27 December conference of his
Honor and Motherland movement, Aleksandr Lebed announced that he will
found a Russian People's Republican Party early next year, Russian media
reported. Lebed said his new party would be a "third force" for those
dissatisfied with both the current authorities and the Communists; he
added that there were plenty of bankers and industrial groups willing to
finance his efforts. Party of Workers' Self-Government leader Svyatoslav
Fedorov attended the conference and is likely to join Lebed's new party.
-- Laura Belin
<p>
CHINESE PREMIER IN MOSCOW. Li Peng met President Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during his 26-28 December official visit,
international agencies reported. Yeltsin said he was "very pleased" with
the current state of bilateral ties, and he and Li Peng confirmed that
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow in April. The two
countries issued a joint communique hailing the "huge potential" of
bilateral cooperation and pledging to build an "equal and reliable
partnership." Several bilateral agreements were also signed, covering
nuclear-power-plant construction, central-bank cooperation, and
finalizing the sale of SU-27 fighters and related production technology
to China. Segodnya on 28 December noted that warming Russian-Chinese
ties were intended as Moscow's "answer to the United States" in response
to such Western policies as NATO enlargement. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
PRIMAKOV IN TEHRAN. Russian Foreign Minister Yevgenii Primakov met with
his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, and Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani during his two-day visit to Tehran on 22-23 December,
international agencies reported. After signing a memorandum of
understanding on nuclear export control with Velayati, Primakov said the
two countries adhere to "internationally accepted norms," and that "no
one can condemn" their cooperation in this area, which includes plans to
finish an incomplete nuclear power station at Bushehr in southern Iran.
The U.S., citing proliferation concerns, has vehemently opposed the
project. The two foreign ministers condemned the Afghan Taliban
movement's "violations of human rights," while Primakov hailed Iran's
role in pushing for a negotiated settlement in Tajikistan. Primakov also
said that "foreign military" deployments in the Persian Gulf undermine
regional stability. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
RODIONOV: U.S. DRIVE FOR HEGEMONY THREATENS RUSSIA. Addressing a Moscow
conference on CIS military cooperation on 25 December, Russian Defense
Minster Igor Rodionov said that Washington's efforts to "make its world
leadership complete" by relying on an expanded NATO may become a
"military threat" to Russia and other CIS states, Russian and Western
agencies reported. Rodionov added that Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Japan,
China, and other unnamed Asian countries also pose potential military
threats. He urged the formation of joint CIS military forces and the
bolstering of Russian strategic nuclear forces in response. The Russian
Foreign Ministry quickly moved to downplay Rodionov's remarks, labeling
his list of potential adversaries "purely hypothetical." Rodionov's
speech contradicts Moscow's ongoing efforts to build close ties with
Iran and China. Kommersant-daily on 26 December described it as a crude
attempt to frighten other CIS states into closer military cooperation
with Moscow. -- Scott Parrish
<p>
TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA
<p>
HIGH-RANKING IRANIAN DELEGATION IN ARMENIA. An Iranian delegation headed
by First Vice-President Hasan Habibi concluded a four-day visit to
Armenia on 28 December, Noyan Tapan reported. The two sides pledged to
boost bilateral cooperation in  communications, energy and industry.
Habibi, the highest-ranking Iranian official to visit Armenia since
1991, said the current state of Armenian-Iranian relationships is "at
the desired level," ITAR-TASS reported. Armenian President Levon Ter-
Petrossyan described Iran's policy in the Transcaucasus as "balanced"
and a "stability factor" in the region. According to Prime-Minister
Armen Sarkisyan, the two countries have "great" potential for further
cooperation. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
KYRGYZ PRESIDENT IN UZBEKISTAN. Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev met his
Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, during a 24-25 December visit to
Tashkent, ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL reported. The two presidents signed a
free trade agreement and discussed the construction of a rail line that
would link Uzbekistan to China via Kyrgyzstan. Uzbekistan agreed to
provide Kyrgyzstan with natural gas at a preferred rate and Kyrgyzstan
will reciprocate by delivering electricity from the Naryn hydro-electric
complex. Presidential spokesman Kanybek Imanaliyev noted that bilateral
trade has increased four times to reach $200 million. At Karimov's
request, the two leaders signed a treaty that included a reference to
the "eternal friendship" between the neighboring states. -- Bruce
Pannier and Naryn Idinov
<p>
NEW TAJIK AGREEMENT FOR PEACE. Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and
United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri signed an agreement in
Moscow on 23 December, international media reported. The agreement
provides for a general amnesty, an exchange of all prisoners, and a
promise by both sides to create the necessary conditions for the return
of Tajik refugees. Most importantly, the agreement establishes a
reconciliation council to be headed by an opposition representative. The
council will spend 12-18 months reviewing proposed amendments to the
Tajik Constitution. -- Bruce Pannier
<p>
UN WORKERS TAKEN HOSTAGE IN TAJIKISTAN. A group led by Rezvon Sadirov
freed sixteen hostages within 24 hours of taking them after their
demands were met on 21 December, Western and Russian press reported.
Sadirov had threatened to kill the hostages, including seven UN
observers, unless his brother and others held by the opposition were
released. He also claimed his group had planted 30 bombs in Dushanbe,
the capital, and would explode them if his demands were not met.
Sadirov, a former defense minister for the Tajik opposition, was demoted
in 1995 and joined government forces last month. -- Bruce Pannier

CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
<p>
NEWS FROM BELARUS. The opposition parliament has set up a shadow cabinet
and appointed its deputy speaker, Henadz Karpenka, as prime minister,
NTV reported on 28 December. It also appealed to the UN, the OSCE, and
the Council of Europe to support democratic forces in Belarus. The same
day, Radio Rossii reported that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has
denied planning to hold a referendum on unification with Russia and
suggesting that he be appointed leader of a unified state. He said the
idea was "absurd, legalistic nonsense." Meanwhile, chief military
prosecutor Maj.-Gen. Anatol Hlyukau has resigned from his post. The
official reason was that Hlyukau wanted to retire. But according to NTV,
the former prosecutor-general Vasil Kapitan had requested that Hlyukau
be allowed to continue in his post for another five years, which
suggests that Lukashenka declined to prolong Hlyukau's term in office.
Finally, Reuters reported that Belarus is seeking a $3.5-4 billion
investment to build its first nuclear power plant, which would ease its
dependence on energy from Russia. -- Ustina Markus
<p>
BLACK SEA FLEET UPDATE. The Russian Federation Council called on
President Boris Yeltsin on 26 December to impose a moratorium on any
agreements over the Black Sea Fleet until a special commission examines
the status of the main base, Sevastopol, NTV reported. The following
day, Moscow Mayor Yurii Lukhkov informed Ukraine's Foreign Ministry that
he intends to visit the city in January, despite the ministry's threats
to declare him persona non grata to prevent such a visit, Rossiskaya
gazeta reported. Luzhkov has repeatedly made clear that he backs Russian
claims to Sevastopol. Meanwhile, Zerkadlo nedeli reported that Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma has said he will never agree to hand Sevastopol
over to Russia. He added that if such a step were taken, he would no
longer be president and Ukraine would lose its independence.
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yas-trzembskii said on 27 December that
Yeltsin has not changed his position that "Sevastopol and Crimea are
part of Ukraine," RFE/RL reported. -- Ustina Markus

SERBIAN PROTESTS ENTER 43RD DAY. Marches and demonstrations are
continuing in up to 47 towns and cities across Serbia, while opposition
organizers announced plans for a gala open-air New Year's Eve party in
Belgrade, Nasa Borba reported on 30 December. Last week, a team of OSCE
representatives headed by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
backed the opposition's view that the governing Socialists stole the
local elections in Belgrade and 13 other places. Federal Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic called the OSCE statement "balanced"
but stressed it was not binding on the Serbian government, international
media noted. The opposition, however, demanded the authorities recognize
the report. On 28 December, thousands attended the funeral of Predrag
Starcevic, a teacher who on 24 December became the first fatality in the
ongoing confrontation in the Serbian capital. Opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic blamed the police for his death. And on 29 December, riot
police kept protesters inside Belgrade's Knez Mihailova pedestrian mall
and prevented them from marching. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
ARMY, MONTENEGRO PUT PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC. Opposition leaders issued a
statement on 29 December saying that Milosevic was trying to turn Serbia
into a prison and expressing their intention to defy him. They also
charged that he plans to declare a state of emergency, AFP reported. But
some army representatives and Montenegrin leaders are urging Milosevic
to reconsider his position. The Nis-based 63rd Parachute Brigade and
officers from other units issued an open letter to the Serbian president
and to army commander Gen. Momcilo Perisic expressing their support for
the students, Nasa Borba reported on 30 December. It is unclear,
however, how deep support for such views runs in the army. Meanwhile,
Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic called on Milosevic to explain his
position in public, Nasa Borba added. Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and
Parliament Speaker Svetozar Marovic, for their parts, have expressed
sympathy for the protesters, the Czech daily Mlada fronta dnes noted. --
Patrick Moore
<p>
BOSNIAN SERBS TO FORM PROFESSIONAL ARMY. The Bosnian Serb parliament on
28 December approved a bill on the creation of a professional army,
international agencies reported, citing Bosnian Serb radio. Under the
new law, "the professional armed forces are responsible for defending
the territorial integrity and constitutional order of the Republika
Srpska," AFP reported. There is also a clause--which is aimed at Serbs
in Serbia-Montenegro--stipulating that people without Bosnian Serb
citizenship can volunteer to join the army in case of conflict.
Meanwhile, a Bosnian Serb court on 24 December decided to proceed with
the in absentia trial of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, despite
international criticism. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
SERBS BESIEGE CROATS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA ATTENDING CHRISTMAS MASS. Some
50 Orthodox Serbs gathered outside a Roman Catholic church  in the town
of Ilok, in eastern Slavonia, during a Christmas Eve midnight mass,
international agencies reported. The Serbs were protesting the holding
of the service. About 200 Roman Catholic Croats who had been displaced
&gt;from the region during the 1991 Croatian-Serbian war were attending the
mass under UN escort. They were trapped inside the church for three
hours before the UN brought in military and civilian police
reinforcements. After the service the Serbs broke into the church and
vandalized the vestry. In neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croats in the
Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka went without their Christmas
midnight mass for the fifth consecutive year amid continuing security
fears, AFP reported. -- Daria Sito Sucic

         YEREVAN, December 29 (Itar-Tass) -  Wind of gale force and<br>
scattered <br>
rains make weather in Yerevan this Christmas. <br>
   Part of the Armenian capital does not have electricity, several <br>
apartment houses are ruined, roofs of hospitals and a kindergarten are <br>
torn off and some monuments are damaged. Fires broke out in four <br>
boroughs of Yerevan and several settlements nearby. Telephone <br>
communication with adjoining settlements is broken. According to <br>
preliminary reports of the Kapan mayor's office, the damage of local <br>
houses is estimated at 16 million Armenian drams (about 40,000 <br>
dollars). <br>
   Electricity supply to Alaverdi, Stepanavan and about 30 populated <br>
localities is broken. Hundreds of power line poles are damaged in <br>
Stepanavan alone. Roofs are torn off, trees are fallen by the wind. <br>
   Measures are being taken to repair the damage, reports the Armenian <br>
governmental press service. There is no loss of life. <br>

 MOSCOW (Dec. 28) XINHUA - Armenian President Levon Ter-Peterosyan <br>
said his country should do its best to keep the Nogorno-Karabakh region <br>
peaceful and stable, Itar-Tass news agency reported today. <br>
   Ter-Peterosyan made the remarks at a joint press conference held with <br>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Ebrahim Habibi. <br>
   Azerbaijan and Armenia reached a ceasefire agreement in May, 1994 after <br>
six years of war triggered by the announcement of independence of the <br>
Nogorno-Karabakh region, whose population is mainly Armenian ethnics. <br>
   Habibi said that he hopes the Caucasian Region will keep stable and <br>
peaceful to benefit the development of economies of the countries <br>
there. <br>
   Habibi arrived in Yerevan, capital of Armenia, on December 25 for his <br>
four-day visit to Armenia. <br>
   During his visit, the two countries signed a mutual understanding <br>
memorandum, and agreements of cooperation on energy, industry, <br>
communication and trade. <br>
   Habibi will visit Tajikistan on December 29 after ending his trip to <br>
Armenia.  Enditem <br>

Bloody road to ballot box<br>
<p>
Nagorno-Karabakh's struggle for freedom<br>
<p>
Joe Fiorito, Special to the Gazette <br>
<p>
FIRST OF A THREE-PART SERIES<br>
<p>
Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh - Nora Babayan pushed her way through a crowd of<br>
foreign observers, brushed aside a photographer, and slipped a piece of paper<br>
through a slit in a plywood box. The world did not sit up and take notice, but<br>
it was big news for Babayan. <br>
<p>
She's never voted for a president before. <br>
<p>
Getting to the ballot box has been a bloody struggle for her and the rest of the<br>
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, who are in the middle of a war of independence<br>
<i>&gt;from surrounding Azerbaijan. </i><br>
<p>
Although no bullets are flying at the moment - it's been quiet for a couple of<br>
years now - the struggle is far from over, and the election put a strain on an<br>
uneasy peace; Azerbaijan considers Babayan's ballot illegal.<br>
<p>
In fact, no government in the world recognizes the little enclave as anything<br>
more than a part of Azerbaijan. But the people of Nagorno-Karabakh are bent on<br>
self-determination, and the election is part of their political strategy: act<br>
like a nation, and you'll<br>
be perceived as one. <br>
<p>
No matter how long it takes. <br>
<p>
Time is part of the problem. The people of Nagorno-Karabakh have had a<br>
succession of Turkish, Persian and Russian rulers throughout their history;<br>
they've survived as Armenians because they've made an art of semi-autonomy.<br>
<p>
There is an uncomfortable ethnic and religious cast to the dispute - Azeris are<br>
Muslim, Armenians are Christian, and power ebbs and flows between them like a<br>
pulse in the vein of history.<br>
<p>
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh achieved independent union in 1918, but the Soviet<br>
Union took control of the region in 1920, and set the boundaries of Karabakh<br>
inside Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
It is a country of high peaks, harsh weather; its name is a pocket history of<br>
foreign rulers: "kara" is from the Persian, meaning fertile; "bakh," from the<br>
Turkish for garden. "Nagorno" is from the Russian, meaning mountainous.<br>
<p>
In 1988, excited by the possibility of perestroika, or Soviet restructuring, the<br>
people of Nagorno-Karabakh announced their intention to rejoin Armenia. <br>
<p>
All hell broke loose. <br>
<p>
Radical Azeris ran wild in Azerbaijan; in the cities of Sumgait, Kirovabad and<br>
Baku, women were raped, men beaten to death, families tossed out of their homes<br>
because they were Armenian. <br>
<p>
Hundreds died, thousands were injured. The brutality was fresh and familiar,<br>
reminding some of the genocide of 1915, when Turks killed 1.5 million Armenians;<br>
the Azeris are a Turkic people.<br>
<p>
The resulting war was short, nasty and brutish: 15,000 dead, an ugly little list<br>
of atrocities on both sides. There is a kind of quiet in the region for the<br>
moment; not war, but not quite peace. A deal to<br>
resolve the status of the region appears far off but the situation seems stable.<br>
Azerbaijan, for the moment, has accepted that it can't retake the area without<br>
great unrest in the region.<br>
<p>
According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, there are a<br>
million homeless on both sides; Azerbaijan claims a million all by itself.<br>
<p>
There are plenty of refugees, and there is also a sense of emptiness; 40,000<br>
Azeris once lived in Nagorno-Karabakh, and many more lived in Armenia; none<br>
remains today, just as no Armenians remain in Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
It will take a miracle to restore Nagorno-Karabakh to normal life. Archbishop<br>
Barkev Mardirossian knows all about miracles. At the height of the fighting, his<br>
house was destroyed by an Azeri rocket. <br>
<p>
He walked away without a scratch. <br>
<p>
These days, his life is much quieter; he prefers to watch his flock rebuild,<br>
rather than watch them destroy or be destroyed. <br>
<p>
"I had my special difficulties during the war," says Mardirossian. He is, after<br>
all, a man of the cloth, and the commandments of the church forbid killing; but<br>
Nagorno-Karabakh is Christian, and soldiers want communion. <br>
<p>
"I told our men that, in battle, they have the right to defend their wives,<br>
their land, their faith and their freedom. But they must not be cruel men or<br>
wild animals; they are soldiers, not killers."<br>
<p>
A fine distinction, and probably the same one made by Mardirossian's Muslim<br>
counterpart, Sheik Ul Islam Pasha Zade. In spite of that distinction - perhaps<br>
because of it - the two religious leaders<br>
have met frequently in Geneva, using the moral authority of their offices to<br>
bring about an exchange of hostages, and urging a peaceful settlement to the<br>
war. <br>
<p>
So far, so good.<br>
<p>
MATERIALS IN SHORT<br>
<p>
The people of Stepanakert are using the two-year lull in the war to rebuild as<br>
best they can, to sweep up the rubble and replant their gardens. <br>
<p>
Peace is nearly as much a struggle as war. Nagorno-Karabakh is subject to a<br>
Turkish-Azerbaijani blockade. Food, fuel and building materials are in short<br>
supply, and water is uncertain in most places, available only for a few hours in<br>
the morning and at night. <br>
<p>
Karabakh is getting some help from the Armenian diaspora:<br>
<p>
Montreal's Armenians are spending half a million dollars to build a water pipe<br>
around Stepanakert; the Armenians of Toronto have donated an equal amount to<br>
connect the pipe to a supply of fresh water.<br>
<p>
Nora Babayan's vote might have been illegal, but the election last month was the<br>
standard stuff of democracy. Electoral districts were mapped out, voters<br>
registered, independent scrutineers hired and trained. Out of a population of<br>
150,000, about 90,000 registered to vote. <br>
<p>
There were three candidates for president, each of whom were authorized $600 in<br>
expenses, and 300 litres of fuel for travel. Incumbent Robert Kocharian, with<br>
the advantage of office and a reputation as a hotshot military commander, was<br>
confident of victory. He declined the money and the fuel.<br>
<p>
There were few signs of a Western-style campaign. A single banner stretched<br>
across a downtown street in Stepanakert. On one side, "We're asking the<br>
international community for recognition;" on the other, "May the best man win."<br>
<p>
The election came off without a hitch. <br>
<p>
Mostly, that is; a few old people brought the passports of relatives and<br>
friends, expecting to cast proxy ballots; standard practice in Soviet days, but<br>
illegal now. Some people cast proxies anyway.<br>
<p>
Stepanakert is a small town. People know their neighbors here.<br>
<p>
None of the 38 international observers seemed concerned.<br>
<p>
CHURCH WAREHOUSE<br>
<p>
The day before the election, workmen were polishing a large metal cross that<br>
once adorned Mardirossian's cathedral, the Church of the Savior. <br>
<p>
Armenians have been Christian since 301 A.D., and this particular church has<br>
become a powerful political symbol: during the war, Azeri troops used it as a<br>
warehouse for Russian rockets; death stored in a church. <br>
<p>
The Azeris reckoned that Armenians would be reluctant to bomb their own holy<br>
place to bits. They were right. No bombs were used. Armenian troops retook the<br>
holy place by hand. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijani war planes bombed the church in retaliation. The roof and walls were<br>
damaged and the cross toppled, but the church was not destroyed. <br>
<p>
Four of his seven churches are battle-marked, yet Mardirossian refuses to<br>
describe this as a religious conflict. "There is a mosque in this town. I would<br>
not allow our soldiers to destroy it. This is not a religious war, it is a fight<br>
for territory and freedom." He describes the war this way for a reason. <br>
<p>
Religious struggles never end. <br>
<p>
This war isn't over yet. <br>
<p>
Off the coast of Azerbaijan, in the Caspian Sea, there is as much oil as all the<br>
reserves in the United States, including Alaska. Two new development deals worth<br>
a total of $3.5 billion U.S. were signed last month. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijan's share will buy a lot of guns if it wants to continue to fight, but<br>
oil in itself is a diplomatic tool with a bigger bang than any gun.<br>
<p>
American interests are hoping a pipeline can be built across the Caucasus,<br>
through Nagorno-Karabakh to the Turkish Mediterranean; they hope to convince the<br>
Azeris that wealth has more virtues than warfare.<br>
<p>
The race is on. <br>
<p>
Robert Kocharian won the election handily. The next day, he celebrated victory<br>
with a cocktail party, a press reception and a visit to Archbishop<br>
Mardirossian's damaged church. He watched quietly as the giant cross was hoisted<br>
high in the air and replaced atop its spire.<br>
<p>
Then he prayed. <br>

SEEM TO BE COMING TRUE.  JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER RUSSIA <br>
RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO WITHDRAW FROM BREAKAWAY CHECHNYA, ISLAMIC <br>
REBELS WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE IN RUSSIAN-BACKED TAJIKISTAN. <br>
<p>
THE 25-THOUSAND RUSSIAN SOLDIERS DEPLOYED IN THAT CENTRAL ASIAN <br>

REPORTED TO BE LESS THAN 180 KILOMETERS FROM DUSHANBE, THE <br>

         LEVEL OF MILITANCY, THIS HEIGHT OF PASSION AND DETAILED <br>
         MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND SO ON IS  NOT  LIKELY TO BE <br>
         FOUND AMONG MANY OTHER MUSLIM GROUPS OF THE FORMER <br>
         SOVIET UNION.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE NEARBY TERRITORY OF <br>
         DAGESTAN, A REGION THAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN TIGHTLY <br>
         LINKED TO CHECHNYA, THAT ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED WITH THE <br>
         CHECHENS IN THE RESISTANCE AGAINST RUSSIAN OCCUPATION IN<br>
         THE 19TH CENTURY, WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE <br>
         SAME SORT OF MILITANCY. <br>
<p>
                    // END ACT //  <br>
<p>
HOME TO MORE THAN 30 MUSLIM ETHNIC GROUPS, RUSSIA SAW AN UPSURGE <br>
OF AN ISLAMIC SELF-DETERMINATION MOVEMENT IN THE EARLY 1990'S.  <br>
THEN, IT ALL BUT SWEPT THE AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC OF TATARSTAN, EAST<br>
OF MOSCOW.  ONLY THE SHOWERING OF THAT OIL-PRODUCING REGION WITH <br>
ECONOMIC BENEFITS HELPED THE KREMLIN KEEP EVENTS THERE FROM <br>
SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. <br>
<p>
BUT SOME RUSSIAN POLITICIANS ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY WILL SEE<br>
MORE UNREST NOW THAT CHECHNYA HAS LAID BARE RUSSIA'S MILITARY <br>
WEAKNESS.  MR. SADOWSKI BELIEVES THE TATARS AND OTHER MUSLIMS <br>
LIVING ALONG THE RIVER VOLGA ARE UNLIKELY TO FOLLOW IN THE <br>
FOOTSTEPS OF THE CHECHENS.  <br>
<p>
               // ACT TWO SADOWSKI // <br>
<p>
         THE VOLGA TATARS HAVE A MUCH MORE REFINED SENSE OF <br>
         IDENTITY AND A MUCH MORE URBANE STYLE OF POLITICS THAN <br>
         MANY OTHER GROUPS.  THEY MAY WISH FOR AUTONOMY FROM <br>
         RUSSIA, AND AN INCREASE OF LOCAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND <br>
         SO ON, EVERY BIT AS PASSIONATELY AS THE CHECHENS DO.  <br>
         BUT THEY ARE LIKELY TO ORGANIZE A PURSUIT OF THAT ALONG <br>
         VERY VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF LINES.  THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE<br>
         WHOSE FIRST REACTION IS TO TURN TO URBAN GUERRILLAS <br>
         WARFARE. <br>
<p>
                     // END ACT // <br>
<p>
BY CONTRAST, PATRICIA CARLEY, A CENTRAL ASIA ANALYST WITH THE U-S<br>
INSTITUTE OF PEACE, IS CAUTIOUS ABOUT PREDICTING A FUTURE COURSE <br>
OF EVENTS.  SHE SAYS A LOT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER RUSSIA'S OWN <br>
DECLINE WILL CONTINUE, PROMPTING VARIOUS COMMUNITIES INSIDE THE <br>
COUNTRY TO LOOK MORE AGGRESSIVELY AFTER THEIR OWN INTERESTS. <br>
<p>
               // ACT THREE CARLEY // <br>
<p>
         THE DEFEAT IN CHECHNYA AND THE PROBLEMS IN TAJIKISTAN <br>
         DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH ISLAMIC REVIVAL.  I THINK <br>
         THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET <br>
         UNION AND THE RUSSIAN MILITARY.  I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT<br>
         TO DO WITH THE RUSSIAN POPULATION BEING UNWILLING TO <br>
         SUSTAIN THE KIND OF INVOLVEMENT NECESSARY, FOR EXAMPLE, <br>
         IN TAJIKISTAN FOR RUSSIANS ACTUALLY TO DO ANYTHING.  IT <br>
         COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN A NON-MUSLIM AND NON-RUSSIAN <br>
         PEOPLE, WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST RUSSIAN COLONIZATION. <br>
<p>
                       // END ACT // <br>
<p>
MEANWHILE, WITH RUSSIAN TROOPS CONCLUDING THEIR PULLOUT FROM <br>
CHECHNYA, CHECHEN SEPARATIST REBELS ARE NOW SAID TO BE IN <br>
PRACTICALLY FULL CONTROL OF THEIR REPUBLIC.  IN TAJIKISTAN, A <br>
RECENTLY CONCLUDED CEASE-FIRE ACCORD IS ALLOWING ISLAMIC REBELS <br>
TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS.  (SIGNED)  <br>

The following appeared in The (Toronto) Globe and Mail on Sat. Dec. 21 in<br>
the "Focus &amp; Books" section. The title of the article is "The party is<br>
over" and concerns the political situation in the ex-Soviet republics. It<br>
was written by Geoffrey York, of the Globe's Moscow bureau, in Moscow. The<br>
article occupies 2/3 of the front page of the section of the paper and all<br>
of page 4, where it goes to small print for a survey republic-by-republic. <br>
The situation in Georgia is described as being somewhat better than<br>
Armenia; that in Azerbaijan worse. Here is what is said about Armenia.<br>
	"Armenia was once regarded as one of the best hopes for democracy<br>
in the former Soviet Union. Its President, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, was a<br>
scholar and former dissident who had spent time in jail in the Soviet era. <br>
But in recent years, Armenia has slid inexorably toward authoritarian<br>
rule. In 1994, the biggest and oldest opposition party was banned, and<br>
dozens of its members were arrested on questionable charges. More than a<br>
dozen newspapers were closed, journalists were beaten and several<br>
newspaper offices were fire-bombed. The first post-Soviet parliamentary<br>
election was held last year, but foreign observers said it was unfair. Ten<br>
parties were banned from participating, widespread fraud was reported and<br>
independent candidates were subjected to violence and intimidation. The<br>
electoral commissions were controlled by the ruling party. Only a few<br>
parties were permitted to campaign, and they were given virtually no<br>
access to state media. A new constitution gave sweeping powers to the<br>
president: He can dissolve parliament, appoint and dismiss the prime<br>
minister and appoint all judges and court members. <br>
	"This year, Mr. Ter-Petrosyan has further tightened his grip. He<br>
claimed victory in presidential elections in September, but observers said<br>
they witnessed "systematic fraud on a massive scale." Ballot boxes were<br>
stolen by the President's supporters, and groups of soldiers were ordered<br>
to vote for the President, they said. The observers said the<br>
irregularities were enough to cast doubt on the President's claim of<br>
victory. Moreover, they said, the opposition candidates had very little<br>
access to state television.<br>
	"After the election, opposition protests became violent and the<br>
government sent tanks into the streets. Dozens of opponents were arrested<br>
and several political parties shut down. Police broke into the offices of<br>
opposition parties, beating and arresting their members. The main<br>
opposition candidate went into hiding because he feared arrest."<br>

Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjanis message to Ter-<br>

policy in the region.<br>

president pointed to the joint Iranian-Armenian economic committee <br>
created in 1994, the construction of a bridge across the Arax <br>

9. TURKEY SUSPENDS SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS IN SECURITY SCANDAL<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Turkish Interior Minister Meral Aksener has <br>
suspended seven police officers in a security scandal over alleged <br>
links between authorities and organized crime, the interior <br>
ministry said in a statement on Thursday.<br>
	The seven, from several units in central and southern <br>
Turkey, are being questioned over claims they deliberately made no <br>
effort to arrest gangster Mehmet Ozcan and that they aided and <br>
abetted convicted criminals.<br>
	The interior ministry had said in the statement that Ozcan <br>
was still at large, but later confirmed he was now in custody.<br>
	Main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz met prosecutors at <br>
Istanbul state security court on Thursday. Party aides said he <br>
handed over documents connected with the scandal.<br>
	Media reports say the documents confirm the existence of a <br>
network of 120 people directed by senior policemen and involved in <br>
murder, extortion and drug smuggling.<br>
	The Radikal newspaper said on Wednesday that a criminal gang <br>
headed by Ozcan had at one time been led by Abdullah Catli, a late <br>
mobster at the center of the scandal.<br>
	Convicted heroin smuggler Catli, who had been wanted for <br>
murder for 18 years, died last month in a traffic accident in the <br>
same car as a senior policeman and a member of parliament.<br>
	The subsequent scandal led to the resignation of Akseners <br>
predecessor at the interior ministry and the suspension of <br>
Istanbul police chief Kemal Yazicioglu.<br>
	The media says security officials and politicians have <br>
turned a blind eye to underworld activities and used gangsters to <br>
kill political opponents and business rivals.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. IRAQI PAPER ASSAILS TURKEY OVER US FLIGHTS<br>
<p>
BAGHDAD (Reuter)-An official Iraqi newspaper condemned Turkey on <br>
Thursday for allowing the United States and Britain to extend <br>
their use of its airbases to patrol the skies of northern Iraq.<br>
	"The Turkish decision is not independent and nationalist... <br>
It smells of a conspiracy against Iraq, said al-Thawra, organ of <br>
the ruling Baath party.<br>
	Turkish parliamentarians voted on Wednesday to give Islamist <br>
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakans government the power to <br>
authorize continued flights over northern Iraq after the mandate <br>
for the current operation, known as Provide Comfort, expires on <br>
December 31.<br>
	US, French and British planes have been shielding Iraqs <br>
Kurds from Baghdad since hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled to <br>
Turkey and Iran after a failed uprising at the end of the 1991 <br>
Gulf War.<br>
	Thawra said Turkey adopted the decision as a result of <br>
"American and British threats and pressure. Even bribes were given <br>
in order to influence the Turkish policy.<br>
	A Turkish foreign ministry official said on Wednesday that <br>
France had decided to withdraw its support for the force. "Turkey <br>
should have taken an independent decision like that of <br>
France...France took part in setting up the so-called Hammer <br>
Force (in 1991) and participated in its activities but it is no <br>
more convinced of its tasks, the Iraqi newspaper said.<br>
	The White House said it was confident that France would soon <br>
rejoin the operation.<br>
	Last week the Iraqi ruling partys newspaper warned Ankara <br>
that bilateral ties would be damaged if Turkey extended the <br>
operation which uses Incirlik in southern Turkey as its airbase. <br>
	Turkey has been a major outlet for Iraqi oil to world <br>
markets since Iraq resumed limited exports via pipeline under an <br>
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations this month. Iraq was <br>
barred from exporting oil under UN sanctions imposed for its <br>
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.<br>

COURTESY:  American Embassy- Yerevan, Armenia<br>
SUBJECT: (IMI) ARMENIA PRIVATISES EIGHT HYDRO-POWER<br>
PLANTS THROUGH INTERNATIONAL TENDER.<br>
<p>
ATTENTION U.S. MANUFACTURERS/SUPPLIERS/INVESTORS<br>
(ENERGY SECTOR)<br>
<p>
-------<br>
SUMMARY<br>
-------<br>
<p>
ARMENIA HAS BEGUN A PILOT PROGRAM OF ENERGY ASSET<br>
PRIVATIZATION, SELLING OFF EIGHT SMALL HYDROELECTRIC<br>
PLANTS.  THE PILOT PROGRAM IS MEANT TO PROVIDE A<br>
LEARNING CURVE FOR INVESTORS TO GET INVOLVED IN ARMENIA<br>
WITH MINIMAL RISK EXPOSURE, AND TO HELP ARMENIA BETTER<br>
MANAGE WITH LARGER-SCALE PRIVATIZATION COMING SOON.<br>
<p>
MAJOR PARTS OF THE 2,500-MEGAWATT STATE-OWNED ELECTRIC<br>
POWER SECTOR, AND OTHER MAJOR STATE-OWNED ENERGY ASSETS<br>
SUCH AS THE GAS COMPANY ARMGASPROM, ARE ON THE OFFICIAL<br>
LIST OF STATE-OWNED ASSETS TO BE PRIVATIZED IN THE<br>
1996/1997 PROGRAM.<br>
<p>
ARMENIA HAS UNDERTAKEN SUBSTANTIAL REFORM IN THE<br>
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR BY SEPARATING THE VERTICALLY<br>
ELECTRIC UTILITY SECTOR INTO GENERATION, TRANSMISSION,<br>
AND DISTRIBUTION, BY RAISING TARIFFS, AND INCREASING<br>
COLLECTIONS DRAMATICALLY ON THE CONSUMER SIDE.<br>
<p>
INDEPENDENT POWER IN ARMENIA IS FACILITATED BY A<br>
LICENSING LAW, AND FOREIGN INVESTOR LAW, ALLOWING FREE<br>
REPATRIATION OF PROFITS, FREELY FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE<br>
RATES, 100% FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESSES IN ARMENIA,<br>
AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS.  AN ENERGY LAW IS EXPECTED TO<br>
BE PASSED BY PARLIAMENT IN EARLY 1997.<br>
<p>
THE PILOT PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM STARTS THE PROCESS OF<br>
COMPETITIVE BIDDING FOR THE EIGHT SMALL PLANTS,<br>
TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 12 MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY.<br>
FOREIGN COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS MAY PARTICIPATE IN<br>
THE PROCESS ON EQUAL TERMS AS LOCAL ARMENIAN CITIZENS<br>
AND COMPANIES.<br>
<p>

Yerevan, Monday, 23. December, 1996, 23:39<br>
<p>
To Hayastan, Groong,<br>
<p>
Due to hurry, many errors occurred in my first edition of "Some <br>
impressions from HH Karekin I's press conference 23 Dec". Please <br>
accept that I re-send the whole message. To all I wish to express my<br>
deepest wish, or "genats", that you Armenian culture and <br>
faith may flourish as in the "voskedareroum", that you may develop<br>
a more and more offensive - not defensive and apologetic - <br>
self identity, and that, finally, through common efforts "spjurk" and <br>
"hajrenik" will act as two well coordinated hands, well placed on<br>
the one and the same gifted person.<br>
<p>
Greetings<br>
Rev. Michael Westh<br>
&lt;mrw@arminco.com&gt; <br>
Yerevan  <br>
<p>
////////////////////Original, corrected message begin//////////////<br>
<p>
Some impressions from HH Karekin I's press conference, held <br>
in Etchmiadzin 23 December 12.00 - 14.00. Based on notes <br>
taken down during the press conference. I do not intend to give a<br>
picture of the interview isolated from the themes that have been <br>
raised on this list already as well as those in the news from <br>
for instance Reuters Bureau claiming, that at "1500 year old <br>
disagreement has found its solution".<br>
<p>
Greetings<br>
Rev. Michael Westh<br>
&lt;mrw@arminco.com&gt; <br>
Yerevan  <br>
<p>
First HH gave a presentation of the aims and themes of his visit to <br>
Rome. <br>
<p>
1.  His Holiness, Karekin I's visit to Rome took place not as an <br>
isolated phenomenon. Other Churches were represented in Rome <br>
as well. Thus the Georgian, the Russian and the Romanian Churches.<br>
<p>
2.  One day was set aside for meetings held within the framework of the <br>
World Council of Churches (WCC). <br>
<p>
3.  HH, after a short presentation of the history of the "ecumenical" <br>
movement after 1945, gave much attention to the need for <br>
the strengthening of this movement at the entrance to the 3 millennium <br>
after Christ. The WCC meetings were dedicated to further unity, especially <br>
concerning the Churches" common prayer, theological reflection, and <br>
ministry to their respective peoples.<br>
<p>
4.  The fellowship between the existing Churches is a true and necessary <br>
sign and testimony to the world, that Christ dwells in his Church (as <br>
according to John's Gospel chapter 17, where Christ prays that the <br>
believers may be one as the Son is one with the Father).<br>
<p>
5. Such fellowship, however, is already in existence. It is given already<br>
<p>
in Christ to the Church Universal. It needs not be created or organized <br>
though man's effort. <br>
<p>
6.  The Armenian Church should continue being active within the <br>
Ecumenical movement. The Armenian Church is about to celebrate its 1700 <br>
anniversary. This should not take place as a special people's special <br>
event without any connection with the rest of the world. This <br>
anniversary concerns the Church Universal as well as the Armenian <br>
Church, since the heritage of the Armenian is not a special Armenian one,<br>
it testifies, however,  in its own special way to the faith common to the <br>
Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Catholic, the Orthodox (Greek and Russian) as well <br>
as the (mainline?) Protestant Churches.<br>
<p>
7.  One of the important themes for the meetings with the Pope - adding <br>
to the need for a deeper fellowship between the represented churches - was <br>
the fast growing need for a new moral or ethical code in all spheres of life. <br>
The societies worldwide are highly alienated from a firmly <br>
established moral code. This is not only the problem to the Church, nor <br>
to other religions, but it is a problem to mankind.<br>
<p>
8.  There was a high degree of mutual understanding in many areas of <br>
discussion, not least the question of the nature of Christ: The same <br>
Christ, who was born, suffered and was crucified, is also true God, God's <br>
Logos. Thus, the teachings of the Armenian Church, and its stance from <br>
after Chalcedon in 451 in no way were given up. On the contrary. The <br>
Armenian position was understood and recognized by the Pope as <br>
orthodox teaching. HH's book "The Council of Chalcedon and the <br>
Armenian Church" was known to the other participants. There was agreement, <br>
that different types of language and categories being use, as well as <br>
political and polemical elements, highly added to the schism after 451.<br>
<p>
9.  Pope John Paul II, head of 900.000 believers, listened carefully <br>
and understand and appreciated the Armenian cause as presented to him.<br>
Such a firsthand presentation of the life and witness of the Armenian Church<br>
was a necessary element of the meetings, and it was received in the most <br>
positive way. <br>
<p>
<p>
This part reflects HH's answers to some questions raised:<br>
<p>
10.  The head of the Roman Church held the position, that <br>
the natures of Christ are not to be conceived of as two separately <br>
acting wills in Christ, as did the Nestorian Churches. The Armenian <br>
Church is (no longer) understood as a "monophysitic". It was admitted, <br>
that such "termini" were attached to the "Oriental Orthodox  Churches" <br>
due to lack of understanding of their real positions. That time, <br>
unfortunately was the time for polemic between churches, now is the <br>
time for dialogue. This was, however, not rhetoric. Even history,<br>
HH stressed show positive examples hereof.<br>
<p>
11.  All Churches face similar challenges in their respective lands, <br>
therefore the need for fellowship in prayer, reflection and ministry. <br>
This is the "positive" imperative for seeking fellowship. Separation is not needed. <br>
<p>
12.  There is likewise a need for re-evangelizing Armenia, and speeding <br>
up the Church's activities. This need stems from the lack of freedom <br>
religion and speech during 70 years of communist dominion  and the <br>
present activity of some Churches and groups in Armenia, with no <br>
contact to the Armenian Church. However, the need for Christian <br>
instruction should not primarily be motivated negatively as a kind of <br>
"re-action". In stead it is time for "action". It is time for positively <br>
and actively live out and make flourish all which lies in Armenian <br>
Christianity and culture, contributing to the Church Universal as well<br>
as to the world.<br>

1. Chechen oil (NeGa)<br>
2. Elections in Chechnya (Segodnya) <br>
<p>
Nezavisimaya Gazeta 27 December 1996 page 3<br>
<p>
   Report by Igor Rotar:  "The Foundation of Independence or a Menace?<br>
Chechen Oil Is Both"<br>
<p>
  At the time when Chechnya was, at least formally, controlled by Russian<br>
troops, local oil was stolen on a grand scale.  In an interview, the former<br>
head of the South Oil Company, the sole monopolist in producing and refining<br>
Chechen oil, made no secret of the fact that the greater part of the<br>
republic's "black gold" is still being embezzled.<br>
   Time has demonstrated that it is more difficult to place Chechen oil<br>
under control than to stop the war.  The power in Chechnya has changed, but<br>
under the new masters oil is being siphoned off with no less intensity than<br>
under the federal authorities.  In independent Chechnya-Ichkeria, home-made<br>
gasoline is traded everywhere.  This is done in a amazingly simple way:<br>
Regular crude oil is put into a kind of moonshine still, and refined.  The<br>
quality of the resultant product is very low but quite passable if the car<br>
owner does not particularly spare his vehicle.  Underground oil companies<br>
with their own employees and the necessary equipment operate in the<br>
republic.  There is a clear-cut specialization in the underground oil<br>
business:  Some engage in oil production; others, in oil refining, and still<br>
others, in trading it.  Normally a criminal group seizes an oil hole; hired<br>
workers extract oil while an armed detachment guards the site.  Small<br>
private oil refineries that are located in practically all populated areas<br>
are also guarded.  True, the "privatization" of oil holes is not the only<br>
and, most important, not the main method of getting rich.  There are also<br>
more primitive methods.  Thus, for example, complete miniature plants are<br>
set up near the pipeline to illegally siphon off oil. <br>
   Initially the new authorities intended to establish a monopoly in the oil<br>
business.  President Yandarbiyev of Chechnya-Ichkeria even issued an edict<br>
on fighting the misappropriation of oil products.  This, however, was where<br>
the fight stopped.  "This edict is not being implemented.  Approximately<br>
3,000 tonnes of oil are produced in Chechnya every day.  The market price of<br>
our oil is approximately $80 per tonne.  That is to say, every day we are<br>
losing some $240,000!" Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, the newly appointed<br>
president of the South Oil Company, which is now a state company of<br>
Chechnya-Ichkeria, told your correspondent.<br>
   It is indicative that the Chechen-Ichkerian authorities have none of<br>
their former optimism about stopping the misappropriation of oil.  Today<br>
Groznyy has returned to its usual tactics, blaming Moscow for its woes.  "In<br>
principle we could easily stop the stealing of oil and the illegal<br>
production of oil products.  But today the 'oil business' has become almost<br>
the main source of income for the majority of Chechen families.  Thus far<br>
Moscow has not disbursed even a kopeck of the promised compensation.  There<br>
are no employment opportunities in the republic, and so to many the oil<br>
trade has become possibly the only way of sustaining their families,"<br>
Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov said. <br>
   It was planned to conclude a treaty on the joint transportation of oil,<br>
based on an agreement between the Chechen and Russian premiers, which was<br>
signed in Moscow on 1 December.  Yet for unknown reasons the treaty was<br>
never signed.  Neither is it clear what share of profit from the oil transit<br>
Chechnya will retain.  "I believe that we should get approximately<br>
one-seventh to one-eight part of the profit:  This is just about the<br>
proportion of the pipeline stretch that passes across the Chechen<br>
territory," Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov believes.  This point of view, however,<br>
is not shared by Boris Pastukhov, first deputy foreign minister of the<br>
Russian Federation:  "It is not quite correct to assess the profit from the<br>
transportation of oil in relation to the length of the pipeline.   For<br>
instance, if a pumping station is located on a small stretch of a pipeline,<br>
the share of profit on this section sharply increases.  So, the question of<br>
what share of profit the Chechen authorities are entitled to calls for<br>
additional negotiations." <br>
   Yet in light of the mounting wave of crimes in Chechnya profit sharing is<br>
perceived as a purely abstract question. <br>

   Report by Mariya Roshchina:  "No Single Candidate for Ichkerian President<br>
Could Be Found.  All Candidates, Excepting Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, Must Step<br>
Down From Their Posts"<br>
<p>
  Yesterday a meeting of the candidates for Chechen president was held in<br>
Groznyy.  Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, Aslan Maskhadov, Movladi Udugov, Shamil<br>
Basayev, and Akhmed Zakayev tried to reach an agreement on nominating one<br>
single candidate.  The meeting was attended by a mufti [Muslim cleric] so as<br>
to have every candidate -- should they decide to run for president on their<br>
own -- take an oath on the Koran that they would abide by the results of the<br>
27 January elections.  After the three-hour talks in the residence of<br>
President Yandarbiyev the candidates parted company, pledging to resume<br>
discussions on the subject next week, Mr. Udugov said.  Participants in the<br>
meeting, which was dubbed the "Meeting of Five," issued a joint appeal to<br>
the residents of the republic, reaffirming their unity and calling on the<br>
Chechens "to pay no heed to idle talk," in particular, about an alleged<br>
split in the Ichkerian leadership.  The appeal points out that regardless of<br>
how the problem of nominating a single candidate is resolved or what results<br>
the elections might yield, all the members of the "Group of Five" "will work<br>
as a single team" with the winner.<br>
   If no single candidate can be named, all the contenders, except for the<br>
incumbent president, will have to step down from their current posts.  The<br>
Chechen Central Electoral Commission demanded that yesterday, invoking the<br>
republic's electoral law.  Shaaman Akbulatov, press secretary of the Chechen<br>
Central Electoral Commission, explained that the republic's Constitution<br>
does not call for the president to resign during his election campaign.<br>
According to Shaaman Akbulatov, the other candidates, including Prime<br>
Minister Aslan Maskhadov, have already announced their readiness to resign<br>
from their posts.  Now these decisions are due to be formalized by<br>
presidential edict.<br>
   In the meantime, the nomination of candidates for the Chechen parliament<br>
continues.  In each of a total of 63 districts from 10 to 20 candidates have<br>
been fielded both by parties and individually.  Independent candidates must<br>
collect 300 signatures to be officially registered by the Central Electoral<br>
Commission.<br>
   Yet it seems that the hope that all Chechens, regardless of their place<br>
of residence, would be able to vote for the president and parliament of<br>
Chechnya are not destined to come true.  Ruslan Kutayev, minister for ties<br>
with CIS countries and Russia, said yesterday that polling stations would,<br>
in all likelihood, be opened only in Ingushetia and Dagestan.  In Dagestan,<br>
a polling station is due to be opened in the district center of Khasavyurt;<br>
and in Ingushetia, in the village of Sleptsovskaya.  The Chechens living in<br>
Moscow, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, or southern Russia will not be able to vote,<br>
Mr. Kutayev said, because of the shortage of funds.  Furthermore, it is<br>
believed in Groznyy that the Chechens who live outside Chechnya are<br>
"pro-Russian minded and will vote for the candidates who suit Moscow best."<br>
   Boris Berezovskiy, deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council,<br>
analyzing the candidates' views, concluded, however, that only the incumbent<br>
Chechen president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, would be dangerous for Russia.<br>
Aslan Maskhadov, Movladi Udugov, Shamil Basayev, and Akhmed Zakayev cannot<br>
imagine their republic outside Russia and without Russia, Boris Berezovskiy<br>
told the "Ekho Moskvy" radio station yesterday.  They all understand that<br>
the current goings-on in Chechnya amount to a complete lack of the rule of<br>
law, which can only be ended by legitimate elections.<br>
   Yet it is Chechnya's no-holds-barred developments that could call the<br>
legitimacy of the elections into question:  It is doubtful that Russian and<br>
international observers will go to Chechnya.  The Russian State Duma has<br>
already declined to send its observers.  The joint commission, operating on<br>
the basis of the Russian Security Council's authority, is due to dispatch<br>
its own observers to monitor elections in Chechnya, but no volunteers have<br>
yet showed up to go to the republic.<br>

HEADLINE: Refugees Straining Patience In Russia <br>
SOURCE: The New York Times, December 26, 1996<br>
<p>
It is 4 P.M. at the hotel Tourist, and the fuse boxes in Block 5 are going<br>
haywire. More than 300 residents, refugees from the 1988 ethnic violence in<br>
Azerbaijan, have fired up their kettles and soup pots all at once, taking<br>
advantage of their daily ration of electricity in the municipal hotel where<br>
they have been unwanted residents for up to seven years. <br>
<p>
Because they have not been registered by the city's Migration Service yet<br>
this year, most are afraid to leave the hotel for fear that they will be<br>
picked up by the police and harassed, fined or worse. <br>
<p>
"We are under house arrest," said Raisa Allakhverdova, who escaped with her<br>
family from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, in 1989 in a wave of 60,000 ethnic<br>
Armenians who fled the fighting. "We've appealed to everyone we can think of,<br>
and no one can help. I don't know what else to do." <br>
<p>
The refugees came to Moscow as Soviet citizens. A few years later, as the<br>
Soviet Union fell apart, they were suddenly foreigners, one struggling group<br>
among the estimated nine million displaced people. <br>
<p>
The refugees include millions of ethnic Russians who had been stranded on<br>
newly foreign turf. About 3.5 million of the 9 million escaped civil war and<br>
persecution. <br>
<p>
Many who have no friends or relatives to house them end up in train stations<br>
or on the street. The lucky ones receive temporary housing from the<br>
Government anywhere from trailer parks to cheap hotels like the Tourist. <br>
<p>
In many ways the Armenians in this hotel are lucky. They are housed, and most<br>
are working, hawking goods at local markets. But their problems are typical<br>
of those faced by the refugees in Russia. <br>
<p>
They are guaranteed either forced migrant or refugee status by the Russian<br>
Constitution, but they find themselves subject to a welter of local laws that<br>
often leave them with no official status at all. <br>
<p>
The hotel administration says crippling bills have made it necessary to<br>
regulate electricity and water. Indeed, the bills for the Soviet-era complex<br>
are high, and the paltry fee the hotel gets from the city as compensation is<br>
not much help. <br>
<p>
But no one is fooled by the hotel's often dangerous tactics. Fire exits are<br>
permanently locked, and the refugees say ambulances have been denied access<br>
to the grounds. The refugees are being pushed out, and the city officials are<br>
watching it happen. <br>
<p>
"The activities of the Moscow government contradict the Constitution," said a<br>
Federal Migration Service spokesman, Yevgeny Chernetsov. "But what can we do?<br>
The Armenians are not our problem." <br>
<p>
Moscow immigration officials do not deny that their methods are sometimes<br>
less than legal. "I think it's perfectly understandable," said Vera Milai,<br>
deputy director of the Moscow Migration Service. "We must provide safety for<br>
the capital. We cannot take in big numbers of migrants, because they cannot<br>
be kept under control." <br>
<p>
Adriano Silvestri, legal officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for<br>
Refugees in Moscow, said: "In some cities you can't get permanent residence<br>
registration unless you have refugee status. But you can't get refugee status<br>
without residence registration. It's a huge problem." <br>
<p>
Many of Russia's biggest cities still operate with the outmoded and<br>
contradictory Soviet pass system. None are worse than Moscow, which has been<br>
criticized by human rights groups for requiring residents to carry documents<br>
proving that they can work, that they send their children to school and that<br>
they are entitled to social services. <br>
<p>
The police in Moscow often use document checks as an excuse to harass ethnic<br>
Caucasians, who are blamed for much of the city's crime. <br>
<p>
"If you're dark-haired, you're in trouble," Mr. Chernetsov said. "If you're<br>
blond, you're exempt." Though many are working "not quite legally and not<br>
paying taxes," Caucasian refugees "don't make criminal problems," he said.<br>
"That's nonsense." <br>
<p>
Yelena Lukianova, deputy director of the Tourist, describes her wards as<br>
rich, boorish ingrates who are destroying the hotel. <br>
<p>
"These people have used up their refugee status," said Mrs. Lukianova. "It's<br>
like when you spoil a child. You can't then turn around and simply call it<br>
spoiled. The child has become insolent. They have lived so long for free that<br>
they no longer understand the value of money." <br>
<p>
Mrs. Lukianova also complained that the Armenians had refused housing offers<br>
in other cities, waiting for openings in "either Moscow, St. Petersburg, or<br>
America." Refugees who were interviewed conceded that they had turned down<br>
alternative housing, saying the remote towns offered to them are places where<br>
people had not been paid for months and where they feared racism. <br>

HEADLINE: Iranian Vice-President Leaves for Armenia <br>
SOURCE: Xinhua News Agency, December 25, 1996<br>
<p>
Iran's first Vice-President Hassan Habibi left here for Yerevan today on<br>
four-day visit to Armenia in a bid to expand their bilateral relations.<br>
 Heading a high-ranking delegation, Habibi is expected to hold talks with<br>
Armenian officials, including President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the parliament<br>
speaker and foreign minister.  Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that<br>
the agenda of his negotiations with Armenian officials would include<br>
expansion of bilateral relations, regional cooperation and the signing of<br>
several agreements in the areas of economy and culture and the expedition of<br>
the implementation of the accords already signed between the two countries.<br>
 Habibi also will discuss with Armenian officials the issue of increasing the<br>
volume of trade exchange between the two countries.  He will visit several<br>
historical, cultural and economic centers in Armenia including the Center for<br>
Iranology Studies, and will break the ground for the construction of the new<br>
Iranian embassy building in Yerevan. <br>

HEADLINE: Chechnya Need Be Russia Part to Be Recognised -- Aleskerov <br>
SOURCE:  Itar-Tass, December 24, 1996<br>
 <br>
Azerbaijan will recognise chechnyaas a component part of the Russian<br>
Federation, Azeri Parliament Chairman Murtuz Aaleskerov, who is visiting<br>
China, told Itar-Tass. <br>
<p>
He said Azerbaijan's stance is that Grozny-Moscow relations need bes ettled<br>
peacefully and on the condition of Russia's territorial integrity. <br>
<p>
Every ethnic group has the right to have autonomy within the state,but has no<br>
right to secede and create its own state, Aleskerov said. <br>
<p>
As for Azerbaijan-Russia relations, Aleskerov said the two republics had<br>
lived in the former Soviet Union for over 70 years. <br>
<p>
"We have respect for Russia and its policy.  We think fraternal,friendly<br>
relations between the two states should remain," he said. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: President of Nagorno-Karabakh Inaugurated <br>
SOURCE:  Itar-Tass, December 24, 1996 (Dicran Liloian)<br>
<p>
President of the non- recognised Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh Robert<br>
Kocharyan was inaugurated on Tuesday. <br>
<p>
He gained 88. 91 percent of votes in the elections a month ago.  <br>
<p>
The inauguration ceremony took place at the Karabakh parliament building in<br>
Stepanakert.  Kocharyan said his policy would aim to unite society. <br>
<p>
Commenting on Karabakh settlement, the President said the people of Karabakh<br>
would have serious problems.  However, the president said, they would be able<br>
to overcome any pressure if the Armenian people, the Armenian authorities and<br>
the whole diaspora displayed willpower. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Crimea Call for State Solution to Deported People Problem <br>
SOURCE:  Itar-Tass, December 24, 1996<br>
<p>
The problem of deported citizens in the Crimea should have a state solution,<br>
Crimean parliament deputies said. <br>
<p>
The deputies requested their Ukrainian colleagues to resume financing of the<br>
return and accommodation of deported citizens from the state budget at an<br>
amount suggested by the government of the Crimean autonomy.   An appeal of<br>
Crimean lawmakers, circulated today, says this problem maybe turned regional<br>
and the Crimean budget may carry the financing burden only by itself. <br>
<p>
According to information of Ukrinform, the Crimean parliament is alarmed by<br>
attempts of some civil servants to make measures on the return and<br>
accommodation of Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Greeks and Germans, who were<br>
deported from the Crimea on the ethnic principle, a regional problem.  The<br>
curtailed budget allocations on accommodation of those returning to the<br>
peninsula aggravates the economic situation and increases social and<br>
political tension in the Crimea, the appeal says.  <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Police Seizes Counterfeiters in Russia's Siberia <br>
SOURCE:  Itar-Tass, December 2, 1996<br>
<p>
Police in Russia's west Siberian city of Chelyabinsk have detained a group of<br>
Armenians and Azerbaijanis who have been counterfeiting 100-thousand-rouble<br>
notes.  <br>
<p>
So far, 212 million counterfeited roubles have been confiscated.  However,<br>
the law enforcement bodies do not rule out that part of the money may still<br>
remain in circulation.   <br>
<p>
In this connection, the Chelyabinsk police on Wednesday warned through local<br>
mass media the citizens of the southern Urals to closely examine notes of<br>
large denominations.  They have given the serial numbers and characteristic<br>
signs of the counterfeited money.   <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Brazil polyglot takes his talent to the masses <br>
SOURCE:  Reuters World Service,  December 26, 1996, Thursday, BC cycle<br>
 <br>
Brazil's foremost linguist, whose ability to speak 58 languages fluently has<br>
brought him fame but no fortune, hopes the tide will turn in his favour with<br>
the Christmas launch of a series of books in which he details his unusual<br>
method of learning languages. <br>
<p>
Ziad Fazah, who has earned himself an entry in the Brazilian edition of the<br>
Guinness Book of World Records as the world's greatest living polyglot, says<br>
he wants to pass his skill on to future generations. "I think I am on a<br>
divine mission to harmonise the understanding between people of different<br>
languages," said the 43-year-old Lebanese immigrant, who has lived in Brazil<br>
for 25 years. "I would feel very satisfied to see other people learn the<br>
languages I learned." <br>
<p>
But, well-meant intentions aside, Fazah, who earns a living as a language<br>
teacher and translator, does hope one of his books will land him on the world<br>
bestseller list. <br>
<p>
He acquired most of the huge number of languages he speaks between the age of<br>
14 and 17, and aside from Arabic, his mother tongue, and French and English,<br>
which he learned at school in Lebanon, he taught himself all the other<br>
languages. <br>
<p>
FROM ARMENIAN TO PAPIAMENTO <br>
<p>
He started with Armenian, then German, then Russian and other slavic<br>
languages before moving on to such exotic tongues as Vietnamese, Mandarin,<br>
Berber and most recently Papiamento, a language spoken in the Dutch Antilles.<br>
<p>
<p>
"My memory is like a biochemical laboratory, a photographic machine which<br>
sees, registers, records and never forgets," Fazah told Reuters in his modest<br>
apartment in Rio de Janeiro's middle-class neighbourhood of Flamengo where he<br>
lives with his wife and son. He admits not everyone will be able to acquire<br>
his repertoire of languages but he says anyone can learn to speak a foreign<br>
language "reasonably well" by following his method. <br>
<p>
His first book, "Teaching to Learn Spanish," reveals some of the tricks that<br>
enabled him to learn three or four languages at the same time in only three<br>
months. He would wake up early every morning, close the curtains in his room<br>
and in the semi-darkness speak out loud to himself in the language of the day<br>
for about 20 minutes. He would then proceed to read sentences in the foreign<br>
language for two minutes while listening to slow music. <br>
<p>
ABSORBING LANGUAGES IN THE IMAGINATION <br>
<p>
"That way the sentences are mechanically absorbed into the imagination," he<br>
said. <br>
<p>
But his method also includes the well-known and arduous task of memorising<br>
vocabulary and finding one's way around the grammatical intricacies of any<br>
language. <br>
<p>
Fazah said with his experience he could now learn any language within three<br>
weeks, but he is looking further afield and hopes to create his own language<br>
one of these days. <br>
<p>
"I am thinking about creating a world language like Esperanto," he said. "I<br>
could create a new language in three weeks, a simple language with little<br>
grammar and phonetic spelling." <br>

Kommersant-Daily 26 December 1996 page 1<br>
<p>
   Report by Aleksandr Korzhakov:  "The Defense Minister Is Looking for<br>
Adversaries"<br>
<p>
  Yesterday -- for the first time since the breakup of the Warsaw Pact --<br>
Russia, through its defense minister, attempted to pinpoint the countries<br>
that currently which pose military danger to the CIS, including Russia.  A<br>
danger that might evolve into an immediate military threat.  In other words,<br>
Igor Rodionov for the first time listed the so-called most likely<br>
adversaries of Moscow.  They include the United States, the NATO bloc,<br>
separately Turkey.  Next come Iran, Pakistan, Japan, and China.  A motley<br>
crew, to be sure.<br>
   Few could have suggested that Rodionov's report at the conference on the<br>
CIS strategic partnership could essentially turn into a conceptual summary<br>
of the Defense Ministry leadership's general vision of the political<br>
situation in the world.  But there you go, just yesterday, addressing<br>
delegations of the CIS countries' defense ministries, the head of the<br>
Russian Defense Ministry for the first time proposed a number of joint<br>
preventive measures to stave off possible military threats to the Commonwealth.<br>
   The assessment of the situation, as done by Rodionov, was fully<br>
traditional for the Russian military ministry:  First among countries that<br>
could potentially threaten not only Russia, but the entire CIS was the<br>
United States, which is striving toward an unrivaled world leadership.<br>
Naturally, next comes NATO.  In the minister's view, the alliance is just "a<br>
serious challenge to the present-day realities and a potential source of<br>
danger, which could evolve into a military threat."  The situation on the<br>
CIS' southern and southeastern borders is just as tense:  Due to the<br>
continuing buildup of offensive weapons and the desire of "certain regional<br>
centers of power" to expand their zones of influence by "diminishing the<br>
importance of the CIS states," Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Japan, China, and a<br>
number of other countries -- that were not named by the minister --<br>
represent increasing military danger.<br>
   Curiously, "Rodionov's list" includes at least two countries with which<br>
Russia is linked by large-scale trade, economic, and military contacts.<br>
Whatever the defense minister might say about potential threats, he cannot<br>
deny that the continuing buildup of offensive weapons in Asia, which has<br>
caused the Defense Ministry's anxiety, occurs with Russia's most active<br>
involvement.  Moreover, with the involvement of the minister himself or his<br>
deputies (a signature of one of them is necessary for any contract on arms<br>
exports to be valid).  The inclusion of China -- the main importer of<br>
Russian weapons -- on the list of "the most likely adversaries" could bode<br>
serious troubles in store for Rodionov.  The reason is that the minister's<br>
utterances are unlikely to contribute to the success of Chinese Premier Li<br>
Peng's visit to Moscow, which is due to take place shortly.  This also<br>
applies to Iran, included by Rodionov on the "black list," although just a<br>
day earlier Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov returned from a<br>
Tehran visit, which was to have given a new boost to economic and political<br>
dialogue between Moscow and Tehran.  On the whole, the minister is out of<br>
step with the rest, to put it mildly.<br>
   Possibly, the minister just wanted to cite "live examples" to his CIS<br>
colleagues to show that in the emerging military-political situation all CIS<br>
members should do their utmost so as to retain the "sufficient" potential of<br>
the strategic nuclear forces and to rally around Russia for this purpose.<br>
At the same time, the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces were portrayed as a<br>
joint nuclear shield for all the Commonwealth countries, which, as is well<br>
known, they are still not.  The minister also called for work to be stepped<br>
up to create a joint air defense system as well as the systems of<br>
intelligence and command and control for "coalition groups of forces."  The<br>
last are necessary in order to ensure collective security and will be<br>
created as soon as next year.  But given that the CIS countries, as the<br>
minister put it, took so long "to understand the evolution of strategic<br>
partnership and military-political integration," there can be no guarantees<br>
that the urgent measures to restore the strategic parity he enumerated will<br>
be realized any time soon at least within the continent's expanses.<br>
   Judging by yesterday's statement by Uzbekistani President Islam Karimov,<br>
however, it will rather be the other way around.  Speaking in Tashkent --<br>
yet unaware of Rodionov's report -- he flatly rejected any possibility of<br>
creating a military-political bloc within the CIS," including as a<br>
counterbalance to NATO expansion.  Other CIS countries are not rushing to<br>
hide under Russia's "military umbrella" either; furthermore, many of them<br>
pursue foreign policy that is, to put it mildly, not in line with that of<br>
Moscow.  Their foreign policy priorities feature many a country from<br>
"Rodionov's list," first  and foremost Turkey.  In short, as Leo Tolstoy<br>
used to say about novelist Leonid Andreyev:  "He is trying to scare me, but<br>
I don't feel frightened."<br>

<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 23, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 20, a meeting dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of<br>
 Energy<br>
 system of Armenia took place. During the meeting the Minister of<br>
 Energy Gagik Martirosian congratulated the energetics with the Day of<br>
 Energetics. He mentioned that this year is also the anniversary of<br>
 several<br>
 electric power plants of Armenia. The Minister noted the role<br>
 of the energy system in the stable development of the Republic's<br>
 economy,<br>
 the mutually beneficial cooperation with foreign organizations and<br>
 the<br>
 solution of future problems.<br>
 Mr. Martirosian mentioned the importance of the fact that the energy<br>
 crisis has been overcome. He also noticed that several new sources of<br>
 energy<br>
 will be implemented in the near future, like the new block of Hrazdan<br>
 Thermal Electric Power Plant, the construction of the Iran-Yerevan<br>
 high<br>
 voltage electric wire-line, and the Herher Hydro-Electric Station in<br>
 the South of Armenia. The far future projects include the<br>
 construction of the Iran-Armenia gas-line, the Hydro-Electric<br>
 Stations in<br>
 Meghry, Shnogh. It is supposed that after the reforms, by th year<br>
 2000, the energy system of Armenia will be able to produce 12 billion<br>
 kw/h<br>
 energy (as in 1988).<br>

        STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC<br>
        OF ARMENIA<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 23, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 On December 16-17, 1996, the Second Conference of the Ministers of<br>
 Environment of Central Asian, Caucasian and Balkan Republics was<br>
 held in Istanbul, with the participation of the delegation of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia, headed by the Minister of Environment Mr. Souren<br>
 Avetissian. Also participating in the Conference were 13 other<br>
 delegations, including the self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of<br>
 Northern Cyprus" and the representatives of the Former Yugoslav<br>
 Republic of Macedonia represented under the name of the "Republic of<br>
 Macecdonia." At the end of the Conference a joint declaration was<br>
 adopted which was also signed by the Minister of Environment of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia.<br>
 On this occasion, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia informs that pursuant to the decisions of the United Nations<br>
 and other international organizations, the Republic of Armenia<br>
 recognizes the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by its<br>
 internaitonally accepted name, and hopes that all the problems<br>
 related to the name of the  republic could be resolved by<br>
 UN sponsered peaceful negotiations on the basis of mutual<br>
 compromise.<br>
 Furthermore, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of<br>
 Armenia declares that the Republic of Armenia remains faithful to its<br>
 frequently stated position that the Cyprus problem must be resolved<br>
 according to the resolutions of the United Nations, and it does not<br>
 recognize any other government than the legitimate authorities of the<br>
 Republic of Cyprus.<br>
 THe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia declares<br>
 that the Ministry of Envirnoment was not authorized to sign on behalf<br>
 of the Republic of Armenia any document which also bears the<br>
 signature of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" - an entity<br>
 that is not a subject of international law.<br>
 While welcoming the regional cooperation on environmental issues, the<br>
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia considers the<br>
 politicization of conference devoted to such important issues<br>
 unacceptable.<br>

        80% OF APARTMENTS PRIVATIZED IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 23, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 As of today, about 80% of the 396.360 apartments in Armenia have been<br>
 privatized. 80% of apartments have been privatized in Yerevan as<br>
 well. Now the privatization process has slowed down, because the<br>
 housing fund became the local self-government bodies' possession.<br>
 On November 18 of the current year, the National Assembly of the<br>
 Republic of Armenia passed a law, which prolonged the privatization<br>
 process until June 30, 1997.<br>

Yerevan, Monday, 23. December, 1996, 23:39<br>
<p>
To Hayastan,<br>
<p>
Some impressions from HH Karekin I's press conference, held <br>
Etchmiadzin 23 December 12.00 - 14.00. This is bases on notes I have <br>
taken down during the press conference. I do not intend to give an <br>
picture of the interview isolated from the themes that have already been <br>
raised on this list and in the news from for instance Reuters Bureau, <br>
that has claimed, that at "1500 year old disagreement has found its <br>
solution".<br>
<p>
Greetings<br>
Rev. Michael Westh<br>
&lt;mrw@arminco.com&gt; <br>
Yerevan  <br>
<p>
First HH gave a presentation of the aims and themes of his visit to <br>
Rome. <br>
<p>
1.  The visit to Rome took place not as an isolated phenomenon. Other <br>
Churches were gathered in Rome as well. Thus the Georgian, <br>
Russian and Romanian Churches (maybe others)<br>
2.  One day was set aside for meetings held within the framework of the <br>
World Council of Churches (WCC). <br>
3.  HH then, after a short presentation of the history of the "ecumenical" <br>
movement after 1945, gave much attention to the need for <br>
strengthening this movement the entrance to the 3 millennium after <br>
Christ. The WWC meetings especially were dedicated further <br>
developments in the Churches" common _prayer_, _reflection_, and <br>
_ministry_ to their respective peoples.<br>
4.  True fellowship between churches is a true and necessary sign in the <br>
world, that Christ dwells here (as according to John's Gospel <br>
chapter 17).<br>
5.  However, such a fellowship is already in existence and given in <br>
Christ to the Church Universal. It is not to be created by man's <br>
effort, or organized. <br>
6.  The Armenian Church should be active within the Ecumenical <br>
movement. The Armenian Church is about to celebrate its 1700 <br>
anniversary. This should not take place as a special people's special <br>
event without any connection with the rest of the world. This <br>
anniversary concerns the Church Universal as well as the Armenian <br>
Church, since its heritage is not a special Armenian but testifies to <br>
the faith common to the Oriental Orthodox, the Catholic, the <br>
Orthodox (Greek and Russian) as well as (some) Protestant <br>
Churches.<br>
7.  One of the important themes for the meetings - adding to the need <br>
for a deeper fellowship between the represented churches - was the <br>
fast growing need for a new moral or ethical code in all aspects of <br>
life in a world, that is highly alienated from firmly established moral <br>
code. This is not only the problem of the Church, nor other religions <br>
but it is the problem of mankind.<br>
8.  There was a high degree of mutual understanding in many areas of <br>
discussion, not least the question of the nature of Christ: The same <br>
Christ, was born, suffered and was crucified, is also true God, Gods <br>
Logos. The teaching of the Armenian Church, and its stance from <br>
after Chalcedon in 451was not given up. On the contrary, the <br>
Armenian position was understood and recognized (by the Pope) as <br>
orthodox teaching. HH's book "The Council of Chalcedon and the <br>
Armenian Church" was known to the other participants. There was <br>
agreement, that different type of language and categories, as well as <br>
political  and polemical element highly added to the schism after 451<br>
9.  Pope John Paul II, the head of 900.000 believers listened carefully <br>
and understand the Armenian cause as presented to him by HH<br>
10.  The head of the Roman Church expressed the understanding, that <br>
the natures of Christ are not to be conceived of as two separately <br>
acting wills in Christ, as did the Nestorian Churches. The Armenian <br>
Church is not understood as a "monophysitic", and it was admitted, <br>
that this "terminus" was attached to the "Oriental Orthodox  <br>
Churches" without real understanding of their positions. Then was <br>
the time for polemic between churches, now is the time for dialogue.<br>
11.  All Churches face similar challenges in their respective lands, <br>
therefore the need for fellowship in prayer, reflection and ministry. <br>
Separation is not needed. <br>
12.  There is likewise a need for re-evangelizing Armenia, and speeding <br>
up the Church's activities. This need stems from the lack of freedom <br>
religion and speech during 70 years of communist dominion  and the <br>
present activity of some Churches and groups in Armenia, with no <br>
contact to the Armenian Church. However, the need for Christian <br>
instruction should not primarily be motivated negatively as a kind of <br>
"re-action". In stead it is time for "action".<br>

<p>
1. FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT BLUNDER<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-At a recent environmental conference, head <br>
of the Armenian delegation, Minister of Ecology Souren Avetissian <br>
signed a joint statement issued at the conference, Armenias <br>
Foreign Ministry announced.<br>
	The second Conference of Ministers of Environmental <br>
Protection of Central Asia, Caucasus and Balkan States took place <br>
Dec. 16-18 in the Turkish capital of Istanbul.<br>
	A total of 13 delegations including delegations of the self-<br>
proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Republic of <br>
Macedonia-Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia-attended the <br>
conference.<br>
	According to the Foreign Ministry statement, "the Republic <br>
of Armenia proceeding from resolutions of the United Nations and <br>
other international organizations, recognizes the Former Yugoslav <br>
Republic of Macedonia only under its international name and voices <br>
hope that all issues related to the name of this state will be <br>
settled through peaceful negotiations mediated by the United <br>
Nations and mutual compromise."<br>
	"Our country remains faithful to its principle position <br>
which has been uttered for many times...the problem of Cyprus must <br>
be settled within the framework of relevant UN resolutions. The <br>
Republic of Armenia will not recognize any other government, but <br>
the legal leadership of Cyprus," the Foreign Ministry statement <br>
said.<br>
	In addition, "the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of <br>
Armenia informs that it did not entrust the Ministry of Ecology of <br>
the Republic of Armenia to sign any documents under which the <br>
self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus put its <br>
signature."<br>
	"While encouraging regional cooperation in the field of <br>
environmental protection, the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of <br>
Armenia considers inadmissible any politicization of conferences <br>
dealing with this important problem," the statement concluded.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. KAREKIN I DISCUSSES RECENT POPE MEETING<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Having established a cooperation between the <br>
Catholic and the Armenian Apostolic Churches, the Armenian <br>
Apostolic Church does not discard religious controversies existing <br>
between the two Churches, Catholicos of All Armenians, Karekin I <br>
said, commenting on the joint declaration signed  the during his <br>
visit with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.<br>
	"We still do not recognize the Chalcedon Council. However, <br>
the historically inherited controversies and dissensions should <br>
not be an impediment in the way of uniting  the two Churches, <br>
which at the same time does not mean becoming similar. The <br>
unification is Gods will," His Holiness said.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER VISITS BAKU<br>
<p>
BAKU (Azg)-Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov visited Baku on <br>
Monday to discuss military collaboration with Azerbaijan. Rodionov <br>
said that Russia will do its best to promote the development of <br>
friendly relations between the two countries.<br>
	Rodionov said that the negotiations will center on bilateral <br>
relations, particularly on collaboration in the defense sector. He <br>
said that several agreements have already been signed between <br>
Russia and Azerbaijan regarding defense, but the goal of the <br>
current visit was to more clearly define their details. Rodionov <br>
planned to discuss Russian use of the Gabeline radar station with <br>
Azeri President Gaidar Aliyev.<br>
	The Gabeline radar station was built in Azerbaijan as part <br>
of the Soviet Unions military/strategic monitoring system during <br>
the Cold War.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. WORLD BANK TO ALLOCATE NEW CREDITS TO ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The World Bank will allocate loans for six <br>
new programs of economic development for Armenia for the coming <br>
year, World Bank representative in Armenia, Vahram Nersissiants <br>
said.<br>
	During his visit to Armenia last week, Director of the World <br>
Banks Eastern Europe and Central Asia Section, Basil Kawalski, <br>
expressed the World Banks eagerness to continue and extend <br>
cooperation with Armenia.<br>
	Nersissiants said that Armenia would be given loans by the <br>
World Banks International Development Association from the so-<br>
called "window of free long-term loans." The loans are due for <br>
repayment in 35 years with a grace period of 10 years.<br>
	The World Bank has allocated loans for nine economic <br>
programs as well as earmarking a grant for a rehabilitation <br>
program for the ecology of Lake Sevan. According to Nersissiants, <br>
the total loans allocated to Armenia will total nearly <br>
$500,000,000.<br>
	One of the programs, Enterprise Development Credit Program, <br>
will be approved by the Council of the World Bank in the near <br>
future. The cost of the program is $16.75 million. Sums designated <br>
for other programs have not yet been specified.<br>
	Earthquake Rehabilitation Credit Program ($28,000,000) is <br>
expected soon. Nersissiants reported that restoration works in the <br>
earthquake area would continue due to the Municipal Social Sector <br>
Credit Program. This program provides for the restoration of <br>
housing and water supply systems both in the earthquake area and <br>
Yerevan.<br>
	In 1997, the World Bank will continue Structural Adjustment <br>
Credit Program. Besides, the World Bank is likely to allot loans <br>
under the program of formation of agricultural infrastructures. <br>
Also, Health Care and Education Reform Support Credit will be <br>
approved for Armenia next year.<br>
	Nersissiants reported that the negotiations were being held <br>
with the World Bank on allocation of "a grant for culture" which <br>
will be made for the National Opera and Ballet Theater of Armenia.<br>
	According to Nersissiants the World Bank rarely provides <br>
grants for culture, however, in former Soviet republics where <br>
culture is highly regarded, cultural reforms have acquired <br>
economic significance.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. OCALAN CALLS FOR DIALOGUE WITH TURKEY<br>
<p>
DIYABAKIR, Turkey (Reuter)-Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan renewed <br>
calls for a lasting solution to 12 years of conflict in southeast <br>
Turkey in a television interview broadcast on Monday.<br>
	"I want there to be a way for dialogue in 1997. Without <br>
putting forward any pre-conditions, I invite the Turkish state to <br>
a solution of the Kurdish problem by political means," the <br>
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) chief said in the interview <br>
broadcast by Belgian-based Med-TV.<br>
	Ocalan said Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan had <br>
made various initiatives for dialogue with the rebels after he <br>
came to power in June, but that these had since been abandoned. <br>
	Turkish governments and the military have often refused <br>
direct negotiations with the PKK, which they regard as a terrorist <br>
group. A unilateral rebel cease-fire declared last year was <br>
ignored by Turkey.<br>
	Ocalan said the PKK was trying to find a party leader or <br>
government official with whom they could talk and repeated <br>
assurances that he had dropped demands for a separate Kurdish <br>
state on Turkish soil.<br>
	"I want the problem to be solved by political means, within <br>
Turkeys national borders," he said.<br>
	Ocalan, also known as "Apo," threatened more suicide <br>
bombings in Turkeys major cities if what he called the repression <br>
of the Kurdish people continued.<br>
	"This time we will send hundreds of Kurds into the big <br>
cities. Its not a difficult thing for a guerrilla with a bomb to <br>
get on a bus or a plane, or infiltrate into a crowded place," he <br>
said.<br>
	Ten people, mostly members of the security forces, were <br>
killed in two suicide bombings in Turkish cities at the end of <br>
October and 10 soldiers were killed by a human bomb in eastern <br>
Turkey in July.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. CIS COMMISSION CONSIDERS LAWS ON FIGHTING MAFIA<br>
<p>
BAKU (Itar-Tass)-The Commonwealth of Independent States Inter-<br>
Parliamentary Assemblys commission in charge of working out <br>
recommendations on fighting organized crime in member countries <br>
held a meeting in the Azeri capital of Baku on Saturday.<br>
	The meeting was attended by parliamentarians from nine of <br>
the 12 CIS states, including Russia.<br>
	Participants stressed that laws on fighting organized crime <br>
are necessitated by the current situation in post-Soviet republics <br>
which have been swept by crime and corruption.<br>
	They stressed that only joint efforts can stop organized <br>
crime. <br>
	The commission approved several laws aimed at improving <br>
investigative activities and providing better protection for <br>
victims, witnesses and other persons who help in investigations.<br>
	The participants also discussed laws on combating corruption <br>
and terrorism, and on the protection of law enforcement people.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. EBRD APPROVES LOANS FOR AZERBAIJAN<br>
<p>
LONDON (Itar-Tass)-The European Bank for Reconstruction and <br>
Development issued a $13.7 million loan to Azerbaijan on Monday to <br>
help improve its airline infrastructure.<br>
	The loan will be used to increase the capacity of <br>
Azerbaijans airports, modernize their air-traffic controls and <br>
improve the safety of air transportation.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. BLACK SEA YOUTH COMMISSION TO MEET<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-A meeting, initiated by the international <br>
organization "Young People" and the Helsinki Citizen Assembly has <br>
been planned between youth organization representatives of the <br>
Black Sea basin on the border of Ijevan-Kazakh.<br>
	HCA coordinator for the Caucasus, Marten Van Garten, said <br>
that the meeting must contribute to ties between youth <br>
organizations of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, as well as Balkan <br>
states, Ukraine, Moldova and Russia.<br>
	"This action is aimed at reconciling, developing the level <br>
of relations between citizens and establishing democracy," Van <br>
Garten said. According to him, this meeting may be viewed as a <br>
sort of a youth congress that speaks out on behalf of citizens.<br>
	He noted that the meeting can become a continuation of a <br>
symbolic corridor between Ijevan and Kazakh that was opened in <br>
December of 1992 at the meeting of mothers and wives of Armenian <br>
and Azeri prisoners of war.<br>
<p>
<p>
9. GROUP WARNS OF MILITARY CONVERAGE<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-A Turkish broadcasting watchdog body warned <br>
television channels on Tuesday about their reporting of the <br>
military in a widening security scandal.<br>
	"Media organs must fulfill their legal obligations... <br>
Broadcasting must respect constitutional principles and democratic <br>
rules," the Radio and Television Supreme Council said in a <br>
statement.<br>
	The council, which has the authority to temporarily halt <br>
television broadcasts, said it was examining reports "covering <br>
some unfounded allegations and statements about the Turkish armed <br>
forces."<br>
	The media last week reported rumors that the military might <br>
intervene to clear up a scandal over alleged ties between <br>
officials and far-right gangsters. The influential armed forces <br>
have denied the charges.<br>
	The scandal erupted in November after a senior policeman and <br>
a gangster died in an accident in the same car. A government <br>
deputy who heads a militia that fights Kurds was injured in the <br>
crash.<br>
	Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakans coalition government last <br>
month threatened to clamp down on press criticism of state <br>
officials but a planned draft law restricting the media has yet to <br>
be debated in parliament.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. US VOICES CONCERN OVER TURKISH-IRAN TIES<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (Reuter)-The United States voiced concern Monday at <br>
NATO ally Turkeys decision to sign economic agreements with Iran <br>
last week in defiance of US calls to isolate Tehran.<br>
	"We remain concerned ... by all efforts to intensify <br>
cooperative relations with Iran until Tehran reforms its <br>
unacceptable international policies," State Department spokesman <br>
Glyn Davies said.<br>
	The United States accuses Iran of being the most active <br>
state sponsor of anti-Western terrorism. It also faults Tehran for <br>
opposing the Middle East process and allegedly seeking to acquire <br>
weapons of mass destruction.<br>
	"The Turkish government knows well our concerns, we <br>
communicate them to them frequently, and we will maintain an <br>
active dialogue with the government of Turkey," Davies told <br>
reporters at the departments daily briefing.<br>
	The agreements, designed to double trade between Turkey and <br>
Iran to $2 billion, were signed near the end of a four-day visit <br>
to Turkey last week by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.<br>
	Turkey has repeatedly ignored US warning regarding relations <br>
with Iran and continues to develop ties with that nation.<br>
	Turkey also went against US wishes over the summer during an <br>
Iraqi attack on Kurdish settlements in Northern Iraq on the <br>
Turkish border.<br>

Itar-Tass correspondent Konstantin Kazeyev: Mutual understanding between<br>
Russia and Iran is of vast importance for a peaceful settlement of the<br>
conflicts in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and region as a whole, Russian Foreign<br>
Minister Yevgeniy Primakov said after talks with his Iranian counterpart, Ali<br>
Akbar Velayati. <br>
<p>
At a news conference held in Tehran on Sunday night [22nd December], the<br>
ministers spoke about the proximity of the two countries' stances on the<br>
whole range of international issues. "We are glad to acknowledge the fact<br>
that our relations are developing in a positive direction," Primakov<br>
emphasized. <br>
<p>
There should be no foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf and the<br>
region should become a zone of peace and stability. This is in the interests<br>
of both Russia and Iran, Primakov said. The Russian Federation fully supports<br>
the aspirations of the Islamic Republic of Iran to normalize relations with<br>
the United Arab Emirates and other Persian Gulf states, Primakov emphasized. <br>
<p>
Ali Akbar Velayati described the atmosphere of the talks as one of<br>
friendliness and mutual trust. "Our relations are at the highest point for<br>
the last two centuries," Velayati believes. The coordination of policy and<br>
the establishment of mutual understanding between Moscow and Tehran are<br>
important stabilizing factors not only for the Central Asian region, but for<br>
the world as whole, the Iranian foreign minister said. <br>
<p>
At the same time he expressed his belief that it is first of all up to the<br>
countries of the region to ensure security in the Persian Gulf zone... <br>
<p>
Primakov says Russia and Iran will never plot against anyone <br>
<p>
Excerpt from report by Interfax news agency <br>
<p>
Both Russia and Iran are interested in preventing a greater military presence<br>
in the Persian Gulf and ensuring stability and peace there, Russian Foreign<br>
Minister Yevgeniy Primakov told a news conference in Tehran on Sunday [22nd<br>
December], following talks with the Iranian foreign minister. <br>
<p>
"The Russian side gladly met Iran's expressed willingness to improve<br>
relations both with the United Arab Emirates and other states in the Gulf<br>
area," Primakov said. "We believe that Iran should be a full-fledged member<br>
of the world community, and in this respect we welcome its contacts with<br>
other countries," he said. <br>
<p>
Primakov said Moscow and Tehran were united in their goal of stabilizing the<br>
region. Russian-Iranian cooperation in normalizing the situation and bringing<br>
about stability in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Nagornyy Karabakh is very<br>
important from this point of view, he said. <br>
<p>
In comment on the situation in the Middle East, Primakov hoped that all the<br>
countries will observe all Oslo agreements. Russia also backs observance of<br>
all verbal accords with respect to Syria and Israel, he said. "We oppose any<br>
actions and plans which may hamper the peace process in the Middle East,"<br>
Primakov stated. <br>
<p>
Speaking about Russian-Iranian relations, he said they "are developing<br>
satisfactorily".  He was satisfied with "the degree of confidence which<br>
exists" between Moscow and Tehran. The development of Russian-Iranian<br>
relations is not directed against the United States, Primakov had told<br>
reporters upon his arrival in Baghdad [as received]. "We will never<br>
mastermind a plot against anyone," he said. <br>
<p>
For his part, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told the news<br>
conference that security in the Gulf area should be secured by the Gulf<br>
states themselves. Velayati called on the Gulf states for closer cooperation<br>
and elimination of all differences on a peaceful basis. This is the best<br>
means to prevent giving other states a pretext to interfere in the Gulf<br>
states' affairs, he said... <br>

HEADLINE: Government source defends possible arms sales to Iran <br>
SOURCE: Interfax news agency, Moscow, in English 1559 gmt 20 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Russia does not rule out possible conclusion of new military contracts with<br>
Iran, a source in the Russian government told Interfax on Friday [20th<br>
December]. "This will depend on how the post-COCOM [Coordinating Committee<br>
for Multilateral Export Controls] order develops and what place Russia will<br>
have in it," the source said. <br>
<p>
"We believe that in this case there should be no discrimination against us or<br>
against Iran. If there are some agreements limiting military supplies, they<br>
should apply to everyone," the source vc said. Russia is currently<br>
"implementing the previous contracts for arms supplies to Iran concluded as<br>
early as in former Soviet times" , the source said. <br>
<p>
"Our stand on this matter is clear. Russian arms supplies to Tehran are not<br>
in any way changing the balance of power in the region, and in particular in<br>
the Persian Gulf, where the advantage is not Iran's either in terms of arms<br>
quantity or in the rate of its increase," the source said. <br>
<p>
The source declined to indicate the volume of military-technological<br>
cooperation between Russia and Iran, saying only that it was below<br>
Russian-Iranian "civil trade turnover" which totalled 370m dollars last year.<br>
<p>
<p>
Russia is not satisfied with the level of trade-economic links with Iran, the<br>
source said. The development of bilateral economic links is impaired by<br>
regional conflicts in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Nagornyy Karabakh, and the<br>
unsettled issue of the Caspian Sea's status, the source said. "We consider<br>
Iran a very important partner. We see it as our task to put in joint efforts<br>
in order to make the region calm, from both the political and military points<br>
of view, for unhindered development of economic links," the source said... <br>

HEADLINE: Armenian nuclear power plant to have another power unit <br>
SOURCE: Itar-Tass news agency (World Service), Moscow, in English 1806 gmt 20<br>
Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Preparations are under way to provide Armenia's nuclear power station with a<br>
new generating unit, Itar-Tass news agency reported from Yerevan. <br>
<p>
The project, which will cost 1.5-2bn dollars, has still to be approved by the<br>
Armenian government, the agency quoted the plant's director, Suren Azatyan,<br>
as telling journalists in Yerevan on 20th December. <br>
<p>
The plant, which produces 40 per cent of the republic's energy, was<br>
decommissioned following the huge earthquake which hit Armenia vc in December<br>
1988. It went back into operation in late 1995 in response to the acute<br>
energy crisis in the republic. <br>

HEADLINE: New criminal links to police unveiled in Turkish mafia scandal <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France Presse, December 23, 1996 (Umit Enginsoy)<br>
<p>
The Turkish intelligence service has uncovered new links between drug<br>
smugglers and corrupt police, press reports said Monday, in a fresh twist to<br>
a massive scandal over mafia infiltration of the state security apparatus. <br>
<p>
A woman, who was caught with heroin worth 250,000 dollars at Istanbul airport<br>
earlier this month, is understood to have links with the personal guard of<br>
the special operations chief at the police directorate, according to an<br>
intelligence report. <br>
<p>
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan revealed the report at a Sunday meeting with<br>
President Suleyman Demirel and leaders of political parties vc , the liberal<br>
Istanbul-based daily Milliyet said. <br>
<p>
Demirel called the meeting in an effort to reach a political consensus over<br>
how to tackle the controversy, which has rocked Turkey for nearly two months.<br>
<p>
<p>
The scandal broke on November 3 when wanted mafia boss Abdullah Catli, a<br>
former ultra-nationalist militant, and a senior police chief were killed in a<br>
car crash in western Turkey. <br>
<p>
Sedat Bucak, a Kurdish parliamentary deputy from Foreign Minister Tansu<br>
Ciller's conservative True Path Party, was seriously injured while travelling<br>
in the same car. <br>
<p>
The incident, which exposed links between police, politicians and organised<br>
crime, created uproar in Turkey and led to the resignation of interior<br>
minister Mehmet Agar, who has been accused by the press of personal<br>
involvement. <br>
<p>
"Those gangs operating within the state are understood to have been active<br>
since the early 1980s," the main conservative opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz<br>
said on television late Sunday. <br>
<p>
"Turkey must get rid of this embarrassing situation and all those involved in<br>
this. No matter who they are, they must be punished," said Yilmaz, who is<br>
also a former prime minister. <br>
<p>
According to press reports, Catli had been employed by the Turkish state for<br>
operations outside the country, notably against leaders of the anti-Turkish<br>
Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) in the 1980s. <br>
<p>
The ASALA claimed responsibility for assassinating nearly 40 Turkish<br>
diplomats and officials abroad in the 1970s. <br>
<p>
Catli and three policemen, who later became personal guards of Bucak, were<br>
also allegedly involved in the killing of a Kurdish tycoon who owned a chain<br>
of casinos. <br>
<p>
Media reports have said several high-ranking government officials were<br>
probably linked with Catli's affairs. <br>
<p>
Milliyet said the intelligence service report revealed at Sunday's crisis<br>
meeting cited the names of 58 people who might be involved in the scandal.<br>
Their identities were not made public. <br>
<p>
"It seems these gangs were originally formed to carry out tasks for the<br>
state, but in the early 1990s they began to pursue their own purposes,"<br>
Yilmaz said. "In both cases the existence of such entities are totally<br>
unacceptable in a democratic society," he said. <br>
<p>
Yilmaz, Ciller and leaders of two left-wing parties and a small<br>
ultra-rightist party also took part in the president's meeting. <br>
<p>
In a statement he released later, Demirel urged parliament and all state<br>
institutions to facilitate an investigation launched into the scandal. <br>
<p>
Political analysts said the parliamentary immunity of some deputies,<br>
including Agar and Bucak, might be lifted soon. <br>
<p>
Yilmaz said he would present Demirel and judicial officials with additional<br>
information and documents he had regarding the scandal. <br>

<p>
A meeting between Azeri leaders and Russian defence minister Igor Rodionov<br>
will be held in Baku today to discuss a number of problems pertaining to<br>
further cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan, said the Russian defence<br>
minister who had arrived in Baku on a one-day working visit at the invitation<br>
of Azeri President Heidar aliyev.  <br>
<p>
Rodionov told journalists at Baku airport that "it is necessary to do<br>
everything possible so that friendship, good-neighborly relations and mutual<br>
assistance strengthen and develop in the interests of the people of the two<br>
countries."  <br>
<p>
Rodionov pointed out that many definite agreements in military and technical<br>
field had been reached vc by the two countries,stressing that some details of<br>
the mutually advantageous cooperation would be specified at today's talks in<br>
Baku.  <br>
<p>
Rodionov said that at forthcoming meetings with Azeri President Heidar Aliyev<br>
and Defence Minister Safar Abiyev he would discuss issues connected with<br>
further exploitation of the Gabelinskaya radar which has been operating in<br>
the centre of Azerbaijan for ten years by now.  This is one of the biggest<br>
radars in the post-Soviet space serviced by Russian military experts and<br>
whose status has not yet been determined since the disintegration of the<br>
former Soviet Union.  <br>
<p>
According to Azeri military sources, a protocol on military and technical<br>
cooperation between the two countries would be signed upon completion of the<br>
meeting in Baku.  <br>

HEADLINE: Cooperation with Vatican Does Not Erase Identity-Catholicos <br>
SOURCE: Itar-Tass, December 23, 1996 (Dicran Liloian)<br>
 <br>
The head of the Armenian Apostolic Church said on Monday that contacts with<br>
the Vatican did not mean a refusal from its underlying principles. <br>
<p>
Catholicos Karekin I told reporters in his residence at Echmiadzin that the<br>
Armenian Apostolic Church still reject the Council of Chalcedon of 451, which<br>
remains its main characteristic feature. <br>
<p>
However, time for dialogue has come, and differences in belief should not be<br>
regarded as obstacles to cooperation among all Christians, Karekin I said. <br>
<p>
With time, relations with other denominations should be purged of<br>
misunderstanding and centuries-old differences, in an attempt to reach a vc<br>
union of churches, he noted. <br>
<p>
He said all denominations, preserving their specific features, belong to one<br>
Christ and one church.  However, unity is not uniformity, he stressed. <br>
<p>
He said his forthcoming visit to the Vatican should be viewed as a new stage<br>
of Armenia's participation in the ecumenical movement and in the development<br>
of inter-denominational ties. <br>
<p>
He said he had made his first visit after accession to the throne of<br>
Catholicos to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II. <br>
<p>
The Catholicos said a permanent body should be established to promote<br>
relations with the Roman Catholic Church.  It is important that the headsof<br>
the two churches do not met only  once in 25 years, he noted. <br>
<p>
According to him, the Armenian Apostolic Church recognises the Armenian<br>
Catholic Church as a historically established one and regularly cooperates<br>
with its exarchs. <br>

<p>
Russia and Azerbaijan on Monday failed to sign an agreement on military and<br>
technical cooperation, Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian<br>
Defence Ministry's Department of International Military Cooperation, said<br>
after the end of the meeting between Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov<br>
and President of Azerbaijan Geidar Aliyev.  <br>
<p>
According to the Russian general, the ceremony of the signing Of this<br>
agreement was put off at Aliyev's proposal, who considered that such<br>
bilateral documents should be more specific and comprehensive. <br>
<p>
At the same time, Ivashov expressed the hope that this agreement, as well as<br>
an interstate protocol vc on military cooperation, would be signed in the<br>
near future.  <br>
<p>
During the meeting, the sides exchanged on a broad range of issues,including<br>
the military and political situation in the region, in particular, the<br>
settlement of the Karabakh conflict, the general said.  <br>
<p>
The two sides also discussed the extension of cooperation between Russia and<br>
Azerbaijan, especially military and technical one, Ivashov said.  <br>
<p>
He said the sides had reached an agreement on the development of bilateral<br>
military relations and are expected to work out measures to continue a<br>
dialogue.  <br>
<p>
The general said that the parties had separately discussed the question of<br>
the Gabelin radar, located on the territory of Azerbaijan and operated by<br>
Russian military specialists.   <br>
<p>
In this connection, Ivashov said that there was a special assignmentby the<br>
Azerbaijani President to the Defence Ministry to begin work out an agreement<br>
on the issue.  <br>
<p>
On the whole, Aliyev described Rodionov's visit to Baku as a step forward of<br>
the development of military cooperation between the two countries.  <br>

HEADLINE: Azerbaijan Upgrades Air Navigation System with EBRD Loan <br>
SOURCE: Universal News Services, December 23, 1996<br>
<p>
The Civil Aviation Authority in Azerbaijan (AZAL) is to improve<br>
aviationsafety and expand  traffic-handling capacity with the help of a US@<br>
13.7 million (ECU 11 million) loan provided  by the European Bank for<br>
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  <br>
<p>
Stijn Albregts, Director of the EBRD's Azerbaijan team, said:"The EBRD's loan<br>
should help  AZAL achieve greater reliability and a higher standard of<br>
services and maintenance.   The  revamped air navigation system will vc meet<br>
international aviation standards set by the  international Civil Aviation<br>
Organisation. The improvements should also enable AZAL to  eet  future<br>
traffic demand and accommodate new routes, thereby increasing its foreign<br>
 exchange  arnings." <br>
<p>
The loan will help to finance an urgently needed capital investmentprogramme<br>
to modernise Azerbaijan's air navigation system. This includes air traffic<br>
control services throughout Azeri airspace as well as terminal and airport<br>
control services in the capital city of Baku. Rehabilitation of the control<br>
tower complex to house the air traffic control equipment and to provide<br>
operation rooms will also be financed by the loan. <br>
<p>
After achieving independence in 1991, Azerbaijan gained full and exclusive<br>
control of its airspace. This covers most of the national airspace as well as<br>
an important area over the international waters of the Caspian Sea and a<br>
portion of airspace in the north, over the territory of the Russian<br>
Federation. AZAL, established in April 1992 as a fully state-owned autonomous<br>
commercial entity, is curently the sole authority and provider for civil<br>
aviation activities in Azerbaijan. <br>

<p>
   Report by Aleksandr Belonovskiy under the "Chechnya" rubric:  "'A Third<br>
Force' with Russian Shoulder-Boards?"<br>
<p>
  Something inexplicable is going on in Chechnya.  It seems that the rebels<br>
have gotten what they asked for.  Russian troops are being pulled out of the<br>
republic on schedule, the field commanders of yesterday are pasting up<br>
leaflets calling on people to vote for them in the upcoming elections.  Yet<br>
emergencies occur in the republic every day and people continue to get<br>
killed.  Over over the past 10 days several murders have been committed.<br>
   The Chechen leadership was swift to state through Movladi Udugov that<br>
children were blown up on a radio-controlled land-mine.  According to the<br>
Russian Internal Affairs Ministry's theory, this accident was caused by<br>
carelessness in the handling of a projectile.  Allegedly the kids were<br>
trying to look at what was inside the "iron toy"...<br>
   Clearly, the Chechens are no longer content with simply blaming all their<br>
woes on a mythical third force, of which everyone has heard, but which no<br>
one has ever seen.  The nation is beginning to split into small clans, which<br>
are pursuing only their own interests and on which Groznyy has very little<br>
influence.  An outside enemy that could rally everyone together has<br>
disappeared.  Where can a new one be gotten?  And there you go, a series of<br>
heinous terrorist acts take place as if they were ordered.  Who is to blame?<br>
The conclusion that readily suggests itself is as follows:  Of course, this<br>
is the third force in the shape of Russian special services.  This is the<br>
enemy plotting wicked designs: To thwart elections, to destabilize the<br>
situation, to unleash another war.<br>
   Most important, there is no need to search for the actual perpetrators.<br>
In a tiny republic everything that happens in the morning becomes common<br>
knowledge by noon.  For this reason finding the killers will hardly present<br>
any difficulty.  But who will dare touch them?  No one has abolished the<br>
laws of blood revenge.  So any attempt to bring all armed men to one common<br>
lawful denominator is bound to trigger local strife or even civil war.<br>
Strange as it might be, our special services acted in the most dignified<br>
manner in this situation.  They simply ignored the Chechen allegations.<br>

   Politics Desk analysis:  "What Lebed's Mother-in-Law Is Going to Be Now?<br>
If His Brother Has Become a Premier"<br>
<p>
  It turns out that Aleksandr Lebed has a plane of his own.  It has been<br>
rumored that it is on it that Lebed went to Kemerovo for a powerful<br>
financial support, and also for the creation of a regional organization<br>
called "third force" (Yavlinskiy, Fedorov, Lebed).<br>
   The mysterious trip was explained at the general's press service<br>
approximately like this:  There is no point for Aleksandr Ivanovich [Lebed]<br>
to take trips to Kuzbass and other poverty regions "for financial backing."<br>
Sponsors call on him in his Moscow office of their own accord, and offer him<br>
money of their own accord and thus there is no point for Lebed to chase<br>
money all over the boundless vastness of Russia.  Lebed's trips pursue<br>
different objectives.  First, he has to see for himself the situation in the<br>
region and compare "government "information with the reports he is getting<br>
from his regional representatives.  Second, Lebed's supporters are urging to<br>
come over and talks with them because they, too, would like to compare<br>
"government" information on Lebed with what he says about himself, his<br>
future and the future of Russia.<br>
   The "third force" variant was clarified at "Yabloko" [headquarters]:  it<br>
is true that the regional leaders of the Honor and the Motherland], Yabloko<br>
and Svyatoslav Fedorov's party  signed a month ago an agreement on a<br>
simultaneous nomination of seven candidates in the elections for a local<br>
legislative assembly to be held next Sunday -- 29 December.<br>
   Thus it becomes clear that Lebed's trip to Kemerovo and to his brother in<br>
Khakassia, is more connected with day-today election affairs rather than<br>
with trying to procure money and create blocs.  More attention, perhaps,<br>
deserves the victory of the younger Lebed (Colonel Aleksey Lebed) in the<br>
elections for head of the executive power (premier of the government) of<br>
Khakassia.  The little brother rather haughtily spoke (in an NTV interview)<br>
about help from his elder brother:  Can two meetings with the voters by some<br>
sort of general count in comparison with seventy meetings with the colonel?<br>
   It appears that there are grounds to conclude that Lebed said everything<br>
in sufficiently precise terms in Kemerovo:  I need no "third force," I have<br>
my own....  Most likely, the formation of "Lebed's force" will consist<br>
precisely in illuminating by his name of those somewhat weak politically but<br>
devoted to their "patron" for various reasons.  What such a party of<br>
professionals is capable of pull off is another matter.  And why should not<br>
it pull off something given backing from "Moscow banks"?<br>

Kommersant-Daily 24 December 1996 pages 1, 3<br>
<p>
   Report by Andrey Smirnov:  "Only Dudayev's State Is Stable"<br>
<p>
  The presidential elections in Chechnya are slightly more than a month<br>
away.  Yesterday four candidates -- Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, Aslan Maskhadov,<br>
Shamil Basayev, and Movladi Udugov -- submitted to the Central Electoral<br>
Commission the 10,000 signatures required for registration.  With the<br>
election campaign in full swing, the Chechen authorities are doing their<br>
utmost so as to convince the outside world of their ability to ensure<br>
stability.  In the meantime, the past several days have seen yet more signs<br>
of the brouhaha reigning in Chechnya, ranging from new hostage takings to<br>
yesterday's decision by the Chechen parliament to award the rank of<br>
generalissimo to Dzhokhar Dudayev posthumously.<br>
   Yesterday the Chechen deputies made yet another decision that has little<br>
to do with the logic of Chechen realities.  The parliament requested the<br>
local electoral commission to oblige presidential candidates to submit<br>
without delay requests for suspending them from office during the election<br>
campaign.  Clearly no one will be upset if terrorist Basayev suspends his<br>
infamous activity.  But if Yandarbiyev, Maskhadov, and Udugov relinquish the<br>
authority that is already slipping through their fingers, the development of<br>
events in the republic will become absolutely unpredictable.  The killing of<br>
the Red Cross workers, the abduction of militiamen, the disappearance of<br>
delegations arriving in Chechnya, continuing skirmishes and "accidental"<br>
killings are only a part of the picture.  Another part of it, which visibly<br>
contrasts with the first one, is the Chechen authorities' desire, first, to<br>
convince Moscow of the need to support them materially and, second, to<br>
"stake out" their considerable oil interests.<br>
   This was the thrust of the appeal to the Russian authorities by<br>
Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company of Chechnya<br>
(YUNKO).  Currently the former chief of the Chechen delegation in talks with<br>
the federal side is dealing with matters of restoring the Chechen fuel and<br>
energy sector.  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow he denied, in<br>
particular, that the oil factor had played any role in unleashing or ending<br>
the Chechen war.  In his view, the latter could only be achieved thanks to<br>
the victory of the "party of peace" in the Russian leadership.  At the same<br>
time Yarikhanov cautioned that the war was far from over; it was only<br>
suspended.  The definitive peace will only be possible after the<br>
cancellation of the pieces of legislation that gave the pretext for starting<br>
combat operations.<br>
   The absence of "formal peace" does not prevent Chechen leaders at all<br>
from demanding assistance in restoring their war-ravaged economy from their<br>
erstwhile enemies.  The issue is first of all the Chechen sector of a main<br>
pipeline connecting Caspian shelf deposits with the oil terminals of<br>
Novorossiysk.  Groznyy appears to see the pipeline not only as the<br>
foundation of the republic's future economic prosperity -- the Caspian<br>
international consortium is ready to pay $15.67 for the transit of one tonne<br>
of oil -- but also as an economic basis to shore up Chechen independence.<br>
At the same time the Groznyy authorities count on Russian assistance for the<br>
restoration of the fuel and energy sector.  According to Yarikhanov, at the<br>
initial stage alone it will require 302 billion rubles -- the Chechens<br>
estimate the total damage done to the industry by war at 8 trillion.  So<br>
officials in Groznyy express their astonishment at seeing corresponding<br>
Russian agencies display no particular enthusiasm about cooperation with the<br>
republic.  In particular, the YUNKO head expressed his displeasure with the<br>
stance of the Fuel and Energy Ministry, which, as he put it, "shows no<br>
interest" in the plans for restoring the Chechen fuel and energy sector,<br>
although they were "included as a separate item" on the November agreement<br>
between Viktor Chernomyrdin and Aslan Maskhadov.<br>
   The Fuel and Energy Ministry disagreed with this assessment, however.  A<br>
spokesman for the ministry told your Kommersant-Daily correspondent that the<br>
agreement was being drawn up and that this work was slowed down only by<br>
uncertainty with regard to sources of financing.  To all appearances, no<br>
clarity in this matter should be expected in the near future.  Plans for an<br>
inflow of private investment in Chechnya will remain wishful thinking as<br>
long as terrorist acts, hostage takings, and similar occurrences continue in<br>
the republic.  Be it a matter of transporting oil, restoring the economy, or<br>
conducting elections in accordance with democratic standards -- it will also<br>
require guarantees to ensure at least the security of those who can help the<br>
Chechens carry out these undertakings.<br>
   The restoration of an oil pipeline and an oil refinery will require not<br>
only money, but also involvement of Russian specialists.  Chechnya has no<br>
qualified specialists of its own -- even at the best of times, when the<br>
republic's oil sector processed over 20 million tonnes of oil, the share of<br>
local specialists in the industry did not exceed 1 percent.  There can<br>
hardly be any doubt as to the fact that in current conditions no Russian<br>
specialists will go to Chechnya -- nor will foreign observers, without whose<br>
participation presidential elections are unlikely to be deemed free and<br>
democratic.<br>
   Yarikhanov devoted a major part of his news conference to attempts to<br>
assure that the current Chechen authorities can give security guarantees to<br>
the people who could help it restore its devastated economy.  Yet he could<br>
never give coherent answers to the perplexed questions of journalists --<br>
mainly Western correspondents, because for their Russian counterparts the<br>
criminal situation in Chechnya has already become commonplace -- as to what<br>
guarantees can one talk about after the killing of the Red Cross workers.<br>
Just as clumsy were attempts by Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov<br>
to deny the obvious.  Yesterday he claimed that the ID's of Chechen Army<br>
servicemen found on those killed in the Monday skirmish with Internal<br>
Affairs Ministry officers in the Prigorodnyy Rayon of North Ossetia had been<br>
planted by some "enemies from the party of war."<br>
   As the elections draw closer such incidents will become increasingly<br>
frequent, there is no doubt about it.  And this is attributable not so much<br>
to the sinister designs by the enemies of Chechen independence than to the<br>
internal struggle among separatists themselves.  The fact that Yandarbiyev,<br>
Maskhadov, Udugov, and Basayev, who are formally members of the same team,<br>
had their candidacies nominated at the same time proves the absence of unity<br>
in the Chechen leadership.  Moreover, the presence of people similar to<br>
Salman Raduyev on the Chechen political scene -- the degree of his sanity<br>
can be judged if only by his resolution to continue carrying out "Dzhokhar<br>
Dudayev's orders" -- does not arouse any optimism as to the prospects for<br>
achieving stability in Chechnya any time soon.<br>

HEADLINE:  A Tale of Two Elections<br>
SOURCE:  The Wall Street Journal Europe, December 23, 1996 (Ms. Pilon is the<br>
director of programs for Europe and Asia at th e Washington- based<br>
International Foundation for Election Systems. She is the author of "The<br>
Bloody Flag: Post-Communist Nationalism in Eastern Europe -- Spot light on<br>
Romania" (Rutgers University Press, 1992). <br>
<p>
This was a good season for democracy in some parts of Eastern Europe. A few<br>
post-Communist governments, notably in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Romania, were<br>
pushed from office. Two elections in particular this season -- in Romania and<br>
Armenia -- showed vc what a fine line there is for many of these countries<br>
between moving toward democracy and bogging down.<br>
<p>
In November, Romanians danced in the streets chanting that "Iliescu is no<br>
more." For the first time in nearly four decades, their head of state had<br>
been removed by peaceful ballot. Free and fair elections, however, were by no<br>
means assured until the very last moment: Only a few days before the election<br>
there was some evidence that the government may have been planning to rig the<br>
election, but with a bit of ingenuity on the part of U.S. and Romanian<br>
experts the tables were turned on the Central Election Bureau and the<br>
elections proceeded in a surprisingly orderly and legal manner.  <br>
<p>
By contrast, a nation further east did not fare as well: The Armenian<br>
presidential elections on Sept. 22 were contested in the Constitutional<br>
Court. Serious electoral violations were committed in full view of the<br>
international community. Yet the court decided, on Nov. 22, to validate those<br>
results; it is unlikely, however, that the court decision can salvage the<br>
reputation of the current administration.  <br>
<p>
Romania may well have overtaken Armenia on the road to democracy and<br>
prosperity. Armenia had been in the vanguard, the first Soviet republic to<br>
declare independence in 1991 and blessed with a reformist president. Romania<br>
hardly changed course when, after the death of its dictator Nicolae<br>
Ceausescu, the Communist Party's former ideology secretary Ion Iliescu<br>
immediately took over. Five years later much has changed.  <br>
<p>
In Romania in mid-October, the recently formed electoral body ( the CEB)<br>
announced its intention to include some newly formed nongovernmental<br>
organizations to observe the elections, as it had done in 1992.   In effect,<br>
these "phantom" NGOs would have squeezed out nearly two-thirds of  the 14,000<br>
bona fide observers necessary to ensure a fair result by using an  old<br>
lottery system that would have limited the number of observers assigned per<br>
polling station. When the CEB, however, was presented with an alternative<br>
 system -- devised by an American election expert and Romanian computer<br>
specialists working with the International Foundation for Election Systems --<br>
 the commission could find no arguments against its use. The system involved<br>
a software package that allocated all available observers equitably  to every<br>
district (judet). CEB members watched, amazed, as the entire exercise was<br>
completed in less than an hour.  <br>
<p>
They still had another trump card. Only four days before the election, it<br>
appeared that domestic observers were going to be banned from watching the<br>
counting of the ballots, the most crucial part of the process. Again local<br>
democratic activists and IFES acted together, producing a detailed memorandum<br>
to the CEB explaining that the intent of the existing electoral law allows<br>
for domestic observers to be part of the counting process. The next day, the<br>
CEB reversed its decision. The elections proceded and were deemed free and<br>
fair by the international organizations such as the Organization for Security<br>
and Cooperation in Europe present. <br>
 <br>
Armenia, on the other hand, was almost an electoral mirror image  of Romania.<br>
Most importantly, the Central Election Commission did not retreat  in the<br>
face of international  pressure and allow domestic polling observers.  While<br>
the CEC argued that its law does not permit them, IFES and others pointed<br>
 out that no law forbids them either. Indeed, in the 1995 elections domestic<br>
observers had been allowed.    Also, on election day, official tallies were<br>
not uniformly posted according to Armenia's election law. Worse, there was a<br>
large discrepancy,  mainly in Yerevan, among the ballots counted and the<br>
number of coupons indicating how many people had picked up ballots. Since the<br>
margin of votes needed by President Ter-Petrossian to win was about 20,000,<br>
that discrepancy alone would be enough to bring the whole process into<br>
question since it exceeded that number. In fact there were several other<br>
incidents of electoral fraud. They were all brought to the attention of the<br>
CEC by the international agencies present and the losing candidates. But no<br>
credible response was forthcoming. <br>
<p>
The hope is that Armenia will soon be back on the road to democracy.<br>
President Ter-Petrossian, considered a friend of the U.S. has been perceived<br>
as a man of progress and peace, with every intention to take his nation into<br>
the post-Communist era. He is also trying to walk a fine line between  Russia<br>
and Iran while being subjected to blockades from Turkey and neighboring<br>
Azerbaijan. But, as much of Eastern Europe is now proving, there is little<br>
that can substitute for a free and fair election.   <br>

HEADLINE: Turkish president meets party leaders to discuss mafia scandal  <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France Presse, December 22, 1996<br>
<p>
President Suleyman Demirel met Sunday with Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan<br>
and five other party leaders to discuss allegations of mafia infiltration<br>
into the state's security apparatus. <br>
<p>
"The president and the government should do everything necessary to unveil<br>
what is still in the dark and those responsible should be punished,"<br>
conservative main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz said Saturday. <br>
<p>
Yilmaz, Erbakan's coalition partner, and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller as<br>
well vc as leaders of two left-wing parties and a small ultra-rightist party<br>
took part in the meeting at the presidential palace. <br>
<p>
The nation has been rocked by the scandal which erupted on November 3 when<br>
wanted mafia boss Abdullah Catli, a former ultra-nationalist militant, and a<br>
senior police chief were killed in a car crash in western Turkey. <br>
<p>
Also in the same car was Sedat Bucak, a Kurdish parliamentary deputy from<br>
Ciller's conservative True Path Party. He survived the accident but suffered<br>
serious injuries. <br>
<p>
The incident, which exposed links among police, some politicians and<br>
organised crime, created a furor in Turkey leading to the resignation of<br>
Interior Minister Mehmet Agar and the sacking of Istanbul's security<br>
director. <br>
<p>
According to press reports, Catli had been employed by Turkey for operations<br>
outside the country, notably against leaders of the anti-Turkish Armenian<br>
Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) in the 1980s. The ASALA<br>
claimed responsibility for assassinating nearly 40 Turkish diplomats and<br>
officials abroad in the 1970s. <br>
<p>
Catli and three policemen, who were personal guards of Bucak, were also<br>
allegedly involved in the killing of a Kurdish tycoon who owned a chain of<br>
casinos. <br>
<p>
Media reports have said several high-ranking government officials are likely<br>
to have been involved in Catli's affairs. <br>
<p>
Yilmaz has accused Erbakan of failing to launch a comprehensive and<br>
high-level inquiry into the allegations, leaving police to investigate the<br>
events. <br>

HEADLINE: Primakov: Russia to integrate Iran into international society <br>
SOURCE:  Deutsche Presse-Agentur, December 22, 1996<br>
<p>
Russia will help to integrate Iran into the international community, Russian<br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Sunday in Teheran. <br>
<p>
"Iran is an important country and given the high level of mutual trust,<br>
Russia will try to integrate Iran into the international society as a fully<br>
authorised member with equal rights," Primakov told newsmen at the Iranian<br>
foreign ministry. <br>
<p>
Primakov arrived in Teheran earlier Sunday and vc was greeted at the airport<br>
by his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati. <br>
<p>
He said that political and economic ties between Teheran and Moscow have an<br>
upward trend and termed future prospect of bilateral ties as "quite<br>
promising". <br>
<p>
Primakov and Velayati termed the first round of their talks as "sincere and<br>
frank". The talks covered issues ranging from Tajikistan, Nagorno Karabakh<br>
and Afghanistan to the Gulf and the Middle East. <br>
<p>
"Russia is in favour of a peaceful Persian Gulf region and welcomes any<br>
understanding between Iran and the littoral states," Primakov said. Regarding<br>
the Middle East, he said that Russia wants previous agreements, such as the<br>
Oslo agreement, to be realised. <br>
<p>
Velayati in turn said ties between Teheran and Moscow were at "their best<br>
level in the last two decades" and said that two states are determined to<br>
continue this suitable trend based upon mutual respect and non-interference<br>
in the internal affairs of the other country. <br>
<p>
Primakov is on his first visit as Russian Foreign Minister to Teheran but<br>
according to Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister, Mahmud Vaezi, he has been in<br>
Teheran five times before under other positions. <br>
<p>
Upon arrival in Teheran with a 15-man delegation, Primakov said that<br>
relations between Teheran and Moscow were very good and constantly expanding,<br>
and both sides had many common topics to talk about during this "important<br>
visit". <br>
<p>
He added that his talks with Iranian officials will focus more on the peace<br>
talks in Tajikistan, which are currently being held between the Tajik<br>
government and the Islamic opposition groups in Moscow where Vaezi<br>
represented Iran. <br>
<p>
Velayati said due to the Iranian influence among the Islamic opposition group<br>
in Tajikistan and Russia's influence in the Tajik government, the two sides<br>
could have an effective co-operation in settling the crisis in Tajikistan. <br>
<p>
Primakov rejected the assumption that his visit would be a move against U.S.<br>
interests. "Russia will never make any plot against anybody," Primakov said,<br>
laughing with Velayati. <br>
<p>
During the Russian foreign minister's three-day-stay in Teheran, the two<br>
sides are supposed to sign three protocols in connection with Tajikistan,<br>
Afghanistan and the Caspian Sea. <br>
<p>
Primakov will also meet with President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has just<br>
returned from a state visit to Turkey, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq<br>
Nuri and Vice-Speaker Hassan Rowhani.  dpa fm ba <br>

HEADLINE: Chechen official holds "fruitless" talks in Moscow on oil transit<br>
via Chechnya <br>
SOURCE: RIA news agency, Moscow, in English 1757 gmt 20 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Russia is not ready to sign an agreement on terms for the forthcoming<br>
delivery of so-called "early" Azeri oil across Chechnya, RIA was told today<br>
by Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, the president of the Chechen oil company Yunco<br>
[Southern Oil Company], now in Moscow to conduct talks with Russia's Fuel and<br>
Energy Ministry . <br>
<p>
According to Yarikhanov, his meeting today with the deputy minister, Viktor<br>
Kudryavyy, turned out to be "fruitless" because "the ministry was totally<br>
unprepared for joint work on the document".  He also said that Kudryavyy had<br>
informed the Chechen side that vc a special working group under the auspices<br>
of the Fuel and Energy Ministry had been set up to "seriously consider their<br>
proposals" . The stance of the ministry and possibly documents drawn up by<br>
the Russian side will be discussed at a meeting in Groznyy which, according<br>
to Yarikhanov, will take place early next year. <br>
<p>
The Yunco president's response to reports by some mass media that Groznyy<br>
wants to join the Azeri consortium was that "it was all the invention of the<br>
biased Russian press" . Meanwhile, according to Baku, Chechen emissaries who<br>
visited the Azeri capital earlier for talks with the management of the<br>
Azerbaijan International Operating Company made it clear that the issue of<br>
safe transportation of early Azeri oil to Novorossiysk across Chechnya<br>
heavily depends on Chechnya' s admission to the consortium. In addition to<br>
that, Groznyy's delegate Ruslan Abdurzakov [as received] said in Baku that no<br>
oil will go from Azerbaijan to Russia if Chechnya remains outside this "<br>
contract of the century" ... <br>

HEADLINE:  Family Life Is an Important Part of the Turkish Culture<br>
SOURCE:  Market Europe, December 1, 1996<br>
<p>
History, culture, and geography have all made Turkey a country where<br>
turbulence is a natural state of affairs. <br>
<p>
The past two years have been no exception to this pattern, and current events<br>
make it unlikely that there will be any substantial change in the next two<br>
years.<br>
<p>
The people of the country and those doing business vc with them are<br>
weathering stormy times.<br>
<p>
Turkey's economy in the 1990s has lurched from peak to trough and back again.<br>
The breakaway growth that made the country a hot property in the 1980s is a<br>
thing of the past. Gross domestic product (GDP)contracted in 1991, rebounded<br>
mildly in 1992 and 1993, then dipped 5  percent in 1994 as the country was<br>
plunged into the worst economic crisis in its modern history. There was a<br>
recovery in 1995, and modest growth of 2.8 percent is forecast for 1996. <br>
<p>
The economic crisis, set off by rapid deterioration of public accounts, led<br>
to triple-digit inflation that has been trimmed only marginally since.<br>
Inflation for the first six months of 1996 was 44.8 percent. The inflation<br>
rate has forced successive devaluations of the Turkish lira. Turkish<br>
wage-earners are stretched to maintain living standards.  <br>
<p>
Political problems compound Turkey's instability. The long-running war<br>
against the Kurdish terrorist groups (PKK) forces diversion of vast resources<br>
to the military and damages the country's democratic image abroad.  <br>
<p>
Relations with Iran, Syria, and Iraq are perennially difficult, and the<br>
international trade boycott of the latter has cost Turkey an estimated US$27<br>
billion in lost commerce. Tensions have flared sporadically with the old<br>
enemy, Greece, most recently over a disputed island territory and the thorny<br>
issue of Cyprus.  <br>
<p>
Internally, a series of ineffective coalition governments have eroded public<br>
trust and ceded ground to the Islamic cause of the Welfare Party (RP). This<br>
year the RP entered government for the first time in a coalition with the<br>
True Path Party (DYP). Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has moderated his<br>
Islamic rhetoric since taking power, and at the city level the RP's municipal<br>
administration is the most honest in years. <br>
<p>
Yet Erbakan's cultivation of ties with Iran has not helped to placate fears<br>
at home and abroad that Turkey's cherished tradition of secular democracy is<br>
under threat.    <br>
<p>
Hopes of Turkey joining the European Union remain alive, and there are those<br>
within the country who view this as a panacea for the country's economic<br>
ills. Turkey has entered into a customs union with the EU, which has removed<br>
tariffs on manufactured goods, a step arguably more important for its<br>
symbolic cementing of European ties than for any impact on trade. The Kurdish<br>
question is likely to have a negative impact on Turkey's attempt to move<br>
closer to Europe while encouraging further cooperation with its Middle<br>
Eastern neighbors.  <br>
<p>
Strangers to turmoil they are not, yet Turkish people have seen the optimism<br>
of the 1980s shredded in the 1990s. Confidence is lacking at both the<br>
business and individual levels. After the crisis of 1994, investors and<br>
workers are only now finding encouragement to participate and take risks.<br>
There is still a tendency for consumers to abstain from major purchases and<br>
to measure present spending against the cost of inflation.  <br>
<p>
What keeps Turkey ticking is the strength of its family system and a strong<br>
sense of nationalism. Like people in other Southern European countries, Turks<br>
measure their well-being in terms less individual than collective.    <br>
<p>
When doubts arise over employment or earnings, the family is there to help.<br>
In a wider sense, this collective identity makes Turks ready to weather<br>
change in the interests of the nation.    <br>
<p>
Land and people - Nationality is important to the people of Turkey.<br>
Regardless of religion and lifestyle, they are proud to identify themselves<br>
as Turks before all else. This is despite the fact that theirs is a large<br>
nation of diverse ethnic groups and lifestyles.    <br>
<p>
Turkey straddles the Sea of Marmara, which divides Europe and Asia. The small<br>
European part of Turkey, called Thrace, measures 24,000 square kilometers.<br>
The remaining 757,000 square kilometers are called Anatolla and are part of<br>
the Asian continent. Turkey shares land borders with Greece, Bulgaria, Syria,<br>
Iraq, Iran, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
Administratively, Turkey is divided into 79 provinces and 84 districts. The<br>
political capital is Ankara, but Istanbul is the commercial capital and<br>
largest city. It is the base for the largest companies and banks, and the<br>
main entry point by sea, air, and land. Domestic transport depends on roads<br>
along with the extensive air links and coastal shipping. Railways are not<br>
well developed.  <br>
<p>
Only 30 years ago, the population stood at 31.4 million.  In 1996, according<br>
to an estimate from the Population Reference<br>
Bureau based on data from Turkey's National Statistics Office,<br>
that figure had more than doubled to reach 63.9 million. About 63 percent of<br>
the population lives in urban areas. The populations of the largest cities<br>
are shown in the sidebar table on page 14.   <br>
Istanbul is growing quickly due to internal migration; the net inflow of<br>
people to the city averages 120,000 per year. Izmir, the manufacturing and<br>
transport center on the Aegean Sea coast, is growing faster than is Ankara.  <br>
<p>
The top three cities are far from being the only concentrations of<br>
population. There is a large number of second-tier cities of considerable<br>
size which are centers of regional economic activity and attract provincial<br>
migration. The southeastern city of Adana and the northeastern city of Bursa<br>
each have more than one million people. Antalya, Balikesir, Diyarbakir,<br>
Gaziantep, Hatay, Icel, Manisa, Samsun, and Sanli Urfa are districts of more<br>
than one million, and a further 25 cities are home to more than 500,000<br>
people each.    <br>
<p>
Each of these areas derives a strong identity from its region. On the<br>
northwestern coast of the Black Sea, for example, the Laz ethnic group<br>
dominates the cities of Trabzon and Rize. The Southeast is the domain of<br>
Kurds, more and more of whom are migrating to escape the poverty and conflict<br>
of their homeland. The outlying districts of Thrace show influence from<br>
Greece and Bulgaria.  <br>
<p>
The vast and frequently arid center of the country, locked into a traditional<br>
lifestyle based on small agricultural holdings, is losing population to the<br>
cities. In the modern environment of the coastal cities, the contrast between<br>
Westernized natives and conservative immigrants is sharp. Young women in<br>
tight jeans and T-shirts share space with contemporaries in ankle-length<br>
dresses and head scarves.  <br>
<p>
Turkey is an Islamic country, inasmuch as most of the population are Muslim<br>
in name. This should not be taken to mean that all Turks are practicing<br>
Muslims. A widely accepted analysis of religion in the country is that about<br>
one-sixth of the population are devout Muslims who follow the daily<br>
observances laid down in the Koran.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps 40 percent of the population attend mosques on the holy day, Friday.<br>
Religious practice is strongest in rural areas and the Southeast.  <br>
<p>
More potent a figure than Mohammed for modern Turks is Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,<br>
the leader who founded Turkey from the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire.<br>
Ataturk bequeathed a secular state to the Turks, and the vast majority of the<br>
population still separate Islam from business and education. Ataturk is<br>
revered with an almost religious intensity. Busts and profiles of the Father<br>
of the Turks are found in most homes and public places.  <br>
<p>
Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party drew about 25 percent of the vote in the<br>
1996 general elections, yet more than one-third of that support is said to<br>
have come from voters dissatisfied by corruption and inefficiency in the two<br>
major parties (both of which polled about the same as Welfare). Those who<br>
voted for Erbakan are nevertheless going to have to live with some Islamic<br>
policies.  <br>
<p>
A Shift in Attitude Toward Population Growth - One of these policies is less<br>
concern about population growth. Previous governments, both military and<br>
democratically elected ones, supported programs to restrict population<br>
growth. Welfare is inclined to ease off on these programs. The Islamic view<br>
of life as something given by God and above human interference is already<br>
evident in the high birth rates in the more religious Southeast and rural<br>
interior. Surveys by the State Institute of Statistics have found that<br>
couples in Mediterranean coast provinces desire an average of 2.28 children,<br>
compared with 3.47 in the Southeast. The national fertility rate was 2.65 in<br>
1990, compared with 6.1 in rural areas of the South East.  <br>
<p>
Turkey thus appears likely to continue the precipitous natural increase in<br>
its population until the end of this century. Infant and child mortality<br>
rates have fallen drastically over the past decade. At the same time the<br>
total fertility rate (the average number of children born to women in their<br>
child-bearing years) has stabilized at around 2.7, and the mean age at<br>
childbearing has dropped to 27.7 years.  <br>
<p>
External migration in the past has helped limit the impact on labor markets<br>
and social services of the average 2.17 percent annual growth in population.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Turkish guest workers and emigrants form significant communities in parts of<br>
Western Europe, especially Germany, and North America. The tightening of<br>
immigration laws in Europe now threatens this safety valve.  <br>
<p>
Immigration to Turkey, meanwhile, is small-scale. Aside from a period in the<br>
late 1980s and early 1990s marked by the forced exodus of the Turkish<br>
minority in Bulgaria, Turkey has generally counted its immigrants by the<br>
hundreds. There were 72,800 foreigners resident in the country in 1994, of<br>
whom 21,700 were from Bulgaria, 6,600 from Greece, 4,400 from Iran, 2,900<br>
from the U.S., and 2,400 from the former Soviet Union. <br>
<p>
Marriage as an institution remains strong. Surveying the population aged 12<br>
and over in 1990, the State Institute of Statistics found that 60.3 percent<br>
were married, 34.6 percent were single, 4.3 percent were widowed, and a mere<br>
0.8 percent were divorced. Each year sees an average of 450,000 marriages and<br>
27,000 divorces.  <br>
<p>
Most divorces occur in marriages of less than five years where there are no<br>
children, a sign of the importance of the nuclear family in this still<br>
traditional society. It is unusual for couples to live together before<br>
marriage.  <br>
<p>
So long as family earnings permit, women normally become home-makers after<br>
marriage.    <br>
<p>
Uninterrupted natural increase makes this a young society. Some 33 percent of<br>
the total population is younger than 15 years; only 5 percent is over age 65.<br>
<p>
<p>
Male life expectancy is 65 years, while women enjoy an extra five years of<br>
life on average.  <br>
<p>
Turkey is facing a rising demand for primary education and housing. Adult<br>
literacy is at about 82 percent.    <br>
<p>
Social welfare takes a back seat to defense spending, which accounts for 40<br>
to 50 percent of the government's annual budget. The military has a high<br>
profile in civil life. All men must complete military service of 16 to 18<br>
months.  <br>
<p>
In conversation, Turks will often express regret that the country's location<br>
compels such a high level of military spending, but there is little dissent.<br>
A pervasive sense of nationalism holds the country together. This is evident<br>
in the distinctive crescent- moon-and-star flag, which is flown proudly at<br>
every opportunity. Turks are passionate about their flag.  <br>
<p>
Earning, Spending, and Saving - Monetary conditions have been far from ideal<br>
in Turkey this decade. Most people have seen their nominal incomes rise with<br>
inflation while their real incomes have fallen. Uncertainty over the future<br>
has made it harder for businesses to attract investment or for retailers to<br>
draw buyers.  <br>
Using 1987 prices as a base rate of 100, the consumer price index was at<br>
754.5 in 1991, at 2,131.2 in 1993, and at 4,395.9 in 1994. Inflation in 1994<br>
was a record 125.3 percent as food prices doubled, property prices rose 85<br>
percent, and general household expenses rose 110 percent. To attract savings,<br>
banks today must offer 100 percent interest rates.  <br>
<p>
Fluctuations in exchange rates and GDP show up in dollar-based calculations<br>
of per capita income. GDP per head stood at US$2,724 in 1992, $3,033 in 1993,<br>
and $2,152 in 1994. Export-import and travel businesses now denominate many<br>
prices in U.S. dollars to protect against the regular devaluation of the<br>
Turkish lira.  <br>
<p>
Surprisingly, official statistics show little change in unemployment during<br>
the period of economic crisis. The unemployed have made up an average of 8<br>
percent of the labor force this decade. Urban unemployment stands at 11.5<br>
percent of those available to work in the cities.  <br>
<p>
What the statistics don't reflect is the extent of youth unemployment and<br>
underemployment. The low salaries offered starting workers have been rendered<br>
even more unattractive by inflation, and there still is a reluctance among<br>
employers to hire inexperienced graduates.  <br>
<p>
About 51 percent of the population over age 12 is in the labor force--an<br>
estimated 22.2 million people. Nearly 34 percent of women in this age group<br>
were in the labor force in 1994, according to OECD data.  <br>
<p>
A breakdown of the economically active population from a 1993 labor force<br>
survey gives an idea of the main spheres of work in Turkey. Of the 19.3<br>
million people included in the active category, the largest group, 8.4<br>
million, were engaged in agriculture, fishing, and related industries. Social<br>
and personal service industries, manufacturing, retailing and catering<br>
industries, and construction were other major employers.   <br>
<p>
Clothing and textiles are Turkey's main export earner, followed by iron and<br>
steel. Germany is the top trading partner, ahead of the USA. More than half<br>
the country's imports are raw materials, with consumer goods making up 14<br>
percent of the total.    <br>
<p>
Tourism has been an important growth sector over the past decade, and has<br>
become the second-largest earner of foreign exchange. Last year saw 7.8<br>
million overseas visitors, boosting employment in retailing and services,<br>
principally in Istanbul and the coastal centers.    <br>
<p>
Tourism revenues are now approximately US$5 billion a year. Remittances from<br>
overseas workers contribute a further $3 billion to the national coffers.  <br>
<p>
Households and Families -Turkey had 11.2 million households at the time of<br>
the 1990 census, 52.5 percent of them in urban areas.  <br>
<p>
Istanbul had 1.7 million households, Ankara 725,000, Izmir 650,000,and Adana,<br>
Bursa, and Konya some 350,000 each. The average household size was 5.2<br>
members.    <br>
<p>
Urbanization has not yet spawned the one-person household: There were as many<br>
households with eight members as there were with one in 1990. <br>
<p>
These statistics underscore the importance of the family as an economic unit<br>
in Turkey. Grandparents, grown-up children, and even grandchildren commonly<br>
live in the same household. When a child marries, families with means will<br>
try to build or buy an apartment for their offspring. It is rare for sons or<br>
daughters to move out on their own unless they have to move to another city<br>
for work.  <br>
<p>
Entrepreneurial activity sustains income at the household level. Urban<br>
households derive 30 percent of income from wages and salaries, compared with<br>
42 percent from rents, trade, and private enterprise. Rural households derive<br>
52 percent of their income from agriculture, with only 16 percent being<br>
earned in the form of wages and salaries. Although available figures have<br>
become fast outdated due to inflation, the general pattern is for urban<br>
households to earn 50 percent more than their rural counterparts, despite<br>
higher urban unemployment.    <br>
<p>
When it comes to expenditures, though, rural households appear to be in the<br>
better position. The average rural household spends no more than two-thirds<br>
of its income; the average urban household, 86 percent. Nationwide, prior to<br>
the economic crisis, households were saving 21 percent of their income. The<br>
primary items of consumption were food, housing, clothing, furniture, and<br>
transport/communications, in that order (see table in sidebar on page 15).  <br>
<p>
Expenditure on food and drink is high in part because of the priority Turks<br>
place on eating well. Great pride is taken in cooking and hosting meals.<br>
Lunch and dinner are occasions for families to get together, relax, and talk<br>
around a table. Meals are often accompanied by a bottle of the national<br>
liquor, raki, beer, or wine. The diet relies on fresh vegetables and fruits,<br>
dairy foods, seafood, and some meats (pork is not eaten). <br>
<p>
Self-contained houses are ever more the preserve of the economically<br>
advantaged in the cities and of rural families. Elsewhere, home is an<br>
apartment. Well-off families usually have a country house to which they can<br>
retreat from summer heat.    <br>
<p>
A sense of neighborliness still prevails in Turkish cities. Many apartment<br>
blocks have a grocer or fruit store on the ground floor purveying to the<br>
inhabitants and nearby residents. Turks are used to a sense of law and order<br>
in their cities. A rise in underworld crime in Istanbul this year has caused<br>
alarm in the media and parliament.  <br>
<p>
Cars are considered an essential item in most households, even if not all<br>
have the means to maintain one. In 1994, there were 2.86 million private<br>
cars, and 789,000 motorcycles registered in the country. European models,<br>
often produced in joint ventures with Turkish holdings, are the most popular.<br>
The market leader is Murat (a Turkish joint venture with Fiat). Renault and<br>
Ford are the number 2 and 3 makers, respectively. Toyota is the only Asian<br>
manufacturer with significant market share, but South Korea's Kia has just<br>
launched a joint venture with Ihlas Holding to make and sell Kias in Turkey.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Few Turkish houses are without basic household appliances such as<br>
refrigerators, washing machines, or gas ovens. White goods and consumer<br>
electronics tend to be of either German or Italian origin, or are<br>
domestically produced. Arcelik is the leading domestic brand for household<br>
appliances. Italian and French brands have the strongest impact in fields<br>
such as fashion, jewelry, and optics, with American fashions typically<br>
popular with those under age 25. Gold jewelry is a symbol of success and<br>
cause for pride among both men and women.<br>
<p>
Retailing is another area where European companies are making inroads.<br>
Traditionally, Turkish homemakers would make major weekly purchases at local<br>
markets, where they could stock up on fruit and vegetables, meat, and plastic<br>
goods. Convenience shopping was the preserve of local grocers.    <br>
<p>
Since the late 1980s, hypermarkets and shopping malls backed by European<br>
retailers have appeared to challenge this tradition. Sometimes pushing<br>
category-killers, sometimes using club shopping advantages, chains such as<br>
Migros, Metro, Tespo, Tansas, and Kiler are drawing Turkish shoppers away<br>
from city centers. Malls now offer services such as unlimited car parking and<br>
restaurants.  <br>
Lifestyles and Culture - Television is the best way of getting a message<br>
across to the Turkish consumer. There are 239 sets per 1,000 inhabitants, or<br>
more than one per household. It is safe to say that when a Turk is at home,<br>
the TV is rarely off. Accordingly, this is the number one advertising medium.<br>
 <br>
<p>
TRT, the government broadcasting corporation based in Ankara, runs four<br>
nationwide TV channels, as well as national radio stations. A fifth<br>
government channel, GAP, broadcasts to the Southeast. From Istanbul numerous<br>
private channels go nationwide, among them the movie- and drama-oriented<br>
Canal-D, Show, and HBB, the music stations Number 1 and Kral, and two Islamic<br>
channels.   There are more than 30 local stations in different parts of<br>
Turkey. <br>
<p>
Cable TV has proliferated in the major cities. Users pay around L1 million<br>
every three months to access stations like the domestic Cine 5, which has the<br>
rights to cover soccer games, and a menu of international channels including<br>
CNN, BBC Prime, and a sampling of German, French, Italian, and Spanish TV.<br>
The expansion of movie channels on cable has had a negative impact on the<br>
market for rental videos. Sales of VCRs are reported to be slack.  <br>
<p>
Cinemas too are losing out to home entertainment. In 1987, 460 cinemas were<br>
registered in the country, but in 1994 there were only 290. The domestic<br>
movie industry has fared worse than imports. There were 11.7 million<br>
spectators for Turkish movies in 1987, but only 1.8 million in 1994. The<br>
slower decline for foreign movies from 13.1 million to 9.3 million testifies<br>
to the continued appeal of Hollywood action on the big screens of Turkey. <br>
<p>
Radio is holding its ground against TV by offering tailored programs to women<br>
at home or drivers stuck in traffic. Soldiers in Turkey's 800,000-strong army<br>
depend on radio for their contact with the civilian world. Most private<br>
channels are on FM bands and gain daytime allegiance from TV viewers because<br>
of their lower ratio of advertisement to content.  <br>
<p>
After TV, newspapers are the main source of information for Turks. The<br>
newspaper world is currently experiencing intense competition to increase<br>
sales, among both the tabloid and quality dailies such as Hurriyet, Milliyet,<br>
Cumhuriyet, and Sabah. The competition is not concerned with price; rather,<br>
the newspapers increase their value by offering extravagant prizes to readers<br>
who can collect coupons from successive editions. Stereos and even cars have<br>
been given away, prompting parliament to seek controls over the giveaway<br>
campaigns. <br>
<p>
The telephone is an important communication tool for Turks. There are 159<br>
telephones per 1,000 people. Fax machines and personal computers are common<br>
in Turkish offices, though rare in homes. Limited by the small PC market and<br>
the plain existing phone network, use of the Internet is still in its<br>
infancy, though a spate of Internet-related seminars in Istanbul and Ankara<br>
this year give notice that cyberspace is reaching the Bosporus.  <br>
<p>
Eating out in restaurants or snack bars is an integral part of life for<br>
Turkish people, and is one area where friends rather than family form the<br>
group. Older men retire to coffee shops (kahvehane) to chat while sipping<br>
drinks, playing backgammon, and puffing tobacco through large water pipes.<br>
Work-mates drop into a doner kebab shop on the way home. Students and young<br>
couples drop into discos or cafe bars, where dancing is popular. <br>
<p>
Younger Turks living in the cities have a strong appetite for Western<br>
fashions and Turkish pop music. The thriving pop market is mostly<br>
merchandised in cassette tapes, which cost an affordable US$6 per unit,<br>
one-third the price of a CD. Songs and videos purvey an image of open<br>
sexuality, often at odds with the older generation who generally enjoy the<br>
sedate tones of Turkish classical music. <br>
<p>
There is no disputing that Turkey's most important sport is soccer, which is<br>
followed with a passion that rivals that of Brazil. Top honors have eluded<br>
the national team, yet the best clubs like Galatasaray and Fenerbahce have<br>
scored notable wins in European competition.<br>
<p>
Internationally, Turkey succeeds at weightlifting and wrestling, the latter<br>
being a great tradition.  Participation in sports is mostly informal. Outside<br>
of schools, only 120,000 Turks were active members of sports clubs in 1994,<br>
reports the General Directorate of Youth and Sports. Jogging and aerobics are<br>
popular.  <br>
<p>
Women's beauty salons often incorporate gym functions.    <br>
<p>
Determined as they are to enjoy life, Turks have not developedthe health<br>
consciousness or the environmental concerns of their European neighbors. At<br>
least three- quarters of men and one-half of women smoke cigarettes, the<br>
brands of choice being Marlboro and nationally produced Tekel. Recycling is<br>
rudimentary. On the other hand, streets and beaches are generally clean.    <br>
<p>
This reflects a paradox about the Turks. While they do not seem too concerned<br>
about their own status and health, that of their family and country is<br>
paramount. <br>
<p>
Critics talk of a me-first mentality creeping into Turkish culture, yet to an<br>
outsider the group orientation of this society remains striking.  <br>
<p>
It is this orientation that is helping Turks get by in the difficult 1990s.<br>
When jobs and money seem insecure, the strong family structure comes into<br>
play to help.  <br>
<p>
Targeting the breadwinner (usually the senior man) and the decision-maker<br>
(the senior woman) within the family unit is important for business success.<br>
 <br>
<p>
The problems faced by Turks have eased a bit since 1994, but stability is<br>
still elusive. Regional tensions could flare up at any time. Population<br>
growth is adding to the difficulties caused by inflation. For the short term<br>
at least, Turkish consumers are likely to be cautious about making big<br>
commitments and to stick to the things they know.<br>

<p>
<p>
1. ARF DELEGATION MEETS WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW-A delegation of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation <br>
Bureau and the ARF Executive Council of Armenia was in Moscow from <br>
December 18-22 for a number of high-level meetings.<br>
	ARF Bureau chairperson Peno Tontian and members Mgrdich <br>
Mgrdichian, Apo Boghigian and Martun Matevossian were joined by <br>
ARF Executive Council members Rouben Hakobian, Hovik Aghazarian <br>
and Gagik Mkrtchian, as well as Seyran Baghdassarian, director of <br>
the ARF Bureau office in Moscow.<br>
	The ARF delegation attended the annual meeting of the <br>
Russian Communities Congress on Saturday, Dec. 21 at the Hall of <br>
Writers of the Russian Federation.<br>
	RCC chairman Dimitri Rogozin and ARF Executive Council <br>
politicial affairs director Rouben Hakobian signed a declaration <br>
of cooperation and called for continued friendly relations between <br>
the Russian and Armenian peoples.<br>
	Later that evening, the ARF delegation met with former <br>
presidential candidate and National Security Minister Alexander <br>
Lebed. The group expressed their deep gratitude to General Lebed <br>
for his unwavering and decisive support of the Armenian residents <br>
of Baku during the 1990 pogroms in the city in an attempt to rid <br>
the Azeri capital of its Armenian population. Lebed was the <br>
commander of the Russian forces in Baku at the time of the <br>
pogroms, and is credited for saving the lives of nearly 200,000 <br>
Armenians.<br>
	The two-hour meeting also foused on common geopolitical <br>
interests and stressed the importance of Russian-Armenian <br>
cooperation in that sphere.<br>
	On Friday, the ARF delegation, joined by writer Zori <br>
Balayan, met with Russian Federation Deputy Prime Minister <br>
Alexander Lobov, and thanked him for his continued support of <br>
Armenia and the Armenian people, especially for his efforts in <br>
assisting the 1988 earthquake survivors. The meeting also focused <br>
on political relations of Armenia and the Russian Federation and <br>
issues related to further development of Russian-Armenian ties.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. KOCHARIAN SWEARS IN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-President-elect Robert Kocharian was sworn <br>
in on Dec. 23 at a special session of the Karabakh National <br>
Assembly. Robert Kocharian was elected president of the Nagorno-<br>
Karabakh Republic in the Nov. 24 national election.<br>
	At the ceremony, the President swore to safeguard the <br>
Constitution and Laws of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, security <br>
of Karabakh citizens and their rights and freedoms. <br>
	He said that it was his duty to pursue a political line <br>
aimed at ensuring the unity of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, <br>
Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora.<br>
	Head of the Artsakh Diocese, Bishop Barkev Martirossian said <br>
a prayer and blessed the President and the people of Artsakh. The <br>
inauguration was attended by Armenias Foreign Minister, Alexander <br>
Arzoumanian and Chairman of the Central Bank of Armenia, Bagrat <br>
Assatrian.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. MANOUKIAN CALLS FOR A UNITED FRONT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-"I bear the responsibility for the events on <br>
Sept. 25, for the rally and procession to the parliament building. <br>
People followed my call, and if the authorities are looking for <br>
those responsible for the events, they must know that it is I and <br>
not the 18 young people who are still in custody. I am <br>
responsible, but not guilty," National Democratic Union Chairman <br>
Vazgen Manoukian said at the NDU party conference.<br>
	Manoukians speech was mainly devoted to the political <br>
consequences of 1996, particularly  the post-election events of <br>
Sept. 25. He noted that the authorities were interested in <br>
creating disorder, particularly by firing upon a rallying crowd. <br>
According to Manoukian, the uncontrollable situation allowed the <br>
authorities to define those events as an attempt of a coup detat.<br>
	"Entering the parliament building was not a wrong thing. The <br>
people had the right to dictate their will. However, as a man and <br>
political figure, I condemn the violence that took place that <br>
day," Manoukian said.<br>
	Manoukian said that his election campaign erased the myths <br>
claiming that there was no replacement for Levon Ter-Petrosyan and <br>
that, no matter who comes to power, he would be incapable of <br>
changing anything in the country. <br>
	Manoukian compared the high electoral activity in 1996 with <br>
the all-national movement of 1988. According to him, the events <br>
during the election campaign was a surprise to the authorities <br>
which resulted in actions that were inadequate for the situation. <br>
	Manoukian said that the falsifications of the poll returns <br>
were accompanied by secret arrests. For example, after the rally <br>
on Sept. 24, 11 cars were impounded, and their owners, who took an <br>
active part in the election campaign, were arrested. "The <br>
authorities tried to threaten the society."<br>
	"I overestimated the authorities respect for Armenias <br>
future. It turned out that their personal interests are top <br>
priority for them," Manoukian said. He pointed out that the power <br>
elected in a non-democratic way will obviously lose respect in the <br>
world.<br>
	"Under current authority, Armenia is deprived of a future, <br>
since the state is not capable of showing political, military and <br>
economic power. I think that the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh must <br>
be solved by a shift in authority as well," Manoukian said.<br>
	Manoukian said that the opposition was never against an <br>
agreement with the authorities, but any agreement must have been <br>
conducted within the guidelines of justice. Organizations of new <br>
elections and adoption of a new Constitution are the problems <br>
which the opposition will negotiate with the authorities in the <br>
future. According to Manoukian, the social and economic crises <br>
will deepen in the near future, the discords within the power <br>
structure will get worse and they will gradually lose power.<br>
	Under such conditions it is necessary to establish a single <br>
front. It is expected that in order to form such a front, <br>
representatives of the National Accord bloc will start <br>
negotiations with other political parties, as well as public <br>
organizations.<br>
	"Our main objective is to get back to a democratic way of <br>
development and running of new elections. To do this, we need to <br>
strengthen our party," he said.<br>
	The next NDU congress will take place in February of 1997.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. ARF YOUTH ATTEND EURO-COUNCIL CONFERENCE<br>
<p>
BUDAPEST-A representative of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation <br>
Youth Organization, Hagop Sarian of Cyprus, participated in the <br>
European Council-sponsored "Euro-Arab Cooperation" conference in <br>
Budapest, Hungary.<br>
	The Dec. 10-14 conference aimed at strengthening European <br>
and Arab relations and outlining future relations at the youth <br>
level.<br>
	The general meeting and the various workshops stressed the <br>
importance of peace as a pre-condition to resolving regional <br>
conflicts democratically, emphasizing the right to self-<br>
determination, while condemning the forceful seizure of <br>
territories and the perpetuation of hostilities.<br>
	The conference participants called for mutual understanding <br>
and consent in settling regional issues.<br>
	The conference adopted the following decisions: development, <br>
at the youth level, of educational programs aimed at conflict <br>
prevention and the establishment of peace, as well as educational <br>
exchange of cadres; establishment of a non-governmental youth <br>
association and a sub-committee of the European Council to <br>
facilitate the issuing of travel visas; publication of key human <br>
rights documents in Arabic and organization of a conference <br>
focusing on the rights of youth; <br>
involvement in the development of educational activities and <br>
programs of UNESCO; establishment of a youth information center; <br>
and use of modern communication technologies in English, French <br>
and Arabic language youth publications.<br>
	The conference called on the European Council to assist in <br>
the implementation of the decisions adopted in Budapest.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. TER-PETROSYAN ASKED TO REPRESENT ACCUSED MINISTRY OFFICIAL<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The former advisor to the Minister of <br>
Interior, Aram Petrossian, who was arrested on March 7 for the <br>
illegal possession of weapons and fraud, submitted a written <br>
appeal to the court inviting Levon Ter-Petrosyan to be his <br>
attorney. <br>
	Petrossian based his appeal on the provision of the <br>
Constitution that the Armenian President is a guarantor of every <br>
Armenian citizens rights. Judge Albert Hakobian turned down the <br>
appeal.<br>
	Extremely upset by the rejection, Petrossian appealed for <br>
postponement of the session. He refused to testify unless his <br>
attorney was invited.<br>
	The defendant made two statements at the session.<br>
	First, he demanded that the investigation be carried out by <br>
the Prosecutor-Generals office. According to legislation, <br>
proceedings instituted against officers of interior law <br>
enforcement agencies are conducted by the Prosecutor-Generals <br>
office. Petrossian noted that this fact was concealed by the <br>
investigator of the sixth department of the Ministry of Interior, <br>
Vanik Obossian, who introduced the defendant as a director of a <br>
limited liability society.<br>
	Secondly, Petrossian told the court that the first deputy <br>
chairman of the sixth department of the interior ministry, Hamlet <br>
Hakobian was using his "Lada" type car after he was arrested on <br>
March 8, 1996. Petrossian said that he had given his car to one of <br>
his creditors. Judge Hakobian said that if this fact is confirmed, <br>
the case would be considered as a violation of the law.<br>
	Manoukian was charged with defaulting on $600,000 in loans <br>
from the Armimpexbank, Ardshinbank, Land, and Credit-Yerevan <br>
banks.<br>
	He also denied the weapons charges against him and refused <br>
saying that two of his five bodyguards had the right to carry <br>
weapons. He insisted that the gun found in his possession was <br>
planted by the employees of the sixth department of the Interior <br>
Ministry. <br>
	Petrossian refuted the statements saying that he used the <br>
credits for his personal use. He stressed that part of the money <br>
was used for reconstruction of the Childrens Railway of Yerevan, <br>
supplies for the childrens cafe, stationing 17 sculptures in the <br>
territory of the park and reconstruction of the Zovk mineral water <br>
plant.<br>
	He said that he was physically and psychologically pressured <br>
to provide some of the statements.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. INVESTMENT ACTIVITY DROPPED THIS YEAR<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The investment activity index, "Hrant," <br>
dropped two-fold for the year of 1996. Hayk Markarian, Director of <br>
the "Hrant" investment and broker company said that in January the <br>
IAI was 15.11, whereas in December it is 7.8.<br>
	IAI estimates the investment activity on the basis of <br>
indices, like the exchange rate of the dram, market price of <br>
privatization certificates, application volumes for real estate <br>
purchase and other indicators.<br>
	According to Markarian, the causes of the IAI drop are <br>
insufficient investment offers. Despite the fact that the volume <br>
and term of privatization were corrected many times by the <br>
parliament, the government failed to ensure the privatization even <br>
in the corrected volumes and extended terms. Besides, the <br>
government could never be able to offer a large enough amount of <br>
securities and attractive conditions for their placement.<br>
	Another reason was the decision on emission of new vouchers. <br>
That decision resulted in a drop of market prices for vouchers and <br>
a real reduction of sums designed for privatization.<br>
	Lastly, political instability, indefinite prospects of <br>
resolution of the Karabakh problem, the presidential elections and <br>
questions on voting that remained disputable after the polls are <br>
among the risk factors from the point of view of both foreign and <br>
domestic investors.<br>
<p>
<p>
7. AVETISSIAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-At the Dec. 19 court session of the "Trial <br>
of 31," defendant Tigran Avetissian pleaded not guilty to charges <br>
of plotting a coup.<br>
	As to the murder of the policeman, Avetissian said that Gnel <br>
Hovanessian had been shot at by one of the policemen. He said he <br>
fired a shot into the ground, however, a bullet fired from the AK-<br>
47 might have ricocheted and hit the policeman. He saw the <br>
policeman squat. Avetissian said that while hiding in Sourenavan <br>
they were surprised to learn about the murder of the policeman, as <br>
both him and Gagik Karapetian had been shooting into the ground.<br>
	The defendant noted that on August 23, 1995 he surrendered <br>
to the Shengavit police department of the Ministry of Internal <br>
Affairs. Defendant Manvel Yeghiazarian, commander of the "Arapo" <br>
detachment, said that allegations from the preliminary <br>
investigation stating that only one of the three policemen had a <br>
gun was inconceivable. He said that a shot fired from an AK-47 <br>
from that range would have left a larger burn area on the body.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. REFUGEES IN ARMENIA RELUCTANT TO ACQUIRE CITIZENSHIP<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The main topics for discussion on the first <br>
day of the "Naturalization of Refugees in the Republic of Armenia" <br>
conference held in Yerevan were problems of economic, political <br>
and psychological effects on refugees and the creation of a legal <br>
basis providing for their full integration into the community.<br>
	Lilia Kalian, chief of the Social Security Ministrys <br>
Migration Department and leader of the "Refugees and Displaced <br>
Persons" working group, noted in her speech that acquiring <br>
citizenship would mean changing the refugee status. No similar <br>
procedure exists in international practice, nor does it correspond <br>
to the norms of the International Convention on Refugee Status, <br>
which calls for the promotion of refugee naturalization and the <br>
acceleration of legal procedures.<br>
	Gevork Poghossian, the president of the Armenian <br>
Sociological Association, stressed the role of non-governmental <br>
organizations that might conduct explanatory works among refugees. <br>
Refugees ought to realize that by having only social rights and no <br>
citizenship they cannot be valuable citizens of the country and <br>
take part in its political and economic life.<br>
	While R. Melik-Pashaeva, leader of a non-governmental <br>
refugee organization, said that refugees must be guaranteed <br>
housing and work first and only in that case a real naturalization <br>
was possible. Besides, in accordance with the Armenian law only a <br>
person who has a permanent registration in Armenia may acquire <br>
citizenship. At present, thousands of refugees live in communal <br>
centers, boarding-houses, hotels and houses unfit for use, and the <br>
authorities will not register them there.<br>
	The participants of the conference agreed that it was <br>
necessary to create a legal and material basis and social <br>
guarantees, elaboration of a single policy in relation to the <br>
problem of the naturalization of refugees in Armenia, and their <br>
full integration was also needed.<br>
	The conference was organized by the Armenian Social Security <br>
Ministrys Migration Department along with the International <br>
Migration Organization and United Nations High Commissioner for <br>
Refugees.<br>

9. IRAN, TURKEY PLEDGE FOR CLOSER TIES DESPITE US<br>
<p>
ANKARA (Reuter)-Turkey and Iran signed several accords Saturday to <br>
boost economic relations following top level talks between the two <br>
neighbors in defiance of US efforts to isolate Tehran.<br>
	"If the agreements we have signed disturb other countries, <br>
it is their problem," Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani <br>
told a news conference after signing the accords with Turkish <br>
President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara.<br>
	"The policy of (the United States of) America is to prevent <br>
strong countries in this region from cooperating," said <br>
Rafsanjani, on the third day of a four-day visit.<br>
	"I dont think America can change our cooperation policy <br>
with Turkey. The Turkish president, prime minister and we are <br>
determined not to allow America to dictate anything to our <br>
region."<br>
	The US government on Friday expressed disapproval of <br>
Rafsanjanis visit to the NATO member Turkey and advised Ankara <br>
against improving relations with Tehran.<br>
	The United States, a close ally of NATO member Turkey, has <br>
accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism. Iran denies the charge. <br>
	Rafsanjanis visit marks a step forward in strengthening <br>
relations between the two Moslem countries since Necmettin Erbakan <br>
became Turkeys first Islamist prime minister in June. <br>
	"A turn to Islamic movement has started in Turkey. And the <br>
latest general elections is the best example of this," he said of <br>
the Welfare Party of Erbakan, which narrowly came first in the <br>
December 1995 elections.<br>
	The Islamist-led Turkish government and Iran aim to double <br>
the two-way trade volume to $2 billion from 1997, enable easier <br>
capital flow for investments and benefit from port facilities in <br>
the three agreements.<br>
	A memorandum of understanding will enable cooperation in <br>
environmental matters and a protocol envisages establishing a <br>
common chamber of commerce and industry to enable communication <br>
between the two countries industrial firms.<br>
	The sides also agreed to open credit lines worth $150 <br>
million to each other to finance bilateral trade.<br>
	Turkey said on Friday it would renew a current oil import <br>
agreement with Iran to continue to buy 4.5 million metric tons of <br>
Iranian crude from April, when the current agreement expires. <br>
	The presidential talks followed a series of joint economic <br>
meetings earlier in the week in which senior Turkish and Iranian <br>
officials agreed to launch air links on Istanbul-Tabriz and <br>
Ankara-Tehran lines and improve a rail link from Tehran to eastern <br>
Turkey.<br>
	Turkish officials have said a six-month study would be <br>
launched to investigate the feasibility of a pipeline to carry <br>
Iranian oil to Western markets through Turkey.<br>
	Iran and Turkey agreed in August in Tehran to build a <br>
pipeline to carry three billion cubic meters of Iranian gas <br>
annually to Turkey from 1998 under a 23-year, $23-billion deal. <br>
	The pipeline and gas deal was struck days after President <br>
Bill Clinton signed a law imposing sanctions on any company <br>
investing over $40 million a year in energy projects in Iran or <br>
Libya.<br>
	Ankara said the deal would not be affected by US sanctions <br>
because Turkey was only constructing the stretch of pipeline on <br>
its own territory, for which it announced a tender last week.<br>

Christmas Greetings<br>

<p>
Dear fellow Armenians, colleagues and friends,<br>
<p>
The end of 1996 marks the end of the third successful year in the life of<br>
the Pan-Armenian Academic and Scientific Society.<br>
The Society which started off  mere technical club, in April 1994, between<br>
Yerevan, Lancaster and Brunel Universities, has grown steadily into a global<br>
grouping encompassing 3 continents and myriads of scientific and non<br>
scientific disciplines.<br>
<p>
The Society's newsletter 'Pan-Armenian Science Review' is steadily becoming<br>
a recognise scientific publication in its own right and as members have<br>
notices it now carries a verity of technical as well as very descriptive<br>
materials. <br>
The recent issue of the Science Review Volume 3 number 3, carries articles<br>
on the architecture, computer science, psychology and law and the next issue<br>
focuses on the science of Information thecnology and its applications<br>
<p>
The message of the Society is, as it has always been, very simple and its<br>
ambitions very clear: to form cooperative links between technical as well as<br>
non-technical professionals around the world to give a lending hand to<br>
Armenia and to mankind. Slowly but surely this message is getting through<br>
and the responses that we have received have been very encouraging.<br>
<p>
Over the last year the Society has managed to launch its own scientific<br>
bulletin board (PAACS), create World Wide Web site and compile a world data<br>
bank of Armenian professional around the world.<br>
Moreover, the Society, through the efforts of  Prof. Markarian at Lancaster<br>
University, has managed to secure a large research fund for a project with<br>
the Institute of Radio-Physics in Ashtarak, Armenia. <br>
The task at hand is by no means completed and just over the horizon the<br>
Society is planning an Armenian Science  day in London.<br>
<p>
On behalf of the Society I would like to wish all fellow Armenians around<br>
the world a very healthy, happy and a prosperous new year, and hope to be<br>
able to make newer friends in the future. Furthermore I would like to thank<br>
all the members of the Society, in USA, UK, Canada and Armenia for their<br>
continued support.<br>
<p>
With best regards<br>
<p>

HEADLINE: Minister reports "unity of views" with Russia on "significant<br>
issues" <br>
SOURCE: TRT TV, Ankara, in Turkish 1300 gmt 19 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Tansu Ciller, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has said that a<br>
unity of views has been reached between Turkey and Russia on taking joint<br>
steps on significant issues concerning regional peace. <br>
<p>
Ciller, who concluded her contacts in Moscow, held a news conference. She<br>
said that the Turkish-Russian protocol on cooperation against terror and the<br>
agreement on the vc construction of the Turkish-Russian Trade Centre in<br>
Moscow signed during her visit would give an impetus to the development of<br>
bilateral relations. Pointing out that Turkey and Russia had clearly stated<br>
that they respected one another's territorial integrity as well as that of<br>
other countries, Ciller added that the two countries would act jointly<br>
regarding the solution of the Karabakh issue. Drawing attention to the fact<br>
that Turkey was the second country on Russia's foreign trade list, Ciller<br>
said that the bilateral volume of trade would grow through the joint projects<br>
to be discussed in the near future. She added that another important issue<br>
that came up during her visit was that all the Russian officials, including<br>
Russian Prime Minister [Viktor] Chernomyrdin in particular, had promised that<br>
they would not approach the economic projects in the region with political<br>
considerations. Ciller noted that the developments achieved during her talks<br>
regarding visa exemptions between the two countries would significantly<br>
contribute to the development of bilateral trade relations. <br>
<p>
Ciller said that the 6 billion cubic meters of natural gas purchased annually<br>
from Russia would be increased to 14 billion at the joint economic committee<br>
meeting that will convene in January. She noted that significant developments<br>
had been achieved in the projects concerning the transfer of natural gas to<br>
Samsun in a bid to meet Turkey's needs. She added that 3 billion cubic meters<br>
would be transferred from Russia to Turkey via Georgia and 16 billion cubic<br>
meters via the Black Sea. <br>
<p>
HEADLINE: Ciller comments on "very favourable" visit on return from Russia <br>
SOURCE: TRT TV, Ankara, in Turkish 1800 gmt 19 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
Tansu Ciller, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has concluded her<br>
visit to Moscow and returned to Turkey. Some ministers and other officials<br>
received Ciller at Ankara's Esenboga airport. <br>
<p>
In a statement she issued, Ciller said that her contacts in the Russian<br>
Federation had been vc very favourable. Explaining that she had held a very<br>
long and comprehensive meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin, Ciller added that a significant unity of views was reached on<br>
settling differences on regional issues. In this context, Ciller stressed,<br>
Russia accepted that the Turkomans [Turkic people in northern Iraq] should<br>
secure their autonomy within the framework of Iraq's territorial security.<br>
She added that issuing an official communique on this issue was an important<br>
step for Turkey . <br>
<p>
Commenting on the Azeri-Armenian conflict, Ciller said that Russia shared<br>
Turkey's views along the lines of recognizing the Azeri territorial integrity<br>
in its entirety. Ciller said: Our mutual work will proceed. For this reason,<br>
it is very important in terms of international relations that our neighbour<br>
Russia confirmed Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Ciller further explained<br>
that important steps were taken towards encouraging investment projects by<br>
eliminating the obstacles in the way of Turkish transporters and the issuing<br>
of visas. <br>
<p>
Recounting that an agreement in principle was reached with Russia with regard<br>
to meeting Turkey's natural gas demands in 1999 and 2000, Ciller continued:<br>
The agreement envisages the transportation of 14 billion out of the 45<br>
billion cubic metres of natural gas needed by Turkey through Bulgaria and<br>
Romania, another 16 billion cubic metres from the Black Sea to Samsun, and 3<br>
billion cubic metres through Georgia. Thus, the agreement in principle<br>
roughly envisages the transportation of 34-35 billion cubic metres of natural<br>
gas from Russia to Turkey. This is very important for Turkey. BOTAS [Pipeline<br>
and Petroleum Transport Corporation] will be an associate in this project,<br>
and in this way Turkey will have the possibility of distributing cheap<br>
energy. Also noting that all their aims were directed towards making Turkey<br>
an oil distributing country, Ciller added: Thus, in the next three to five<br>
years, Turkey will assume its position as a country which distributes oil<br>
transported from the Caspian Sea and the Iraqi oil pipelines as well as<br>
through the Mediterranean Sea. <br>
<p>
Ciller continued: In this context, we insisted that the Caspian Sea oil,<br>
which is envisaged to reach Nova [place name as heard] and Supsa in the Black<br>
Sea, cannot be transported through the straits. Transporting this oil through<br>
the straits will pose a danger for Istanbul and its 10-million population and<br>
is impossible both physically as well as for environmental reasons. We<br>
explained this very clearly to all the Russian officials. We also told them<br>
not to rely on transporting the oil through the straits when they make their<br>
calculations, and that it is essential in terms of regional peace and the<br>
interests of both countries that Russia should become a partner in this<br>
system, which will transport this oil to the Mediterranean and distribute it<br>
from there. I am pleased to say that this view was received with<br>
understanding. <br>

HEADLINE: Kurdish MED TV reports oppression of Alawite Kurds in Erzincan <br>
SOURCE: MED-TV, London, in Turkish 1815 gmt 18 Dec 96 <br>
<p>
The state is oppressing the Alawites in Erzincan [eastern Turkey]. The state,<br>
with the collaboration of Bunyamin Kuran, one of the commanders of the<br>
gendarmerie, and Erzincan Governor Recep Yazicioglu, is trying to evacuate<br>
the villages inhabited by the Alawite Kurds. The village evacuation policy is<br>
being implemented by the state forces with the aim of depopulating the region<br>
using the vc pretext that the regional people are abetting the PKK [Kurdistan<br>
Workers' Party]. <br>
<p>
Many have been detained and tortured in Refahiye and surrounding villages<br>
during the past 20 days. Following these developments, a news conference was<br>
held at the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Centre. Those who had been detained, as<br>
well as the presidents of the Tunceli, Divrigi, Imranli, and Bahadir Cultural<br>
Associations and the Haci Bektas Veli Anadolu Cultural Fund, participated in<br>
the news conference. Videotaped interviews with those who were tortured while<br>
in detention were screened at the news conference. The tapes explained that<br>
even the mentally disturbed were tortured and accused. The interviewees<br>
disclosed that the methods of torture included electric shocks and sexual<br>
assaults. <br>
<p>
Murtaza Demir, president of the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association, said<br>
that the oppression was mounting and that there were attempts to expel the<br>
Alawites living in the Refahiye provincial centre and its surrounding<br>
villages from the region. He added that Kuran threatened the Alawites in<br>
order to get them to leave the region. According to Demir, Kuran says the<br>
following to the detainees: You are traitors. I will not let you live here.<br>
You are actually from Tunceli [south of Erzincan], and the residents of<br>
Tunceli are of Armenian origin. This country cannot benefit from you. Demir<br>
said that Kuran also tortured the detainees. Noting that the regional people<br>
were being forced to emigrate through such pressures, Demir said that a<br>
delegation would be sent to the region and a rally organized. <br>

HEADLINE: Toddler proves the star of Stalin birthday bash <br>
SOURCE:  Agence France Presse,  December 21, 1996<br>
<p>
Georgia's die-hard communists celebrated the 117th anniversary of Stalin's<br>
birth Saturday by christening the Soviet dictator's two-year-old namesake and<br>
great-great-grandson, Josef Dzhugashvili junior. <br>
<p>
A crowd of some 600 gathered outside Stalin's humble brick house, now a<br>
museum, in his birthplace Gori, 65 kilometres (35 miles) east of the capital<br>
Tbilisi. <br>
<p>
The town is the centre of a personality vc cult that, despite official Soviet<br>
"de-Stalinisation," never quite died in the republic of the ex-dictator's<br>
birth. <br>
<p>
The die-hard communists carried portraits of Stalin, who died in 1953, and<br>
banners reading: "Bring Back Free Medical Care and Free Education," and<br>
"Hail, the United Communist Party." <br>
<p>
"We must do all we can to show today's youth the true face of comrade Stalin,<br>
and somehow help them to form an objective opinion about the personality of<br>
the great leader," said Stalin's grandson, Yevgeny Dzhugashvili. <br>
<p>
Yevgeny is the son of Stalin's eldest son, Yakov, who died as a<br>
prisoner-of-war in German captivity during World War II. <br>
<p>
The crowd greeted Yevgeny's grandson, two-year-old Josef, with thunderous<br>
applause, and were then treated to a display of disco-dancing by a Gori<br>
childrens' group called the "21st-Century Communists." <br>
<p>
Young children recited poems written by Stalin in his youth, when he still<br>
went by the name of Josef Dzhugashvili, and had not yet risen to become<br>
dictator of the proletariat. <br>
<p>
The crowd, waving red flags and clutching bouquets, then moved on to the<br>
four-metre-high (12-foot) granite Stalin statue that dominates the town. <br>
<p>
Turkish and Armenian communists were among the Stalin fans who turned out to<br>
praise the Soviet supreme leader who fostered a monolithic personality cult<br>
and unleashed state-sponsored terror which claimed millions of lives. <br>
<p>
Later, communists accompanied Yevgeny Stalin and his family to the Sioni<br>
Monastery, for the christening of Josef Dzhugashvili junior, for once turning<br>
a blind eye to the atheist teachings of Marxism-Leninism. <br>
<p>
Three clerics struggled to hold the screaming toddler, but finally managed to<br>
wrap three little gold crosses round his neck. <br>
<p>
Georgia's communists have high expectations of the boy who bears one of the<br>
most infamous names in history. <br>
<p>
Niko Abuashvili, a member of the United Georgian Communist Party, remarked:<br>
"a person's genes are immortal, and I'm sure that this boy will fulfil our<br>
ideas no less successfully than his great-grandfather." <br>
<p>
The party's leader Panteleimon Giorgadze, who was in Moscow Saturday, sent a<br>
message of congratulations for the christening and anniversary. <br>
<p>
The old Stalinists' ignorance of religious tradition was revealed when they<br>
stood with their backs to the church icons and failed to observe any of the<br>
Christian rituals during the ceremony. <br>
<p>
The christening was rounded off with a banquet in honour of the new rising<br>
star in the Georgian communists' firmament. <br>

<p>
   Interview with Shamil Basayev by Maksim Shevchenko under the general<br>
headline:  "Who Is the Culprit in the War"<br>
<p>
  [Shevchenko]  First of all, what do you think about the tragic incident in<br>
Novyye Atagi.  Who do you think is behind this crime?<br>
 [Basayev]  At first I was inclined to think that this act was committed by<br>
regular criminals.  An unhealthy atmosphere has long developed around that<br>
hospital, related to financial matters, and even mere employment with very<br>
good compensation packages.  Yet, judging by the massive onslaught in the<br>
Russian mass media and their state of agitation during the past three days,<br>
I come to the conclusion that this is the work of Russian special services,<br>
timed to coincide with Raduyev's capturing of POW's.  Generally, standing<br>
behind it are the people who are strongly anti-peace.  This is an act of<br>
unprecedented vandalism.  We Chechens are saying today that we regret,<br>
sympathize, and so forth.  In fact, however, the stigma of disgrace has<br>
fallen on all Chechens and all citizens of the republic.  Our people have<br>
never offended a guest.  Meanwhile, recently guests began to be kidnapped<br>
and even killed.  The Chechen people cannot do this; the Chechens cannot act<br>
in this way.  During this war we have had plenty of opportunity to kill<br>
indiscriminately; the people were strongly embittered.  Yet nobody -- not<br>
even Russian journalists, even though they were fighting on the Russian side<br>
-- was touched here.  I think that this is a provocation aimed against<br>
elections, against ending the war, and against peace.  But we shall do our<br>
utmost to catch the criminals in the very near future and punish them severely. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  Precisely who could be behind the crime?  Maybe you have some<br>
theories?<br>
 [Basayev]  Today I am a private person.  But I have talked with President<br>
Yandarbiyev on this count, and he told me that there is some information<br>
about it.  All our power structures are at work, including the Internal<br>
Affairs Ministry, the State Security Department, and a special<br>
anti-terrorist group.  Work is in progress on all lines.  I spoke with the<br>
deputy internal affairs minister, and representatives of the State Security<br>
Department, and listened to a tape recording the discussion of economic and<br>
financial matters at the hospital.  There has been a lot of juggling with<br>
figures, and abuses.  But most importantly, today I have attended a session<br>
of the Human Rights Committee which adopted a document and expressed<br>
condolences; I was also present at a session of the International<br>
Conciliation Group which adopted an appeal to the Red Cross and other<br>
international organizations, stressing that the Chechens cannot do this with<br>
their own hands -- if only because we badly need the Red Cross.  Now they<br>
have gone, and we have over 200 mentally sick people in Zakan-Yurt without<br>
medical care, without food, without anything....  In fact, several thousand<br>
people in the republic have been left without medical assistance or food<br>
supplies.  We are not suicides to do this with our own hands.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Shamil, some political figures and media organizations link<br>
your name with the strange situation around the North Ossetian delegation.<br>
Could you clarify this issue?<br>
 [Basayev]  At the time when the delegation went missing I was at the<br>
village of Novoye Gordalo, taking part in the exchange of the Penza OMON<br>
[special purpose militia] troopers.  I learned about the incident in the<br>
evening from a TV news show, where everything was presented so finely:  They<br>
knew exactly that the people had been abducted in jeeps and taken to Vedeno.<br>
I understood at once whom they were targeting.  I go around with my<br>
bodyguards in two jeeps, and I come from Vedeno.  This is the district for<br>
which I am responsible in the military sense.  At the end of the footage<br>
about the events in Novyye Atagi they showed the entrance to my election<br>
headquarters and my bodyguards, and said that the killers have not been<br>
found, but that they must be found.  This is a dirty, unprofessional, and<br>
brazen lie on the part of the Russian mass media.  On one hand, this is<br>
insulting to me, but on the other, it pleases me.  I am pleased by the<br>
weakness of the Russian special services and the Russian state.  This will<br>
facilitate our progress down the path of independence. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  How do you react to the harsh comments against you on the<br>
part of Russian Duma Speaker Gennadiy Seleznev?  In particular, that Russia<br>
may not recognize you as president of Ichkeria owing to your past?<br>
 [Basayev]  I will say this:  The dog barks but the caravan passes on.<br>
Seleznev is not concerned either about the fate of Russia or Chechnya.  In<br>
fact he could not care less whether I indeed could become the president or<br>
not.  And I will certainly become one, if only to spite Seleznev....  Today<br>
he accuses me of being "covered in blood from foot to ears."  Seleznev<br>
himself is covered in blood from foot to the top of his head!  This is the<br>
blood of the Chechen people, the blood of our Russians, [as published] and<br>
the blood of Russian soldiers.  Today they are like small dogs who can bark<br>
at Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, and the whole of the presidential staff.  They<br>
took a step toward peace, but then stopped and corrected their mistake.<br>
Before the Communists yelled in parliament that it was necessary to stop the<br>
war, but when it was stopped, they began to yell that it cannot be stopped.<br>
If Seleznev is so concerned about the great power, let him come here and<br>
fight, but not send here ordinary Russian soldiers:  Let him send his own<br>
sons.  We shall gladly meet them and fight them.  And we shall also find a<br>
job for Seleznev:  He will shepherd my sheep in the mountains.  Let him<br>
come.  I need a good shepherd.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Once the issue of the prisoners of war has been raised, I<br>
simply must ask about their fate.  How many Russian servicemen are in the<br>
hands of the Ichkerian government, and what are the final terms for their<br>
release or exchange?<br>
 [Basayev]  I do not know the exact figure like nobody in the republic knows<br>
it.  But this figure is high.  And it is the Russian State Duma and<br>
personally Seleznev, who could not care less about the fate of these boys,<br>
that are to blame for that they have not as yet returned to their<br>
Motherland.  Some of them were killed here, while those who stayed alive<br>
cannot return home.  I have repeatedly invited the Russian leadership,<br>
members of the Russian delegation, and personally Boris Berezovskiy -- three<br>
days ago -- to make a goodwill gesture and show at least for once that this<br>
is after all a great state and a great power.  A great state should be<br>
generous, without none of the slavish emotions that today hold sway in the<br>
Duma.  I invited them to amnesty all Chechens and Ingushes who were<br>
imprisoned on the ethnic principle in the period from 26 November 1994 until<br>
26 November 1996.  I feel awkward having to teach the Russian leadership<br>
politics.  I am telling them:  "This will be a big stick in your hands.  You<br>
will be able to dictate terms to us in front of the word community!"  And<br>
we, the republic's leadership will have to run around looking for these<br>
prisoners of war or maybe their remains, and hand them over to Russia.<br>
Today our people are holding many POW's.  But the Russian special services<br>
from the very start chose to engage in exchanging POW's on a case by case<br>
basis, buying out military servicemen.  After that the Chechens stopped<br>
selling them POW's.  Because they are not indifferent to the fate of these<br>
people.  We have a different mentality:  In combat they are our enemies, but<br>
now we feel sorry for them.  Today I have given one prisoner of war to a<br>
friend.  When we caught him, he was all lice-infested, shabby, and dirty....<br>
If you talk to our people and say that prisoners need to be released, they<br>
say:  "But where are our men?  Can you ensure the release of our relative,<br>
who is being held, for no good reason, at a particular place?"  I say that<br>
today I cannot do this.  And they go:  We shall talk when you can.  The<br>
Chechens have this law:  A prisoner of war is private property.  Many see<br>
this as barbarism, as slavery.  No, this is not slavery!  They eat what we<br>
eat.  Some caught their POW's themselves; some bought them; some received<br>
them as a gift -- like this man here.  I have already released more than 200<br>
men for free: to soldiers' mothers and Chechens from various diasporas.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Do you consider Russia a hostile country?<br>
 [Basayev]  I feel deeply sorry for the Russian people.  Because at the end<br>
of the day we grew up in the same state, in the same family.  I remember the<br>
days when I sang:  "My address is not a street or a block number...."<br>
[reference to a popular Soviet-era song that goes on as follows:  My address<br>
is the Soviet Union]  Today people are in slavery.  The Russians must free<br>
themselves from it.  When I become the president I shall help Russia --<br>
providing humanitarian assistance.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  You have said this in at least three earlier interviews.<br>
What is your definition of slavery?<br>
 [Basayev]  Slavery is the complete indifference of a whole nation.  An<br>
aspiration to suppress everybody and everything, and to destroy everything<br>
and everybody.  And, third:  Russians live in poverty and so, they believe,<br>
everybody else should live in poverty.  A free person does not act like<br>
this.  A free person supports somebody when he falls and is glad when<br>
somebody makes progress.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Do you consider Russia a Christian country?<br>
 [Basayev]  I consider Russia a country of agnostics.  When, during this<br>
war, some ignorant people on our side said that we were fighting against<br>
Christians, that this was a crusade, I responded that we were fighting not<br>
Christians but agnostics.  What does it matter if somebody wears a cross<br>
around his neck but has no faith in his heart?  I cited concrete examples.<br>
It was the agnostics who organized a crusade against us.  No, I do not<br>
consider Russia to be Christian.  The main tenet of Christianity is this:<br>
"Thou shalt not kill." <br>
 [Shevchenko]  Do you believe that military crimes have been committed in<br>
Chechnya, and will you press for punishment of those who committed them?<br>
 [Basayev]  This is the concern of nongovernmental organizations that have<br>
been recording everything from the outset of the war.  Both military crimes<br>
and crimes against the person have been committed here as well as genocide<br>
against the Chechen people.  I mean the people of the Chechen Republic and<br>
also the Russians against whom genocide was also committed.  The culprits<br>
must answer for this.  They will be called to account before an<br>
international tribunal.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  The Russian-Chechen war is often related to economic<br>
problems.  The oil pipeline, oil fields, and many other things are cited in<br>
this context.  Are these the defining moments here, or is there something<br>
else besides?<br>
 [Basayev]  The defining moment here is the backward Russian policy.<br>
Russianism [rusizm] is a terrible ideology, worse than fascism, racism, and<br>
so forth.  This definition was given by our first president Dzhokhar<br>
Dudayev.  Today everybody is shouting that this abhorrent, bandit-style war<br>
is over oil, but they make it a point never to say that this is a<br>
"national-liberation" war.  This has been a war for our independence and our<br>
freedom.  Economically, we achieved great stabilization back in 1994.  The<br>
whole North Caucasus was buying from us.  Long convoys arrived at our<br>
bazaars with two battalions committed to ensure their protection.  Inflation<br>
was falling....  In January 1995 we were planning to introduce our own<br>
currency and our own Chechen passports.  All this caused the war.  We were<br>
setting a bad example to others.  And so, instead of learning from us, they<br>
decided simply to stop us. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  But at the same time the Chechen Republic was accused of<br>
sheltering bandits.  There was that scandal over false money orders....<br>
 [Basayev]  We called them "castle-builders."  They stuck in our throats<br>
like a bone.  They were stealing in Russia but building palaces or castles<br>
in the air here.  People hated them.  But we could not do anything.  Because<br>
Russia, which should have taken the first step by at least concluding an<br>
agreement on the extradition of criminals, would not do that.  It was<br>
because of the Russian leadership that these criminals managed to flee here<br>
and launder their money.  If Russian authorities do not officially state<br>
that they want a particular crook, how can we possibly indict him then?  And<br>
after this we are called a safe haven for bandits and thieves!  If official<br>
representatives are not sent here asking that certain persons be caught and<br>
extradited, we cannot do anything on our own.  Now when those terrorist acts<br>
started in Mineralnyye Vody, in the first two incidents we cooperated with<br>
[Russian] special services. We let them into our territory.  Incidentally,<br>
the Russian special services failed to catch the bandits, but we got them:<br>
We returned both the money and the men.  They did not like it that we were<br>
better at it. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  What kind of society do you intend to build in Chechnya?<br>
 [Basayev]  I am content with the situation whereby there are super-rich<br>
people.  But they should be rich by virtue of their brains, not at the<br>
expense of the state or the brazen sucking of people's blood:  We shall not<br>
allow anybody to get rich on people's blood.  Islam presupposes the<br>
existence of both rich and poor, but it also presupposes protection of the<br>
poor.  I want to enforce Chechen laws.  Today we live by Russian laws.  I am<br>
going to introduce two codes in the republic: a civilian code and a Sharia<br>
code.  In taking a matter to court, everybody is free to choose the first or<br>
the second....  Unofficially, this has always been so just the same.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  And still, do you see the possibility of a complete<br>
settlement of the Russian-Chechen relations?  How do you envision the future<br>
for Chechnya and Russia?<br>
 [Basayev]  In his time Dzhokhar Dudayev formulated our foreign policy<br>
principles.  Back in 1993 and 1994 I proposed that we have a common defense<br>
system with Russia.  And today the Chechens can easily field two special<br>
purpose brigades to defend Russian borders.  We have a common geopolitical<br>
space and common economic interests.  We can be the conduit of Russian<br>
policy in the Islamic world, in the Middle East.  Russia can be a conduit of<br>
our interests in Europe.  Or take the UN.  Will Russia not be happy with an<br>
extra vote on its side if we are allies?  We need not faraway America or<br>
nearby Turkey.  They have never helped us.  There has been talk to the<br>
effect that we shall end up under Iran, under Turkey...  The point is that<br>
we shall never be under anybody -- if only under Russia, and if only because<br>
we would be awed by such a great power.  The Almighty created us free, and<br>
we are slaves only to Allah.  Russia can benefit from having common economic<br>
interests with us.  We also stand to gain from this.  We agree to a<br>
commonwealth within the CIS. I understand that after taking on the republic<br>
like a bag on your shoulders we shall not be able to run away anywhere.  As<br>
they say, "not in Russia, but with Russia."  We agree to live in a common<br>
building, but only in our own apartment.<br>

	Proposal for funding of Noyan Tapan Acquisition.
<p>
Dear Hayastan and Groong readers,
<p>
We've been in touch with Noyan Tapan (NT) to acquire their news on a daily
basis for Groong. As you may already know, NT is based in Armenia and
sells its news service for a fee.
<p>
NT came forward voluntarily during September's elections in Armenia and
informed us with up-to-the-minute news and events for altruistic reasons.
We appreciated their work; we think that their news service is very
informative and timely, and we'd like to read more of it, and regularly.
<p>
Noyan Tapan has requested a fee of $250/month for a specially prepared
"Groong Edition" daily bulletin, and has sent us many days' worth of
samples. I'm attaching one day's worth below for your perusal and
judgement. I feel the fee is reasonable and well worth it.
<p>
In addition to improving our quality of news here on Groong, and being
better informed on Armenia and the Caucasus region in general, our
subscription to Noyan Tapan will be an explicit statement of support
and approval for free and independent media in Armenia.
<p>
As the daily readers of Groong News, there's only you to turn to, to fund
such a project. Therefore I'm asking all interested parties to come
forward with any amount of donation to fund the next 12 months' worth of
Noyan Tapan reception on Groong.
<p>
We need to raise $3000 for this. Groong has 1100 members and Hayastan
has 350. If 100 members come forward with $30 each, we're there! If
more members come forward, then we will arrange to receive as many
more months of daily Noyan Tapan as we have money for.  And if we
don't come up with the required funds, then I will assume that we're
not interested in receiving Noyan Tapan daily.
<p>
I ask that you send me email, with your pledge amount, which I will
tally. The deadline for this initial drive is December 25. If we're
well on the way, I'll extend the deadline a bit and continue reminding
very often, as I feel that this is a very worthy service and would
enhance our news from Armenia greatly.  I will of course update the
list very regularly of our progress. In fact, I can tell you that we
already have $260 from just 4 Groong readers!
<p>
My goal at the moment is to receive NT news daily for all of 1997.
<p>
Send no money now. Once final amounts are tallied, I'll inform the lists
where to send checks and who to write it out to. As far as trusting that
your (our) funds will be well used, I assure you that every penny will
be spent on this project, and there will be not a penny of administrative
overheard (I'll deal with that).
<p>
I hope to hear from you very soon. Please help if you can.
<p>
Regards,
<p>
Asbed

CC RESOLUTION REGARDING ELECTION RESULTS ADOPTED BY
MAJORITY OF VOTES
     YEREVAN, November  26   (Noyan  Tapan). "This was the first
attempt  to  raise a  dispute   between  the  opposition and the
authorities  onto  a   civilized   level,"   Chairman   of   the
Constitutional Court (CC) of Armenia Gagik Haroutiunian  said at
a Monday news conference.
     Haroutiunian said that the Constitutional Court had  chosen
the right way -- a search for a final decision  through thorough
scritiny and analysis of all available documents.
     Haroutiunian  reported  that the  Constitutional Court  had
charged  lawenforcement    agencies   to   institute    criminal
proceedings in connection with a number of violations and  carry
out a probe into those cases. Haroutiunian was  astonished  over
the fact   that  a  person who  had   stolen a ballot box from a
polling station was sentenced to 10  days  in  jail.  Meanwhile,
according to him, that was a serious crime.
     CC Chairman said that the law on the  Constitutional  Court
of the Republic  of Armenia bans publicising the results of  the
discussions.  He only said  that  the resolution  was adopted by
the majority of votes. Constitutional Court  Chairman noted that
under  the  legislation in  effect, protocols of closed  meeting
were immediately sealed and sent to  state  archives.  "Pethaps,
in some years they will be accessible,  and everybody will  have
an opportunity to know what had happened," he said.
     Haroutiunian said  it   was  not right   to  form electoral
commission by   party  representation principle, since, he said,
the commissions should be made up  of professionals, whose  work
must be supervised.
     Haroutiunian highly appreciated a worthy  behavior  of  the
aggrieved party representatives at  the Court.  He  said that it
thanks to  them  that  the  proceedings  were held  on  a really
civilized level. "Our  country  needs opposition as we have  the
Parliament,  Government   and   the  Constitutional  Court,"  CC
Chairman said.

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN KARABAKH AROUSED AZERBAIJAN'S
ANGER
     YEREVAN,  November 26   (Noyan Tapan).  The   November   24
presidential election  in  the   Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  were
held, despite statements from  a  number of countries that  they
will not recognize the election results.
     On the   same  day   rallies,   protesting   the   Karabakh
presidential   election  were    staged   in  Azerbaijan.    The
Instanbul-based  Armenian  "Marmara"  daily  reports  that Azeri
Culture Minister Polad Bul-Bul ogly said, addressing  a rally in
Baku,  that  the  elections  in Karabakh  were   nothing but  "a
politcal irritator". He said that  Azerbaijan  was  against  any
bloodshed, but,  if   necessary, they were ready  to  shed their
blood to liberate the occupied Azeri territories.

<p>
ECONOMIC REVIEW (NOVEMBER 17-24)
<p>
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).
<p>
     NATIONAL CURRENCY
     Dollar rate did not practically  change for the  week.  The
average cost of 1 USD decreased by 1 point and was equal to  434
drams during   the week.  At   the  same  time, the  margin (the
difference between sale and purchase prices) is still very  low.
Maximal sale  price   (433 drams against 1  dollar) dropped by 2
points, and minimal purchase price (436  drams) decreased by the
same two points.
     In principle, the  margin size is to  a certain  extent  an
indicator of the health of the national currency. The higher  is
the margin, the more alarming is  the  condition  of  the  given
currency, and vice versa. In our case, drop of the  margin  from
10 drams (2.5%  of the  dollar)  in  early November to  3  drams
(0.7%)  is a sign  of  healthening,  though  its causes are  not
clear.  The Government  did   not take  any efficient  steps  to
protect dram from devaluation , and did  not even  make a formal
statement on it. The Central Bank did only  one  thing:  for the
first time during  two months it  took part  in  tradings at the
Yerevan and Giumri Stock Exchange and purchased a rather  modest
sum of 200,000 dollars.
     But this   circumstance  could  never able  to  relax   the
tension on currency market. Here, we  have  probably  the result
of other factors: restraint from  emission, the  fact  that  the
government used only those sums that are  in circulation, delays
in pension and salary payments, and hence,  low consumer  demand
and  relatively  stable consumer prices.  Anyway,  it should  be
noted that it is not only the dollar rate that  affects consumer
prices, but  also consumer  prices cause changes  in the  dollar
rate.
     Exchange  rate  at the Moscow  Interbank Currency  Exchange
was 5,489 ruble on November 22.
<p>
     CONSUMER BUDGET
     By  the end   of  the  week the  cost  of   the living wage
consumer budget   was  12,900  drams (29.6 dollars). The cost of
the overalkl budget constituted 19,800 drams (45.5 dollars).
     So, the cost of the consumer budget dropped by  200  drams,
and 0.5 dollars.
<p>
     CONSUMER PRICES
     NT-16  index calculated   of  16 staple   food products was
equal  to 1,000,  i.e.  general level of consumer prices  had no
relation to changes in dollar rate and remained unchanged.
<p>
     INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
     Following the "Hrant"  index,  the investment  activity was
9.55 during the week.
<p>
     TREASURY BILLS MARKET
     "Sed  Marced"  index of   profitability of   treasury bills
constituted 0.3996, which is  456 points  lower  if  compared to
the previous   week. The profitability  was 39.96%. According to
President of   the Sed   Marced Firm  Tigran  Jerbashian,   such
decrease  is  conditioned by  the fact that  2,000,000,000-worth
treasury  bills were   used  up by  foreign  investors  two week
before.

            ------------- KARABAKH NEWS -----------
<p>
<p>
KARABAKH DISAPPOINTED WITH HELSINKI NEGOTIATIONS, FM SAYS
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan).  "We  are  disappointed
with the results of this round of negotiations  on  the Karabakh
conflict", Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady  Ghoukassian said at
a Nov. 26 news conference.
     He  noted that results  of  a  half-and-a-year  work of the
OSCE  Minsk  group  and  principles  of  the conflict settlement
worked out by the Armenian party were left out  of  the  account
at  the   Helsinki    negotiations.   Ghoukassian  said    that,
unfortunately, at the last moment  representatives of Azerbaijan
refused  to participate  in   the work,   insisting   that   the
negotiations  must be  held from the initial position,  i.e. the
principle of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.
     Ghoukassian  said  that  the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic did
not consider   itself to  be   a  part  of Azerbaijan,   and any
decision must proceed from this position.  "We  are  against any
attempts to   predetermine the  results   of  the  negotiations.
Respecting the  territorial  integrity,   Karabakh is  ready  to
discuss this issue only after both  contending sides  hold equal
initial positions at the  negotiations  and the Nagorno-Karabakh
Republic  is  viewed as   a subject  of the  international law,"
Karabakh's FM said. He described  statements by  the Azeri  side
as statements of the  lost party which  demands  capitulation of
its enemy. "If Azerbaijan really viewed Nagorno Karabakh  as its
integral part, it would have  decided this  problem  by  itself,
without turning to international organizations," he noted.
     According to Ghoukassian, Azerbaijan intends  to kick up  a
row at   the  forthcoming  OSCE summit   in Lisbon.  He   voiced
confidence  that if  Azerbaijan  insists  that  the  territorial
integrity be a basic principle of the  conflict settlement, then
Armenia will have to use its right to veto.
     He stressed  that  the  issue of  territorial  integirty is
directly connected with the problem of  Karabakh's  status. "The
fact  that the  Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic  is   independent  is
obvious  and the status of  Karabakh  must be  a  result  of the
negotiations,  and not   a starting   point  for   the  latter,"
Ghoukassian said.
     He emphasized   that  the presidential  election in Nagorno
Karabakh proved that the Karabakh people trusts its leadership.
     Ghoukassian said that the internal political  situation  in
Armenia had played a certain part in toughening of  position  of
Azerbaijan. However, he voiced confidence that  this  would  not
influence the positions of Karabakh and Armenia.
<p>
CONFLICTING SIDES FAIL TO AGREE A COMMON DOCUMENT
     YEREVAN, November  26  (Noyan   Tapan).  No document  to be
submitted at   the forthcoming OSCE summit in  Lisbon  has  been
adopted  at a recent  round of talks  over the Karabakh conflict
held in Helsinki. The positions of the parties  to  the conflict
remained unchanged,   President elect   of the  Nagorno-Karabakh
Republic Robert   Kocharian  said   at  a  news   conference  in
Stepanakert. He noted that no document had  been  adopted during
Libaridian-Guluzade meeting as well.
     Kocharian noted that there  is  still a  chance to  agree a
common  document  in  Vienna, a   document,  which  will then be
presented at   the  Lisbon summit.  But   he was skeptical about
that. He  said Azerbaijan  would stick  to its  position  as  it
hoped to   submit  its  own  document at   the   Lisbon  summit.
According to   Kocharian, the   Azeri side   will be pushing for
territorial integirty of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan counts  that the
document will be supported by all countries-participants of  the
cummit, and if Armenia  uses its rights to  veto  and  does  not
vote for  that  document, it will have  to  confront with  other
OSCE-member  countries.  Azerbaijan   believes  that  this  will
seriously affect Armenia's international image.
     "This is the major  position on  which  Azerbaijan  stakes.
Taking  this    position  Azerbaijan  torpedoes  any  compromise
decision which  might   be  achieved before the Lisbon  summit,"
Kocharian said.

MANVEL EGHIAZARIAN REFUSES TO ATTEND HEARINGS ON CASE OF 31
     YEREVAN, November 26 (Noyan Tapan). At a  Nov.  25  hearing
on the case of 31  Manvel  Eghiazarian's nephew Gagik Vanian did
not plead guilty to committing an attempt on policeman's life.
     Vanian  confirmed testimonies  that  he   had  given during
preliminary  probe.   He   said  that  on  the  day  of   arrest
Eghiazarian's house was encircled  by  armed people in masks and
heavy  military  vehicles (Vanian said the house  was surrounded
by tanks).  Armed  people burst  into the yard of the house  and
opened  fire.  Eghiazarian was   crying out: "Don't shoot, there
are small children at the house." Vanian said  he  was  not with
Eghiazarian   and  could   not    remember   precisely   whether
Eghiazarian returned fire or not. Vanian  said he  did not  know
whether the  assailants   were agents   of  the   lawenforcement
bodies.
     Vanian said that out of the arms  seized at his  apartment,
only 15 cartridges really belonged to him. He said he  kept them
as a memory about the Karabakh war. He said he did not  know how
the rest of the arms appeared at his apartment. As to arms  that
had been found at Eghiazarian's, Vanian  said  that  "Manvel has
always kept   arms at  home  and   even   much  more   than  the
lawenforcement agents have found."
     Manvel   Eghiazarian  said  that   he  refuses  to   attend
hearings, whereas   his  wife Mariam Khzyrjian will not  come to
the court as a witness.

RUSSIA
<p>
FORBES PROFILE. Security Council Deputy Secretary Boris Berezovskii said
an article published in the 30 December edition of the U.S. magazine
Forbes was filled with "fabrications, garbled facts, and direct lies,"
ITAR-TASS reported on 19 December. The article alleges that Berezovskii
became a billionaire through criminal means and suggests that he might
have been involved in the March 1995 assassination of TV journalist
Vladislav Listev and could perhaps be described as "the godfather of
Russia's godfathers." Berezovskii charged that Forbes had fallen victim
to a "disinformation campaign" and had become "a mouthpiece for
communist propaganda." The opposition Sovetskaya Rossiya published the
article in Russian before it appeared in Forbes, which NTV said "attests
to clear coordination between the two publications." Meanwhile,
Berezovskii was voted Patron of the Year by the Society for Supporting
Science and Education; his donation of $1.3 million financed conference
trips abroad for1,500 Russian scientists in 1996. -- Laura Belin
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERSHIP DENIES ABDUCTION OF NORTH OSSETIYAN DELEGATION.
Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov on 19 December denied
Russian media reports that Chechen militants were responsible for the
abduction of a delegation of North Ossetiyan and North Caucasian
officials, for whom a $6 million ransom has been demanded, AFP reported.
Udugov also told journalists that the Chechen Interior Ministry is on
the track of the killers of the six Red Cross volunteers and six Russian
civilians slain in Grozny earlier this week. He implicated Russian
security forces in the murders, which he said were intended to undermine
international support for Chechnya, Reuters and AFP reported. -- Liz
Fuller
<p>
MOSCOW ON CHECHEN ELECTIONS. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told
journalists in Kazan on 19 December that the Russian leadership
considers the Chechen parliamentary and presidential elections
"essential to the Chechen people" and hopes that they will be
"democratic and legitimate," ITAR-TASS reported. In Moscow, however,
State Duma Chairman Gennadii Seleznev argued in favor of postponing the
elections, which are scheduled for 27 January. Meanwhile, Ekho Moskvy
claimed on 19 December that the Ukrainian Academy of Military Sciences
has asked Chechen field commander and presidential candidate Shamil
Basaev to deliver a course of lectures on the subject of waging a
guerilla war in current conditions. Basaev reportedly accepted the offer
and declined the fee. -- Liz Fuller
<p>
TATARSTAN OPENS CHEVROLET PLANT. Presidential Chief of Staff Anatolii
Chubais, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and several other ministers on 19
December attended the ceremonial opening of the Yelabuga factory, which
will assemble Chevrolet Blazers, RTR and ITAR-TASS reported. The plant
plans to assemble 50,000 cars per year from imported components,
eventually rising to 300,000. They will sell at $23,000 each. The plant
will produce not the North American jeep but the more basic model that
GM sells in Brazil. General Motors owns 50% of the shares in the
venture; the Russian and Tatarstan governments 25% each. This is the
first foreign venture in the auto industry to start production since
Soviet times. -- Peter Rutland
<p>
SPACE AGENCY ASKS FOR MORE MONEY. Russian Space Agency head Yurii Koptev
told the Duma on 18 December that the government should increase
spending on the space industry in the 1997 budget by 1.8 trillion rubles
to 5.1 trillion rubles ($920 million), ITAR-TASS and AFP reported.
Koptev warned that without additional funds the agency will not be able
to continue work with the U.S. on the Alfa space station. He noted that
50% of Russia's satellites are outdated and that the stock of rockets is
virtually exhausted. Funds from Western companies and agencies accounted
for 40% of the industry's funding in 1996, and the industry expects to
receive $600 million from such sources in 1997. The space industry was
allocated 3 trillion rubles in the 1996 budget, but only 2.4 trillion
were released. As a result, Russia was able to carry out only 11 of 27
scheduled space lauches in 1996. -- Natalia Gurushina

LATEST ISSUE OF OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER CONFISCATED IN ARMENIA. The 18
December issue of Ayzhm, the newspaper of the opposition National
Democratic Union, has been confiscated by the Haymamul state-run
distributing agency, Groong reported on 18 December citing Asbarez-on-
line. Ayzhm's latest issue contained an article critical of Haymamul's
activities. The agency, which has a monopoly over newspaper
distribution, has been repeatedly slammed by Armenian journalists for
its allegedly inefficient work, including delays in paying periodicals
for copies sold. Some journalists claim that the agency is used by the
authorities as an instrument of control over the media. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
TURKMENISTAN SUSPENDS GAS SUPPLIES TO ARMENIA. Turkmenistan has
suspended natural gas supplies to Armenia because of the latter's $15
million debt for 1996, Noyan Tapan and AFP reported on 19 December.
Armenian Energy Minister Gagik Martirosyan said that Armenia's energy
sector now has debts of $75 million as a result of nonpayments by
enterprises, government agencies, and individuals. He added that
Armenian officials are currently negotiating with the Turkmen side and
suggested that gas supplies may soon resume. -- Emil Danielyan
<p>
IMF SUSPENDS LOAN TO UZBEKISTAN. The International Monetary Fund on 19
December suspended a $185 million standby loan to Uzbekistan, Reuters
reported. Further disbursements have been postponed because Uzbekistan
failed to meet the fund's inflation targets, according to Mark O'Brien,
the IMF's resident representative in Tashkent. Uzbekistan's target for
1996 was 25%, but inflation is estimated to have exceeded 40%. Another
factor was the introduction of draconian foreign exchange controls in
October. Further payments have been condtioned on a "very tight
financial policy...combined with a full liberalization of access to
foreign exchange." -- Lowell Bezanis
<p>
HIGH PRICES FOR KAZAKSTANI BROADCAST FREQUENCIES. Information obtained
by Internews in Moscow suggests that prices at a planned auction for
broadcast frequencies in Kazakstan will prove prohibitively high for
independent stations. A decree signed by Deputy Prime Minister Imangali
Tasmagimbetov on 12 December lists annual fees and auction starting
prices for radio and television frequencies. Bidding for radio
frequencies with the weakest signals (FM 100-1,000W) will begin at
$30,857; radio stations will also have to pay an annual fee of $6,171.
The highest starting price--$114,285--is for UHF television frequencies
(100-1,000W). Companies will also have to pay an annual fee of $11,428.
Discounts will be available for stations broadcasting outside Almaty and
Akmola. Frequency licenses cost $500, and only Kazakstani companies can
apply. Such high costs are likely to force most independent stations off
the air. -- Bruce Pannier

ONE MAN'S SOLUTION TO WAGE ARREARS IN KAZAKSTAN. Kazhmurad Nagmanov, the
head (akim) of the eastern Kazakstan region, is encouraging heads of
local factories to sell their cars in order to pay their workers,
Reuters reported citing an article in the 20 December Kazakstani daily
Karavan Blitz. Unpaid wages have become a chronic problem in Kazakstan,
triggering several demonstrations to protest living conditions.
According to Karavan Blitz, there was no indication that "the directors
were rushing to take the akim's advice." -- Bruce Pannier

SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE
<p>
FEDERAL YUGOSLAV FOREIGN MINISTER DOES NOT RULE OUT NEW ELECTIONS . . .
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Milan
Milutinovic, said on 19 December that yet another round of municipal
elections in those centers where the opposition Zajedno coalition
originally scored victories cannot be ruled out. But he added that such
elections would be contingent on an OSCE recommendation. "Should the
OSCE delegation which is coming here [on 20 December] recommend new
elections in Serbia after making a thorough and impartial review, we
would accept that," he said. Meanwhile, CNN reported that Milutinovic
also said that the strategy of the demonstrators has outlived its
usefulness. "Here in Serbia, there is an old saying that when the song
is over, you stop singing," he said. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
. . . AND DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUE. Across Serbia, meanwhile, mass
demonstrations demanding that the regime recognize the opposition
electoral victories continued into a their 30th day on 19 December.
Radio Index reported that more than 200,000 people marched in Belgrade
in one of that city's largest single protest actions to date. For their
part, Zajedno leaders also used the occasion for a mass celebration of
St. Nicholas Day. On 18 December, some 37 students began a march from
Kragujevac, about 120 km from Belgrade, to the capital with a protest
letter they were intending to deliver to Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic. Meanwhile, pro-Milosevic demonstrations continued on 19
December for a second day throughout small towns in Serbia, including
Kosovo. So far, such events have been attended by only a few thousand
people, mostly elderly and die-hard communists, and they have not taken
place in Belgrade. -- Stan Markotich
<p>
CROATIA, VATICAN SIGN KEY AGREEMENTS. Croatia and the Holy See signed
three documents on 19 December to regulate their relations, Croatian and
international media reported. The texts cover legal issues, education
and culture, and the role of priests in the army and police. The head of
the government's religious affairs commission, Jure Radic, said that
Croatia has thus become the first former communist country of Eastern
Europe to establish "full ties" with the Vatican, Reuters added.
Cardinal Franjo Kuharic praised the agreements as legalizing the status
of the Roman Catholic church, and stated that the still-open question of
former church properties confiscated by the Communists could be solved
soon. More than 90% of Croats are nominally Roman Catholic, but polls
consistently show that, while Kuharic himself is well liked, there is
strong opposition to a larger political role for the church and to the
church's stand on abortion. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
IZETBEGOVIC WARNS AGAINST SERBIAN BLACKMAIL OVER BRCKO. The Muslim
member of the Bosnian presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, has warned the
international community against yielding to Serbian pressure in the
upcoming arbitration over the strategic town of Brcko, Onasa reported on
19 December. The president of the Republika Srpska, Biljana Plavsic, had
said on 16 December that there will be war if anyone tries to take the
formerly majority Muslim town away from the Serbs (see Pursuing Balkan
Peace, 17 December 1996). Izetbegovic has now responded that his forces
could have taken the town in late 1995 but accepted arbitration under
the Dayton agreement instead. He said he did so because he believes the
legal arguments are on his side, a point Dnevni avaz reiterated on 20
December. Izetbegovic concluded: "The only right that [the Serbs] stress
is the right of the stronger. This right exists no more, because they
are not stronger any more. If there really were a war for Brcko, there
is no doubt who would win it. -- Patrick Moore
<p>
HERCEG-BOSNA SAID TO BE OFFICIALLY DISMANTLED . . . Kresimir Zubak, the
former president of the Muslim-Croat Federation and a Croat member of
the three-man Bosnian presidency, said on 19 December that the Bosnian
Croat para-state of Herceg-Bosna ceased to exist on 17 December, the
same day that the Bosnian republican government transferred its
functions to the federation, Oslobodjenje reported the next day. In a
letter to international peace envoy Carl Bildt and U.S. envoy John
Kornblum, Zubak said a special commission will be in charge of the
details of dismantling the mini-state. Zubak said all stamps,
stationery, and other documents will be withdrawn and requested that the
same be done by the Bosnian government. Zubak also asked that the
information and documentation agency, which the Croats claim is an
espionage organization directed against them, be dismantled. He said the
Federation Forum, which he prevented from convening last week, should
meet as soon as possible to deal with the question of implementing the
federation. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<p>
. . . BUT EVICTIONS OF MUSLIMS FROM MOSTAR CONTINUE. UNHCR spokeswoman
Ariane Quentier said an elderly Muslim couple was expelled from the
Croat-held part of Mostar on 18 December, thus bringing the number of
Muslims driven out since the beginning of the year to 73, AFP reported
on 19 December. The couple were forced out by men who showed them "a
temporary authorization" from Herceg-Bosna authorities to move into the
apartment. Meanwhile, the Croat mayor of Mostar, Ivan Prskalo, accused
his Muslim deputy, Safet Orucevic, of wanting to spark a conflict in the
city, saying that his statements "only offer one option for the future:
war," AFP reported. In other news, Croatian Ambassador to the UN Mario
Nobilo said Croatia is not willing to support the Croat-Muslim
Federation until the alleged poor treatment of Croats in central Bosnia
and Sarajevo stops, Oslobodjenje reported on 18 December. -- Daria Sito

                               ======<br>
 Tajik talks postponed<br>
	A planned meeting between the president of Tajikistan<br>
and the troubled Central Asian nation's opposition leader has<br>
been postponed for at least one day. Tajik opposition leader<br>
said Said Abdullo Nuri arrived in the Russian capital several<br>
hours after his talks with President Emomali Rakhmonov were to<br>
begin Thursday. The rivals in the former Soviet republic reached<br>
a cease-fire deal last week to end months of escalating<br>
fighting. They also pledged to sign a blueprint for peace and<br>
political reconcilitaion at the Moscow meeting. Differences<br>
remain that could make the talks rocky: The linchpin of the<br>
peace plan is a pledge to form a joint commission that would<br>
iron out disputes, but the sides disagree on how much power the<br>
group will have. The opposition wants to share real power<br>
through the commission until new elections can be held.<br>
Emomali's government does not want to release its increasingly<br>
weak hold on war-ravaged Tajikistan and its rival<br>
clans. Fighting has plagued the impoverished nation of 5.7<br>
million since a 1992 civil war that that killed tens of<br>
thousands of people and drove much of the opposition across the<br>
frontier into Afghanistan.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Uzbekistan gets $50 million loan<br>
	The Manila-based Asian Development Bank Wednesday said<br>
it has approved a $50-million loan and $830,000 technical<br>
assistance grant to rehabilitate and modernize agro-processing<br>
enterprises in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. The<br>
bank said the loan to the former Soviet republic aims to enable<br>
medium non-state firms to access new export markets. "It will<br>
also provide collective and family farms with new<br>
micro-processing facilities," an ADB official said. Agriculture<br>
plays a key role in Uzbekistan's economy, accounting for nearly<br>
30 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 45<br>
percent of total employment. Prior to its independence in 1991,<br>
the country was among the largest producers of fruits and<br>
vegetables in the former Soviet Union, and was the source of<br>
fresh and processed fruit and vegetable products to other<br>
republics.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkish bulker impounded at Port Said<br>
	A Turkish bulker has been impounded at Port Said, in<br>
Egypt, after allegations that her operator failed to pay<br>
$450,000 for fuel and provisions another of its ships had taken<br>
on an earlier voyage, the Lloyd's List said Wednesday. The<br>
26,732 dwt Gokceli, operated by Istanbul-based Akmar Shipping<br>
and Trading Co., was impounded after sailing through the Suez<br>
Canal. The vessel, Hassan B, allegedly slipped away from Port<br>
said in October without paying her dues, the paper said.<br>
                               ======<br>
 European rights court condemns Turkey<br>
	The European Court of Human Rights has has ordered<br>
Turkey to pay compensation to the family of an ethnic Kurd who<br>
was allegedly tortured while in police custody. The man, Zeki<br>
Aksoy, was killed in Turkey 16 months after being released from<br>
jail and several weeks after he filed a complaint with the<br>
European court, which is based in the eastern French city of<br>
Strasbourg. Turkish authorities have denied any involvement in<br>
the killing and have charged a member of a Kurdish dissident<br>
group with his death. The court said Wednesday that Aksoy was<br>
arrested in November 1992 in Kizitepe, in southeastern Turkey,<br>
and held by police for at least 14 days. It said that while in<br>
police custody he was tortured by having live electrical wires<br>
placed on his genitals. He was also allegedly stripped naked and<br>
hung by his arms for long periods, as a result of which he<br>
suffered paralysis of the lower arms. The European court ruled<br>
the torture constituted "extremely serious violations" of the<br>
European Convention on Human Rights. It ordered Turkey to pay<br>
the equivalent of around $42,000 in compensation to Aksoy's<br>
father, plus legal costs of about $35,000.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Australia supplies ferries to Turkey<br>
	Western Australian aluminum shipbuilding specialist<br>
Austal Ships has strengthened its export market standing with<br>
the completion of two passenger catamarans for a Turkish ferry<br>
operator, the Lloyd's List said Wednesday. The London shipping<br>
daily said the deliveries involve the 450 passenger-capacity<br>
sisters Sinan Pasa and Piyale Pasa. The contract forms part of<br>
one of the largest single deals in the history of Australia's<br>
light-weight vessel construction industry. The ferries will be<br>
deployed on Bosporus crossings and between ports in the Sea of<br>
Marmara, the paper said. Meanwhile, Turkish shippers, Akdeniz<br>
Gemi Isletmeciligi, in Istanbul, has given a $2 million contract<br>
to Antwerp Shiprepairers to replace some 152 tonnes of steel on<br>
board the 124,100 dwt Turkish bulk carrier Esra 1. The vessel<br>
suffered engine problem, struck a lock and was grounded while<br>
entering Antwerp in late November.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Turkey, Russia sign anti-terrorism pact<br>
	The foreign ministers of Turkey and Russia have sought<br>
to smooth out troubled relations by pledging to cooperate in<br>
fighting terrorism. Tansu Ciller and Yevgeny Primakov signed the<br>
anti-terrorism memorandum Wednesday. Ciller is in Moscow for<br>
talks on trade and problems that plaguing the traditionally<br>
tense relationship. The pact aims to dispel Kremlin concern<br>
about perceived Turkish support for Chechen rebels and Turkish<br>
anger over what it sees as Russian support for the separatist<br>
Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK -- which has offices in<br>
Russia. Another prickly point came up with Primakov's defense of<br>
reported Russian plans to sell ground-to-air missile systems to<br>
the Greek Cypriots. He says such sales would not threaten peace<br>
because the weapons are "not offensive." Ciller also met with<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to discuss trade, thriving<br>
despite a struggle to host the export route for Caspian Sea oil<br>
and a dispute over regulations for passage of tankers through<br>
Turkish straits. Ciller and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov agreed on<br>
the construction of a trade center to bring order to the $6<br>
billion "suitcase trade" done by Russians who buy goods in<br>
Turkey and sell them at home.<br>
                               ======<br>
 Japan and EBRD rebuild Uzbek refinery<br>
	Japan's Eximbank and the European Bank for<br>
Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, will team up to help fund<br>
the overhaul of the Fergana Oil Refinery in Uzbekistan. Japan<br>
will contribute $85.5 million to the project under an agreement<br>
signed in Tokyo by Eximbank and the Uzbek Bank for Foreign<br>
Economic Activities, the Russian Interfax news agency<br>
reported. An Uzbek government official told the agency Wednesday<br>
that the EBRD will lend the same amount, and Uzbekistan will<br>
provide about $30 million to cover the remaining costs of the<br>
project. Japan's Mitsui will carry out the upgrade, which<br>
involves installing new equipment to refine locally drilled oil<br>
with a high sulfur content. The overhaul is scheduled to take<br>
three years.<br>

 Japan in $130m Uzbekistan airport loan<br>
	Japan will lend Uzbekistan $130 million to improve<br>
airports in the "silk route" cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and<br>
Khiva, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported Tuesday. An<br>
agreement on the loan was signed in Tokyo by Uzbek Deputy Prime<br>
Minister Bakhtier Khamidov and Akira Nishigaki, president of<br>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Foundation, Itar-Tass<br>
said. Like an earlier Japanese credit for construction of a<br>
plant in Uzbekistan to repair railroad cars, the airport loan is<br>
repayable over 30 years with an annual interest of 2.7 percent<br>
after a 10-year grace period. A Japanese official said the easy-<br>
term loan was the third to be granted to Uzbekistan by the<br>
foundation under a program to speed up development in nations<br>
with gross national product per capita of $695 to $1,345. Per<br>
capita GNP in the Central Asian nation of 22 million was $950 in<br>
1994, according to Japanese figures. The total of the three<br>
loans granted over the past two years is about $300 million, the<br>
official said.<br>

 South Korea joins Uzbek bank venture<br>
	South Korea's Daewoo Securities and Koram Bank have<br>
signed a contract to join a bank project in Uzbekistan, a<br>
spokesman said Tuesday. Starting next month, the bank will<br>
provide general bank services, targeting South Korean companies<br>
in Uzbekistan, spokesman Min Kyong-bu said. Daewoo will hold 55<br>
percent equity and Koram 10 a percent stake in the $20-million<br>
UzDaewoo Bank, Min said. The European Bank for Reconstruction<br>
and Development will own a 25-percent stake, while<br>
Uzbekistan-based firms NBSEA and Turon Bank will each hold 5<br>
percent, the spokesman said. Some 20 South Korean companies,<br>
including Daewoo Group, currently operate businesses in<br>
Uzbekistan, Min said.<br>

 Turkish leader hints Iran military ties<br>
	Turkey's prime minister risked a crisis Tuesday with the<br>
United States by announcing that he was seeking military<br>
cooperation with Iran.  "Military cooperation would be for the<br>
benefit of both countries," Nemettin Erbakan told reporters on<br>
the eve of a visit to Ankara by Iranian President Ali Akbar<br>
Hashemi Rafsanjani. Asked whether such a move would not conflict<br>
with the U.S. call to isolate Iran, Erbakan said. "No, it means<br>
that Turkey is an independent country," he said.  Erbakan, who<br>
leads the hard-line Muslim Welfare Party, has made it a feature<br>
of his premiership to turn Turkey toward eastern, Muslim-<br>
dominated countries. He made his first foreign visit to Iran in<br>
August.  U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said<br>
last week that the United States was aware of reports that<br>
Turkey was interested in military cooperation with<br>
Iran. "Should that be true, we would be greatly concerned,"<br>
Burns said. Recalling that Turkey is a U.S. ally in the North<br>
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Burns said: "We believe the<br>
Turkish government ought to understand a fundamental fact: The<br>
Iranian government is a government that sponsors terrorism and<br>
is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction." "Why would<br>
any NATO country want to help Iran enhance its defense<br>
production capabilities? It does not make sense, and we would be<br>
opposed to it," Burns added. But on Tuesday, Erbakan said of<br>
Turkey's NATO membership: "Trying to make a defense agreement<br>
with a non-NATO country is something else again." He did not<br>
elaborate. Erbakan said other NATO countries had already sold<br>
weapons to Iran and reminded reporters that on his August visit<br>
to Tehran, Turkey and Iran had agreed to double their volume of<br>
trade to $2 billion a year. "We will jointly lower customs<br>
tariffs, and we will not be paying in dollars," Erbakan said.<br>

	+&gt; Turkey pleased by Kurd camp closure  <br>
	+&gt; Turkmenistan in agricultural crisis  <br>
	+&gt; Turkey marks first shipment of Iraq oil  <br>
                               ======	 <br>
 Turkey pleased by Kurd camp closure<br>
	Turkey expressed satisfaction Monday with a United<br>
Nations decision to withdraw from a Kurdish refugee camp in<br>
northern Iraq, which the government in Ankara considered a base<br>
for separatist rebels. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees<br>
office said last week it was pulling out of the camp at Atrush<br>
because the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, had taken<br>
effective control of the camp. ``We are pleased with the U.N.<br>
decision to close the camp, where our Kurdish people are under<br>
heavy pressure from the PKK,'' Turkish Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman Omer Akbel said. Turkey would welcome effective<br>
implementation of the refugee panel's decision in the ``shortest<br>
time possible. We are ready to extend our help in every way for<br>
the return of the Turkish Kurd inhabitants back to Turkey.'' The<br>
camp, set up two years ago about 40 miles (65 km) from the<br>
Turkish border, shelters about 14,000 Kurds who fled the<br>
fighting between secessionist rebels and Turkish troops in<br>
southeastern Turkey. No date has been scheduled for the<br>
withdrawal, but a spokeswoman at the regugee agency's<br>
headquarters in Geneva said it was pulling out because ``we can<br>
no longer provide support. PKK sympathisers are in control of<br>
the camp committee.'' Ankara has long been seeking closure of<br>
the Atrush camp, which it said was being used as a base for the<br>
PKK, who have been fighting since 1984 to carve an independent<br>
Kurdistan out of southeastern Turkey. At least 21,000 people<br>
have been killed and many more wounded in the insurgency.<br>

 Turkmenistan in agricultural crisis<br>
	Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov says the nation<br>
must solve a worsening agricultural crisis that is seeing some<br>
of its 4 million citizens go hungry despite rich material<br>
resources. Niyazov has told a state council meeting that farmers<br>
in Turkmenistan have harvested less than half the planned amount<br>
of grain this year and said the cotton harvest is three times<br>
smaller than projected. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass quotes<br>
him as saying the situation ``demands an immediate solution''<br>
and suggesting croplands be handed over to those who work them<br>
to create incentive. He says, ``The need has arrived to give<br>
land to its real owners, who will provide the nation and the<br>
people with agricultural products they produce themselves.''<br>
Niyazov says 450,000 tons of cotton have been harvested this<br>
year instead of the planned 1.4 million tons, and 480,000 tons<br>
of grain instead of 1 million. Reports say bread is scarce in<br>
some regions. Niyazov has created a personality cult in the<br>
former Soviet republic and rules with an iron hand. He has had<br>
trouble boosting the economy despite natural gas reserves that<br>
are the fourth largest in the world.<br>

 Turkey marks first shipment of Iraq oil<br>
	Turkey Monday held a ceremony to mark the first shipment<br>
of Iraqi oil after a six-year freeze caused by U.N. economic<br>
sanctions against the Arab country for invading its tiny Arab<br>
neighbor Kuwait in 1990.  Although the sanctions remain in<br>
place, a special U.N. approved oil-for- food deal allows Iraq to<br>
export $2 billion worth of crude every six months to pay for<br>
medicine and essential food for the Iraqi people and to pay<br>
compensation to victims of the invasion that ended with the 1991<br>
Gulf War. Pumping from Iraq's northern Kirkuk fields began last<br>
week, sending tons of oil through a joint Iraqi-Turkish pipeline<br>
to Yumurtalik terminal in southern Turkey. The Anatolian news<br>
agency said oil was loaded on the 150,000 dwt Turkish tanker<br>
Gole at Ceyhan at a ceremony attended by Turkish Prime Minister<br>
Necmettin Erbakan and his deputy Tansu Ciller. ``The<br>
celebrations are not only for the first loading of the tanker<br>
with Iraqi oil but also signal the (economic) revival of our<br>
southeast region,'' said Erbakan. He said he hoped that the<br>
economic ties with Iraq would flourish in the near<br>
future. Ciller, who is also the Foreign Minister in the<br>
Islamist-led Coalition, said Turkey's aim was to make use of the<br>
full capacity of the pipeline soon. Turkey had closed the<br>
pipeline in 1990 in line with the U.N. economic sanctions.<br>
Turkey's state-owned oil refiner Tupras was the first company to<br>
sign a contract in Baghdad last week for the daily shipment of<br>
75,000 barrels of Iraqi crude.<br>

Archbishop Norayr Bogharian of the Brotherhood of St.<br>
James died last night. He will be interred tomorrow,<br>
Saturday, after services in St. James Cathedral,<br>
Jerusalem.<br>
<p>
Archbishop Bogharian was born in Aintab on 17 January,<br>
1904. After the deportations during which he was chiefly<br>
in Syria, he studied at St. James, Jerusalem, under the<br>
learned Patriarch Eghishe Turian. He was ordained as<br>
celibate priest on Transfiguration Sunday, July 22, 1928<br>
He then studied for two years in London and returned to<br>
Jerusalem, where he lived for the rest of his life,<br>
except for 1935-1940 during which he was Dean of the<br>
Seminary in Antelias.<br>
<p>
He became Keeper of Manuscripts in 1949 and held that<br>
position until he was 90 years old.<br>
<p>
He was a remarkable scholar, and wrote very numerous<br>
articles on Armenological matters in Sion for the most<br>
part, but also in Hask, Echmiadzin and other journals.<br>
<p>
His major life's work was the full catalogue of the<br>
almost 4,000 manuscripts of the Library of the Patriarchate.<br>
These eleven volumes appeared between 1966 and 1991. His<br>
other works include a critical edition of the poems of<br>
Yovhannes Tlkuranc'i, his work on Armenian Literature,<br>
Hay Groghner, on Scribes, Hay Gric`ner and Painters,<br>
Hay Nkaric`ner. He wrote up to the last days before his<br>
death and since his retirement from the Manuscript<br>
Library, had produced a new edition of Girk' Tl'toc'<br>
(The Book of Letters) and a number of other books.<br>
<p>
Norayr srpazan was without doubt the premier Armenologist<br>
of the time. He was a small man, of enormous learning,<br>
who loved learning and did not suffer fools lightly. But<br>
a human man, with a sense of humor to be appreciated. He<br>
was a faithful servant of his Church and of St. James<br>
all his life.<br>
<p>
Those who have been touched by him will carry the<br>
imprint always.<br>
<p>
He was a patron member of AIEA from its founding.<br>
<p>
His life will be a light for our feet.<br>

<p>
1. REPERATION FOR GENOCIDE MUST BE SOUGHT, SAYS KOCHARIAN<br>
<p>
PARIS (Gamk)-Reparation to the Armenian people for the Genocide <br>
must be pursued, outlined Nagorno-Karabakh Republic President <br>
Robert Kocharian during a public meeting at the Royal Monceau <br>
Hotel Wednesday, where the leader also discussed the recent <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Lisbon summit <br>
and the role of all Armenians in the future of Karabakh.<br>
	"Armenian should have weakened Turkeys position by <br>
addressing the Genocide issue and the territorial reparations <br>
stemming from it," remarked Kocharian during discussion of <br>
Armenias policy prior to and during the OSCE Lisbon summit.<br>
	Kocharian stated that Turkey, as the perpetrator of the <br>
Armenian Genocide, should not be a part of the OSCE peace talks, <br>
since it advocates for the same interests as Azerbaijan, thus its <br>
position is one-sided on the international mediating effort.<br>
	"Karabakh has already declared its independence through a <br>
referendum, and any concession which endangers the security of the <br>
Karabakh people will not take place-not today, not ever," asserted <br>
Kocharian.<br>
	The Karabakh leader admitted that Azerbaijan was preparing <br>
itself for one year through diplomacy and Armenia, especially in <br>
the latter part of the year, was busy with the presidential <br>
elections and thus was not prepared at the summit.<br>
	Kocharian characterized the outcome of the Lisbon summit as <br>
neither a victory nor a defeat, stressing that Armenia utilized <br>
its veto privilege and halted a pro-Azeri resolution from being <br>
included in the final declaration, despite the efforts of the <br>
international community which, based on their own interests, sided <br>
with Azerbaijan where oil issue is an important one.<br>
	In addressing the military condition in Karabakh, Kocharian <br>
explained that todays Karabakh army cannot be compared to the <br>
battalions of Hadrut and Stepanakert of some years back.<br>
	"Our soldiers must constantly be trained, live in proper <br>
conditions, in order to be able to continue their devoted-and <br>
imperative-service for the future of the Republic," Kocharian <br>
stated.<br>
	The president also emphasized that during all talks, a <br>
representative of northern Karabakh, who is a native of the still <br>
occupied Shahumian Region, is always included.<br>
	Kocharian explained that recognition of independence was not <br>
a priority for Karabakh initially, adding that neutralizing Azeri <br>
firing posts and liberating Azeri-occupied territory became the <br>
vanguard for the Karabakh struggle, as did  guaranteeing the <br>
rights and will of the people of Karabakh.<br>
	The recognition issue, Kocharian stressed, is a matter which <br>
could take years to achieve.<br>
	Kocharian also emphasized the importance of the Diaspora in <br>
assisting in the enhancement of Karabakhs economy, and called on <br>
all Diaspora-Armenians to participate in the rebuilding process of <br>
Karabakh.<br>
	Stressing that people of Karabakh have paid their dues for <br>
the entire Armenian nation through their will and blood, Kocharian <br>
said  now the time has come for Armenia and the Diaspora to share <br>
in the process and assist the people of Karabakh who have <br>
experienced such horrors as the Sumgait and Kirovabad massacres.<br>
	"The most important issue for us is the youth and the task <br>
of keeping them in Karabakh. For this we need to provide them with <br>
work and education and create personal security. It is a major <br>
tragedy for us when more than 5000 youth leave Karabakh-even if <br>
they establish residence in Armenia," stressed Kocharian.<br>
	The president also spoke about Karabakhs agricultural <br>
capabilities, stating that this year, Karabakh produced more than <br>
13,000 metric tons of wheat, adding that other agricultural crops <br>
were also on the rise.<br>
	He stated that the Karabakh government planned to implement <br>
a privatization program beginning in 1997, reminding the audience <br>
that the 150,000 residents of Karabakh cannot overcome the <br>
obstacles and difficulties facing them, alone.<br>
	The gathering which was organized by the Armenian Ambassador <br>
to France Viken Chitechian and the Friends of the Armenian Embassy <br>
organization was mainly to allow a dialogue between the French-<br>
Armenian community and the Karabakh leader.<br>
	At the on set of the program, Kocharian discussed his visit <br>
to the various communities in France, as well as briefed the <br>
participants about meetings with French and Swiss government <br>
officials, stating that he has met mayors, members of parliaments <br>
and high-ranking officials at the foreign ministries of France and <br>
Switzerland.<br>
	He emphasized that the Karabakh side was lobbying for France <br>
to assume the co-chairmanship of the OSCE Minsk Group.<br>
	Kocharian stated that his visit, coupled with the active <br>
political participation of the French-Armenian community could <br>
improve Frances negative position vis-a-vis Karabakh.<br>
	Kocharian was accompanied by his wife, Karabakhs <br>
representative in Armenia Alexander Harutunian, as well as <br>
Karabakhs representative to France and the European Parliament <br>
Varoujan Grigorian.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. MEDZAMOR UPGRADING CONTINUES<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The second block of  Armenias Medzamor <br>
nuclear power plant is currently working at 92 percent of its <br>
projected capacity, generating some 370 megawatt/hour daily, <br>
director of the plant, Souren Azatian said Thursday at a news <br>
conference called on the 20th anniversary of the plant.<br>
	Since its resumption last year, Medzamor has been stopped <br>
only once which testifies to a higher degree of its safety, <br>
Azatian said. He discussed plans aimed at further increasing the <br>
plants safety.<br>
	"The Armenian nuclear power plant will be working until <br>
another block is built on the same ground. Besides, the nuclear <br>
power plant will be stopped in a year after a new block is put <br>
into operation," Azatian said.<br>
	Armenia is currently working with French Framatom company, <br>
which has pledged to assist Armenia in constructing nuclear waste <br>
depositories.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. GAS SUPPLY TO ARMENIA AND GEORGIA SHUT OFF<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Combined Sources)-Gas supplies to Armenia and Georgia <br>
were shut off Wednesday morning as a result of non-payment of <br>
debts incurred by the two countries.<br>
	Armenias debt to the joint Russia-Turkmenistan Itera <br>
enterprise has totaled $15 million for the past 11 months, <br>
Armenias Energy Minister Gagik Martirossian said Thursday during <br>
a briefing.<br>
	Martirossian said that Armenias industrial enterprises and <br>
population owe large sums to the energy sector. At present, <br>
Armenias energy sector debt totals $75 million, more than half of <br>
which was incurred by private citizens.<br>
	According to Martirossian, the debt is expected to grow, but <br>
at a slower rate until next August when the restructuring of <br>
Armenias energy sector will be completed and it will be possible <br>
to make regular payments for the consumed energy. The debt will be <br>
fully repaid in at least two years, Martirossian said.<br>
	Martirossian reported that those who regularly pay their <br>
utility bills should not expect power or natural gas to be shut <br>
down. Measures are being take to resume the gas supply.<br>
	Before Wednesdays shut down, Armenia received 5 million <br>
cubic meters of gas daily, of which 3 million was used to generate <br>
power.<br>
	Armenians have grown accustomed to difficulties with energy <br>
supplies in the years since independence. Having no natural energy <br>
sources and being subject to Azeri blockades, they are used to <br>
dealing with one fuel supply crisis after another.<br>
	With the recently announced reforms, Armenian consumers are <br>
expected to pay more to heat their homes and maintain power <br>
supplies. Under an agreement signed nearly a year ago with the <br>
World Bank, the Armenian government is scheduled to implement an <br>
increase in utility costs starting in January.<br>
	The aim is to create a rational economic basis for the <br>
functioning of the electricity industry, first by covering the <br>
cost of production, and secondly by financing rejuvenation of the <br>
antiquated system.<br>
	Prices are due to rise next month by some 30 percent to 20 <br>
dram (about 4.5 cents) per kilowatt/hour of electricity. Further <br>
price increase are expected in stages during the year.<br>
	Armenian Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian plans to hold talks <br>
with the World Bank next month in order to adjust the terms of the <br>
original agreement. Sarkissian believes a segment of the <br>
population will not be able to pay such a high price for <br>
electricity.<br>
	A Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent in Yerevan <br>
reported that Armenian industry would also be hard-hit by such <br>
steep price rises. According to the RFE/RL report, a local factory <br>
which manufactures rubber (chloroprene) already pays 14 drams per <br>
kilowatt/hour, with the energy component making up 90 percent of <br>
the production costs.<br>
	At the same time, large-scale investment, nearly $250 <br>
million, is urgently needed to reconstruct the supply system.<br>
	Some foreign credits have already been approved, such as the <br>
$57 million grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and <br>
Development to upgrade the conventional, Soviet-styled thermal <br>
power plant in Armenia.<br>
	In addition, the World Bank has extended $13.7 million in <br>
credits for the renovation of some hydroelectric power stations, <br>
as well as Russias 60 million rubles to finance last years re-<br>
starting of the controversial nuclear power plant at Medzamor. <br>
Negotiations are underway for additional funds for the further <br>
safety upgrades of Medzamor.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. NOUNE SARKISSIAN NAMED TEMPORARY CHARGE DAFFAIRS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg)-Noune Sarkissian, the wife of newly-appointed Prime <br>
Minister Armen Sarkissian, is currently acting as Armenias <br>
temporary Charge dAffairs in London.<br>
	Prior to being named to temporarily represent Armenia in <br>
Great Britain, Sarkissian was involved in the diplomatic functions <br>
of the Armenian Embassy as well as its day-to-day operation.<br>
	Noune Sarkissian holds a degree in philology, and is a <br>
graduate of the Fine Arts Department of London University.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. ANCA-WR BOARD MEMBER MEETS WITH WILSON<br>
<p>
SACRAMENTO-During a private reception in Sacramento in honor of <br>
Governor Pete Wilson, Armenian National Committee of America-<br>
Western Region Board member Ohannes Boghossian had a chance to <br>
talk with the California governor about the Armenian-American <br>
communitys plans for 1997.<br>
	Governor Wilson spent several minutes thanking the ANCA-WR <br>
for its continued support of his efforts and briefly outlined his <br>
plans for 1997. The Governor also informed Boghossian that he <br>
hoped that the ANCA-WR would assist in making his 1997 agenda for <br>
California a reality.<br>
	"Its always nice to see Governor Wilson and renew our <br>
friendship," stated Boghossian. "I am certain that the ANCA-WR and <br>
the Governors office will continue to work together next year to <br>
better serve the California Armenian community," Boghossian <br>
concluded.<br>

        MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 20, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 Yesterday, the President of the Republic of Armenia, Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosian<br>
 received Baroness Caroline Cox. She is the Head of the mission of<br>
 humanitarian assistance to Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia organized<br>
by<br>
 the International Christian Solidarity Organization. The mission includes<br>
 the foundation of an Orthopaedic Clinic and a Rehabilitation Center<br>
 in Stepanakert. Medical equipment and other forms of humanitarian<br>
 assistance are also part of the mission.<br>
        The President thanked the Baroness for the moral and material<br>
 assistance that she displays to Nagorno Karabakh. He also informed<br>
 her about the current state of the Karabagh conflict resolution<br>
 process. From her side, Caroline Cox told that she and<br>
 parliamentarians of a number of countries will continue defending the<br>
 right of the people of Nagorno Karabakh in international sphere.<br>
<p>
         BRIEFING OF THE PRIME MINISTER ARMEN SARGSIAN<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 20, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The Prime Minister of Armenia Armen Sargsian had a briefing after the<br>
 regular session of the Government. Armen Sargsian informed about the<br>
 results of his non-official visit to Great Britain. During the visit<br>
 he met the British Foreign Minister, Minister of Trade, the officials<br>
 of Administration of Science and Culture and other officials. The<br>
 second purpose of the visit was the discussions with the Directors of<br>
 European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The Prime Minister<br>
 had meetings with the President and the Deputy President of the Bank,<br>
 during which projects being implemented in Armenia were discussed.<br>
 Future projects were also touched upon. The sides had discussed such<br>
 issues as the construction of the 5-th block of Hrazdan Thermal<br>
 Electric Power Plant, the cargo terminal in the Zvartnots airport in<br>
 Yerevan, wholesale market and other problems. The speaker mentioned<br>
 that during the last two years there were some obstacles with the<br>
 European Bank concerning the Nuclear Power Plant. It was possible to<br>
 settle these issues in a diplomatic manner.<br>
 The Prime Minister announced that the construction of the 5-th block<br>
 of Hrazdan Thermal Electric Power Plant has been stopped for almost a<br>
 year. It turned out that the remaining money is not enough to finish<br>
 the work. The European Bank has hired two organizations to examine<br>
 the situation. Transition period, unexpected expenses on<br>
 transportation and the like were identified as the main causes of the<br>
 situation. As to the Prime Minister, the solution must be looked for<br>
 in macroeconomic perspective, i.e. the problem of the whole economy<br>
 and not only the problem of Hrazdan must be taken into consideration.<br>
 To finish the project there will be a need for as much funds as was<br>
 previously invested. As to the Prime Minister, the process of<br>
 privatization must be continued and speeded with the help of the<br>
 newly established Ministry of Privatization.<br>
<p>

Nezavisimaya Gazeta 20 December 1996 page 3<br>
<p>
   Interview with Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, president of the Chechen Republic<br>
of Ichkeria, by Maksim Shevchenko under the general headline:  "Terrorist<br>
Acts in Chechnya Have Not Stopped" -- in Groznyy<br>
<p>
        Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, president of the Chechen Republic of<br>
Ichkeria, received Nezavisimaya Gazeta's correspondent in his residence, and<br>
responded to his questions.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  What will be your comment on the killing of the Red Cross<br>
workers in the village of Novyye Atagi?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  This is an extremely deplorable incident.  I cannot define<br>
it otherwise than as a major political provocation.  Such provocations have<br>
increased as we are nearing elections.  Generally speaking, this is a crime<br>
atypical of the Chechen mentality.  So I am stumped [as to who did it].  And<br>
I cannot assess it otherwise than as a barbarous and senseless murder of<br>
people who had come to do good.  The Chechen people are as one in their<br>
indignation and condemnation of this atrocity.  So I declared 19 December a<br>
day of mourning.  I have just been briefed by the chief of the state<br>
security department.  He said that although it is too early to talk about<br>
any concrete trail, there are some theories.  We have started working, and<br>
soon the crime will be solved.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Are you counting on assistance in the investigation on the<br>
part of Russian special services?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  To be frank, no.  At least not on objective assistance.  I<br>
am afraid that Russian special services themselves could be involved here.<br>
This is sad, but possible.  When they were at Severnyy airport and in<br>
Khankala, these special services committed many crimes -- both with their<br>
own hands and with the hands of various criminal scum.  I am not counting on<br>
anything.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  What can you say about the capture of the North Ossetian<br>
delegation? <br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  The military commanders of the Russian group of forces,<br>
which are being pulled out of Chechnya, told Udugov that they had received a<br>
phone call from Galazov, who told them that a certain group had set out to<br>
meet with Udugov here.  The latter said that he did not know anything about<br>
that, and so made no arrangements about the meeting.  Naturally neither I<br>
nor any of the state leaders knew anything about that.  Possibly this was<br>
yet another provocation.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  What forms of statehood are upheld by Ichkeria's leadership<br>
and its people?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  The status of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria is that of a<br>
fully independent state as it has existed since 1991.  It was confirmed<br>
during the recent Russo-Chechen war and is based on the full observance of<br>
principles of international law.  This is a status established in full<br>
conformity with the contemporary laws of the ChIASSR, [Checheno-Ingush<br>
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic] the RSFSR, and the USSR through the<br>
expression of the will of the people via elections.  There are 74 documents<br>
confirming the legitimacy of the power structures of the Chechen state of<br>
Ichkeria, which four years ago were sent to the UN, but to all appearances<br>
they never reached it.  So, there is only one possible status: the<br>
independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  But the Khasavyurt agreements do not provide for full<br>
independence of Chechnya....<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  The Khasavyurt agreements neither affect nor infringe this<br>
status.  In Khasavyurt, we took the safest possible path.  At least in order<br>
not to irk those ill-wishers who do not want the war to stop.  But at the<br>
same time the agreements in no way infringe the independence of our state.<br>
This is enough to enable us to say that we have upheld our status.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  How do you plan to shape your relations with Russia after<br>
process of state building has been completed?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  Both before or after it is completed we intend to build our<br>
relations with Russia as interstate relations.  But I believe that we should<br>
above all look for ways of achieving a better mutual understanding with<br>
Russia as well as interaction in all spheres: economic, political, social,<br>
cultural, and others....  Based on principles of integration.  This on<br>
condition that the Russian leaders and the Russian state are really<br>
interested in acquiring the Chechens as reliable allies.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Oftentimes Chechen resistance is associated with the notion<br>
of "Islamic revolution."  To what extent does this conform to reality?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  I do not think that Islam in Chechnya was so weak or so<br>
suppressed that it would take a revolution to revive it.  Although, indeed,<br>
Islam is reviving.  Yet it would be more appropriate to describe this<br>
process through the notion of "gazavat" or "jihad" -- the holy Muslim war in<br>
the name of Allah and for the freedom of Muslims, that is, for the<br>
independence of all Muslims and all citizens of the Chechen state.  To be<br>
sure, many representatives of other Muslim peoples, aroused by the flame of<br>
jihad, got involved in this struggle.  So, not an Islamic revolution, but jihad.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  How in this context are your relations evolving with Islamic<br>
states -- for instance, Iran and Turkey?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  In the context of these developments our relations with them<br>
are not evolving.  This especially refers to Iran and some other states that<br>
are aspiring today to being Islamic.  Their "Islamism" is confined in<br>
itself.  After addressing the specific tasks of the initial period of the<br>
Iranian revolution, they ended up involved in infighting and internal<br>
strife, which does not allow them to act just as boldly as it was at the<br>
start, after Homeini's comeback.  In this respect the incumbent leadership<br>
of Iran and other Muslim countries, which call themselves constitutionally<br>
Islamic, has not shown much solidarity with us.  As to the people at large<br>
-- in any Muslim or even non-Muslim country, they strongly sympathize with us. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  Does your jihad have a purely territorial meaning, being<br>
confined to Chechnya, or is this holy war supposed to spread in any way?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  Our jihad is above all a jihad to defend the territory,<br>
honor, and dignity of the Chechen people.  But jihad is not simply an armed<br>
struggle.  This is a struggle against everything that contradicts the order<br>
established by God; that is to say, everything that is forbidden by God to a<br>
Muslim.  In this respect, of course, jihad has no rigid forms or borders.<br>
It is prescribed to a Muslim from the moment of his birth until the his last<br>
breath.  This world was made by God for man so that he goes through jihad --<br>
in the true sense of the word that is described in the Koran.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  In his time Gen. Dudayev observed:  "Today we are liberating<br>
Chechnya; tomorrow, Russia; and the day after tomorrow, Europe."<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  I do not recall Dzhokhar Dudayev saying this in this<br>
particular form.  But he did say that "by liberating Chechnya today, we are<br>
liberating Russia."  He took a very philosophic approach toward the problem<br>
of liberating the individual, the people, and mankind, on the assumption<br>
that today mankind is enslaved by those forms of international communities<br>
and organizations at various levels that dictate to whole nations how to act<br>
-- even [preaching] submission to evil instead of helping them to get rid of<br>
that evil; instead of helping them to free themselves from injustice.  It<br>
was in this sense that he viewed the situation in Russia.  He said, with<br>
profound conviction and frankness, that the Russian people was suffering the<br>
most from the regime reigning in Russia -- as a result of the unconscious<br>
despotism that even today is dictated by Russian state practices, the<br>
interrelations between nations imposed by the state, as well as the<br>
interrelations between the ruling authority and the individual, and between<br>
the citizens of different social standing.  It was in this context that he<br>
spoke about the need to liberate Russia.  He believed that the Chechen<br>
people and the Chechen state would serve as a tool for liberating the<br>
Russians.  I share this point of view. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  Could you say precisely by which forces Russia is enslaved<br>
today?  <br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  Forces that have put first material interests -- profit and<br>
lust for profit, by any means and methods, regardless of the price.  This is<br>
the main force that has enslaved and suppressed the peoples [narody] of<br>
Russia.  This force today is concentrated in the Russian state power<br>
structures.  Many economic processes were affected by this force.  The<br>
Chechen Republic became a target of this man-hating aggression in part<br>
because we excluded our country from this pseudo-economic bacchanalia which<br>
spread across the empire, especially after the breakup of the USSR.  <br>
 [Shevchenko]  But then it is with these forces that you are concluding a<br>
treaty....<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  We are concluding a treaty with the actual forces that today<br>
act in the name of the Russian state and the people.  But we are concluding<br>
the treaty not to fall under the impact of these forces.  Especially given<br>
that we are concluding the treaty in light of the fact that the war has<br>
changed much in the Russian leadership itself.  New people came in, people<br>
who have the experience of a two-year war with Ichkeria.  This experience<br>
dictates quite a different behavior pattern to them.  The incumbent Russian<br>
leadership declares -- and partially demonstrates through its behavior --<br>
the wish to act in other ways.<br>
 [Shevchenko]  Moving over to more down to earth matters, here is this<br>
question:  What is preventing the return of the bodies of the Russian<br>
servicemen killed in action?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  This sounds strange to me.  There are no obstacles<br>
preventing the return of the bodies of a clergyman and other Russians who<br>
were killed here. <br>
 [Shevchenko]  Is the oil pipeline a key problem to formalizing Ichkeria's<br>
independence?<br>
 [Yandarbiyev]  The oil transit route today is an international and<br>
political problem.  We predicate many questions on how it is resolved.  <br>

HEADLINE:  A People of Hope, a Land of Challenge // Armenia<br>
SOURCE:  The Orange County Register,November 17, 1996 (John Hughes)<br>
<p>
At the end of an unmarked alley, past gardens burdened by fruit of a rich<br>
soil that has not failed Armenia when much else has, the family of Samuel<br>
Kocharian is evidence that the world's sweetest people live where the<br>
pavement turns to dirt.<br>
<p>
My photographer companion and I were looking for a vantage point from which<br>
to photograph Mount Ararat. Without the benefit of a common language, a man<br>
whose smile makes neither English nor Armenian necessary leads us past an<br>
area with a tattered fence in which an impossibly large hog is a willing<br>
captive, past a slant-roof coop in which a dozen chickens fight for grape<br>
leaves, to his modest home on the edge of a ravine. <br>
<p>
Gesturing unmistakably, Kocharian invites us to climb a discomforting ladder<br>
onto the tin roof over his kitchen. From there another ladder takes us<br>
higher, to the top of his home, level, it feels, with the snow-covered peak<br>
of the distant mountain where Noah found landfall after the Deluge.  <br>
<p>
Noah _ the agent of a vengeful, if loving, God _ could do no more for the<br>
cause of spiritual belief than this simple man who has led us to his roof for<br>
a look at that mountain.  <br>
<p>
My partner walks uneasily across rafters from which tin has un-nailed itself<br>
and aims his lens across the backside of Yerevan, Armenia's capital, toward<br>
Turkey, where Mount Ararat is a reminder of land that, too, was once<br>
Armenian. <br>
<p>
They have a joke here: At least Armenia, they say, gets to see the pretty<br>
side of the mountain.  <br>
<p>
It is a country of challenge, Armenia. A country of great reward for the<br>
ambitious traveler. And it is a country of people who have learned to adjust.<br>
<p>
<p>
Communism brought an assured degree of relative prosperity but with it,<br>
oppression. Oppression was lifted in 1988, but so was the safety net that the<br>
socialist government offered. Also that year an earthquake took more than<br>
25,000 lives and in the six years that followed, a war with neighboring<br>
Azerbaijan for rights to Nagorno-Karabakh killed thousands more.  <br>
<p>
At the Kocharian home, Samuel, a taxi driver, no longer has a shift and<br>
recently had surgery and lost weight, making his oversize clothes hang from<br>
him. A wife, two daughters, a son and Samuel get by, though, supported partly<br>
by one daughter's work at a bakery and by the unpredictable means that seem<br>
to be the good fortune of this country where at least 70 percent are<br>
unemployed.  <br>
<p>
For some, the means come from Armenians of the diaspora who have immigrated<br>
to America and send millions a month to families and friends whom they've<br>
left but mercifully not forgotten.    <br>
<p>
At the clean home of the Kocharians, economic insufficiency is hardly noticed<br>
because wealth of the soul is so abundant. <br>
<p>
We come down from that roof to where Nellie, Samuel's wife, and Lusine, a<br>
daughter, meet us with freshly ground Armenian coffee, pastries, watermelon<br>
and English walnuts.  <br>
<p>
His other daughter, Aramine, begins making a cake with fresh eggs gathered<br>
from Samuel's chickens.  <br>
<p>
Coffee behind us, we are taken down the way to Nellie's father's house where<br>
more relatives join us for a noon meal that includes spiced bologna, two<br>
types of cheese, fresh mahatnakash bread, eggplant, tomatoes, two varieties<br>
of grilled pork kebabs, pickled peppers, juice, vodka, sweet wine and an<br>
Armenian brandy favored by Winston Churchill. <br>
<p>
An interpreter is located and Samuel's first words to me are an apology.  <br>
<p>
"We do not have much," he says through Efram, the soldier and translator,<br>
"but what we have we gladly share with you, our new friends. If we had known<br>
you were coming we could have prepared better." <br>
<p>
I start to reply but to my huge surprise and Western-influenced<br>
embarrassment, tears stop my words as I try to tell Samuel how much his<br>
graciousness has touched me. <br>
<p>
The gentle man cradles my head in his rough hands, kisses my forehead and<br>
tells me it is good when people are open to unexpected feelings. <br>
<p>
Kocharian's words are with me three days later as I light a candle in his<br>
honor inside Geghart, a monastery that dates to the fourth century, when<br>
Armenian monks carved cells and a cathedral into the side of a mountain just<br>
outside Yerevan.  <br>
<p>
Geghart was both a place of worship and a fortress for Christian monks whose<br>
beliefs were a death sentence at the hands of Turkish Muslims.  <br>
<p>
Dark as any cave, Geghart is a web of catacombs linked to two main cathedrals<br>
that are magnificent studies in ancient worship and architecture. <br>
<p>
Much of Armenia _ the first country to adopt Christianity as a national<br>
religion (in A.D. 301) _ has links to biblical times. Geghart, Armenian for<br>
"spear," is where a spear believed to be the one used by a Roman soldier to<br>
pierce Christ's side at the Crucifixion was kept until the ninth century,<br>
when it was transferred to Echmiadzin for safekeeping.  <br>
<p>
Echmiadzin, about 12 miles from Yerevan, is to the Armenian Apostolic Church<br>
as the Vatican is to Roman Catholicism.    <br>
<p>
Built on the site of a pagan temple (as was the custom for many early<br>
religious centers in Armenia), Echmiadzin's legend is that Jesus Christ<br>
descended from heaven to designate the site of the church _ built in A.D.<br>
301-303  _ where Gregory the Illuminator became the first Armenian<br>
catholicos, or church leader. Echmiadzin's seminary is a testament to more<br>
modern times in the life of Armenia's foremost religion. <br>
<p>
Here, Father Paren Avedikian and other priests teach 110 theology students,<br>
where once, during Soviet times, there were fewer than 30. And, until 1988,<br>
Echmiadzin was the only seminary in the country. Now, there are three.  <br>
<p>
"I do not think there are proper words to describe the repression by the<br>
Soviets," says Avedikian.  <br>
<p>
But to focus only on its history of struggle and suffering _ significant as<br>
it is _ is to miss the very satisfying benefits of a nation that has<br>
triumphed when others might have surrendered.  <br>
<p>
A transplanted Texan who has lived in Armenia four years, Rick Ney, sees his<br>
adopted country's past as an enhancement to its considerable cultural wealth,<br>
and as a sign of hope for glory days ahead. <br>
<p>
"In the end," Ney says, "these people push themselves up. They always push<br>
themselves up."  <br>
<p>
During Soviet times, Armenia drew more than 1 million tourists a year. Most<br>
came to Yerevan for its art, for its history and to enjoy the company of a<br>
warm and hospitable people.  <br>
<p>
Ney, who works with a program that helps schools create their own incomes,<br>
sees Armenia as a fertile bud waiting to blossom _ a country of great<br>
scholars and scientists looking for ways to use skills and knowledge left<br>
dormant with the collapse of communism.  <br>
<p>
The American has written a travel guide and, as he waits for a publisher, on<br>
Nov. 7 his first installment of "Armenia: A Practical Guide for the<br>
Adventurous Soul" appeared on the Internet at www.arminco.com, with others to<br>
follow. <br>
<p>
Still, however, the country with new Internet access has a phone system that<br>
is unreliable _ it is easier to make an international call than a local one.<br>
 <br>
<p>
And, although one of Armenia's first acts of independence was to create a<br>
national stamp, there is no effective postal service. (Osheen Keshishian,<br>
editor of the Armenian Observer in Los Angeles, once mailed himself a letter<br>
from Yerevan, which took two months to arrive in the United States.) <br>
<p>
Paper products are still something of a luxury, and, in a country known for<br>
some of the world's harshest winters, the citizens of Yerevan are expecting<br>
as few as 14 hours a day of electricity. Gasoline is sold from jugs at<br>
roadside stops, but, these people will unflinchingly say, "at least we now<br>
have gasoline."  <br>
<p>
Relics of communism remain: Socialized medicine is the norm, although<br>
privatization looms amid concerns of how the 70 percent of the citizens who<br>
are unemployed could afford to pay for their own health care.  <br>
<p>
And, a sure sign that democracy comes slowly is seen in routine and frequent<br>
traffic stops by police, who extort money from drivers.  <br>
<p>
Still, there are compelling reasons to visit Armenia, including Vernisage, a<br>
weekend market in the middle of the city that is the gathering place for the<br>
nouveau capitalists of the young republic, who sell goods ranging from Soviet<br>
flasks with hammer-and-sickle insignias to nesting dolls in the image of<br>
President Clinton.  <br>
<p>
It is here on a Sunday that I am approached by an excited artist whose<br>
stumbling English adds to the bizarre charm of the moment when he says to me:<br>
"Please. I must paint you. I am artist, understand? Do you know you look like<br>
the king of Sweden? You must come, please. I will take only moments."  <br>
<p>
Curious, I follow the man to an easel he keeps on the edge of a dry fountain.<br>
   <br>
<p>
Expecting, in the way we are taught (to our fault at times), that I am being<br>
set up for a scam, my American suspicions are shamefully displaced. The<br>
gracious artist wants nothing but a chance to draw a portrait of features he<br>
rarely sees: that is, those of a blond, blue-eyed drifter. <br>
<p>
"You look like Jesus," the artist says.  <br>
<p>
The Christ of history, of course, most likely resembled the artist himself<br>
more than this American of Irish descent. But why argue?  <br>
<p>
So, I sit while he works in a fury, surrounded by onlookers.   <br>
<p>
He finishes, apologizes that his pen is low on ink, and says that with my<br>
permission he will use the drawing as a reference for a later painting. <br>
<p>
<p>
So, if you are in Yerevan and see a painting of Jesus, the king of Sweden ...<br>
 <br>
<p>
At Vernisage, artists once commissioned to do the state's work now sell their<br>
self-expressions for the price of art supplies alongside housewives who sell<br>
crocheted tablecloths and have learned this much English: "Special price for<br>
you!"  <br>
<p>
Musicians play instruments that are also for sale. Pieces of jewelry that<br>
could have been family heirlooms are shopped at bargain prices, marking an<br>
unfortunate crossroad where struggle and capitalism meet. <br>
<p>
And, on nearly every street in Yerevan, sidewalks are crowded with vendors<br>
selling cigarettes (approximately 10 out of every 10 men smoke), penny<br>
candies, magnificent loaves of bread, mineral water and delicacies such as<br>
sujuk, a sweet candy made of walnuts, fruit and syrup wrapped in grape<br>
leaves. <br>
<p>
Nearby, Republic Square is the grandest of Yerevan's attractions _ a great<br>
boulevard highlghted by fountains and a reflecting pool with "dancing" water<br>
that throws itself into the night, in a rhythmic spray to classical music. <br>
<p>
Oddly vacant and occupying nearly a full block is a platform where a<br>
prominent statue once stood. Some years ago that likeness of Lenin was<br>
toppled, replaced by nothing _ signifying, it would seem, that these newly<br>
freed Armenians would rather see empty space than a reminder of communist<br>
authority. <br>
<p>
It is hard for a first-time visitor to comprehend a people of such passion<br>
being suppressed, especially by influences that would stifle their resilient<br>
spirit. <br>
<p>
Hope is a great sustenance. That is Samuel Kocharian's message, delivered as<br>
I  stop by his home for one last moment before leaving Yerevan. <br>
<p>
I have gone to the market and purchased the most expensive and largest bottle<br>
of Armenian brandy I can find (for about $15) and am standing at Kocharian's<br>
door with a translator. <br>
<p>
"Enjoy this with your family," I have the translator tell him. "And when you<br>
drink, lift a glass toward America and think of someone whose life you've<br>
made richer."  <br>
<p>
"No," he replies. "We will not open it until you return."  <br>
<p>
SIDEBAR - Survival brings hope<br>
<p>
Armenia, a country of about 3 million, is a little smaller than Maryland, and<br>
is landlocked, bordered by Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia. <br>
<p>
During Soviet rule (which ended in 1988), scientists in Armenia were<br>
responsible for much of the engineering and development in computer<br>
technology for the entire Soviet Union. Today, those scientists and other<br>
professionals whose livelihoods were dependent on the Soviet Union are among<br>
the millions trying to adjust to life in a new republic. <br>
<p>
Armenia's conversion to democracy has not been easy. Although its people have<br>
embraced their independence emphatically, forces beyond their control have<br>
made life a remarkable struggle.  <br>
<p>
In 1992, an earthquake that killed more than 25,000 and crippled thousands<br>
more came when the country already was suffering the effects of a fierce war<br>
with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of 250,000 that is about 90<br>
percent Armenian within Azerbaijan. <br>
<p>
Because of the war with Azerbaijan and bad relations with Turkey that have<br>
existed since the early 1900s, when Turkish Muslims killed 1.5 million<br>
Armenians in a religious genocide, Armenia's geography has contributed to its<br>
struggle. <br>
<p>
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia lost its source of crucial<br>
supplies such as petroleum. Blockades by surrounding countries forced Armenia<br>
into the impractical position of having to fly gasoline into the country,<br>
which created heating shortages during some of the country's worst winters.  <br>
<p>
In 1991-92 the national income of Armenia fell 60 percent, and it dipped an<br>
additional 15 percent in 1993.  <br>
<p>
Today, at least 70 percent of Armenia is unemployed, surviving economically<br>
only with outside help, largely from the United States. America's per capita<br>
aid to Armenia is second only to the amount it sends to Israel. <br>
<p>
Still, there are signs of hope for Armenia's recovery and its eventual<br>
self-reliance. Relations with Turkey are improving, and trade between the<br>
countries is expected soon. And, because internal strife in Georgia has<br>
abated, Armenia now has access to two crucial Black Sea ports that previously<br>
were not at its service.    <br>
<p>
Forty American companies now do business in Armenia, and, slowly,<br>
privatization of businesses is contributing to hopes for a stable economic<br>
infrastructure. <br>
<p>
The effects of struggle are subtle in Yerevan, the country's capital, where<br>
life moves with European flavor on streets crowded with smartly dressed men<br>
and women offering little hint of such fresh suffering. <br>
<p>
During a recent speech at the University of California, Irvine, the consul<br>
general of Armenia, Armen Baibourtian,  acknowledged what any casual student<br>
of Armenian history knows: "The faith of Armenians," he said, "has been<br>
stretched beyond the limitations of imagination." <br>
<p>
But he added, "We believe (living conditions) will improve in one to two<br>
years. This is only the beginning."  <br>
<p>
IS THIS FOR YOU?<br>
<p>
YES if you want to meet the indomitably spirited people of an<br>
ancient land.<br>
<p>
NO if you want room service.<br>
<p>
GETTING THERE: Armenian Airlines has weekly flight connections from Paris,<br>
Amsterdam and Athens to Yerevan. Aeroflot has daily connections between<br>
Moscow and Yerevan. <br>
<p>
DON'T FORGET: All foreign visitors must have a visa, which can be requested<br>
through the Armenian Embassy, (202) 319-1976, or the Consulate General, (310)<br>
657-6102. <br>
<p>
HANG YOUR HAT: Hotel Armenia, 011-3742-52-53-93; Hotel Ani,<br>
011-3742-52-07-75; Hotel Divin, 011-3742-53-63-43. <br>
<p>
THE BOTTOM LINE: The current exchange rate is approximately 405 Armenian<br>
drams to the dollar. Small bills are recommended for easy exchange. Credit<br>
cards and traveler's checks generally are not accepted. <br>
<p>
TIPS: Paper products, including toilet paper and paper towels, are not easy<br>
to obtain in Armenia. While the natives are proud of their drinking water,<br>
foreigners could find it troublesome. Bottled mineral water is available. <br>
<p>
TIPS II: As Armenia has no effective postal service, good relations with the<br>
locals can be established by offering to bring back mail to the United<br>
States. With one-third as many Armenians in this country as in Armenia, many<br>
natives have connections here.<br>

Subject: Russian spacecraft returns to Earth over S.Pacific<br>
Date: Mon, 18 Nov 1996 0:10:27 PST<br>
<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Russia's crippled Mars probe, carrying  <br>
four canisters of radioactive plutonium, fell to Earth Sunday <br>
over the South Pacific west of Chile, U.S. and Australian <br>
officials said. <br>
	 U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had  <br>
been monitoring the stricken spacecraft's orbit, said it <br>
re-entered Earth's atmosphere above ``a broad ocean area <br>
somewhere west of Chile'' at about 8:30 p.m. EST. <br>
	 Australian officials said the probe landed between Easter  <br>
Island and the Chilean coast and located the impact site at 31 <br>
degrees South, 96.3 degrees West. <br>
	 The Chilean Navy had received no official word of the crash,  <br>
but recovery of any debris from the spacecraft would be <br>
difficult if not impossible, a Chilean naval officer said. <br>
	 ``This area has one of the deepest ocean floors in the  <br>
world. Any kind of recovery, if it were possible, would be very, <br>
very tough,'' the officer told Reuters. <br>
	 The area where the spacecraft fell is up to 6,000 yards  <br>
deep, according to maps of the area. <br>
	 U.S. Space command spokesman Dave Knox said his agency  <br>
tracked objects in space, not in the atmosphere, therefore it <br>
was impossible to know whether the six-ton craft exploded upon <br>
re-entry and where exactly the debris landed. <br>
	 ``We have confirmed that the spacecraft has re-entered.  <br>
There's no way for us to tell if something survived re-entry,'' <br>
Knox told Reuters. <br>
	 If the probe survived re-entry, it may have crashed into the  <br>
Southern Pacific several hundred miles from the calculated <br>
re-entry location, the command's Space Control Center said. <br>
	 Most of the craft likely burned up upon entering the Earth's  <br>
atmosphere, although NASA officials said two landing vehicles <br>
weighing 110 pounds each were built to survive a landing on Mars <br>
and likely crashed into the ocean as debris. <br>
	 The vehicles each carried two tiny plutonium batteries about  <br>
the size of 35mm film canisters containing a total of 200 grams <br>
(seven ounces) of the radioactive material, but Russian <br>
officials said they were designed to survive the intense heat of <br>
re-entry and the impact of a crash. <br>
	 U.S. officials said they were confident the batteries had  <br>
survived intact and were now at the bottom of the ocean. <br>
	 ``Our operating assumption is that the plutonium ...  <br>
withstood re-entry and fell into the water fully encapsulated,'' <br>
said Department of Energy spokeswoman Carmen MacDougall. ``In <br>
the unlikely event that a release (of radioactivity) occurred, <br>
the weather is currently blowing away from Chile.'' <br>
	 The spacecraft lifted off from Kazakhstan's Baikonur space  <br>
center on Saturday, but failed to break out of the Earth's orbit <br>
after a booster rocket misfired. <br>
	 Initially the probe looked likely to hit Earth over  <br>
Australia, causing Australian defense officials to jump into <br>
frenzied preparations for a possible emergency. <br>
	 Two 6.5-foot penetrators designed to ram into the surface of  <br>
Mars and weighing 143 pounds each, were also expected to survive <br>
re-entry. <br>
	 The Russian probe had been due to reach Mars on Sept. 12  <br>
next year. The failed mission was the second of three planned <br>
trips from Earth to Mars in just over a month. <br>
	 The United States launched a robot voyage to Mars two weeks  <br>
ago and a second mission will blast off on Dec. 2. All were <br>
tasked to check for signs of water on the distant planet -- a <br>
key clue to whether there was once life on Mars. <br>
	 National Security Council official Robert Bell told  <br>
reporters a misfiring of a fourth stage of the probe's booster <br>
rocket had doomed the Russian Mars probe. <br>
	 Before it landed, Bell, a special assistant to President  <br>
 Clinton and a senior director of the NSC for defense policy,  <br>
outlined what would happen if the plutonium batteries did not <br>
survive. <br>
	 One possibility was that the canisters would break up. If  <br>
this happened at high altitude, Bell said a small radioactive <br>
cloud that would result would dissipate harmlessly. <br>
	 Plutonium 238 causes lung or bone cancer if inhaled.  <br>
	 Bell said dispersal at a lower altitude or breakage upon  <br>
impact could have been lethal to humans. <br>
	 The Russian space mishap was the fourth in recent years. A  <br>
U.S. space vehicle, Skylab, plunged to Earth over Western <br>
Australia in 1979 without causing damage and a Russian Cosmos <br>
satellite fell in an unhabited region of Canada in 1987. <br>
	 In 1991 the Soviet space station Salyut 7 re-entered the  <br>
Earth's atmosphere and the debris was believed to have landed in <br>
the Atlantic Oceon, though some pieces were reportedly found in <br>
Argentina. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	LONDON, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Ten oil companies and the governments of  <br>
Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman have settled their remaining differences <br>
over construction of an export pipeline for at least $18 billion worth <br>
of western oil ventures in Kazakhstan, a London business daily reported <br>
Monday. <br>
	The Financial Times quoted Ed Smith, general director of the Caspian  <br>
Pipeline Consortium, as saying all issues had been settled in principal <br>
at a meeting of the parties in Moscow last week. <br>
	They were now wording the shareholder agreement and hoped to sign it  <br>
in early December, enabling the 10 companies the following month to buy <br>
50 percent of the consortium from its current members, the governments <br>
of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman, the daily said. <br>
	The $1.5 billion pipeline, due on line in 1999, would pump 28 million  <br>
tons a year from the west of the country to the Russian Black Sea port <br>
of Norosossiysk. Later expansion to 68 million tons would be financed <br>
partly from early revenues. <br>
	Chevron and Mobil, among others, have held back production in  <br>
Kazakhstan because Russia, claiming capacity limitations, would not <br>
grant sufficient access to its export pipelines. <br>
	Kazakh officials accused Russia of using its stanglehold on the  <br>
project to press for political concessions, the Financial Times said. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 YEREVAN, Armenia (Reuter) - Armenia's Constitutional Court  <br>
Friday rejected an opposition plea for the results of a <br>
presidential election in September to be annulled. <br>
	 The decision was likely to fuel tensions in the Armenian  <br>
capital Yerevan, where opposition supporters have staged big <br>
demonstrations against the vote. <br>
	 The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) declared that  <br>
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan had won a second five-year term in <br>
the Sept. 22 poll, but his election challenger, former prime <br>
minister Vazgen Manukyan, accused the president of vote-rigging. <br>
	 Ter-Petrosyan, a Soviet-era dissident and former close ally  <br>
of Manukyan in the independence cause, denied the charge. <br>
	 Foreign observers noted major irregularities in the election  <br>
by Ter-Petrosyan forces, and the Organization for Security and <br>
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said they could have been serious <br>
enough to call his victory into question. <br>
	 The CEC says Ter-Petrosyan, officially sworn in on Nov. 11,  <br>
won with 51.8 percent of the votes, just clearing the 50-percent <br>
hurdle needed to win without a run-off. It said Manukyan won <br>
41.3 percent. <br>
	 The leader of the opposition Party of National  <br>
Self-Determination condemned the court's ruling and said he <br>
would appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. <br>
	 ``Today it was proven that we do not have a constitutional  <br>
court and that the authorities in Armenia are lacking in all <br>
reason,'' Paruyr Airikyan told reporters. <br>
	 In the immediate aftermath of the election, Ter-Petrosyan  <br>
sent tanks into the streets, rounded up dozens of opponents, and <br>
closed several political parties after demonstrations by <br>
Manukyan's backers turned violent. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	MOSCOW, Nov. 24 (UPI) -- Presidential elections were held Sunday in  <br>
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan, despite opposition <br>
from Baku, which does not recognize the enclave's independence. <br>
	The election sparked protests in cities and towns throughout  <br>
Azerbaijan, some of which included thousands of demonstrators, Russian <br>
news agencies reported. <br>
	State-run Azerbaijani television also commented that the presence of  <br>
Russian electoral observers at voting sites represented a lack of <br>
respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation. <br>
	The mostly Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh chose between  <br>
three candidates -- incumbent President Robert Kocharyan, former Deputy <br>
Parliament Speaker Boris Arushayan and Communist leader Grant Melkumyan <br>
-- all of whom support independence for the enclave and the continuation <br>
of economic reform. <br>
	Nearly 50 percent of an eligible electorate of 130,000 had voted by  <br>
Sunday afternoon, well in excess of the 25 percent turnout needed to <br>
validate the election, the Nagorno-Karabakh electoral commission <br>
reported. <br>
	If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote a runoff will be held  <br>
between the two top finishers in two weeks. The election is to a five- <br>
year term. <br>
	``The main goal of the so-called election is to pressure Azerbaijan.  <br>
It is not to legitimize the self-declared separatist regime,'' <br>
Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade told the Russian Interfax <br>
news agency. <br>
	``Those who are seeking to regain their foothold in the region''  <br>
believe it benefits their cause to increase tensions in the region, <br>
Gulizade said, accusing neighboring Armenia of organizing the vote. <br>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe together with  <br>
a number of foreign countries expressed concern for the effect the vote <br>
might have on regional stability, the Russian Itar-Tass news agency <br>
reported. <br>
	Russia and Turkey have also objected to the election on the grounds  <br>
that it is being held before talks on the region's political status are <br>
completed. <br>
	A bloody conflict over the disputed enclave broke out in 1992 between  <br>
mostly Muslim Azerbaijan and mostly Christian Armenia. The fighting cost <br>
25,000 lives and created more than 1 million refugees. <br>
	After two years of war a 1994 cease-fire agreement brought peace to  <br>
the enclave, but attempts at a political settlement between the former <br>
Soviet republics have been unsuccessful. <br>
	As talks have dragged on, the self-declared independent republic has  <br>
sought to turn its military victory against Azerbaijan into a permanent <br>
union with Armenia. <br>
	Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan remain tense despite two  <br>
years of relative calm. <br>
	In September, Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliev threatened, ``If our  <br>
lands are not freed, we will have to free them ourselves.'' <br>
	The Karabakh Armenians have said they will not give up territory  <br>
without international guarantees of peace. <br>
	Western nations have been particularly concerned to see fighting does  <br>
not re-ignite in the region as a pipeline slated to carry oil from the <br>
Caspian Sea to the Black Sea port of Batumi runs through the enclave. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	YEREVAN, Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Incumbent Robert Kocharyan has easily won a  <br>
second term as president of the self-proclaimed republic of Nagorno- <br>
Karabakh, election officials in the ethnic Armenian enclave said Monday. <br>
	Kocharyan, 42, polled 86.1 percent of the vote held Sunday despite  <br>
fierce oppsosition from Azerbaijan, which does not recognize the <br>
sovereignty of the region. He will be inaugurated to a five-year term. <br>
	Karabakh parliament member Boris Arushunyan was a distant second with  <br>
under 7 percent of the vote in the region of 190,000 people, and <br>
regional Communist Party leader Grant Melkumyan got 3.7 percent. <br>
	The vote was a slap in the face to Azerbaijan, which fought a drawn-  <br>
out war with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict ended in 1994, <br>
when the sides signed a cease-fire that cemented Armenian gains in the <br>
fighting. <br>
	The election sparked protests Sunday throughout Azerbaijan, and  <br>
state-run television said the presence of Russian observers at polling <br>
places showed a lack of respect for the territorial integrity of <br>
Azerbaijan. <br>
	A former Communist Party official and advocate of uniting Nagorno-  <br>
Karabakh with Armenia, Kocharyan was elected president of Nagorno- <br>
Karabakh by the regional parliament in a December, 1994 vote that also <br>
defied Azerbaijan. <br>
	No foreign country recognizes the sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh,  <br>
but it is run as an independent nation and gets strong support from <br>
Armenia, which seized the strip of land between Armenia and Nagorno- <br>
Karabakh in the war. <br>
	Since the 1994 cease-fire, international efforts to broker a lasting  <br>
political settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute have met with <br>
little success. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 MOSCOW, Nov 25 (Reuter) - From Russia's volatile Chechen  <br>
republic to Georgia's separatist Abkhazia region, Caspian Sea <br>
oil faces an increasingly tough obstacle course of geopolitical <br>
hurdles as it seeks safe routes to Western markets. <br>
	 A multinational consortium that will soon begin tapping oil  <br>
in the sea's Azeri sector will use a dual-route option -- one <br>
through Chechnya, one through Georgia -- for its early oil to <br>
avoid being sidelined by explosive regional politics. <br>
	 But both routes are a cauldron of ethnic tensions that have  <br>
put the regions on a collision course with Moscow and threatened <br>
the export of all future Caspian oil to world markets. <br>
	 ``All of the routes are equally difficult,'' said Peter  <br>
Houlder, managing director of the CentreInvest consultancy in <br>
Moscow. ``Georgia is not particularly any better than Chechnya.'' <br>
	 A weekend peace deal between Chechnya and Moscow could  <br>
ensure there are no delays in the transport of up to 100,000 <br>
barrels per day of early oil from the $8 billion Azerbaijan <br>
International Operating Company (AIOC) project in the Caspian <br>
from August 1997. <br>
	 The peace agreement included a promise by the Chechen rebel  <br>
government to safeguard local refineries and pipelines, and Ivan <br>
Rybkin, secretary of Russia's Security Council, told a news <br>
conference on Monday that Chechnya would conclude a final <br>
agreement on oil issues by December 1. <br>
	 Wary of long-term instability, the 13-member AIOC will use  <br>
two routes for its early output -- one through the wartorn <br>
Chechen capital Grozny to Russia's Black Sea port of <br>
Novorossiisk, and a second to Georgia's Black Sea Batumi outlet. <br>
	 The consortium, led by an alliance of British Petroleum Co  <br>
Plc&lt;BP.L&gt; and Norway's Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS (Statoil) <br>
1/8STAT.CN3/8, has sought to give the Chechen route priority in <br>
order to appease Moscow, which wants to earn oil transit fees. <br>
	 But in the long-term the group plans to build a new pipeline  <br>
to the Turkish Mediterranean coast, probably via Georgia, for <br>
its main output up of to 800,000 barrels per day. <br>
	 While the Chechen peace deal could make the transport of  <br>
early oil safer, weekend separatist events in Abkhazia could <br>
complicate the Georgian option both in the short- and long-term. <br>
	 Abkhazia, which has run itself as an independent state since  <br>
1993 when it routed government troops after a year-long war, <br>
held a weekend parliamentary poll, which Georgia and Russia <br>
condemned as a further blockage to the peace process. <br>
	 In yet a third sign of regional instability, the mostly  <br>
ethnic Armenian population of Azerbaijan's embattled enclave of <br>
Nagorno-Karabakh held its own weekend presidential election, two <br>
years after the end of a six-year war with Azerbaijan. <br>
	 The events could leave 13-member AIOC with tough choices.  <br>
	 The Abkhazian poll could make the Georgian oil transport  <br>
route, which runs just south of the breakaway region, an <br>
increasingly unstable option. Georgia and Russia have imposed an <br>
economic blockade of Abkhazia. <br>
	 ``No one is going to risk sending oil along any single  <br>
route,'' Houlder said. <br>
	 But the Chechen route is uncertain too.  <br>
	 ``It is still not clear how the Chechen side will receive its  <br>
share from the transport of oil across its territory,'' said <br>
Ravil Polyanin, spokesman for Transneft, which owns and operates <br>
Russia's entire pipeline network. <br>
	 ``We have not had contact with them on the Caspian pipeline  <br>
issue -- that is a question for the future. And you can't <br>
exclude the possibility that they'll be tough negotiators.'' <br>
	 He said Chechen rebels had not harmed the oil pipeline  <br>
crossing their territory during the 21-month conflict with <br>
Moscow because they did not want to cut themselves off from a <br>
major source of income. <br>
	 ``The Chechens haven't blown it up yet, and there's no reason  <br>
they should in the future,'' Houlder said. <br>

  	  				 <br>
	 ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) - Main opposition leader Mesut  <br>
Yilmaz Wednesday accused the Islamist-led government of <br>
attempting to cover up a scandal over Turkey's alleged use of <br>
far-right gangsters to carry out political dirty work. <br>
	 ``It's no coincidence that their attempts to control the  <br>
judiciary and silence the press come at a time when political <br>
dirt has reached such an extreme dimension,'' Yilmaz said. <br>
	 The ruling coalition is preparing a bill that is expected to  <br>
restrict criticism of the government and bureaucrats by Turkey's <br>
media on the trail of an unpleasant scent in the corridors of <br>
power. <br>
	 ``Those who want to silence the press are trying to cover  <br>
their own dirty business, they are afraid of the truth coming <br>
out,'' Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Yilmaz told reporters. <br>
	 A series of media revelations uncovered a close relationship  <br>
between late mobster Abdullah Catli and government member of <br>
parliament Sedat Bucak, who heads an anti-guerrilla Kurdish <br>
militia. <br>
	 Catli, once a leading light in the extreme nationalist  <br>
``Grey Wolf'' movement, is alleged to have helped the pope's <br>
would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca escape imprisonment in Turkey <br>
before the 1981 attack on the pontiff. <br>
	 The media has also said that Turkey may have ordered Catli  <br>
or other rightist mobsters to carry out death squad killings of <br>
suspected Kurdish rebel sympathizers and an Armenian guerrilla. <br>
	 Far from trying to hide the scandal, Deputy Prime Minister  <br>
Tansu Ciller Tuesday defended the gangster. <br>
	 ``I do not know whether he is guilty or not ... but those  <br>
who fire bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this <br>
country, this nation and this state will always be respectfully <br>
remembered by us,'' she said in a reference to Catli. <br>
	 ``I don't know Abdullah Catli, but I have investigated. He  <br>
has no confirmed conviction in Turkey,'' Ciller, also the <br>
foreign minister, told a meeting of her conservative True Path <br>
Party. <br>
	 Convicted drug smuggler Catli and a senior policeman died in  <br>
the same car in a crash Nov. 3. MP Bucak, from Ciller's True <br>
Path Party, was also in the vehicle. <br>
	 State officials are alleged to have encouraged criminal  <br>
gangs to take over the lucrative heroin trade from Kurdish drug <br>
barons sympathetic to Kurdistan Workers Party rebels. <br>
	 ``Our people's money is being used as a vehicle for dirty  <br>
dealings. Dirty money is the foundation of the mafia and these <br>
gangs,'' Yilmaz said. <br>
	 Former prime minister Yilmaz was punched in a hotel lobby  <br>
last weekend during a visit to Budapest. His aides have blamed <br>
Grey Wolves resident in Hungary for the attack. <br>
	 President Suleyman Demirel has only half-heartedly called  <br>
for the scandal to be probed and commentators see the government <br>
as unwilling to cooperate. <br>
	 ``It is obvious that the True Path wing of the government  <br>
will pull out all the stops to cover up the scandal,'' political <br>
analyst Bilal Cetin told Reuters. <br>
	 ``Welfare may try to cover up for the sake of continuing the  <br>
coalition. They may try to drag it out forever,'' he said. <br>
	 The interior minister, who stayed at the same hotel as the  <br>
gangster on the weekend of Catli's death, resigned earlier this <br>
month. <br>

	 MOSCOW, Nov 27 (Reuter) - Azerbaijan is proving more  <br>
successful in attracting foreign oil investment dollars than big <br>
brother Russia, but the Caspian state must still deal with <br>
Moscow if it wants to become a major world energy player. <br>
	 In the latest deal underscoring the shift, Azeri oil  <br>
officials said Amoco Corp &lt;AN.N&gt;, Unocal Corp &lt;UCL.N&gt;, Japan's <br>
Itochu Corp &lt;8001.T&gt; and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir would <br>
initial a $1.5 billion agreement with Azeri officials on <br>
December 14 to tap unexplored reserves in the Azeri sector of <br>
the Caspian. <br>
	 The deal is the fourth multi-billion-dollar project Baku has  <br>
won since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and takes <br>
place as a chill settles over Western oil companies struggling <br>
to push Russian-based deals through a legal maze. <br>

wants the investment,'' said one Western oil executive in Moscow. <br>
``With the Azeris, it's never really a question.'' <br>
	 Douglas Hill, resident manager of Amoco unit Amoco Caspian  <br>
Sea Petroleum Ltd in Baku, said the Azeri government had done <br>
much to make deals attractive to foreign investors. <br>
	 ``There's a strong realisation here that some assistance is  <br>
needed and that oil is going to be the primary driver of the <br>
economy,'' he said. <br>
	 Actual foreign oil investment in Russia has all but dried up  <br>
as Moscow struggles to pass tax and resource laws backing <br>
investors' projects and is less than $1 billion out of a planned <br>
$60 billion. No deals are close to the production stage. <br>
	 In contrast, Azerbaijan's flagship $8 billion Azerbaijan  <br>
International Operating Company (AIOC) project grouping 13 <br>
international oil companies is scheduled to start pumping in the <br>
third quarter of next year. <br>
	 Moscow is not indifferent to the change in focus to  <br>
high-yielding Caspian reserves and has pushed to get Russian oil <br>
giant LUKoil involved in the projects -- partly, some analysts <br>
say, in exchange for not arguing over who owns Caspian oil. <br>
	 Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia all  <br>
border the sea. Russia says its resources should be shared <br>
equally but Azerbaijan follows a sectoral approach and is <br>
proceeding with deals in its area. <br>
	 ``Of course, Azerbaijan is now our competitor,'' said Nikolai  <br>
Bolmasov, deputy head of the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry's <br>
section for cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent <br>
States. <br>
	 He said Moscow was ``analysing'' Azerbaijan's role in landing  <br>
foreign oil deals but declined to say if the ministry would <br>
produce policy directives on the issue. <br>
	 Caspian oil projects are next door to the Middle East Gulf  <br>
region, which contains nearly 70 percent of world oil reserves <br>
and produces one quarter of global oil supplies. They will make <br>
Azerbaijan and neighbouring Kazakhstan big competitors to <br>
Russia. <br>
	 ``Over the next three or four years, production will shift  <br>
from Siberia to higher yielding Caspian and Sakhalin projects,'' <br>
Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC <br>
Securities in London, said in a recent interview. <br>
	 But the deals on Far Eastern Sakhalin island do not have  <br>
Russian majors as shareholders, and analysts say LUKoil's <br>
participation in leading Azeri deals has kept Moscow quiet on <br>
the Caspian status issue. <br>
	 LUKoil could yet join the latest Caspian group, which will  <br>
tap the unexplored Dan-Ulduzu and Azhrafe reserves. <br>
	 One hand Moscow has not forced is the question of how the  <br>
region's oil will be transported to Western markets. <br>
	 Russia is keen to earn crude oil transit tariffs and control  <br>
supplies, but knows some new pipelines will probably go through <br>
Turkey due to worries over increased tanker traffic through the <br>
Bosphorus. <br>

Subject: Summit torn by disputes over European security<br>
Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 15:01:22 PST<br>
<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 LISBON, Portugal (Reuter) - Russia attacked NATO's plans for  <br>
enlargement and Belarus came under fire at a security summit <br>
Monday, sounding a jarring note as some 50 nations promised to <br>
build a lasting peace in Europe. <br>
	 The first day of the summit was also marked by a fierce  <br>
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan which threatened to block <br>
the entire summit declaration, and by growing concern over <br>
Serbia's handling of mass protests on the streets of Belgrade. <br>
	 Leaders from the Organization for Security and Cooperation  <br>
in Europe (OSCE) did manage to agree on a new round of arms <br>
control talks that would adapt and extend a Cold War-era <br>
agreement cutting conventional force in Europe. <br>
	 They also agreed on a security blueprint for the 21st  <br>
century, a set of concepts designed to make all nations feel <br>
secure on the continent where two world wars have started. <br>
	 But the veneer of diplomatic harmony was shattered almost  <br>
from the start, when Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin <br>
told assembled leaders that NATO would create new fault lines in <br>
Europe if it went ahead with plans to take in countries from <br>
Eastern Europe as new members. <br>
	 ``Is it not clear that the appearance of new dividing lines  <br>
would lead to a worsening of the whole geopolitical situation in <br>
the world?'' Chernomyrdin asked the opening session of the <br>
two-day meeting. <br>
	 The last summit of the 54-nation Organization for Security  <br>
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), two years ago in Budapest, was <br>
wrecked by a row on the NATO issue and differences over Bosnia. <br>
	 The United States and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana  <br>
insisted that the alliance posed no threat to anyone and that it <br>
wanted to cooperate with Russia. <br>
	 ``NATO has been and remains a defensive alliance...it poses  <br>
no threat to any other state,'' U.S. Vice President Al Gore told <br>
the summit. ``The stability that NATO can help extend to Central <br>
Europe can help ensure the security of all nations.'' <br>
	 Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters his country  <br>
still expected to be among the first to join the alliance, and <br>
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said: <br>
	 ``Moscow has trouble accepting that NATO's enlargement is a  <br>
foregone conclusion.'' <br>
	 However, the Lisbon meeting did reach agreement on an issue  <br>
of concern to Russia -- adapting and extending a 1990 arms <br>
treaty which Moscow says no longer reflects reality. A new round <br>
of negotiations is now expected to start in Vienna in January. <br>
	 Western nations told Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko,  <br>
accused of trying to acquire dictatorial powers, to put the <br>
former Soviet republic back on the track to democracy. <br>
	 A defiant Lukashenko responded by supporting Russia's  <br>
opposition to NATO expansion, denying there was any problem at <br>
home and telling leaders to mind their own business. <br>
	 ``It would be counterproductive to try to exert pressure on  <br>
us or try to interfere in our internal affairs,'' he said. <br>
	 The summit is expected to endorse a continued OSCE role in  <br>
Bosnia, one year after the war ended there, although most eyes <br>
were on Serbia and the unprecedented challenge from <br>
demonstrators to President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic rule. <br>
	 International peace coordinator Carl Bildt called for  <br>
Milosevic to start radical democratic reforms and to drop a <br>
threat to crush the protests. <br>
	 A senior U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said  <br>
there could not be a ``decent peace in the Balkans'' unless <br>
Serbia became an open society, while British Foreign Secretary <br>
Malcolm Rifkind also called for greater democracy there. <br>
	 Russia has won little support at the summit for its  <br>
proposals to give the OSCE a more powerful role in European <br>
security and have it act as a counterbalance to NATO. <br>
	 France and Germany showed some sympathy for Russian  <br>
concerns, but many other countries fear Moscow wants to gain an <br>
effective veto on important European security issues by changing <br>
the way the OSCE works. <br>
	 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the meeting Europe must  <br>
not miss the chance to build real cooperation. <br>
	 ``There can only be security in Europe with, not against,  <br>
Russia,'' the German leader said. <br>
	 The security blueprint adopted by the summit reflects such  <br>
differences, balancing Russian concerns with the desires of NATO <br>
allies and Eastern European nations to press on with expansion. <br>
	 It said countries would consider developing a charter on  <br>
European security, something Moscow wants, but reaffirmed the <br>
rights of all nations to join alliances. <br>
	 Diplomats said the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan  <br>
over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh could torpedo the <br>
final summit communique, which was due to be issued Tuesday. <br>
Every country in the OSCE has a veto. <br>

Subject: Turkish PM vows to clear up underworld scandal<br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 ISTANBUL, Dec 3 (Reuter) - Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin  <br>
Erbakan slammed the state's alleged use of far-right gangsters <br>
in its fight against rebels and said he was confident those <br>
involved in any such illegal relationship would be punished. <br>
	 ``You cannot have a gang within the state...Nobody can be  <br>
allowed to do anything illegal, with no exceptions,'' Erbakan <br>
told Turkish columnists in an interview widely published on <br>
Tuesday. <br>
	 Erbakan was speaking in detail for the first time since a  <br>
scandal over alleged ``state gangs'' in the underworld erupted <br>
last month following an accident in which a wanted gangster, <br>
Abdullah Catli, and a top policeman died in the same car. <br>
	 A government MP, who heads Turkey's biggest private militia  <br>
in its fight with separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers <br>
Party (PKK), was also in the car but survived with minor <br>
injuries. <br>
	 ``Nothing, including fighting the PKK, can be an excuse for  <br>
a crime. If such things happen, those gangs, whatever their <br>
make-up, will be disbanded,'' said Erbakan in an apparent rebuff <br>
to comments by his deputy, Tansu Ciller, that anyone fighting <br>
for the state was a hero. <br>
	 Turkey's opposition has accused the Islamist-led ruling  <br>
coalition of attempting to cover up the scandal. <br>
	 ``The state has many layers. If one tries to cover up  <br>
something, another section will bring it out into the open,'' <br>
Erbakan said, asked if it was possible for such a scandal to be <br>
covered up. <br>
	 Ciller last week defended the mobster, saying ...''those who  <br>
fire bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this <br>
country...will always be respectfully remembered by us.'' <br>
	 Ciller said she had found through enquiries that Catli had  <br>
no confirmed conviction in Turkey. Catli had been on the run for <br>
18 years and was wanted by Interpol for his alleged role in the <br>
1981 attack on the Pope and in Turkey for the murder of seven <br>
leftists <br>
	 The media has said Turkey may have ordered Catli or other  <br>
right-wing gangsters to carry out death squad killings of an <br>
Armenian guerrilla and suspected PKK rebels, who have been <br>
fighting the army for control of southeast Turkey since 1984. <br>

Date: Tue, 3 Dec 1996 7:41:17 PST<br>
<p>
  	  				 <br>
	MOSCOW, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Russia and Iran have signed an agreement  <br>
pledging to create a joint Caspian Sea oil exploration and drilling <br>
company, reports said Tuesday. <br>
	The deal came late Monday, on the first day of a four-day session of  <br>
a bilateral commission on economic cooperation that is meeting for the <br>
first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union five years ago. <br>
	The Caspian agreement was signed by Russian Energy Minister Pyotr  <br>
Rodionov and the Iranian Economics and Foreign Trade Minister Mohammad <br>
Khan, the independent NTV television network reported. <br>
	Russian and Iranian officials declined to comment on the deal. They  <br>
did not say whether it would drill for oil in the Iran or the Russian <br>
sectors of the Caspian, or seek to work in the sectors of the other <br>
three littoral states. <br>
	Russia and Iran have sought to enforce Soviet-era treaties under  <br>
which all decisions on development of the oil-rich inland sea are <br>
subject to a consensus of all five shoreline states, but they have been <br>
rebuffed by Azerbaijan. <br>
	Pressure from the United States pushed Iran out of a $7.4 billion  <br>
Western-led consortium to drill three oil fields in the Azerbaijani <br>
sector of the Caspian, although Russia's Lukoil received a 10 percent <br>
stake in the contract. <br>
	The aim of the revived joint commission is to boost trade between the  <br>
former partners. Soviet trade with Iran in 1991 stood at more than $1.3 <br>
billion, while Russian-Iranian trade was just $250 million last year. <br>
	According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the  <br>
two nations have raised that to $350 million this year and have signed <br>
an additional $700 million worth of bilateral deals. <br>
	Those figures do not include a controversial $800 million contract  <br>
signed in January 1995, under which Russia is helping build a nuclear <br>
power plant near the Iranian city of Bushehr. <br>
	Russian Foreign Trade Minister Oleg Davydov, who heads the Russian  <br>
side in the joint commission, told the Itar-Tass news agency bilateral <br>
trade with Iran ``could reach several billion dollars within a few <br>
years.'' <br>
	Davydov told the Itar-Tass news agency 70 percent of the existing  <br>
trade comprises Russian delivery of machinery for the Iranian oil and <br>
energy sectors, and stressed energy should remain the focus of trade in <br>
the future. <br>
	Despite the sunny forecast of skyrocketing cooperation, Davydov  <br>
lamented that the development of trade is hindered by the lack of a <br>
legal basis and financial institutions to support it. <br>
	He said a treaty eliminating double taxation and investment  <br>
protection was being drawn up but would probably not be ready for <br>
signing until the next meeting of the bilateral commission. <br>

  	  				 <br>
	LONDON, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- California's weather woes have benefitted nut  <br>
traders of Iran and Turkey, with British consumers having to pay more <br>
for the Christmas crunchies. <br>
	A looming shortage has pushed up prices of almonds and pistachios,  <br>
while the cost of hazlenuts has jumped by 35 percent after the Turkish <br>
government intervened to bolster prices, a London business daily <br>
reported Thursday. <br>
	Good quality almonds are almost sold out and prices are up 20 percent  <br>
in the past six weeks following a poor Californian crop for the second <br>
year running, the Financial Times said. <br>
	Pistachio prices are also 20 percent higher after bad weather  <br>
affected almost half of this year's Iranian crop. <br>
	Californian almond prices have more than doubled over the past two  <br>
years as cold and windy weather during the important growing periods <br>
caused a decline in the harvest and poor-quality nuts. After a <br>
disastrous crop in 1995 there were no stocks to carry over to this <br>
season, the daily said. <br>
	Pistachio prices have risen from $3,200 a ton in July to $4,000 and  <br>
nuts and dried-fruit trader expect a further rise of $50 to $100 before <br>
next summer when supplies will run out. <br>
	The new season's crop comes to market in November.  <br>
	The daily said the Turkish government's farm cooperative has so far  <br>
bought 25 percent of this year's hazelnut harevest at almost $1,000 a <br>
ton higher than the free market price in an effort to push up prices <br>
from their low base of recent years. <br>
	Free market prices have risen to $3,800 a ton, but remain below the  <br>
$4,100 which the Turkish cooperative is believed to be paying farmers, <br>
the daily said. <br>

  	  				 <br>
	ANKARA, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  <br>
planned to pay a state visit to Turkey this month, Turkish and Iranian <br>
diplomats said Thursday. <br>
	Trade and the northern Iraq crisis would probably top the agenda of  <br>
Rafsanjani's talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime <br>
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the diplomats said. <br>
	The three-day visit would begin on Dec. 18.  <br>
	Erbakan, the first hard-line Muslim leader to become Turkish prime  <br>
minister, visited Iran first after taking office in July. Iran is <br>
controlled by its Shiite Muslim clergy, while modern Turkey has had a <br>
secular government. <br>
	Iran is also a focus of Erbakan's attempts to strengthen Turkey's  <br>
trade ties to eastern, Muslim-dominated countries. <br>
	During his August visit, Erbakan signed a $20 billion deal to supply  <br>
Turkey with Iranian natural gas. The two countries also pledged to raise <br>
their trade volume by $2.5 billion. <br>
	The visit was announced the day after Iranian Foreign Minister Ali  <br>
Akbar Velayati concluded his visit to Syria with fresh criticism of a <br>
renewed military accord between Israel and Turkey. <br>
	``We strongly oppose any accord concluded between Muslim countries  <br>
and the Zionist entity,'' Velayati told the government-run Ath-Thawra <br>
newspaper before leaving Damascus after a two-day visit. <br>
	He was referring to a renewal, signed last week, of a military  <br>
training accord that had sparked protests from Turkey's Muslim <br>
neighbors, particularly Syria, Iraq and Iran. <br>
	``It is clear that such an accord is not in the interest of the  <br>
Muslim world,'' Velayati said. ``We have announced our protest and <br>
rejection of such an accord.'' <br>
	Velayati met President Hafez Assad, Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa  <br>
and other high officials during his visit. <br>

	 ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) - Turkey's efforts to prevent  <br>
Kurdish rebels infiltrating from Syria are being hindered <br>
because the military does not have a map of its own minefields <br>
on the border, a commission of parliamentarians said. <br>
	 ``It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown  <br>
because a minefield chart cannot be found,'' the commission said <br>
in a report on border protection. <br>
	 The report, to be debated in parliament in coming weeks, was  <br>
seen by Reuters Friday. ``Officials say the minefields present <br>
an obstacle to the security forces,'' it said. <br>
	 It said Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas sometimes  <br>
know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the <br>
security forces. <br>
	 ``Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines, defused  <br>
them and opened up wide paths in some areas. They can come in <br>
and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle,'' it said. <br>
	 Turkey says Syria sponsors the PKK, fighting for Kurdish  <br>
self-rule in southeast Turkey. Damascus denies aiding the <br>
rebels. <br>

  	  				 <br>
	 MOSCOW (Reuter) - Barely 150 mostly elderly people gathered  <br>
in Moscow to mourn the demise of the Soviet Union Sunday, the <br>
fifth anniversary of a pact that consigned the communist <br>
superpower to history. <br>
	 The demonstrators waved red flags and pictures of Soviet  <br>
dictator Josef Stalin as they listened to denunciations of <br>
President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms and the breakup of <br>
their vast multi-ethnic state into 15 independent republics. <br>
	 ``Yeltsin and his cronies are robbing the people, they are  <br>
in the pay of the West. Their reforms are anti-Russian and <br>
against the people,'' one speaker told the crowd. <br>
	 But no major opposition leaders joined the protests, a clear  <br>
sign that restoring the Soviet Union five years on is virtually <br>
a lost cause even among diehard communists. <br>
	 The leaders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine -- the three  <br>
Slavic core states -- met at a Belarussian hunting lodge on Dec. <br>
8, 1991 to inaugurate the Commonwealth of Independent States <br>
(CIS) that replaced the old Soviet Union. <br>
	 The CIS groups all the former Soviet republics except the  <br>
three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. <br>
	 Belarus' former president, Stanislav Shushkevich, who signed  <br>
the pact with Yeltsin and Ukraine's then-leader Leonid Kravchuk, <br>
said Sunday he had no regrets about their decision. <br>
	 ``The Soviet Union was dead by then and we wanted to  <br>
preserve what was good of it in the newly formed Commonwealth of <br>
Independent States,'' he told Russian television. <br>
	 Ironically Shushkevich's successor as Belarus leader,  <br>
Alexander Lukashenko, wants to rebuild a union with Russia. <br>
	 Sunday's demonstrators expressed support for Lukashenko, who  <br>
recently won sweeping powers in a controversial referendum, and <br>
said he should become leader of a reunited Russia and Belarus <br>
instead of Yeltsin. <br>
	 Belarus is probably the only former Soviet republic where  <br>
the population has consistently backed re-unification. Elsewhere <br>
independence had become irreversible in people's minds and <br>
hardly an issue for any public celebrations or protests. <br>
	 The collapse of the Soviet Union has been a painful process  <br>
for many of the nearly 300 million people that populated the <br>
vast country. Hundreds of thousands, mainly Russians, have moved <br>
from many former Soviet republics fearing ethnic discrimination. <br>
	 Trade links between the former parts of one huge centralized  <br>
economy have been disrupted, aggravating economic crisis in most <br>
of them. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 MOSCOW (Reuter) - The United States and its Western allies  <br>
put political and economic interests ahead of the protection of <br>
human rights in the former Soviet Union, a watchdog group <br>
charged Tuesday. <br>
	 ``In 1996 human rights principles were subordinated to  <br>
current political and economic interests,'' said Alexander <br>
Petrov, Moscow representative of the U.S.-based Human Rights <br>
Watch/Helsinki group. <br>
	 ``This particularly concerned the United States and the  <br>
countries of the European Union,'' he told a news conference to <br>
mark International Human Rights Day. <br>
	 ``An example of this kind of policy was provided by Russia's  <br>
accession to the Council of Europe despite the renewal and <br>
continuation of intense military activity in Chechnya involving <br>
colossal violations of humanitarian law,'' he said. <br>
	 The Council of Europe, which sees itself as an arbiter of  <br>
human rights, accepted Russia in February after months of delay <br>
due to concerns over Moscow's campaign in the breakaway region. <br>
	 Council members said at the time that having Russia on board  <br>
would help it to push forward human rights, but critics charged <br>
that it did nothing to stop the Chechnya fighting, which killed <br>
tens of thousands before a peace deal was signed in August. <br>
	 ``Things were no better in other republics,'' Petrov said,  <br>
citing aid given to Armenia and Georgia despite government <br>
crackdowns on opposition groups. <br>
	 Azerbaijan had also conducted a campaign to crush dissent,  <br>
he said, but nevertheless won observer status in the Council of <br>
Europe. Kazakhstan and Kirgizia also got Western support. <br>
	 As far as the rights situation itself was concerned, Petrov  <br>
said autocratic and arbitrary rule in Uzbekistan and <br>
Turkmenistan made them the biggest causes for alarm. <br>
	 In Russia, Petrov said the only significant improvement was  <br>
the end to the conflict against separatist rebels in Chechnya, <br>
begun when President Boris Yeltsin sent in troops two years ago. <br>
	 ``If you set this aside human rights stayed on the same  <br>
level and in some cases worsened,'' he said. <br>
	 He said the situation in Russia's regions was worse than in  <br>
Moscow and other big cities, citing direct threats and financial <br>
sanctions which he said were used to gag the media. ``There is <br>
no progress, but a regression here.'' <br>
	 Petrov also pinpointed a growth in xenophobia in Russia,  <br>
particularly against people of Caucasian origin beaten up and <br>
deported from big cities by the authorities. <br>

	YEREVAN, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- Armenia's Supreme Court, culminating a 17-  <br>
month trial widely viewed as politically motivated, handed down death <br>
sentences Tuesday to three men convicted of murdering three members of <br>
their own political party. <br>

guilty in the murder of three former members of their outlawed <br>

compromising information on its activities. <br>

charges of drug trafficking and spying on government officials, and <br>
received prison terms of three to 13 years. <br>

Dashnaktsutyun that allegedly engaged in illegal operations aimed at <br>
enriching the party and improving its political standing. <br>
	Ruben Akopyan, a lawmaker and member of Dashnaktsutyun, which was  <br>
declared illegal two years ago to exclude it from 1995 parliamentary <br>

	``I am certain that this trial had political aims, and the  <br>
accusations of anti-government action essentially have removed the basic <br>
political rival of the current leadership,'' Akopyan said. <br>
	Akopyan reiterated claims the defendants were ``violently abused and  <br>
practically beaten to death'' in prison. One of the orginal 12 <br>
defendants died in solitary confinement in a pre-trial holding center. <br>
	Grant Markaryan, an Iranian citizen and a chief ideologue of  <br>
Dashnaktsutyun, received a surprisingly short five-year sentence. One of <br>
the defendants sentenced to death, Artsumi, is a citizen of Lebanon. <br>
	Political observers in Armenia said it was likely the death sentence  <br>
would be commuted, as President Levon Ter-Petrosyan has repeatedly said <br>
there will be no capital punishment while he is in office. <br>
	Ter-Petrosyan has led the country since 1990. He won a second term as  <br>
president in an election last September, winning 51 percent of a vote <br>
marred by claims of fraud and riots to protest the official result. <br>
	Dashnaktsutyun, formed early in the century and revived amid the  <br>
drive for independence from Moscow, was banned before campaigning got <br>
under way for 1995 parliamentary elections foreign observers called <br>
``free but not fair.'' <br>
	Its leader, Vahan Hogannesyan, and 30 other members are being tried  <br>
in a separate case on charges of conspiring to seize power during the <br>
disputed 1995 vote. <br>

	 YEREVAN (Reuter) - Armenia's Supreme Court on Tuesday  <br>
sentenced three members of the outlawed Dashnaktsitun political <br>
party to death on terrorism charges. <br>
	 Judge Eduard Manukyan said Armen Mndjoyan, Arsen Arsrune and  <br>
Armen Grigoryan would be put to death for terrorist activities, <br>
drugs trafficking, and arms dealing. <br>
	 Lawyers for the condemned immediately said they planned to  <br>
appeal. Eight other members of the nationalist party got <br>
sentences of three to 15 years in prison. <br>
	 Dashnaktsitun was outlawed in 1994 by President Levon  <br>
Ter-Petrosyan who said its members were plotting terrorist acts <br>
and wanted to overthrow the government. <br>
	 But Dashnaktsitun maintained it was the victim of a witchunt  <br>
to crack down on dissent in the small Caucasus state of three <br>
and a half million. <br>
	 Ter-Petrosyan closed several opposition parties earlier this  <br>
year and sent tanks into the streets after he won a <br>
controversial second term in office. International observers <br>
said the vote was marred by major violations. <br>

	 ANKARA, Dec 12 (Reuter) - Turkish President Suleyman Demirel  <br>
has written to the 15 leaders of European Union countries to ask <br>
them not to forget Turkey's bid for full membership when they <br>
meet at the Dublin summit, an aide said on Thursday. <br>
	 ``The EU will talk about its future enlargement at the Dublin  <br>
summit. The president sent letters to remind the leaders Turkey <br>
has a privileged position for full membership of the union, <br>
because it is a stable, secular and democratic country,'' the <br>
adviser told Reuters. <br>
	 EU leaders will meet for two days in Dublin from Friday to  <br>
discuss the single currency, enlargement into eastern Europe, <br>
fighting drugs and the future of EU institutions. <br>
	 Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has  <br>
turned down an invitation to dine with EU ministers during the <br>
summit, saying he did so to warn Europe about its coolness <br>
towards Turkey. <br>
	 Europe has put Turkey's application for EU membership on  <br>
hold because of Ankara's economic troubles, human rights record <br>
and disputes with member Greece. <br>
	 Turkish officials bemoan the fact that former communist  <br>
nations of eastern Europe have streaked ahead of it in the queue <br>
for full membership. <br>

<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 BAKU, Dec 13 (Reuter) - Azerbaijan's parliament on Friday  <br>
approved a $758 million budget for 1997 which includes a $163 <br>
million deficit, a significant increase over 1996. <br>
	 The Milli Mejlis, or parliament, approved spending of 3.18  <br>
trillion manats and revenues of 2.5 trillion manats. The 680 <br>
billion manat deficit is significantly more than in 1996 which <br>
it was 516 billion manats ($117 million at the then exchange <br>
rate). <br>
	 The deficit is to be covered mainly by issuing treasury  <br>
bills and ``bonuses'' paid into state coffers by western oil <br>
companies signing new offshore Caspian Sea drilling contracts <br>
with the government. <br>
	 The government expects gross domestic product to rise two  <br>
percent over 1996 levels to 17.2 trillion manats. <br>
	 Education accounts for 648 billion manats, the biggest slice  <br>
of government spending, while 357 billion go to defence, 278 <br>
billion for social security and 250 billion for health care. <br>
	 Servicing the government debt will take 413 billion manats.  <br>
	 Some Milli Mejlis deputies complained about what they see as  <br>
the relatively low level of military spending at a time when the <br>
country is still in conflict with neighbouring Armenia over the <br>
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. <br>
	 Finance Minister Fikret Usifov said the government had  <br>
collected nearly 100 percent of expected tax revenues for 1996. <br>

Subject: Azeris, oil firms sign $2 bln Caspian Sea deal<br>
Date: Sat, 14 Dec 1996 8:00:26 PST<br>
<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 BAKU, Dec 14 (Reuter) - Azerbaijan and a consortium of  <br>
foreign oil companies led by Amoco Corp's Amoco Eurasian <br>
Petroleum Company signed a $2 billion deal on Saturday in Baku <br>
to develop the Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu oil fields. <br>
	 The 25-year contract is Azerbaijan's fourth major deal with  <br>
a consortium of Western companies, in the Caucasus republic's <br>
Caspian Sea reserves. <br>
	 Amoco said it hopes to sign another exploration agreement  <br>
with the former Soviet republic soon. <br>
	 The Western consortium in Saturday's deal includes Amoco  <br>
Eurasian, with a 30 percent stake, Unocal with 25.5 percent, <br>
Japan's Itochu with 20 percent and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir <br>
with 4.5 percent. <br>
	 The Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR will have a 20  <br>
percent stake in the deal and Azeri oil officials say 65 to 80 <br>
percent of profits from the development of the fields will go to <br>
the Azeri government. <br>
	 The Ashrafi and Dan Ulduzu fields lie appoximately 30 miles  <br>
off the Apsheron peninsula. They are spread over 453 square km <br>
(175 sq miles) at depths of 75 to 200 metres (246 to 656 feet) <br>
and are estimated to contain 150 million tonnes of crude. <br>
	 First production is expected to come on line in 2003 and  <br>
will reach seven million tonnes per year by 2007. <br>
	 The deal requires an up-front bonus payment to the Azeri  <br>
government of $75 million from consortium members and must be <br>
ratified by the Azeri parliament. <br>
	 The deal brings total western investment in Azerbaijan's  <br>
promising oil sector to over $12 billion. <br>
	 Azeri President Haydar Aliyev said the agreement was  <br>
evidence of the growing importance of the former Soviet republic <br>
for American companies. <br>
	 ``I am happy that the Clinton administration is finding  <br>
cooperation with Azerbaijan,'' Aliyev said, adding that he had <br>
received a telephone call from U.S. Vice President Al Gore on <br>
Friday. <br>
	 ``I consider that the U.S. and Azerbaijan are strategic  <br>
partners... The Vice President said the administration supports <br>
cooperation with the Azeri oil sector and regards the contract <br>
as of the utmost importance,'' he said. <br>
	 Azerbaijan, with its vast Capsian oil potential, has been  <br>
the centre of a tug-of-war between Russia, Iran, Trukey and <br>
Western countries since independence in 1991. <br>
	 Tom Stacy, Chairman of Amoco Eurasian Petroleum Company,  <br>
said the oil giant hoped to sign another Caspian contract with <br>
the Azeri government soon. <br>
	 ``We are happy to work in Azerbaijan and hope to sign another  <br>
contract soon on exploration of the southern part of the Azeri <br>
sector of the Caspian basin,'' he told a news conference. <br>

Subject: Chechen oil head assures pipeline safe, wants cut<br>
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 15:02:31 PST<br>
<p>
  	  				 <br>
	 MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuter) - The head of war-torn Chechnya's  <br>
oil company said on Thursday that Russia's rebellious region <br>
would guarantee the safety of a major oil pipeline across its <br>
land but demanded a cut in foreign deals that will use the link. <br>
	 Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil  <br>
Company, which is based in the devastated capital Grozny, told a <br>
news conference that an $8 billion multinational consortium that <br>
will use the link to export oil in 1997 should not worry because <br>
the pipeline was safe and sound. <br>
	 ``We guarantee the link's safety,'' he said. ``But remember  <br>
that with pipelines all over the world, things sometimes happen <br>
-- sabotage, technical errors, human errors.'' <br>
	 He said Chechnya should get a cut from transit fees via the  <br>
so-called northern link, which can carry 17 million tonnes of <br>
oil a year. <br>
	 ``The Chechen part is approximately in the same condition as  <br>
the rest of the link,'' he said, referring to the stretch running <br>
through Grozny and linking the Azeri capital Baku to Russia's <br>
Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk. <br>
	 The 13 international oil companies in the Azerbaijan  <br>
International Operating Company plan to reverse the flow of the <br>
pipeline to ship up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of early <br>
oil from their Caspian offshore projects near Baku from August <br>
1997. <br>
	 The consortium is led by an alliance of British Petroleum  <br>
Plc and Norway's Statoil. <br>
	 Protracted bloodshed and instability in the 21-month Chechen  <br>
conflict have given the consortium the jitters ever since Moscow <br>
sent troops into Grozny in December 1994 in a bloody bid to rein <br>
in the breakaway region. <br>
	 The oil firms, worried that exports from their big ticket  <br>
investments could fall prey to a separatist war, have access to <br>
a second export route via the former Soviet republic of Georgia. <br>
	 Underscoring the fragility of the region for oil investors,  <br>
six foreigners working with the International Committee of the <br>
Red Cross were shot dead at a Chechen hospital on Wednesday and <br>
six ethnic Russians were killed on Thursday. <br>
	 Yarikhanov, who said he had faced a cool reception at  <br>
Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly, which owns and <br>
operates the pipeline, and at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, said <br>
Moscow was not doing enough to resurrect the region's <br>
once-glorious oil sector. <br>
	 While he said the pipeline was no worse for the war,  <br>
Chechnya's production and refining facilities had been laid <br>
waste. <br>
	 At least eight trillion roubles ($1.44 billion) were needed  <br>
to bring the facilities back on line. Yarikhanov said financing <br>
could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the <br>
Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya. <br>
	 ``We want our share of profits from the transport of oil  <br>
across our country,'' he said, adding the Azeri group would pay <br>
$16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near <br>
Baku to Novorossiisk. <br>
	 The Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm  <br>
SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco <br>
Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott <br>
International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir. <br>
	 The Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil  <br>
Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million <br>
tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into <br>
bloodshed. <br>
	 Chechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in  <br>
the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow <br>
began tapping its massive Siberian reserves. <br>
	 Refining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22  <br>
million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased. <br>

1. CONSENSUS APPARENT IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, SARKISSIAN SAYS<br>
<p>
YEREVAN-At a press conference Thursday, Armenian Prime Minister <br>
Armen Sarkissian stated that he would introduce reforms in the <br>
countrys tax system, adding that there was a domestic consensus <br>
in the governments overall proposed agenda, reported the Noyan <br>
Tapan news agency.<br>
	The prime minister also announced that he planned to make <br>
changes in the 1997 fiscal year budget, increasing earning by two-<br>
thirds percent, for which he planned to initiate reforms in the <br>
taxation and customs areas.<br>
	Stressing that the governments programs are in concert with <br>
that of the opposition platform, Sarkissian stated that there <br>
existed a domestic consensus in Armenia.<br>
	Sarkissian added that during last weeks meeting with <br>
representatives of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Executive <br>
Council, he "only presented all facets of his governments <br>
program."<br>
	According to Noyan Tapan, Sarkissian conveyed that the ARFs <br>
reinstatement issue in Armenia was not discussed during that <br>
meeting.<br>
	A report by the Yerevan news agency noted last week that the <br>
ARF representatives discussed the prime ministers government <br>
program during the meeting with Sarkissian, and "addressed <br>
domestic political issues, emphasizing the importance of political <br>
parties in the resolution of those concerns."<br>
	During the press conference, Sarkissian also discussed the <br>
possibility of more meetings with the opposition.<br>
	Finally, Sarkissian added, that the government had decided <br>
to establish a new structure for privatizing state businesses and <br>
unfinished construction projects, as well as a time-table for the <br>
implementing the project.<br>

2. ARF MARKS 106TH ANNIVERSARY IN YEREVAN<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The 106th anniversary celebrations of the <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation were held on December 17 in <br>
Yerevans "Hagop Baronian" theater.<br>
	Master of Ceremonies and ARF Executive Council member Vartan <br>
Petrossian drew parallels between the ARFs activities a century <br>
ago with those of today.<br>
	"One hundred years ago, the ARF came to the forefront with <br>
the famous [Sarkis] Gougounian expedition of 1896 and in 1990, the <br>
ARF took an active part in Karabakhs self-defense struggle," he <br>
said.<br>
	ARF Executive Council and National Assembly member Rouben <br>
Hakobian delivered the keynote address. "In 1890, Armenian <br>
political thought opened a new page with the founding of the <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation, and the realization that <br>
Armenias future lies in its own strength."<br>
	Hakobian synthesized the 106-year life of the ARF with a <br>
overview of the three-stages in its development-the founding of <br>
the ARF to the Sovietization of the Republic of Armenia in 1921; <br>
the ARFs role in the Armenian Diaspora; and the ARFs return to <br>
Armenia and Artsakh as a result of the Gorbachev-era reforms and   <br>
national reawakening begining with the 1988 Karabakh movement.<br>
	Hakobian concluded his remarks by focusing on the suspension <br>
of the ARF in Armenia. "Any plans to halt the ARFs activities is <br>
doomed to failure. The ARF will continue its activity for the good <br>
of the nation and the establishment of statehood, and no force can <br>
hinder us," he said, adding "the announcement during the <br>
sentencing phase of the so-called "Dro" trial showed that justice <br>
will prevail." The court found no direct links between co-<br>
defendant and ARF leader Hrand Markarian and the "Dro" group, thus <br>
absolving any alleged ties between the ARF and the purported <br>
clandestine group.<br>
	National Democratic Union chairman Vazgen Manoukian praised <br>
the ARF on the anniversary of its establishment, saying "the ARF <br>
is a national asset and it has a mission. There is still more to <br>
be done in the future than has been done in the past."<br>
	Aram Sargssian of the Armenian Democratic Party joined <br>
Manoukian in congratulating the ARF, which he characterized as an <br>
honor.<br>
	The final speaker for the evening was former Communist Party <br>
member, Prof. Karnig Ananian, who praised the ARFs "glorious <br>
history."<br>
	The evenings celebrations concluded with a cultural <br>
program.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. DEFENDANT REJECTS PRELIMINARY TESTIMONY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-"Trial of 31" co-defendant Martin <br>
Karapetian, who is charged with high treason, conspiracy to commit <br>
a terrorist act and illegal possession of weapons, started his <br>
testimony, rejecting statements made during the preliminary <br>
investigation.<br>
	Karapetian said he gave false testimony to help his father <br>
and brother Vladik, who had been arrested. He is convinced that <br>
his father and brother were taken hostage to make his elder <br>
brother Gagik surrender.<br>
	Karapetian was convinced that co-defendant Vachagan Kossian, <br>
a fellow veteran of the Afghan war, was arrested as a warning in <br>
case of non-compliance. He said that twenty of his friends have <br>
been interrogated.<br>
	He denied preliminary investigation claims that his brother <br>
Gagik had told him about the alleged coup attempt and instructed <br>
him to recruit people. Karapetian also rejected claims alleging <br>
that he was going to learn the presidents and other top <br>
officials whereabouts via his friends working at the National <br>
Security Council in order to carry out alleged acts of terrorism.<br>
	Karapetian stated that he, his two brothers, father and even <br>
his pregnant sister-in-law were subjected to violence by <br>
investigating bodies, as a result of which his sister-in-law went <br>
into premature labor. The condition of the newborn twins is still <br>
critical, he said.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. BARONESS COX RECEIVES KARABAKH MEDAL<br>
<p>
STEPANAKERT (Noyan Tapan)-The Prime Minister of Karabakh, Leonard <br>
Petrossian, presented Baroness Caroline Cox, deputy speaker of the <br>
British House of Lords, with a commemorative medal dedicated to <br>
the fifth anniversary of Karabakhs independence.<br>
	Petrossian met with a delegation of the Geneva-based <br>
Christian Solidarity International, a charity group that Cox is <br>
involved with, and discussed the recent presidential election in <br>
Karabakh. Cox asked Petrossian to convey her congratulations and <br>
best wishes to Robert Kocharian on his election.<br>
	Petrossian briefed his guests on economic reforms, the <br>
development of infrastructures and tourism in Karabakh.<br>
	Deputy Prime Minister Jirayr Poghossian and writer Zori <br>
Balayan also attended the meeting.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. PROSECUTOR-GENERAL ASKS COURT TO REVISE "DRO" TRIAL VERDICT<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Azg)-The Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Armenia, <br>
Artavazd Gevorkian, called on the Supreme Court to revise the <br>
"Dro" trial verdicts, and consequently the sentences, handed down <br>
on December 10.<br>
	By law, only Gevorkian may provide additional information, <br>
since he signed the final document. The prosecutors office <br>
believes that in certain cases the court mistakenly accepted <br>
evidence provided by the preliminary investigations, sources close <br>
to the case said.<br>
<p>
<p>
6. YEREVAN MAYOR MEETS WITH  CHINESE AMBASSADOR<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Yerevan Mayor Vano Siradeghian welcomed <br>
Chinas Ambassador to Armenia Xian Kezhun  Tuesday.<br>
	The two discussed the importance of establishing friendly <br>
relations between the two countries and possibly having China <br>

<p>
<p>
7. ARMENTEL TO UPGRADE TELEPHONE SERVICE<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The Armentel telephone company has already <br>
used $37 million to upgrade Armenias telephone service, director <br>
Vahram Soghomonian said.<br>
	The German firm, Siemens, allocated $75 million in loans to <br>
help fund the modernization of Yerevans telephone network. <br>
Soghomonian also said that Armentel received new investment <br>
proposals, however, they are not ready to utilize them yet.<br>
	"Armentel does not have financial problems. The problem is <br>
staff training, quick installation and operation of the <br>
equipment," Soghomonian said at a press conference.<br>
	Armentel is a joint-venture of which 49 percent of is <br>
controlled American Trans-World Telecom Company.<br>
	Soghomonian denied reports published in "Golos Armenii" <br>
newspaper of protest against privatization by Armentels <br>
employees. He characterized the article as "a provocation" <br>
instigated by the chairman of the Armenias Communication <br>
Employees Trade Union, Victor Adamian.<br>
	Soghomonian said that abusing the freedom of speech can <br>
hinder the investment flow into Armenia. "We manage to earn money, <br>
do not interfere with our work," he said and added that Armentel <br>
received new investment proposals from Siemens ($150,000,000), <br>
Alkatel ($20,000,000) and Daewoo ($30,000,000).<br>
	Chairman of the Yerevan Stock Exchange Sedrak Sedrakian <br>
expressed regret that Adamian and the editor of "Golos Armenii," <br>
Flora Nakhshkarian, did not take part in the news conference.<br>
	Soghomonian said that presently Armentels shares are being <br>
prepared for public sale. Conditions of the privatization must be <br>
specified by the government, he added.<br>
	According to Soghomonian, modernization of the enterprise <br>
will lead to downsizing and loss of some jobs, but at the same <br>
time, it will create a number of new ones.<br>
<p>
<p>
8. GERMAN EXPERTS STUDY CONDITION OF ARMENIAN RAILWAY<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-The German economic and consulting firm, <br>
Tewet, is currently preparing a package of technical and economic <br>
documents to determine the amount of money needed for the <br>
restoration of Armenian's railway.<br>
	All work is being implemented within the guidelines of the <br>
European Communitys Traceka program, which calls for an extension <br>
of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia corridor.<br>
	The 16-part program includes a joint Transcaucasus railway <br>
enterprise to be set up between Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. <br>
The program is being implemented in association with GTZ and De-<br>
Consult companies of Germany and is due to be completed within the <br>
next 10 months.<br>
	A representative from the De-Consult firm, Erica Muller, who <br>
is also responsible for the implementation of the program in <br>
Armenia, reported that since September, six experts from these <br>
firms have confirmed that Armenias railway is in extremely poor <br>
shape and its restoration will require a sizable investment.<br>
	Another group of German experts who will determine the size <br>
of investments needed for the restoration of locomotives, railway <br>
stations, and communications is expected to visit Armenia in <br>
January 1997.<br>
<p>
<p>

association with the International Center for the Protection and <br>
Study of the City of Ani, the ancient capital of Armenia, it will <br>
hold talks with Turkey to discuss problems regarding preservation <br>
and study of the Ani ruins.<br>
	Historians and archeologists have tried on many occasion to <br>
draw attention to the plight of the ancient city, but to no avail, <br>
and the governments have repeatedly pledged to sign a number of <br>
international agreements in order to ensure the protection of <br>
memorials that are of international value, the academy said.<br>
	The latest call to action by the National Academy of <br>
Sciences pays special attention to the famous Ani Cathedral, which <br>
is faced with destruction as a result of the 1988 earthquake in <br>
Armenia.<br>
	The Cathedrals 1000th anniversary will be marked in 2001. <br>
It was also noted that Armenia is ready to carry out the <br>

	The Turkish side has offered to proclaim the Ani zone an <br>
international museum under the protection of Turkey and Armenia.<br>
<p>
<p>
10. TACIS IMPLEMENTS ENERGY PROGRAM IN ARMENIA<br>
<p>
YEREVAN (Noyan Tapan)-Chief specialist of the Energy Ministrys <br>
Department for Reconstruction and Development, Alexander <br>
Kocharian, said that TACIS started implementing a program to <br>
develop Armenias energy sector.<br>
	The first two stages of the program are devoted to problems <br>
of project and office management, Kocharian said.<br>
	TACIS has set up guidelines for the training of office <br>
staff. Seminars are conducted by foreign specialists.<br>
	According to Kocharian, Armenia is presently getting foreign <br>
aid and loans under various projects, and it is very important <br>
that these funds are spent efficiently.<br>
<p>
<p>
11. UN ENVOY NOMINEE SUPPORTS ARMENIAN ISSUES<br>
<p>
*New Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson has backed aid to Armenia, <br>
peace in Nagorno-Karabah, the Azeri aid ban, and commemoration of <br>
the Genocide<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON-President Clintons nominee to serve as US Ambassador <br>
to the United Nations, New Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, has <br>
a record of supporting a range of issues of concern to Armenian-<br>
Americans, including aid to Armenia, the equitable resolution of <br>
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, sanctions on Turkey due to its <br>
blockade of Armenia and the commemoration of the  Armenian <br>
Genocide, reported the Armenian National Committee of America. <br>
	In June of this year, Richardson voted in favor of the <br>
Visclosky Amendment, which stregthened the Humanitarian Aid <br>
Corridor Act sanction on Turkey for obstructing US humanitarian <br>
supplies to Armenia.  The Amendment, which limited the Presidents <br>
authority to waive the Corridor Act, was designed to cut off all <br>
US economic assistance to Turkey until it had ceased to block the <br>
delivery of relief assistance to Armenia.  In June 1995,  Rep. <br>
Richardson voted in favor of the Porter Amendment to the FY 1996 <br>
foreign aid bill, sharply reducing US aid levels to Turkey  <br>
because of that nations continued blockade of Armenia, occupation  <br>
of Cyprus, mistreatment of the Kurds and worsening human rights  <br>
record. He has also supported a number of other issues of concern  <br>
to Greek and Kurdish-Americans.<br>
	During the 103rd Congress, Richardson co-sponsored H.Res. <br>
86, introduced by House Democratic Whip David Bonior, which <br>
presented a six-point guideline for US involvement in the <br>
NagornoKarabakh Peace process.  The resolution called for <br>
continued humanitarian aid for Armenia; promoted a "lasting and <br>
equitable resolution to the conflict within the UN and CSCE"; <br>
called for the "full participation of the representatives of <br>
Nagorno Karabagh in all negotiations"; encouraged "Turkey, which <br>
has provided military, economic and diplomatic support for <br>
Azerbaijan, to play a neutral role"; condemned the "blockades of <br>
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh; and demanded "the immediate lifting" <br>
of the blockades and the opening of humanitarian corridors to <br>
facilitate the delivery of humanitarian goods to Armenia; and <br>
supported the continuation of the ban on US aid to Azerbaijan <br>
until its ceases its aggression against and blockades of Armenia <br>
and Nagorno-Karabakh.<br>
	Richardson voted for the Armenian Genocide resolution both <br>
times that it came before the House during his term of office, in <br>
1987 (H.J.Res.132), and 1985 (H.J.Res.192). He did not,  however, <br>
support the Radanovich-Bonior Amendment to the FY 1997 foreign aid <br>
bill.<br>

OMRI DAILY DIGEST
No. 244, Part I, 19 December 1996
<p>
RUSSIA
<p>
YELTSIN CREATES DEPARTMENT ON COSSACK POLICY. Yeltsin signed a decree
establishing a Main Directorate on Cossack Units in the presidential
administration, which will be responsible for working out policy on the
revival of Russia's Cossacks and coordinating the activities of all
registered Cossack organizations, ITAR-TASS reported on 18 December. In
April, Yeltsin signed several decrees on Cossack participation in the
border guards and civil service (see OMRI Daily Digest, 18 April 1996).
Meanwhile, Komsomosakaya pravda reported on 18 December that 3,000 Terek
Cossacks blockaded the airport and train station in Mineralnye Vody
(Stavropol Krai) until they were promised a meeting between Chernomyrdin
and their ataman, Vladimir Shevtsov. The Terek Cossacks are demanding
that some territory be transferred from Chechnya to Stavropol Krai, as
well as immunity from prosecution for possession of firearms and the
authority to guard the border between Chechnya and Stavropol. * Laura
Belin
<p>
DUMA PASSES BILL AGAINST SEPARATISM BY AUTONOMOUS OKRUGS. The Duma
passed in the third and final reading a draft law regulating relations
between krais, oblasts, and the autonomous okrugs subordinated to them,
ITAR-TASS reported on 18 December. Nine krais and oblasts of the Russian
Federation contain autonomous okrugs. The bill would make okrugs subject
to the laws of the corresponding oblast or krai. It stresses that
elections to a krai's or oblast's legislative and executive bodies are
held throughout all their territories without any exception. The Duma
vote is in large part aimed at preserving the integrity of Tyumen
Oblast, since the legislature of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug-one
of two okrugs in Tyumen-has declared that the okrug's citizens will not
participate in the 22 December Tyumen gubernatorial elections (see OMRI
Daily Digest,16 and 18 December 1996). * Nikolai Iakoubovski
<p>
RODIONOV TAKES HARSH STAND IN BRUSSELS. Russian Defense Minster Igor
Rodionov blasted NATO's plans to expand eastward after meeting with
defense ministers from the 16 NATO countries on 18 December,
international agencies reported. Rodionov dismissed alliance pledges not
to deploy nuclear weapons in new member states, saying such promises
could be revoked at any time. He renewed threats to take unspecified
"countermeasures" if the alliance expands and said expansion would
threaten START II. Rodionov's comments may be aimed at extracting the
maximum concessions for Russian acquiescence to enlargement, but they
could also signal that Moscow still hopes to torpedo the process.
* Scott Parrish
<p>
TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER IN MOSCOW. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller discussed a wide range of issues in
meetings with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign
Minister Yevgenii Primakov on 18 December, international agencies
reported. Ciller said NATO expansion should "be handled very carefully,"
adding that Turkey, whose approval is neccessary for the admission of
new members, "will not allow NATO to become a threat to Russia."
Kommersant-Daily on 19 December speculated that Ciller hoped to trade
Turkish opposition to NATO expansion for Russian agreement not to
support Kurdish separatists. Ciller and Primakov did sign a joint anti-
terrorism declaration, and each side pledged to respect the others'
territorial integrity. But Primakov said Moscow is "not responsible" for
the activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party and rebuffed Turkish
concerns over the planned sale of S-300 air defense missiles to the
Greek-controlled part of Cyprus. * Scott Parrish
<p>
DE BEERS ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO RUSSIA. South Africa's De Beers has issued
a statement urging the Russian government to ratify an agreement between
the company and Russia's largest diamond producer Almazy Rossii-Sakha by
the end of 1996, AFP and ITAR-TASS reported on 18 December. De Beers
says it will not buy Russian raw diamonds under the terms of the current
agreement next year. The new agreement would allow De Beers to become
the sole buyer of all Russian raw diamond exports. De Beers was
responding to a statement by Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits in
Smolensk on 17 December: he said the agreement with De Beers should pay
more attention to the interests of the Russian diamond extracting and
cutting industries. * Natalia Gurushina

TRIALS ON POST-ELECTION UNREST IN YEREVAN TO START IN JANUARY. An
Armenian opposition representative, Vladimir Hakhverdyan, said that the
investigation into the 25 September protests in Yerevan is complete and
that trials will begin in January, Groong reported on 18 December citing
Asbarez-on-line. The protests were triggered by reports of alleged vote-
rigging in the 22 September presidential election. A number of
supporters of the defeated opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan burst
into the parliament building and took the National Assembly speaker and
his deputy hostage. According to Hakhverdyan, a group of opposition
activists arrested in connection with the unrest, have been charged with
inciting mass disorder and illegally possessing arms. * Emil Danielyan
<p>
RUSSIA UPSET OVER ADAMS/KHACHUKAEV MEETING. Russia's Ambassador to Baku,
Aleksandr Blokhin, told ITAR-TASS on 18 December he was displeased at
the reported recent meeting in Baku between Terry Adams, chairman of the
Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), and Chechen
government official Eduard Khachukaev (See OMRI Daily Digest for 18
December 1996). Blokhin argued that the export of Caspian oil via
Chechnya to Novorossiisk, which Adams and Khachukaev allegedly
discussed, was regulated under the terms of the existing agreement
between Transneft and the AIOC. A spokesman for Adams confirmed that he
had met with Khachukaev but denied that the two men had discussed
transit tariffs. * Liz Fuller
<p>
ADZHAR SUPREME SOVIET DENIES REPORTS OF STATE OF EMERGENCY IN BATUMI. On
18 December a spokesman for the Adzhar Supreme Soviet denied press
reports that a state of emergency had been declared in the capital,
Batumi, but said that military vehicles had been moved to the city on 18
December to take part in maneuvers, according to ITAR-TASS of 18
December. Nezavisimaya gazeta on 19 December quoted a source within the
Georgian parliament as claiming that all Russian troops stationed in
Adzharia had been placed on full alert in connection with an anticipated
attempt to assassinate Azdhar Supreme Soviet chairman Aslan Abashidze.
* Liz Fuller
<p>
NIYAZOV ON NATUAL GAS EXPORTS. Speaking on state television, Turkmen
President Saparmurat Niyazov said on 18 December he is pinning his hopes
for an economic revivial on renewed exports of natural gas to Western
Europe, Reuters reported. He said that gas exports in 1997 will almost
double to 40 billion cubic meters and that half the gas will be shipped
to Western Europe via Russia, in accordance with an agreement with
Russia's Gazprom. Last year, Turkmenistan exported 24 billion cubic
meters of natural gas. In the late 1980s, Turkmenistan produced more
than 80 billion cubic meters of gas a year. In 1993, Russia stopped
delivering Turkmen natural gas to Europe, leaving the country to supply
cash-strapped CIS countries. * Lowell Bezanis
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION FREES CAPTIVES; MOSCOW TALKS DELAYED. The Tajik
opposition on 18 December released 39 hostages captured in recent
fighting, RFE/RL reported. Those freed were described only as "high-
ranking" officials. The move was agreed at a meeting of Tajik President
Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri on 10-11
December. Talks between the two leaders in Moscow scheduled for 19
December have been pushed back a day as Nuri's departure was delayed by
an opposition meeting in Tehran on 18 December, according to Russian
sources. In a brief interview with Nezavisimaya gazeta on 19 December,
Rakhmonov said that a national reconciliation council must be set up
but-a stipulation of the original cease-fire agreement signed in Tehran
in 1994-but added: "It's not our fault the agreement has not been
realized." * Bruce Pannier
<p>
CORRECTION. In the Freedom House survey covered in the OMRI Daily Digest

UKRAINE TO REMOVE FUEL FROM CHORNOBYL SARCOPHAGUS. Ukrainian
Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety Minister Yurii Kostenko said
Ukraine will remove nuclear fuel from the concrete shell over the
damaged No. 4 reactor, Ukrainian TV and Western agencies reported on 18
December. The process could take 30-50 years, while the preparation for
it will require 10-15 years, according to Kostenko. In opting for the
fuel removal method, which will be financed by the West, Ukraine has
rejected French-British and Russian projects to reinforce the concrete
structure. The fuel must be removed to rule out the possibility of a
chain reaction inside the devastated reactor. Kostenko said Ukraine has
received only $185 million out of the $3.1 billion pledged by the G-7 to
fund the closure of the Chornobyl by the year 2000. He reiterated that
Ukraine will have to reopen the second block of Chornobyl, because the
only functioning reactor, No. 3, cannot meet national electricity needs
alone. * Oleg Varfolomeyev

SERBIAN OPPOSITION SUFFERS A SETBACK? The electoral commission in the
town of Smederevska Palanka on 18 December ruled that the governing
Socialists won the 17 November municipal elections, Nasa Borba reported
the following day. The commission's ruling comes after a court decision
recognizing a Zajedno victory in the town. A similar court ruling in
Serbia's second largest city of Nis which also recognized opposition
victories has not been contested by the local electoral commission, at
least for the moment. Meanwhile, at least 100,000 people marched in
Belgrade on 18 December, with some of the protesters walking past the
Russian Embassy to register their protest and anger at Moscow's support
for the regime. About 30,000 students tried to march to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's residence, but they were turned away by
police. * Stan Markotich
<p>
SERBIAN PRESIDENT STANDS FIRM. In the latest sign that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic is standing firm in his resolve to not recognize the
opposition's victories in the recent municipal elections, about 2,000
Milosevic loyalists demonstrated in the village of Sremska Mitrovica,
near Belgrade, to show support for the regime, RTS 1 reported. The
demonstrators, almost all elderly, showed their support for the
authorities by unfurling banners reading, "We love you, Slobo" or
"Slobo-Peace and Progress," and injunctions against opposition

19 December 1996 Monitor - Vol.II, No.237<br>
<p>
<p>
MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
<p>
IRAQI OIL BAD NEWS FOR MOSCOW? Analysts say that Iraq's recent<br>
"oil-for-food" deal with the UN, strongly backed by Russia, could actually<br>
undermine profits earned by Moscow from some of its own oil exports. Russian<br>
Urals crude oil is said to be similar to Iraq's Kirkuk blend, and the two<br>
were competitors in the Mediterranean before the imposition of sanctions.<br>
Baghdad's reemergence could cost Russia customers and force Moscow to<br>
rethink the way it markets its oil, analysts say. (Reuter, December 18)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN SPACE EFFORT DEPENDS ON FOREIGN MONEY. In 1996, foreign investments<br>
in the Russian space industry accounted for nearly 40 percent of all funds<br>
invested, and the general director of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev,<br>
said he expected $600 million in foreign money next year. He said that the<br>
industry would need 5.1 trillion rubles ($935 million) from the state just<br>
to operate at a "subsistence level." Without this support Russia would not<br>
be able to participate in international space projects. (Interfax, December=<br>
 18)<br>
<p>
WESTERN DONORS PLEDGE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINIAN REFORMS. International financial<br>
organizations and Western countries will provide $3.5 billion in 1997 to<br>
support Ukrainian economic reforms. Of this amount, $1.1 billion is to be<br>
granted by the IMF and $1 billion by the World Bank. The decision to provide<br>
the assistance was taken at a meeting of donor countries on December 17 in<br>
Washington, where tax reform and investment support projects put forward by<br>
the Ukrainian government were positively assessed. (Interfax, December 18)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>

<p>
MORE VIOLENCE IN CHECHNYA. In a sinister echo of the murder one day earlier<br>
of six Red Cross workers, six elderly Russian civilians were shot dead<br>
yesterday in two separate houses in the Chechen capital. The victims --<br>
three men and three women -- were all aged over 60. As with the Red Cross<br>
workers, no evidence of theft was found, fueling suspicion that the motive<br>
was political. (RTR, BBC, December 18)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, the bodies of the six Red Cross workers were flown from<br>
Chechnya to Switzerland. Traveling with them were 70 foreign nationals who<br>
had been working for the Red Cross in Chechnya. Virtually all international<br>
organizations have decided to pull out of Chechnya in the wake of the<br>
massacre. The exception was the Organization for Security and Cooperation in<br>
Europe, which announced its intention of staying. (RTR, December 18)<br>
<p>
RADUEV RELEASES HOSTAGES. At a checkpoint in Gerzel Raion on the border<br>
between Chechnya and Dagestan, meanwhile, a detachment of Chechen fighters<br>
under Salman Raduev yesterday released all 22 of the policemen that it had<br>
held hostage for the four preceding days. (Interfax, December 18) Raduev and<br>
Russian deputy security council secretary Boris Berezovsky had earlier<br>
signed a joint protocol ensuring that the hostages would be released without<br>
preconditions. But Magomet Tolboev, the secretary of Dagestan's Security<br>
Council, who also took part in the negotiations, has told the Monitor that<br>
one of Raduev's preconditions did make its way into the agreement.<br>
Berezovsky gave Raduev a guarantee that eleven of Raduev's fighters, who had<br>
been captured during the war, would be released from Russian prisons if the<br>
policemen were freed. Tolboev also told the Monitor that: "It was very<br>
important for Raduev not to lose face, and that is why he insisted on<br>
apologies from the Russian leadership. Our task boiled down to trying to get<br>
this done on a 'lower' level. In the end, it was agreed that the commander<br>
of the MVD detachment guarding the Dagestani-Chechen border would talk to<br>
Raduev. They met, and came to the conclusion that both of them were doing<br>
their duty as soldiers." Tolboev added that the talks had almost broken off<br>
because of provocations from the Russian military.=20<br>
<p>
On his return to Moscow, Berezovsky made an unexpected statement. He said<br>
that Raduev had been virtually forced to take the hostages. According to<br>
Berezovsky, when Raduev approached the Chechen-Dagestani border, Russian<br>
soldiers told him that he and his men must lay down their arms to cross the<br>
border. Raduev agreed to this condition, but Russian soldiers then tried to<br>
seize him. Berezovsky also said that there are forces, both in Chechnya and<br>
in Russia, who have an interest in disrupting the January elections, but he<br>
declined to say which of these forces were most active. Berezovsky also<br>
predicted that there would be more provocations in the future. (NTV,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
DELEGATION OF NORTH OSSETIANS SEIZED IN CHECHNYA. The welcome news that<br>
Raduev had released unharmed his 22 hostages was counterbalanced by fears<br>
for the safety of a delegation of high-ranking North Ossetian officials who<br>
were taken captive in northern Chechnya yesterday. The delegation included<br>
Schmidt Dzoblaev, the general secretary of the Assembly of<br>
National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of Russia, Georgi Dzhigkaev, an<br>
adviser to the president of North Ossetia, and Soslan Sikoev, the deputy<br>
minister of internal affairs and a deputy to the republic parliament. A<br>
ransom of $6 million is said to have been demanded for their release. (RTR,<br>
Interfax, Vesti, December 18) North Ossetian president Akhsarbek Galazov has<br>
appealed to Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Security Council<br>
secretary Ivan Rybkin to take all necessary measures to ascertain the<br>
delegation's whereabouts. (Interfax, December 18)=20<br>
<p>
RODIONOV DELIVERS A STERN MESSAGE TO NATO. If NATO defense ministers thought<br>
that Igor Rodionov's recent switch from uniform to mufti would soften the<br>
former general's views about NATO expansion, they were quickly disabused of<br>
that notion when the Russian defense minister met with them in Brussels<br>
yesterday. All of their carefully-crafted language about not deploying<br>
nuclear weapons on the territory of any new members and of building a<br>
"strong, stable and enduring security partnership" with Russia fell on deaf<br>
ears. Rodionov reiterated Russia's adamant opposition to the plan in terms<br>
that one NATO official described as "the language of the past." Rodionov<br>
warned that Russia would be forced to take unspecified retaliatory measures<br>
and hinted that these would include an end to Russian cooperation in arms<br>
control. At a press conference following the meeting, Rodionov pointed out<br>
that the admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia<br>
would increase NATO's military potential by as much as 20 percent and would<br>
wipe out the buffer zone between Russia and NATO.=20<br>
<p>
NATO had hoped that Rodionov would agree to establish permanent military<br>
liaison offices at NATO Headquarters in Brussels and at the two major NATO<br>
military commands: the European headquarters at Mons, Belgium, and the<br>
Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia. Rodionov discounted that idea,<br>
however, as being "premature." Russia does have a liaison officer at Mons<br>
because of its participation in the NATO-led Bosnian efforts.<br>
<p>
U.S. secretary of defense William Perry said after the meeting that it was<br>
clear there was "a broad and a deep perception in Russia that NATO expansion<br>
is a threat=85." He added that both NATO and the Russian government had to=<br>
 act<br>
to correct "this misperception." Other NATO officials suggested that<br>
Rodionov was really not the key player in the dialogue with NATO. In fact,<br>
the proposed Charter between the two parties is to be negotiated by<br>
Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian foreign minister Yevgeni<br>
Primakov. (Interfax, Reuters, RFE/RL, Xinhua, December 18)<br>
<p>
FBI AGENT CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR MOSCOW. The U.S. intelligence community<br>
suffered yet another shock yesterday when a 13-year veteran of the FBI was<br>
arrested on charges of selling secrets to Moscow. The arrest of Earl Edwin<br>
Pitts, who joined the agency in 1983 and was employed most recently at the<br>
FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia, came exactly one month after<br>
Harold Nicholson, a high ranking CIA officer, was also charged with spying<br>
for Russia. (See Monitor, November 19-21) One unnamed U.S. official said<br>
that he knew of no connection between the two cases. Other sources suggested<br>
that Pitts' activities may have constituted a greater intelligence breach<br>
than those perpetrated by Nicholson -- whose own damage to U.S. security has<br>
been described as considerable. U.S. law enforcement organs had suffered an<br>
additional embarrassment in November when pressure and threats of<br>
retaliation from Moscow compelled them to release a former Soviet spy who<br>
had been arrested at New York's JFK airport. (See Monitor, November 6, 14,=<br>
 18)=20<br>
<p>
U.S. officials yesterday indicated that Pitts, who is the second FBI agent<br>
ever to be arrested on espionage charges, had probably begun his illegal<br>
activities in the late 1980's when he was serving in a New York office of<br>
the FBI responsible for catching spies. In the early 1990's he became a<br>
supervisory agent at FBI headquarters. Reports varied on the question of<br>
whether Pitts had been moved in 1995 to the position in Quantico because he<br>
was under suspicion, or whether he had requested the transfer. (Reuter, AP,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
WHAT IS RUSSIA UP TO IN AJARIA? The office of Ajarian Supreme Soviet<br>
chairman Aslan Abashidze issued a special communiqu=E9 yesterday. It stated<br>
that the autonomous republic's internal affairs and "other law enforcement<br>
organs" (presumably meaning its KGB) have taken under their control the<br>
length of Ajaria's administrative border with the rest of Georgia, and are<br>
conducting "preventative exercises" in order to "stop armed groups wearing<br>
Georgian Internal Affairs Ministry uniforms from entering Abkhazia." The<br>
statement accused those groups of perpetrating acts of violence against<br>
local civilians along the administrative border, and charged that Tbilisi<br>
has ignored previous Abkhaz complaints on the issue. (Interfax, Itar-Tass,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
Issuance of the communiqu=E9 coincides precisely with the arrival of a=<br>
 Russian<br>
delegation allegedly representing Stavropol krai and headed by the commander<br>
of Russian border troops in the Caucasus (see Monitor, December 18). In a<br>
similar fashion, the arrival three weeks ago of a senior-level delegation<br>
from the command of the Russian Federal Border Service coincided exactly<br>
with the publication of an unprecedented statement by Abashidze that<br>
challenged Tbilisi's authority and demanded creation of a free economic zone<br>
in Ajaria's capital city of Batumi, where Russian border troops and other<br>
military facilities are based. In the interim between these two incidents,<br>
those Russian border troops in Batumi seized the Ukrainian ship Almaz and<br>
its crew, coordinating their action with Ajaria but not with Georgia. This<br>
series of actions raises the question of whether Ajaria is being nudged by<br>
Russia along the path of secession from Georgia.<br>

JOHN PAUL II AND KAREKIN I SIGN COMMON DECLARATION <br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY, DEC 13, 1996 (VIS) - His Holiness John Paul II, Bishop<br>
of Rome and Pope of the Catholic Church, and His Holiness Karekin I,<br>
Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of all Armenians, signed a Common<br>
declaration in the Vatican following their meeting this morning.<br>
Following are excerpts from the original English-language text:<br>
<p>
"Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I recognize the deep<br>
spiritual communion which already unites them and the bishops, clergy<br>
and lay faithful of their Churches ... (which) finds its roots in the<br>
common faith in the Holy and life-giving Trinity proclaimed by the<br>
Apostles and transmitted down the centuries. ... They rejoice in the<br>
fact that recent developments of ecumenical relations and theological<br>
discussions carried out in the spirit of Christian love and fellowship<br>
have dispelled many misunderstandings inherited from the controversies<br>
and dissensions of the past."<br>
<p>
"They particularly welcome the great advance that their Churches have<br>
registered in their common search for unity in Christ, the Word of God<br>
made flesh. Perfect God as to His divinity, perfect man as to His<br>
humanity, His divinity is united to His humanity in the Person of the<br>
Only-begotten Son of God, in a union which is real, perfect, without<br>
confusion, without alteration, without division, without any form of<br>
separation.<br>
<p>
"The reality of this common faith in Jesus Christ and in the same<br>
succession of apostolic ministry has at times been obscured or<br>
ignored. Linguistic, cultural and political factors have immensely<br>
contributed towards the theological divergences that have found<br>
expression in their terminology of formulating their doctrines. His<br>
Holiness John Paul II and His Holiness Karekin I have expressed their<br>
determined conviction that because of the fundamental common faith in<br>
God and in Jesus Christ, the controversies and unhappy divisions which<br>
sometimes have followed upon the divergent ways in expressing it, as a<br>
result of the present declaration, should not continue to influence<br>
the life and witness of the Church today."<br>
<p>
"The communion already existing between the two Churches and the hope<br>
for and commitment to recovery of full communion between them should<br>
become factors of motivation for further contact. ..."<br>
<p>
"Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Karekin I give their blessing and<br>
pastoral support to the further development of existing contacts and<br>
to new manifestations of that dialogue of charity ..."<br>
<p>
"Such a dialogue is particularly imperative in these present times<br>
when the Churches are faced with new challenges to their witness to<br>
the Gospel of Jesus Christ arising out of the rapidly changing<br>
situations in the modern world so deeply affected by an extreme<br>
secularistic and secularizing pace of life and culture." "They appeal<br>
to their clergy and laity to carry out more actively and effectively<br>
their full cooperation in all fields of diaconia, and to become agents<br>
of reconciliation, peace and justice, struggling for the true<br>
recognition of human rights and dedicating themselves to the support<br>
of all those who are suffering and are in spiritual and material need<br>
throughout the world.<br>
<p>
"John Paul II and Karekin I express a particular pastoral concern for<br>
the Armenian people, ...  those living in their historic motherland<br>
where freedom and independence were once more recovered ... those<br>
living in Nagorno Karabagh in need of permanent peace, and those who<br>
live in a state of world-wide diaspora. Amid upheavals and tragedies,<br>
especially during this century, these people have remained faithful to<br>
the apostolic faith, ... As they approach the seventeenth centenary of<br>
the official establishment of the Church in Armenia, may they receive<br>
the special blessings of the Triune God for peace with justice and for<br>
a renewed dedication to witnessing faithfully to the Lord Jesus<br>
Christ."  .../COMMON DECLARATION/KAREKIN I VIS 961213 (620)<br>

POPE WELCOMES "BELOVED BROTHERS" OF ARMENIAN CHURCH <br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY, DEC 13, 1996 (VIS) - Pope John Paul this morning<br>
welcomed Catholicos Karekin I, supreme patriarch of all Armenians, and<br>
those accompanying him, "in this house and this Church, for you are<br>
for us beloved brothers."<br>
<p>
"The deep communion which we feel at this moment has its source in our<br>
common faith in the one Lord, a faith sealed by the gift of baptism,"<br>
said the Pope. "By virtue of apostolic succession, which allows us to<br>
mutually recognize the validity of the ministerial priesthood and the<br>
episcopacy, our Churches celebrate the same sacraments. ... our<br>
Churches are consequently engaged in the same mission for the world of<br>
today."<br>
<p>
He pointed out that "the Armenian apostolic Church is the bearer of an<br>
incomparable richness of tradition, which goes back to the origins of<br>
our faith. The Armenian people were among the first to receive the<br>
Good News. ... She became a living Christian community, truly rooted<br>
in the local human reality and showing solidarity in the joys and<br>
sufferings of the entire people. Living in a tormented region, at a<br>
junction with different cultures and religions, and different<br>
political entities, the Armenian Church has known persecution."<br>
<p>
John Paul II remarked that "the Armenian Church today finds itself<br>
facing a new and immense task. The Catholic Church wishes to be at her<br>
side today." And he recalled the 1988 earthquake which struck Armenia,<br>
and the Catholic Church's assistance "in fraternal charity" to its<br>
victims.  "The needs of Christians in your land are many. We must<br>
study together how a closer collaboration might aid in the rebuilding<br>
of the Church and give assistance to the people of Armenia."<br>
<p>
The Pope then turned to ecumenism and, in words from his encyclical<br>
"Ut Unum Sint," he said: "The ecumenical path is both 'a dialogue of<br>
conversion' and 'an exchange of gifts'." He lauded the "pioneering"<br>
work of His Holiness Catholicos Karekin I in this field, recalling his<br>
activity as observer at Vatican Council II, his work in the World<br>
Council of Churches and also in the Council of Churches of the Middle<br>
East.<br>
<p>
Pope John Paul expressed delight at their meetings in recent days and<br>
voiced his hopes for a "continuing and more intense collaboration."<br>
"May our reconciliation and our union also open the way to peace and<br>
fraternal understanding among peoples, in a world which is still too<br>
often marked by injustice, scorn for the poor, the exasperation of an<br>
exacerbated nationalism or discrimination!"  AC/CATHOLICOS KAREKIN<br>

GREETINGS AND BLESSING OF CATHOLICOS KAREKIN I <br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY, DEC 12, 1996 (VIS) - The greeting in French and blessing<br>
in Armenian pronounced by Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of all<br>
Armenians Karekin I, and addressed to the Holy Father at yesterday's<br>
general audience, were made public in the afternoon.<br>
<p>
"I thank you from the bottom of my heart," said the catholicos to the<br>
Pope, "for words which are so sincere and full of Christian love for<br>
all peoples without distinction, including the Armenian people. Today<br>
I have heard many languages in this great hall, but I never felt like<br>
I was in the 'Tower of Babel' because it is the Christian faith which<br>
creates the unity in which we can understand one another and live<br>
together in the peace and love that our common Lord Jesus Christ gave<br>
us.<br>
<p>
"In the name of all the people of Armenia, recently declared an<br>
independent state," he went on, "of the people of Nagorno Karabakh and<br>
the people dispersed throughout the world, we pray the Lord to give<br>
you perfect and continued health for the well-being of all mankind and<br>
not only for the Roman Catholic Church."<br>
<p>
Catholicos Karekin I and the Armenians present at the audience sang<br>
the Our Father in Armenian, joining the Holy Father and faithful as<br>
they sang it in Latin.  He then gave a blessing in the same language.<br>

And yet another part (4):<br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY, DEC 11, 1996 (VIS) - "At the start of this meeting,"<br>
said the Pope at today's general audience, "I present to you with<br>
feelings of great joy our venerable and dear brother in Christ, His<br>
Holiness Karekin I, supreme catholicos of all Armenians, who these<br>
days is staying near me in the Vatican."<br>
<p>
He added that other "illustrious representatives" of this Church had<br>
accompanied Catholicos Karekin I, including the patriarchs of<br>
Jerusalem of the Armenians and of Constantinople of the Armenians, and<br>
other archbishops.<br>
<p>
The Holy Father pointed out that "from his faraway country, the<br>
catholicos has come on a pilgrimage to the Church of Rome, " a city<br>
"where he lived for a long time during Vatican Council II, in which he<br>
took part as an assiduous and attentive observer." John Paul II<br>
mentioned their previous meeting in Rome in 1983, their "fraternal<br>
correspondence during these long years," and the presence of Cardinal<br>
Edward Cassidy at the catholicos' enthronement in April 1995 when he<br>
was called to lead the Apostolic Armenian Church.<br>
<p>
"Led by the deep communion which already unites us," said the Pope,<br>
"Catholicos Karekin and I maintain the hope that the meetings and<br>
exchanges of these days will favor further steps towards full unity."<br>

Summary of results of Tansu Ciller=92s visit to Moscow<br>
<p>
Tansu Ciller=92s =93shuttle=94* diplomacy<br>
<p>
By Andrei Smirnov and Marina Sergeeva<br>
<p>
<p>
The visit of Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister, Tansu Ciller to Moscow<br>
confirmed once again that economic cooperation of two countries can develop<br>
successfully despite serious political contradictions. =20<br>
<p>
Political problems aggravating bilateral relations are well-known. Primarily<br>
they are Turkey=92s =93veto=94 on oil transit through Bosporus, attempts to<br>
establish =93special relations=94 with Turkic peoples of Russia and Ankara=<br>
=92s<br>
tacit support of Chechen separatists. Ankara is concerned with Russian<br>
military equipment supplies to Greek Cypriots.=20<br>
<p>
Tansu Ciller=92s conversation with Victor Chernomyrdin and Evgenii Primakov=<br>
 on<br>
political topics left the sides with their opinions. Primakov and Ciller did<br>
not even try to conceal political contradictions.  Moscow did not soften<br>
even by Ciller=92s =93promising=94 statement that Ankara will do everything=<br>
 in its<br>
power so that NATO expansion does not pose threats to Russia. Primakov only<br>
noted that Russia did not need mediators in the dialogue with NATO. However,<br>
the exchange of =93niceties=94 ended with assurances of the sides to adhere=<br>
 to<br>
the principle of territorial integrity of each other.  By the way, the fact<br>
that Ciller would offer Moscow assistance in dealing with NATO expansion<br>
your =FF correspondent was told by one of the leaders of PKK long before the<br>
visit. In his opinion Ciller would want Moscow to give assurances to stop<br>
the support of Kurds who are engaged in a guerrilla warfare with Turkish<br>
army.  In Moscow the sides signed a Memorandum on cooperation with<br>
terrorism. But that is only a non-binding declaration. Answering a question<br>
whether the Memorandum meant a ban on the activities of PKK in Russia,<br>
Primakov said, =93 I am not responsible for activities of that party.=94 One=<br>
 can<br>
only conclude that numerous Kurdish organizations in Russia (they even held<br>
a session of their parliament in exile in Moscow not long ago) have nothing<br>
to worry about.  Military equipment supplies to Greek Cypriots will, too,<br>
continue. In response to Ankara=92s grudge Russian Foreign Affairs Minister<br>
said that=20<br>
anti-aircraft means (Russia signed a contract with the Republic of Cyprus<br>
recently) are not offensive weapon types. =20<br>
<p>
Negotiations at Moscow mayor=92s office, Yurii Luzhkov were free from<br>
contradictions on Kurds and straits. The sides agreed to implement three<br>
large business projects: construction of a wholesale trading center, a hotel<br>
and business center in Novinskii Boulevard, and a wholesale food market. A<br>
memorandum on understanding of principles of trade-economic cooperation was<br>
signed by the government of Turkey and Moscow mayor=92s office.  The<br>
construction of a wholesale trade-center is virtually an attempt to take<br>
under control =93shuttle trade=94 without decreasing the volume of trade<br>
turnover with Turkey. In 1995 in Moscow alone Turkish goods worth $226<br>
million (the official turnover standing at $3.5 billion). But statistics<br>
does not take into consideration the real turnover: thanks to =93shuttle<br>
traders=94 the real turnover is estimated at $5-6 billion in Russia and the<br>
bulk of it is concentrated in Moscow.   Last summer Luzhkov did raise =93the<br>
shuttle=94 question after Russian government had adopted new taxes for these<br>
traders. The mayor did not like these taxes. Neither did the Turkish<br>
government. Luzhkov argued then that new taxes would result in a sharp<br>
increase of prices -- by 42% -- on goods from Turkey brought in by =93shuttl=<br>
e<br>
traders=94 from Russia and consequently would be a serious blow to Russians<br>
from less wealthy walks of life. This, however, did not happen.  =20<br>
<p>
By the way, the mayor who had broken his leg after a visit to circus greeted<br>
the Turkish lady without crutches and looked fresh. In appreciation of<br>
developing cooperation Luzhkov gave his Turkish guest a swan from Khokhloma<br>
and invited her to visit Moscow as often as she could. (end)=20<br>
<p>
(Translated by AM, *play on words, Russians use the word =93shuttle traders=<br>
=94<br>
to designate tourists who travel to Turkey to purchase goods there and to<br>
sell them in Russia and other CIS countries.)=20<br>

DATE=12/18/96<br>
TYPE=YEAREND REPORT<br>
NUMBER=5-35263<br>
TITLE=96:  CASPIAN OIL<br>
BYLINE=HASAN JAVADI<br>
DATELINE=WASHINGTON<br>
CONTENT=<br>
VOICED AT: <br>
<p>
INTRO:  THE CASPIAN SEA WITH ITS VAST OIL AND NATURAL GAS <br>
RESOURCES HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE A CONTESTING GROUND FOR <br>
WESTERN OIL COMPANIES.  IN WASHINGTON VOA'S HASAN JAVADI SURVEYS <br>
THE OIL DEALS AND DEVELOPMENTS BY THE CASPIAN LITTORAL STATES IN <br>
1996.<br>
<p>
TEXT:  SEVERAL DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN 1996 TO RESOLVE THE <br>
CONTESTED STATUS OF THE CASPIAN SEA WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  IRAN, <br>
RUSSIA AND TURKMENISTAN CONSIDER THE CASPIAN SEA AS A LAKE AND <br>
WANT TO SHARE ITS RESOURCES.  AZERBAIJAN AND KAZAKHSTAN REMAIN <br>
ADAMANT IN REGARDING IT AS A SEA WITH EACH STATE HAVING EXCLUSIVE<br>
COASTAL ZONES.<br>
<p>
PENDING A FINAL DEFINITION OF THE BODY OF WATER INVOLVED, THE  <br>
DEVELOPMENT OF CASPIAN OIL RESOURCES CONTINUED ON TWO FRONTS -- <br>
PIPELINE ROUTES AND OIL EXPLORATIONS. <br>
<p>
ONE NEWCOMER TO THE REGION IS JAPAN, SEEKING TO INVEST IN THE <br>
CASPIAN OIL AND GAS RESOURCES FOR EXPORT THROUGH THE BLACK SEA.  <br>
THIS HAS BEEN CALLED "THE CASPIAN DIRECTION" AND HUGE SUM OF  <br>
CAPITAL IS BEING INVESTED IN AZERBAIJAN, GEORGIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND <br>
TURKMENISTAN.  JAPANESE ITOCHU COMPANY IS INTERESTED IN BUILDING <br>
TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS IN THE REGION.  <br>
<p>
DAVID NISSMAN, A WASHINGTON-BASED OIL EXPERT, WATCHES THE AREA'S <br>
DEVELOPMENT.<br>
<p>
                        // NISSMAN ACT //<br>
<p>
         THIS POLICY WILL AFFECT  NOT  ONLY AZERBAIJAN, BUT <br>
         GEORGIA AS WELL.  AND (IT) HAS AFFECTED THE KAZAKH <br>
         DECISION TO TRY TO SHIP SOME OF THE TENGIZ (KAZAKHSTAN) <br>
         OIL OUT FROM BAKU (AZERBAIJAN) TO SUPSA (GEORGIA).  BUT,<br>
         NONETHELESS, IT MEANS THAT THE ENTIRE CAUCASUS HAS BEGUN<br>
         TO GAIN VISIBLE IMPORTANCE AS FAR AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY <br>
         IS CONCERNED.<br>
<p>
                          // END ACT //<br>
<p>
ANOTHER DEAL WAS SIGNED BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND GEORGIA IN <br>
NOVEMBER AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ACCORD CLEARED THE <br>
WAY FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM TO TRANSPORT OIL FROM THE <br>
CASPIAN SEA VIA A GEORGIAN PIPELINE TO THE PORT OF SUPSA AT THE <br>
BLACK SEA.  THE EXISTING PIPELINE NEEDS NEARLY 240 MILLION <br>
DOLLARS OF REPAIRS.<br>
<p>
STILL, THE BULK OF THE CASPIAN OIL WILL HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED <br>
THROUGH GROZNY, IN CHECHNYA, TO THE RUSSIAN PORT OF  NOVOROSSYISK<br>
ON THE BLACK SEA, THE NEWLY SIGNED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHECHENS<br>
AND RUSSIA IS VERY IMPORTANT SINCE THE FLOW OF OIL WILL DEPEND ON<br>
PEACE IN CHECHNYA. <br>
<p>
ON DECEMBER 6 AN INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM SIGNED AN AGREEMENT IN <br>
MOSCOW CLEARING THE WAY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A PIPELINE LINKING <br>
KAZAKHSTAN TO THE BLACK SEA.  UNDER THIS TWO-BILLION DOLLAR <br>
ACCORD, RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND OMAN WILL SHARE A 50 PERCENT STAKE<br>
IN THE DEAL.  EIGHT INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES WILL SPLIT THE <br>
REMAINING 50 PERCENT.  THE CHIEF BENEFICIARY IS EXPECTED TO BE <br>
CHEVRON (U.S. OIL COMPANY).<br>
<p>
THE PIPELINE IS EXPECTED TO TAKE THREE YEARS TO BUILD.  <br>
MEANWHILE, CHEVRON IS INCREASING PRODUCTION IN TENGIZ.  KAZAKSTAN<br>
ALSO SEEKS OTHER OIL EXPORT ROUTES.  LAST MAY, KAZAKHSTAN AND <br>
IRAN SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO EXCHANGE OIL CREDITS.  KAZAKHSTAN <br>
WILL DELIVER TWO MILLION TONS OF OIL TO IRAN ANNUALLY AT THE <br>
CASPIAN SEA, AND IRAN WILL DELIVER AN EQUAL AMOUNT TO BUYERS AT <br>
THE PERSIAN GULF.  <br>
<p>
BULENT ALIREZA OF THE STRATEGIC INSTITUTE OF WASHINGTON HAS <br>
WATCHED THE CENTRAL ASIAN OIL EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS.<br>
<p>
                      // OPT ALIREZA ACT //<br>
<p>
         ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY IT HAD ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF <br>
         PUTTING ITS OIL THROUGH IRAN, THERE IS A DISPENSATION <br>
         THAT IS GRANTED TO THAT END BY THE TREASURY.  CLEARLY, <br>
         CHEVRON HAS DECIDED  NOT  TO TAKE THIS UP, AND HAS <br>
         PREFERRED TO PUT IT THROUGH TRANS-CAUCASUS.<br>
<p>
                     // END ACT., END OPT //<br>
<p>
MR. ALIREZA SAYS KAZAKHSTAN IS ALSO TRYING TO EXPORT OIL THROUGH <br>
AZERBAIJAN.  EARLIER THIS YEAR ONE MILLION TONS OF CHEVRON OIL <br>
WAS SHIPPED FROM AKTAU, IN KAZAKHSTAN, TO BAKU, AND FROM THERE IT<br>
WAS SENT BY RAIL TO BATUMI.  <br>
<p>
BULENT ALIREZA SAYS HE EXPECTS THAT TO CONTINUE TO THE BENEFIT OF<br>
AZERBAIJAN.<br>
<p>
                        // ALIREZA ACT //<br>
<p>
         THAT IS THE HARBINGER OF MORE TO COME. THE MOST <br>
         SIGNIFICANT THING THAT I WOULD STRESS IS THAT AZERBAIJAN<br>
         NOT  ONLY IS GOING TO BE PUTTING ITS OIL INTO MARKETS, <br>
         BUT IN ADDITION IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE PLAYING A ROLE AS<br>
         A CONDUIT FOR KAZAKH OIL.  IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT <br>
         DEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE WE ARE NOW TALKING OF KAZAKH OIL <br>
         REACHING MARKETS THROUGH NON-RUSSIAN ROUTES, IN WHICH <br>
         AZERBAIJAN IS PLAYING A ROLE.<br>
<p>
                          // END ACT//<br>
<p>
ONE MORE SIGNIFICANT STEP IN DISPOSITION OF THE OIL INTO MARKET  <br>
WAS THE COMPLETION OF THE FIRST FLOATING DRILLING PLATFORM,  <br>
WHICH WAS TUGGED FROM BAKU INTO THE ACTUAL OILFIELD IN THE <br>
CASPIAN IN AUGUST, 1996.  THE THREE-STORY HIGH STRUCTURE WAS <br>
COMPLETED BY AZERBAIJAN INTERNATIONAL OPERATING COMPANY ( <br>
A-I-O-C). <br>
<p>
// OPT //  AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE FOUR CONSORTIA ON THE AZERI <br>
OIL.  THE MEGA PROJECT OF THREE OIL FIELDS OF CHIRAG, GUNESHLI <br>
AND AZERI, WHICH IS WITH A-I-O-C WITH EIGHT-POINT-TWO BILLION <br>
DOLLAR INVESTMENT.  IN THIS VENTURE THE AZERI STATE OIL CO <br>
(S-O-C-A-R) IS WORKING WITH BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP), STAT OIL, <br>
AMOCO, PENZOIL, UNOCAL, EXXON, AND THIS IS DUE TO PRODUCE OIL IN <br>
OCTOBER 1997.<br>
<p>
// OPT // THE OTHER TWO CONSORTIA WHOSE AGREEMENTS WERE <br>
FORMALIZED THIS YEAR ARE SHAH DENIZ WITH PARTICIPATION OF B-P, <br>
IRAN, TURKISH PETROLEUM AND S-O-C-A-R AND KARABAKH WHICH INVOLVES<br>
LUKOIL AND PENZOIL.  THESE CONSORTIA ARE FAR FROM PRODUCTION <br>
STAGE.  IN EARLY DECEMBER A FOURTH CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT (ASHRAFI <br>
AND DAN ULDUZU) WAS SIGNED BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN, AMOCO, UNOCAL AND <br>
ITOCHU COMPANY FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS.<br>
<p>
// OPT // TOTAL INVESTMENT IN THE FOUR CONSORTIA AMOUNTS TO <br>
12-AND-ONE-HALF BILLION DOLLARS.  AZERBAIJAN HAS SIGNED OTHER <br>
CONTRACTS WITH WESTERN COMPANIES TO ATTRACT ANOTHER 14 BILLION <br>
DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS DURING THE NEXT 15 YEARS. // END OPTIONAL <br>
//<br>
<p>
LOOKING AHEAD, IT SEEMS THAT CASPIAN OIL WILL BE TRANSPORTED  <br>
PARTLY THROUGH GROZNY AND PARTLY BY RAIL THROUGH GEORGIA.  THE <br>
OIL COMPANIES ARE COUNTING ON PEACE IN THE CAUCASUS -- THROUGH <br>
WHICH PIPELINES PASS.  (SIGNED) <br>

 "OUR NATIONAL-ECCLESIASTICAL TRADITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 An interview with Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan on the recent meeting <br>
 between Catholicos Karekin I and Pope John Paul II in the Vatican<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 ISTANBUL ("Lraper" 18 December 1996) -- Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, <br>
 Chairman of the Religious Council of the Armenian Patriarchate of <br>
 Constantinople, gave an interview to the Istanbul Armenian daily <br>
 newspaper "Jamanag" in which he elucidated the main points and <br>
 significance of the formal declaration issued recently in the Vatican <br>
 on the occasion of the meeting between Catholicos Karekin I of All <br>
 Armenians and Pope John Paul II. The interview, conducted by editor <br>
 Ara Kochunian, was first published in the 17 December issue of <br>
 "Jamanag".<br>
 <br>
 Q.  Your Eminence, you were part of the delegation of the Armenian<br>
 Apostolic Church, led by His Holiness Karekin I, that paid an <br>
 official visit to the Vatican where historic documents were signed. <br>
 Almost all the European news agencies reported that the signing of <br>
 these documents signaled the end of 1500 years of controversies <br>
 between the Chalcedonian churches and the Armenian Apostolic Church.  <br>
 It was even said that, from now on, we would celebrate Christmas on <br>
 the 25th of December. Could you please explain these things to us?<br>
 <br>
 A. Indeed, I witnessed a historic and a solemn peak [in the <br>
 relationship between our two Churches]. In recent years, I have met <br>
 His Holiness Pope John Paul II on six occasions (once for a private <br>
 visit and five times during ecumenical and inter-religious meetings). <br>
 However, this seventh meeting was different from all previous <br>
 encounters for several reasons.<br>
 <br>
 It is an historic and significant event when the successors of the<br>
 Apostles St. Peter and Sts. Bartholomew and Thaddeus embrace each <br>
 other. This is an important event for Christ's Apostolic Holy  <br>
 Church. This does not happen too often.  The last time the Pope of <br>
 the Roman Catholic Church and the Catholicos of All Armenians met was <br>
 26 years ago.<br>
 <br>
 It is significant that, at the threshold of the third millennium,  <br>
 the two pontiffs, through their own example, were providing a light <br>
 of inspiration to their followers and to all Christians, and were <br>
 affirming the fact that without the one the other would not be <br>
 complete.<br>
 <br>
 It was the first time in history that the Catholicos of All  <br>
 Armenians visited the Vatican in his capacity as the chief pastor of <br>
 an ancient people, who, at long last, have a free and independent <br>
 state. The Catholicos had come [to the Vatican] this time not to ask <br>
 for help, or to play diplomacy under the pressure of some hostile <br>
 state, but, inspired by the new age of independence, he had come to <br>
 his brother in Rome in an expression of fellowship and spiritual <br>
 togetherness.<br>
 <br>
 Q.  Your Eminence, is it true that the Armenian Church, putting  <br>
 aside the christological controversies, ended the 1500-year old <br>
 dispute, in order words, have the Armenian Apostolics become  <br>
 "Chalcedonian"?<br>
 <br>
 A.  No. The Catholicos of All Armenians, our two Patriarchs and the <br>
 nine archbishops [of whom the delegation consisted] are not able [to <br>
 decide] such an issue. In order to make such a historic decision, <br>
 certain commissions would have to be established to study the <br>
 dogmatic and theological aspects of the issue. The reports of the <br>
 commissions would then have to be studied by a series of episcopal  <br>
 conclaves and then they would be presented to the National <br>
 Ecclesiastical Assembly for final approval.<br>
 <br>
 Therefore, the Catholicos of All Armenians and the members of the<br>
 delegation have not accepted the decisions of the Council of  <br>
 Chalcedon  [A.D. 451].  Such a decision is beyond our power and <br>
 authority. We continue to follow the teachings of our Church Fathers, <br>
 that is, the living Orthodox Faith of our Church.<br>
 <br>
 Q.  What has changed then?<br>
 <br>
 A.  From a dogmatic point of view, nothing.  The two sides--without <br>
 making any changes in their theological terminologies or their modes <br>
 of explaining Christ's nature--formally accepted that, although they <br>
 use different formulae, each is as orthodox as the other, they <br>
 believe in the same Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is One, but at the same <br>
 time he is both perfect God and perfect Man. The two sides explain <br>
 this truth by using different formulae. Henceforth, the sides will no <br>
 longer criticize each other for being "diophysite" or "monophysite" <br>
 as it has been the case since 451 A.D.<br>
 <br>
 In this connection, we should remember Patriarch Malachia Ormanian of <br>
 Constantinople who always defended the view that all other churches <br>
 are obligated to accept the orthodoxy of the Armenian Apostolic <br>
 Orthodox Church, because, if we accept a Church as orthodox before <br>
 451 A.D., we cannot consider it heretical after 451 A.D. Our Church's <br>
 faith was formulated long before 451 A.D. This is what the Church of <br>
 Rome, through the signature of Pope John Paul II, formally <br>
 recognized.<br>
 <br>
 It is very clear in the joint statement--clearer than the statement <br>
 that was signed by Catholicos Vazken I and Pope Paul VI in 1970 -- <br>
 that both the Roman and the Armenian Churches have numerous common <br>
 teachings of faith.<br>
 <br>
 For example, they both believe in "Apostolic succession", that is,  <br>
 the episcopal form of Church government where the bishops in the  <br>
 Church are understood as the successors of the apostolic college of <br>
 Christ. Therefore, the two Churches formally recognize each other's <br>
 episcopal authority. For an Armenian, a Roman Catholic bishop is to <br>
 be respected as much as a bishop of the Armenian Church, and vice <br>
 versa.<br>
 <br>
 The pontiffs formally agreed that linguistic, cultural and  political<br>
 dynamics in the past caused serious misunderstandings, confrontations <br>
 and tragic divisions between the two Churches.  The two pontiffs, <br>
 humbly before God, expressed regrets for those confrontations and <br>
 promised to try to eradicate the ill feelings of the past, mutual <br>
 accusations, even hatred -- which have cast a shadow on true <br>
 brotherly relations between the faithful and religious leaders of the <br>
 two Churches -- from the thoughts and memories of their respective <br>
 followers.  Therefore, the signed document is not only a formal <br>
 communique about last week's summit, but has the appeal of an <br>
 Apostolic Letter, through which all members of the Church, both laity <br>
 and clergy, are called to a fuller reconciliation.<br>
 <br>
 Q.  Would the faithful be able to take Communion in sister Churches?<br>
 <br>
 A. Unfortunately not yet.  The declaration of the pontiffs clearly<br>
 affirms that there is unity between the two Churches, but it is not <br>
 full unity. In other words, Holy Communion is a sign of full unity or <br>
 agreement. Our Catholic brethren allow their faithful to take <br>
 Communion in the Armenian Church only when a Catholic Church does  <br>
 not exist in a given city or neighborhood.<br>
 <br>
 Reciprocally, the faithful of the Armenian Church could take <br>
 Communion in a Catholic Church only when there is no Armenian Church <br>
 in a given region. Of course, one could go to any Christian church <br>
 for prayers or pilgrimage, but on festive days or for regular Sunday <br>
 worship each faithful should attend the Divine Liturgy in the Church <br>
 of their rebirth by baptism.<br>
 <br>
 Q.  How about the date of Christmas?<br>
 <br>
 Not only the date of Christmas, but all our national-ecclesiastical<br>
 traditions remain unchanged.<br>
 <br>
 A.  How would you evaluate our relationship  with the Armenian <br>
 Catholic Church after the recent visit of the Catholicos to the <br>
 Vatican?<br>
 <br>
 During the consultations, our relationship with the Armenian  <br>
 Catholic Church was not on the agenda. However, His Holiness the <br>
 Pope, in his address, in one sentence, mentioned the Armenian <br>
 Catholic Church and the fact that it exists--that there is an <br>
 Armenian Catholic hierarchy in existence. In the future, when we <br>
 enter into fuller communion with the Church of Rome and when there<br>
 is fuller union between the Churches, we do not know where the <br>
 Armenian Catholic Church would fit. For now, there is such a Church, <br>
 which  is ethnically Armenian, but instead of the Catholicos of All <br>
 Armenians, its members have chosen the Bishop of Rome [as the Head of <br>
 their Church].  This is a choice based on their freedom of <br>
 conscience.  This is not a problem for us.  We have equal love and <br>
 respect for them, bearing in mind that we are two separate and <br>
 independent Churches.  This is a fact that remains true.  On the <br>
 other hand, one has to confess that if the Armenian Catholic Church <br>
 did not exist, as a development of a historical reality, it would be <br>
 much easier and faster to establish full communion and unity between <br>
 the Armenian and the Roman Catholic Churches.<br>
 <br>
 A.  Your Eminence, besides being the Chairman of the Religious <br>
 Council, you are also Patriarchal Vicar for Ecumenical Affairs. As <br>
 such, what are your concluding remarks?<br>
 <br>
 Since the late 1970s, I have found myself involved in ecumenical  <br>
 affairs. I believe not only in Christian unity, but also in the <br>
 brotherhood  of all humankind. Ever since my years in school, I have <br>
 had many opportunities to be closely associated with Catholics, <br>
 Orthodox, Anglicans, Protestants, Jews and Moslems. I have come to be <br>
 fond of them and have learned something from each one of them.<br>
 <br>
 I am extremely content with the visit of the Catholicos to the <br>
 Vatican and his meeting with the  Pope. May the Lord bless their <br>
 mutual proposals, and may He lead us all in  the path of peace and <br>
 brotherhood.<br>
          <br>

        GAZ SUPPLY TO GEORGIA AND ARMENIA CUT OFF<br>
<p>
 YEREVAN, DECEMBER 19, ARMENPRESS.<br>
 The pressure in the gaz pipes of the Republic of Armenia has dropped<br>
 significantly, yesterday morning. According to the Head of the<br>
 Armenian state concern "Haygazard" Roland Adonts, the gaz supply<br>
was<br>
 cut off by Turkmenistan near the Ossia-Georgia border. The reason is<br>
 the fact that Georgia has not paid its debts for gaz.<br>
 According to Mr. Adonts, Armenia has already paid its debt in money<br>
 for more than 1 blm cubic meters of gaz, which have entered the<br>
 country withing the last 11 months. There are some problems with<br>
 paying the commodity part of the debt, which will most likely be<br>
 settled by the end of this year.<br>

 joint-stock company to examine the situation and to restore the gaz<br>
 supply.<br>

<p>

 On December 17, the Armenian and Georgian delegations met near the<br>
 Armenian-Georgian-Azeri border in the Tavush province of Armenia.<br>
 The main issue discussed in the meeting was the Armenian-Georgian<br>
 border incident on December 14, where one Georgian was killed. Diring<br>
 the meeting the Georgian side tried to place the entire<br>
 responsibility fot the incident on the Armenian side.<br>
 The Armenian side carefully examined the situation and stated that<br>
 the responsible for the issue were the Georgian citizens, who<br>
 illegally crossed the border and found themselves within 35-40 meters<br>
 from the Armenian defense positions. These people did not obey any<br>
 warning orders of the Armenian border guards. Moreover, they were<br>
 armed.<br>

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
 <br>
 NAASR   (617) 489-1610<br>
 Blue Crane Books (617) 926-8585<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                 PROF. DADRIAN DETAILS GERMANY'S<br>
                 COMPLICITY IN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<br>
 <br>
 <br>
         Before a standing-room-only audience of nearly 300 at the First<br>
 Armenian Church in Belmont, Mass., Prof. Vahakn N. Dadrian, foremost<br>
 authority on the Armenian Genocide, delivered on the evening of December 5<br>
 a lecture on Germany's complicity in the Armenian Genocide-~the subject of<br>
 his latest book published by Blue Crane Books of Cambridge, Mass. This was<br>
 the first public lecture he has given on this aspect of his ongoing<br>
 research on the Armenian Genocide.<br>
         In a tightly woven discourse on the set of conditions which were<br>
 responsible for the involvement of a host of high-ranking German military<br>
 and civilian functionaries in the World War I tragedy of the Armenian<br>
 population of Turkey, Dr. Dadrian presented his case against the German<br>
 leadership of the time.<br>
         With his unique and captivating style of delivery, Dadrian first<br>
 dealt with the Turko-German relationship in its historical perspective,<br>
 followed by the ramifications of the World War I Turko-German political and<br>
 military alliance. He then focused on the actions and the actors of the<br>
 complicity at issue, the German alibis and cover-ups, and, finally, the<br>
 legal implications for amends and reparations from the standpoint of<br>
 national and international law.<br>
 <br>
         Multitude of Documents Cited<br>
 <br>
         He cited a multitude of German and Turkish documents, including<br>
 official reports, memoirs, signed deportation orders, and Turkish Military<br>
 Tribunal findings as collaborating evidence to complete the final picture<br>
 of Germany's direct and indirect involvement in the planning and execution<br>
 of the mass deportations and annihilation of the Armenian population of<br>
 Ottoman Turkey.<br>
         In detail after detail, Dr. Dadrian revealed the characters,<br>
 doctrines, and actions of major German military and civilian officials,<br>
 exposing the complicity of such figures as the two Chiefs of the Ottoman<br>
 General Staff at the Ottoman General Headquarters, Generals Fritz Bronsart<br>
 von Schellendorf and Hans Friedrich von Seekt, as well as Ambassador Hans<br>
 von Wangenheim, Chief of Railroad Services Lt. Colonel Boettrich, Marshal<br>
 Colmar von der Goltz, and even the Kaiser himself.<br>
 <br>
         Damning Indictment of the Germans<br>
 <br>
         Dr. Dadrian in his research into the German archives uncovered the<br>
 very close relations between German and Turkish officials and the cases<br>
 where German officers actually signed deportation orders for the Armenians.<br>
 One highly placed German, Max von Oppenheim, developed a plan for the<br>
 annihilation of the Armenians. Germans were even involved in the<br>
 establishment of the Special Organization units which actually carried out<br>
 the Genocide.<br>
         While his research leaves no doubt about a high level of German<br>
 complicity in the Genocide, Dadrian at the same time stressed that by no<br>
 means should a blanket denunciation be made of the Germans in the Ottoman<br>
 Empire. Many Germans vociferously condemned the atrocities they had<br>
 witnessed, risking their positions, their health, and even their lives, in<br>
 the process. These included one ambassador, Count Paul von Metternich,<br>
 several generals, and the longtime consul in Aleppo, Dr. Walter Rossler.<br>
 <br>
         Co-perpetrators and Accessories<br>
 <br>
         A central feature of German complicity is "the willingness of a<br>
 number of German officials, civilian and military, to aid and abet the<br>
 Turks in their drive to liquidate the Armenians," Dadrian stated. "They<br>
 qualify to be regarded as co-perpetrators and accessories to the crime."<br>
         Prof. Dadrian predicted that open-minded Germans would accept his<br>
 conclusions and demand justice "despite great pressure from politicians,"<br>
 who would argue that Germans have enough on their hands as a result of the<br>
 Nazi Holocaust without becoming concerned now about their responsibility in<br>
 the Armenian Genocide as well.<br>
         Dadrian, however, expressed confidence that Germany would<br>
 eventually accept the truth preserved in its own archives; and once Germany<br>
 officially recognizes its complicity in the Genocide, then Turkey will<br>
 remain totally isolated.<br>
         If Germany, Turkey's ally in World War I, accepts responsibility,<br>
 "this will then close all avenues of escape for Turkey" in that nation's<br>
 persistent and continued efforts to deny the Armenian Genocide, Dadrian<br>
 concluded.<br>
         Dadrian delivered his over-an-hour-long lecture without notes, as<br>
 has become his hallmark. He received a prolonged standing ovation from the<br>
 audience, who continued the evening with numerous questions and a long<br>
 queue to meet the author in person and have their books auto graphed.<br>
 <br>
         Unique and Varied Background<br>
 <br>
         Having studied mathematics, philosophy, international law, and<br>
 sociology in European and American universities, his varied background has<br>
 prepared him uniquely to undertake his research and writing about the<br>
 Armenian Genocide. After serving as Professor of Sociology at the State<br>
 University of New York for over 20 years, Dr. Dadrian is now devoting his<br>
 efforts full-time to his research on the Armenian Genocide and has been<br>
 director of a major Genocide Study Program sponsored by the H.F. Guggenheim<br>
 Foundation.<br>
         The evening was co-sponsored by Blue Crane Books, publisher of<br>
 Dadrian's most recent title, German Responsibility in the Armenian<br>
 Genocide: A Review of the Historical Evidence of German Complicity, and the<br>
 National Association for Armenian Studies and Research (NAASR).<br>
         The evenings program began with a brief commentary by Board<br>
 Chairman Manoog S. Young of NAASR on the implications and impact of<br>
 genocide in today's world and on the singular accomplishments by the guest<br>
 lecturer. Prof. Dadrian received special accolades from Rev. Vartan<br>
 Hartunian, pastor of First Armenian Church, who coupled his praise of<br>
 Dadrian's work with an appropriate quotation from Shakespeare's Hamlet. His<br>
 remarks were from a pastoral letter on the occasion of the publication of<br>
 Dadrian's book on Germany's complicity.<br>

 <br>
         Introducing the speaker, the publisher of Blue Crane Books, Ms.<br>
 Alvart Badalian, outlined the many academic achievements of Prof. Dadrian<br>
 in the U.S. and abroad, announcing that while German Responsibility has<br>
 gone to a second printing in less than six months of publication, Blue<br>
 Crane books has embarked on a forthcoming publication in 1997 of a new work<br>
 by the distinguished scholar, titled Warrant for Genocide: The Key Elements<br>
 of Turko-Armenian Conflict. She ended her presentation with an excerpt from<br>
 a moving letter to Prof. Dadrian by Father Sahag Jemjemian, Abbot of the<br>
 Mkhitarist Congregation in Venice, written in August 1996, only five weeks<br>
 before his unexpected passing. It reads:<br>
         "I wish to convey to you the thanks of the entire Armenian nation<br>
 for the singular and unprecedented work you are doing- -a work that<br>
 transcends the national boundaries and reaches to the international. The<br>
 Armenian nation today has but one and only one Vahakn Dadrian and everyone<br>
 is filled with gratitude toward you for the gigantic work you are<br>
 performing. It is the nation that is grateful to you and I join my<br>
 compatriots in intoning to you THOUSAND THANKS, dear Vahakn."<br>
 <br>
         Lectures in Europe and Canada<br>

         Prof. Dadrian has just returned from a five-week multi-language<br>
 lecture tour of Europe---his second tour in 1996---during which he was<br>
 invited to address the Italian Parliament on the subject of the recognition<br>
 of the Armenian Genocide. In 1995 he had lectured in the British House of<br>
 Commons on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.<br>

 University of Toronto and at the Armenian Community Center.<br>
