<H2>Executive Summary </H2> 
 
<P> 
With the signing of the Cartagena Declaration <A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#note1">(1)</A> 
by the Andean heads of state and President Bush, the &quot;war 
on drugs&quot; was directly tied to respect for human rights, 
particularly with regard to police and military anti-narcotics 
activities. As he assumed the obligations of the treaty, Alan 
Garcia, then-President of Peru (1985-1990), did not foresee the 
political and economic implications that the issue of human rights 
could have for Peru. In October 1990, the Peruvian government, 
under a new administration, announced its new anti-narcotics strategy. 
The so-called &quot;Fujimori Doctrine&quot; sought to establish 
a market economy in coca-growing regions, promote respect for 
human rights, and acknowledge the distinction between the coca 
leaf growers and the drug traffickers. As of May 1992, one month 
after President Fujimori's presidential coup,<A NAME="back2"> 
</A><A HREF="#note2">(2)</A> very few of the initiatives laid 
out in the Fujimori Doctrine had been carried out.

The three Peruvian governments which have had to confront the 
Shining Path insurgency since 1980 have faced an almost unavoidable 
dilemma: In regions like the Upper Huallaga Valley (UHV), these 
governments have had to carry out police operations against drug 
traffickers alongside the military's operations against two insurgencies, 
the Shining Path <EM>(Sendero Luminoso)</EM> and the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement <EM>(Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac Amaru,</EM> 
or MRTA). 
<P> 
The Huallaga region was placed under a state of emergency <A NAME="back3"></A><A 
HREF="#note3">(3)</A> 
in 1984 by then President Fernando Belaunde Terry (1980-1985). 
Since then, there have been many obstacles to both police and 
military operations. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>The forced eradication of coca fields by CORAH <A NAME="back4"></A><A 
HREF="#note4"><B>(4)</B></A> 
technicians supported by the police has led to constant abuses 
against tenant farmers, owners of the targeted coca fields and 
the local population. This has deepened the public's distrust 
and fears of state authority and the police forces, which has, 
in turn, strengthened the position of the Shining Path guerrillas.</STRONG> 
 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
On several occasions, eradication activities have been suspended 
when the military command deemed it necessary for security reasons. 
These decisions, in turn, have hampered the Peruvian police and 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) antinarcotics efforts. 
<P> 
The frequent divergences between the military and the police in 
the UHV have fueled allegations from the United States of corruption 
in Peru. On many occasions, the U.S. media has accused Peruvian 
military personnel of collaborating with drug traffickers, accusations 
which continue to date. The U.S. media and authorities, however, 
have not yet understood how the complex socio-political situation 
in the illicit coca-growing regions <A NAME="back5"></A><A HREF="#note5">(5)</A> 
fosters terrorist actions. Because of constant conflicts between 
the Peruvian police, the military, and government priorities in 
the region, the Peruvian government has issued a decree <A NAME="back6"></A><A 
HREF="#note6">(6)</A> 
which subordinates police actions related to combating both subversion 
and drug trafficking to the military command in the UHV region. 
The Peruvian government's priorities are clear: It is more important 
for the Peruvian government to defeat the Shining Path than it 
is to win the battle against the drug traffickers. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>In light of Peru's dismal 1991 record of anti-narcotics 
advances, a U.S. embassy official conceded in November of that 
year that: &quot;anti-narcotics operations undertaken with the 
support of the armed forces have led to the dispersion of laboratories 
and coca cultivation zones in the Upper Huallaga Valley.&quot;</STRONG> 
 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
These antinarcotics measures have not, in fact, eliminated the 
underlying causes of illegal coca production. Instead, they have 
fostered the proliferation of coca growing areas and the laboratories 
used to process the coca leaf into paste and eventually into cocaine.

<P> 
In the wake of many misunderstandings, the Peruvian and U.S. ambassadors 
finally signed a bilateral anti-drug agreement on May 14, 1991. 
In bold strokes, the treaty reiterates the basic tenets of the 
&quot;Fujimori Doctrine;&quot; however, it also lays out the priorities 
of the U.S. government. The treaty, for example, seeks to fulfill 
reforms in both the economic and state structures laid out in 
the Fujimori Doctrine, and it also calls for the involvement of 
the Peruvian military in the war on drugs. 
<P> 
On July 23, 1991 both governments endorsed two &quot;Letters of 
Agreement&quot; which specified the allocation of U.S. anti-narcotics 
assistance for Peru in 1991. A cursory glance at the allocation 
of these funds provides a clear understanding of the priorities 
set by both governments.<A NAME="back7"> </A><A HREF="#note7">(7)</A> 
The bulk of the economic aid is balance of payments support intended 
to facilitate the Peruvian government's efforts to balance the 
budget and meet international debt payments; these funds are not 
intended to support crop substitution or other programs that would 
directly benefit local farmers. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>Thus, proposals for crop substitution and rural development 
programs included in the Fujimori Doctrine have not received adequate 
funding and therefore cannot go forward. Development programs 
in the UHV have been allocated fewer than two million dollars, 
a relatively insignificant sum.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
According to the anti-narcotics accord, both countries committed 
themselves to set up a bilateral association within six months 
to undertake the measures laid out in the treaty. Nonetheless, 
after more than one year, the association has not been put into 
operation and therefore has not put into practice the policies 
set forth in the bilateral agreement. Moreover, the funding promised 
has not been delivered, clearly demonstrating a lack of will on 
the part of the authorities of both countries. 
<P> 
In July 1991, President Bush issued a determination that Peru 
met the human rights conditions necessary to receive U.S. anti-narcotics-related 
security assistance.<A NAME="back8"> </A><A HREF="#note8">(8)</A> 
In response, certain committees of the U.S. Congress suspended 
the 1991 anti-narcotics aid package earmarked for Peru. Congress 
continued to withhold the aid until President Fujimori announced 
a number of specific measures to be taken to improve Peru's human 
rights record, just before an official visit to the United States 
in September of that year. The U.S. Congressional Representatives 
and Senators involved finally lifted the freeze on the aid package, 
but reduced it by about $10 million and laid out additional conditions 
to be met for the aid to be delivered.<A NAME="back9"> </A><A HREF="#note9">(9)</A> 
Congress also stipulated that the aid be delivered in tranches 
corresponding to compliance with the additional conditions. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>However, even after the San Antonio Summit in February 
1992, only the first tranche of the 1991 aid package had been 
disbursed. The concerns of U.S. Congress members will continue 
until there are clearer signals on the part of the Peruvian government 
that its counterinsurgency policies will be tied to respect for 
human rights and that it will confront corruption within the institutions 
of the state.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Fujimori's recent break from constitutional rule has once again 
cast doubts over the continuation of bilateral cooperation in 
the war on drugs.

<H2><A NAME="corrupt">The Corruption Problem</A></H2>

<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
In early 1991, the Peruvian Chamber of Deputies set up a commission 
to investigate the use of goods seized from drug traffickers in 
recent years. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>After several months of investigation, the commission 
found serious irregularities and cases of corruption within government 
agencies.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
These included both the disappearance of impounded drugs and confiscated 
goods - including money, furniture, and jewelry - and the government's 
control over the movement of precursor chemicals (necessary for 
the production of cocaine). The corruption uncovered may be the 
result of a decade of law enforcement-oriented anti-narcotics 
operations, backed by the U.S. government, which prioritize eradication 
and interdiction over programs oriented towards socioeconomic 
development. Unfortunately, the suspension of the Peruvian Congress 
thwarted the presentation of the commission's final report. 
<P> 
Since the signing of the anti-drug agreement, law enforcement 
efforts have increased with the help of Tucano aircraft used to 
intercept planes suspected of carrying drugs. The Tucanos operate 
out of the Santa Lucia police base in the UHV. On April 10, 1992 
the Peruvian government issued orders regarding the functioning 
of civil aviation companies in coca-growing regions: It authorized 
Air Force personnel responsible for monitoring flights to shoot 
down those airplanes which fail to obey orders to land. In addition, 
the radar equipment in operation in Andoas and Iquitos (both in 
the jungle region) allowed for a more effective control of air 
space, until the equipment was withdrawn by the U.S. government 
in May. Despite these actions, the results achieved to date continue 
to be disheartening, as the price of coca is on the rise. 
<P> 
In Peru, the excesses of the police forces are compounded by the 
abuses committed by military personnel, the present corruption 
within the government agencies in charge of controlling airfields 
and highways, and by the insecurity caused by subversive groups. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>Not even the executive branch is free from allegations 
of corruption. One of Fujimori's closest advisers is former army 
captain Vladimiro Montesinos, who has worked as a defense lawyer 
for drug traffickers.</STRONG>

In June of 1991, President Fujimori requested that the Peruvian 
Congress give him the power to legislate on economic issues and 
to develop a comprehensive policy for combating both the insurgencies 
and drug trafficking.<A NAME="back10"> </A><A HREF="#note10">(10)</A> 
The 126 decrees which were subsequently issued in November of 
that year lay out the government's national &quot;pacification&quot; 
strategy. The approximately thirty decrees on the measures for 
confronting political violence essentially granted unlimited powers 
to the armed forces throughout the country and especially in the 
designated &quot;emergency zones.&quot; The strengthening of the 
Peruvian military at the expense of civilian sectors of society 
contradicts what was set forth in the &quot;Fujimori Doctrine.&quot; 
 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>Thus, while on the one hand the government claimed to 
want to develop alternative development programs in collaboration 
with the coca growers, on the other it sought to promulgate decrees 
which would limit even further the role of grassroots organizations 
in developing an effective strategy for confronting political 
violence.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Of the 126 legislative decrees, five were oriented towards anti-narcotics 
policies. The first decree declared money laundering illegal; 
the second established the crime of complicity to punish government 
officials implicated in aiding in the escape of captured drug 
traffickers. The latter decree also included the reduction of 
prison sentences for those who collaborate with judicial authorities. 
However, although this decree was presented as part of the drug 
trafficking package, it included a clause stipulating that sentence 
reductions could only apply to terrorism cases. Hence, accused 
drug traffickers - the majority of whom are small-scale dealers 
- were excluded from the incentive program. In sum, the government's 
proposed judicial reforms left much to be desired. 
<P> 
Apart from these revisions to the penal code, the government presented 
a law regarding alternative development programs in the coca growing 
regions.<A NAME="back11"> </A><A HREF="#note11">(11)</A> Reiterating 
previous proposals included in the Cartagena Accord, the president's 
own &quot;Fujimori Doctrine,&quot; and even the bilateral agreements 
signed with the United States, the law designates &quot;Special 
Zones for Alternative Development&quot; <EM>(Zonas Especiales 
de Desarrollo Alternativo,</EM> or ZEDAS) where the new strategy 
is to be implemented. It also creates the Institute for Alternative 
Development <EM>(Instituto de Desarrollo Alternativo,</EM> or 
IDEA), the organization with responsibility for overseeing the 
implementation of alternative development programs. This decree 
was presented within the context of the government's new agrarian 
policy which provides incentives for private investment in the 
agricultural sector, eliminates barriers in real estate exchange, 
and essentially breaks from the main tenets of the 1969 Agrarian 
Reform - primarily the longstanding ban on large landed estates. 
<P> 
In the end, Peru's Congress struck down and/or modified the decrees 
related to judicial reforms, but maintained the alternative development 
law. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>The Fujimori government, however, has failed to distribute 
land titles to coca growers as proposed in the alternative development 
law. Moreover, it has failed to address the fundamental cause 
of underdevelopment in the region: domestic and international 
markets for the country's agro-industry.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
On November 26, 1991, Peru ratified the Vienna Convention <A NAME="back12"></A><A 
HREF="#note12">(12)</A> 
on drug trafficking and incorporated it into national law. <A NAME="back13"></A><A 
HREF="#note13">(13)</A> 
Peru's ratification of the Convention, however, came with a reservation 
which clarified the distinction between legal and illegal coca 
production by differentiating between the production and use of 
coca leaves for traditional purposes (primarily chewing coca leaves) 
prevalent in the highlands and the production and use of coca 
for cocaine production. Nevertheless, Peru's new obligations under 
the convention necessitate that the government modify numerous 
laws related to coca production. 
<P> 
Specifically, the Peruvian government will have to make decisions 
regarding the country's legal coca growing industry, whose producers 
are represented in the Provincial Federation of Convencion, Yanatile 
y Lares <EM>(Federacion Provincial de la Convencion, Yanatile 
y Lares,</EM> or FEPACYL). 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>According to the new penal code adopted by the Peruvian 
government in January 1991, coca production is not a criminal 
activity, although it is classified as such in the Vienna Convention. 
The contradictions between the existing laws and those mandated 
by the Vienna Convention are unresolved.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Also unresolved is the status of the formation of an official 
institution to administer the legal coca market. Despite the president's 
insistence on dialogue with coca growers, he has not followed 
through with one of the key outcomes of that dialogue: The formation 
of a National Coca Institute which would support the legal coca 
market. Because of these contradictions, many coca growers are 
reluctant to sign crop substitution agreements with the government. 
The law on alternative development stipulates that individuals 
who do not comply with the terms of written agreements - i.e., 
do not eradicate all coca - can be prosecuted and imprisoned, 
despite the fact that the act of growing coca itself is not illegal. 
<P> 
In the days prior to the April 5th presidential coup, the Fujimori 
government attempted to discredit the Congress, and hence justify 
the need to break from constitutional rule, by calling attention 
to the lack of progress in bringing drug traffickers to trial. 
Following the coup, Fujimori reinstated the decrees rejected by 
Congress related to money laundering and complicity with drug 
traffickers and on April 10 he gave the Air Force control of all 
airports and landing strips. It is under these conditions that 
two Peruvian airplanes shot at and grounded the U.S. Hercules 
C-130 airplane which, according to U.S. officials, was on an approved 
anti-narcotics mission in the UHV. This incident has further strained 
U.S.-Peruvian anti-narcotics cooperation; however, the fact that 
there have been few political repercussions indicates that neither 
country wanted to focus too much attention on the incident.

<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
In response to the government's offer of a dialogue on the coca 
issue, some peasant organizations from the Huanuco and San Martin 
departments (the latter includes the UHV) initially accepted the 
government's proposal to create a new relationship between the 
state and the farmer. The decriminalization of coca production 
in the January 1991 penal code <A NAME="back14"></A><A HREF="#note14">(14)</A>, 
referred to above, was well received by these groups and facilitated 
the dialogue process. Likewise, the dialogue emphasized some common 
interests shared by the government and some of the UHV peasant 
organizations. Through a ministerial resolution, <A NAME="back15"></A><A 
HREF="#note15">(15)</A> 
the government officially recognized as &quot;valid interlocutors&quot; 
almost 160 organizations of coca growers. In August 1991, the 
Executive Director of the United Nations Drug Control Program 
(UNDCP), Giorgio Giacomelli, visited Peru to evaluate both the 
United Nations' development projects in the region and the possibility 
of the UNDCP monitoring compliance with the agreements signed 
between the coca producers and the government. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>The situation in Peru has worsened over the past months. 
The Fujimori government has refused to modify its economic structural 
adjustment policies, which favor the importation of agricultural 
products subsidized abroad at the expense of agricultural production 
in the UHV. In addition, it has virtually closed down government 
institutions which fund agricultural development </STRONG><EM><B>(bancas 
de fomento agricola),</B></EM><STRONG> cutting the flow of funds 
needed to finance agricultural campaigns.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
The Fujimori government has also established an agrarian policy 
<A NAME="back16"></A><A HREF="#note16">(16)</A> which, by lifting 
the ban on large estate holdings and deregulating the sale of 
lands, effectively breaks with the principles of the 1969 Agrarian 
Reform and the 1979 Constitution in which the reforms are laid 
out. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>In the area of alternative development, the government 
has not taken a single step forward; it has not even created the 
Institute for Alternative Development.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
In light of these facts, the farmers of the UHV feel that the 
government's decisions regarding drug policy have been made behind 
their backs, despite the agreements signed with the coca growers 
organizations. Since 1991, a fungus which attacks the stems of 
coca plants has appeared, threatening the livelihood of the coca 
growers. This fungus, called <EM>&quot;fusarium oxysporum,&quot;</EM> 
has also attacked other crops. According to local farmers, the 
fungus is not only prevalent in the UHV region, but has spread 
to the distant region of La Convencion, where most of Peru's legal 
coca is grown, in the Cusco department in the southern part of 
the country. Peasants have given testimony that helicopters carrying 
DEA agents and the Peruvian police have been spotted dropping 
pellets containing the fungus onto coca fields; however, there 
is no other solid evidence to support these allegations. This 
fungus appears to be the principal threat to the coca plant. Its 
broader impact on the local environment is not yet clear. It is, 
moreover, not too likely that the fungus will be a significant 
factor in the eradication of illegal crops: There are now poppy 
plantations providing the raw material for the international heroin 
market in the Amazon department and in the Biabo Valley in San 
Martin. 
<P> 
In the meantime, the predicament of the FEPACYL farmers in the 
Cusco region has yet to be resolved. In November 1991, the government 
decreed <A NAME="back17"></A><A HREF="#note17">(17)</A> the cultivation 
and marketing of legal coca crops to be under a state of emergency, 
thereby further extending the government's control over the coca 
industry. Apparently, this was done to enhance the progress of 
the ongoing negotiations with the United States. Another reason 
for this legislative decree was to prevent the transfer of the 
National Coca Company <EM>(Empresa Nacional de Coca, S.A.,</EM> 
or ENACO) from the national government's jurisdiction to regional 
government control. The government's deadline for submitting a 
report on the future of legal coca production and ENACO was not 
met.

<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
On the 26th and 27th of February 1992, the second anti-drug summit 
- designed to address the drug issue within the context of the 
Andean Initiative launched by President Bush in 1989 - took place 
in San Antonio, Texas. The Andean participants in the Cartagena 
Summit were present in San Antonio, as well as Ecuador, Mexico, 
and Venezuela, which are primarily transit countries for drugs 
en route to the United States. Prior to the San Antonio Summit, 
representatives of each country met in Quito to draft the joint 
document to be signed in Texas. In this preliminary session, no 
agreement was reached on either the sweeping U.S. proposals for 
drug interdiction or the Colombian government's proposal to eliminate 
drug trafficking by the year 2010; nor was President Bush forthcoming 
with an economic aid package for the implementation of crop substitution 
and alternative rural development projects. Finally, the critical 
opinions voiced by President Fujimori in San Antonio regarding 
corruption and bilateral cooperation found echo in the other Andean 
delegations, which generally agreed with his viewpoints. 
<P> 
On January 28, weeks before the San Antonio Summit, Hernando De 
Soto, Fujimori's primary adviser on the drug issue, submitted 
his letter of resignation, citing his disagreement with the government's 
implementation of economic reforms and antinarcotics policies. 
De Soto hurled serious accusations against the Peruvian government, 
including inaction, corruption, and even of the murder of Walter 
Tocas, a leader of one of the coca growers' organizations. As 
things stand, the future looks bleak, both for the U.S. government's 
objectives in the drug war and for the Andean countries efforts 
to solve their deep-rooted economic problems. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>In this election year in the United States, the San Antonio 
Summit highlighted the fact that few advances have been made in 
the effort to control international drug trafficking, while at 
the same time the socioeconomic situation continues to deteriorate 
for those living in countries where the raw materials for cocaine 
and heroin are grown.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
The failure of the U.S. government's &quot;Andean Initiative&quot; 
is clear, as is the lack of political will on the part of Andean 
governments to come to a realistic understanding of the problem. 
Thus, the first reactions to the summit noted the lack of progress 
in resolving the political disputes between the countries involved 
in the war on drugs.

The unconstitutional actions taken by President Fujimori on April 
5th have failed to improve the negative image of Peru's efforts 
to carry out the war on drugs. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>Although Fujimori claimed that the inefficiency of Congress 
and the judiciary in approving his national pacification and drug 
control laws lay at the root of the coup, the truth is that since 
April 5 there has been little advancement on the antinarcotics 
front in Peru.</STRONG> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
On the contrary, within a short period of time, a series of obstacles 
has once again threatened U.S.-Peruvian bilateral relations. First, 
the United States suspended aid because of the presidential coup; 
then, Peru clashed with the U.S. over the Hercules airplane incident. 
In recent weeks, the Peruvian press has speculated about the potential 
withdrawal of U.S. DEA agents due to the ongoing conflicts between 
the Peruvian military and police which reflect the competing priorities 
of simultaneously combating the Shining Path and drug traffickers.<A NAME="back18"> 
</A><A HREF="#note18">(18)</A> Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court 
decision affirming the legality of U.S. agents kidnapping accused 
criminals abroad for prosecution in the United States further 
darkens prospects for the future of bilateral relations. 
<P> 
Within this context, it is difficult to believe that Peru can 
achieve any better results in its fight against drug trafficking 
than it has in recent years. As long as the words and intentions 
of Peru's de facto president continue to be held suspect by the 
international community, Peru's increasing isolation in the hemisphere 
will continue. Fujimori's inability to follow a clear path to 
return to democratic rule only serves to further aggravate this 
situation. Moreover, the recent bloody offensive by the Shining 
Path is a direct result of the break with constitutional rule 
on April 5, 1992. One of the tragic results of the presidential 
coup may be that Fujimori's unconstitutional actions play directly 
into the hands of both drug traffickers and the Shining Path.

<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
<STRONG>The U.S. continues to face serious problems of drug abuse 
and drug-related violence for which there are no quick or easy 
solutions. However, the administration's &quot;Andean strategy,&quot; 
which targets the cocaine supply coming from source countries, 
is not working. And overwhelming evidence exists that it cannot 
succeed.</STRONG> 
<P> 
Furthermore, in pursuing this strategy, the U.S. has trained and 
equipped forces engaged in widespread, egregious violations of 
human rights, strengthened militaries at the expense of fragile 
civilian rule, and threatened to spark armed resistance in Bolivia 
and fuel guerrilla movements in Peru. If the military component 
of the Andean strategy proceeds as planned, it is likely to have 
more serious negative consequences on human rights, democratization, 
and internal stability in the Andean region. 
<P> 
U.S. problems of drug use must ultimately be solved at home. The 
U.S. should redirect funding to reduce the demand for drugs in 
the U.S., and to meet development needs and offer debt relief 
in the region. 
<P> 
Such a shift in resources would use antinarcotics monies more 
effectively and would facilitate a more balanced foreign policy 
toward the Andes - one in which U.S. interests in human rights 
and democratization are not sacrificed to an unworkable source-country 
drug policy. 
<HR> 
 
<H2><A NAME="item2">I. THE ANDEAN STRATEGY </A></H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The &quot;Andean strategy&quot; is the centerpiece of the administration's 
international drug policy. Announced in September 1989, the strategy 
is part of an overall effort to reduce cocaine supply in the U.S. 
by 60% by 1999, and includes eradication, low-level interdiction 
at the processing and trafficking stages, and efforts targeting 
high-level cartel leaders. Although the strategy proposes significant 
amounts of economic assistance as part of the five-year, $2.2 
billion &quot;Andean Initiative&quot;, it marks a sharp shift 
toward militarization: 
<OL> 
<LI><U>For the first time, U.S. antinarcotics policy views Andean 
militaries as essential to source-country efforts</U>. U.S. military 
officials admit that the strategy endorses an internal security 
mission for Andean militaries which is denied the U.S. military 
under law because it would jeopardize U.S. democracy. 
<LI><U>The Andean strategy calls for a dramatic increase in U.S. 
military involvement in source-countries</U>. Coincident with 
the announcement of the Andean strategy, Secretary of Defense 
Cheney upgraded the counternarcotics mission to a &quot;high priority 
national security mission&quot; for the Pentagon. He directed 
key commands, including the U.S. Southern Command (SouthCom) with 
responsibility for Central and South America, to draw up antinarcotics 
plans. 
<LI><U>Under the Andean strategy, economic and military aid are 
conditioned on host-country &quot;performance,&quot; including 
involvement of Andean militaries in the drug war</U>. Although 
Congress has mandated significant economic assistance, the Andean 
Initiative called for only military aid for FY1990. In practice 
the administration has withheld economic and military assistance 
pending each Andean government's assent to military participation 
in drug enforcement. 
</OL> 
 
<HR> 
 
<H2><a name="item3">II. IMPLEMENTING THE ANDEAN STRATEGY: THE FIRST YEAR-AND-A- 
HALF</a> 
</H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
Three tendencies marked the first year-and-a-half of the Andean 
strategy: (1) the expansion of the U.S. military role, (2) the 
formal agreement of all three Andean governments to military participation 
in the drug war, (3) a sharp increase in security assistance following 
bilateral accords. 
<H3>1. Expansion of the U.S. Military Role </H3> 
 
<P> 
As planned, in the first year-and-a-half of the Andean Strategy, 
the U.S. military's role in the drug war has expanded dramatically: 
<UL> 
<LI>In 1990 SouthCom's then-commander, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, ordered 
his commanders to make the anti-drug mission their &quot;number 
one priority,&quot; and drugs remains the command's top priority. 
<LI>While the direct U.S. troop presence in the Andes is only 
a few hundred, (the number is classified), this presence reportedly 
rose through 1990 and early 1991. With the recent U.S.-Peru bilateral 
accord, U.S. troop levels in that country are likely to rise over 
the next year. 
<LI>SouthCom's anti-drug budget rose from $230 million in FY1990 
to over $430 in FY1991. 
<LI>The Persian Gulf War had little effect on training and security 
assistance activities &quot;on the ground&quot; in the Andes. 
The Pentagon diverted some of its most sophisticated equipment 
to the Gulf, including AWACS planes and some in-country radar, 
which had been used mainly for air and sea interdiction. 
</UL> 
 
<H3>2. Formal Agreement from Andean Governments </H3> 
 
<P> 
Since late 1989, all three Andean governments have formally agreed 
to an expanded military role in the drug war. 
<P> 
<STRONG>PERU:</STRONG> After almost a year of negotiations, the 
Fujimori government signed a bilateral anti-drug accord with the 
United States in May 1991. In the accord, the two governments 
agreed to sign three annexes governing military, police, and economic 
assistance by the end of 1991. The U.S. proposal for the military 
annex includes the training of six strike battalions and the refurbishing 
of twenty A-37 airplanes. 
<P> 
<STRONG>BOLIVIA:</STRONG> Under intense U.S. pressure, the government 
signed an accord in May 1990 agreeing to expand military participation 
in the drug war. Since then the air force and navy participation 
in narcotics-support roles increased. However, the Paz Zamora 
government delayed inclusion of the army in antinarcotics operations 
for almost a year. In April 1991, the first of 112 Green Berets 
arrived in Bolivia to begin training the army. 
<P> 
<STRONG>COLOMBIA:</STRONG> In 1989 the Colombian government agreed 
to a greater role for its armed forces in antinarcotics, and since 
then the U.S. has provided antinarcotics advice and training to 
the armed forces and the police. 
<H3>3. Military and Economic Assistance </H3> 
 
<UL> 
<LI>Following the bilateral accords, U.S. military assistance 
to the Andean nations shot up. Economic assistance, which has 
also increased, consists overwhelmingly of balance of payments 
support, not assistance for development projects. 
<LI>Military assistance, including drawdown equipment, to Colombia 
and Bolivia jumped from less than $5 million in FY1988 to over 
$140 million in FY1990. Military aid to these two countries exceeded 
that to all of Central America in FY1990. Over $141 million was 
requested in military assistance for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru 
for FY1992. 
<LI>Over $313 million was requested in economic aid for the three 
Andean countries in FY1992. However, 88% of that aid will be economic 
support funds (ESF), of which more than 85% will be for balance 
of payments support, rather than development projects. 
<LI>The administration has requested only $22.5 million for Bolivia 
and $15.7 million for Peru in development assistance for FY1992, 
a decrease from FY1990 levels for both countries. 
</UL> 
 
<HR> 
 
<H2><A NAME="item4">III. WILL THE ANDEAN STRATEGY WORK?</A> </H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<H3>A. Results to Date </H3> 
 
<P> 
Thus far, the Andean Strategy has failed to achieve its goals. 
While cocaine use in the United States appears to have declined 
in 1990, indications are that supply has increased. The administration's 
main supply-side goals are to reduce cocaine supply by 60% within 
10 years, and by 15% within two years. Since those goals were 
set in 1989, DEA agents report that production in South America 
<EM>increased</EM> in 1990 by <EM>28%</EM>. Recently revised statistics 
of the State Department indicate that net coca leaf production 
in the Andean region - where U.S. efforts have been overwhelmingly 
focused - actually increased last year. According to those same 
figures, eradication efforts in 1990 destroyed only 4% of total 
production in the Andes, and <I>none </I>in the world's largest 
producer, Peru. 
<H3>B. An Unworkable Strategy </H3> 
 
<P> 
Substantial evidence has been presented by Congressional and other 
sources that the Andean strategy cannot succeed because it ignores 
two fundamental realities in the region. <STRONG>First, Andean 
governments do not have the political will to pursue the drug 
war.</STRONG> They have shown disinterest or outright opposition 
to the military thrust of the Andean strategy. Corruption is rampant 
within Andean governmental forces, and counterinsurgency is the 
top priority for the Colombian and Peruvian militaries. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Second, the Andean strategy ignores the market logic of 
the cocaine trade.</STRONG> In what's known as the &quot;balloon 
effect,&quot; squeezing production and trafficking in one place 
simply forces operations to shift elsewhere. And even successful 
repression of supply would have little effect on the ultimate 
price, and thus the demand, of cocaine on U.S. streets. 
<H4>Lack of Political Will </H4> 
 
<P> 
Despite having reached bilateral and multilateral accords with 
the United States, Andean governments have generally opposed the 
military thrust of the Andean strategy. One member of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, based on a meeting with the ambassadors 
of all three countries, reported that, &quot;the governments of 
these countries have asked the United States not to provide this 
level of military assistance.&quot; 
<P> 
<STRONG>PERU:</STRONG> In negotiating the bilateral accord, Peruvian 
officials had resisted the U.S. proposal, which its ambassador 
termed a &quot;military solution,&quot; favoring more socio-economic 
assistance for alternative crop development. However, U.S. law 
requires the U.S. to vote against any multilateral loans to Peru 
in international financial institutions if the government is not 
cooperating with the U.S. anti-drug efforts. The &quot;stick&quot; 
of legal sanctions and the &quot;carrot&quot; of desperately-needed 
foreign aid led President Fujimori to accept the military component 
in May 1991. 
<P> 
<STRONG>BOLIVIA: </STRONG>As in Peru, the Paz Zamora administration 
has resisted army involvement in antinarcotics. Even after the 
May 1990 accord, the Paz Zamora government delayed inclusion of 
the army in antinarcotics operations for almost a year. When U.S. 
training of the army began in April 1991 after a year-long delay, 
protests erupted from labor groups, opposition parties, and the 
Catholic church. 
<P> 
<STRONG>COLOMBIA: </STRONG>Current events are likely to strain 
Colombia's cooperation with U.S. anti-drug efforts. Colombia has 
never actively sought military aid, and has offered to forego 
<I>all</I> foreign assistance in exchange for trade benefits. 
In late 1990, President Gaviria offered not to extradite and to 
reduce sentences for drug traffickers who turned themselves in 
and confessed to one drug-related crime. In addition, the Constituent 
Assembly, meeting from February to July 1991, is likely to ban 
extradition. Privately U.S. officials acknowledge that these developments 
are a big blow to the administration's antinarcotics strategy. 
<H4>Corruption </H4> 
 
<P> 
Corruption is rampant within Andean military and security forces. 
Andean officials retain working alliances with drug traffickers 
in all three countries, largely because of the unrivaled rewards 
offered by traffickers. 
<UL> 
<LI>SouthCom's Special Forces commander stated in February 1991 
that there is &quot;unbelievable corruption&quot; among Peruvian 
state forces, and that &quot;we know as a fact that the Army gets 
payments for letting traffickers use airstrips.&quot; 
<LI>In two separate incidents during the second week of March 
1990, Peruvian military personnel fired upon police units traveling 
in U.S.-owned helicopters. 
<LI>In late 1989, the office of Colombia's Attorney General was 
investigating 4,200 cases of corruption by police and some 1,700 
involving the armed forces. 
<LI>According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Colombian law enforcement 
officials confirmed in May 1991 that the three Ochoa brothers, 
who surrendered under the government policy of immunity from extradition 
to the United States and reduced prison sentences, continue to 
run &quot;one of the largest narcotics networks in Latin America 
from a special prison...outside Medellin.&quot; 
<LI>In March 1991, the Minister of the Interior and the recently-appointed 
head of Bolivia's anti-drug police resigned amid charges that 
they were involved in drug trafficking. The latter had been appointed 
by President Paz Zamora despite his well-known service in the 
cocaine-trafficking Garcia Meza military regime of the early 1980s. 
<LI>In April 1991, the Bolivian government announced that due 
to alleged corruption it would completely reorganize the &quot;UMOPAR&quot; 
antinarcotics police, replacing many of the officers. This unit 
has been the <I>main recipient</I> of U.S. training in the Andes, 
and the recent action signals the failure of four years of U.S. 
Special Forces training. 
</UL> 
 
<H4>Conflicting Military Priorities </H4> 
 
<P> 
Both the armed forces and the police of the Andean region have 
long opposed an expanded military role in antinarcotics activities. 
Although the militaries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia welcome 
U.S. security assistance, any antinarcotics aid will undoubtedly 
be used for other missions of higher priority for the Andean armed 
forces. Counterinsurgency, viewed by Andean militaries as independent 
of the drug war, is chief among these other missions.<BR> 
In <U>Peru</U>, where the Bush administration openly advocates 
using antinarcotics assistance for counterinsurgency efforts against 
the Shining Path, the military has been hostile to the anti-drug 
mission, impeding police operations in areas under their control. 
As then-commander of the Upper Huallaga Valley told WOLA in 1990, 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
&quot;If we attack drug trafficking, we will convert the local 
population into our enemy... Instead of one enemy, the Shining 
Path, we will have three: the Shining Path, the local population 
who will then support the Shining Path, and the drug traffickers 
who will then provide resources to the Shining Path.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
In <U>Colombia</U>, the armed forces have faced armed insurgencies 
for 25 years and have failed to suppress a recent guerrilla offensive. 
High-ranking military officials have stated that $38.5 of $40.3 
million in U.S. counternarcotics military aid for FY1990 was to 
be used for an unrelated counterinsurgency operation. Although 
the military registered more drug confiscations and arrests in 
1990 than in 1989, its priority continues to be fighting the FARC 
and the ELN guerrillas. 
<P> 
In <U>Bolivia</U>, the army has been reluctant to get involved 
in antinarcotics activities. At the same time that U.S. troops 
were preparing to fly to Bolivia to begin training the Bolivian 
army, SouthCom's top Special Forces commander told WOLA that for 
counternarcotics efforts to work in Bolivia, the armed forces 
&quot;must have the intent to become successful, and I don't think 
they do.&quot; 
<H3>2. The Market Logic of the Cocaine Industry </H3> 
 
<P> 
Even if Andean governments could carry out effective antinarcotics 
programs, U.S. cocaine use would not be significantly affected 
because of the flawed logic of U.S. anti-drug policy. The Andean 
strategy assumes the following links between supply-side efforts 
and U.S. demand: (A) that supply-side efforts will reduce the 
availability of cocaine to U.S. consumers, and (B) that disruption 
of production and trafficking will drive up the price to the consumer, 
reducing demand. 
<P> 
This logic ignores two fundamental economic realities of cocaine 
trafficking: (1) that effective repression of production and trafficking 
in one locale will simply shift it to another, and (2) that even 
successful disruption of production and trafficking can have only 
very marginal influence on the final price of cocaine to the consumer. 
 
<H4>The &quot;Balloon Effect&quot; </H4> 
 
<P> 
Even if current Andean suppression efforts are successful, DEA 
officials acknowledge that production is likely to simply spread 
to other countries. This dispersion, called the &quot;balloon 
effect,&quot; (i.e., squeezing in one place produces expansion 
into others), has already occurred in the Andes. 
<P> 
In response to the crackdown in Colombia in late 1989 and early 
1990, cocaine trafficking and production has increased in Brazil, 
Bolivia, Venezuela, and Ecuador according to the DEA. Cocaine 
trafficking continues through these countries and Argentina, Uruguay, 
Paraguay and Panama. Without suppressing production <I>throughout</I> 
the hemisphere, antinarcotics efforts are useless. 
<H4>The Small Impact of Source-Country Efforts on Demand </H4> 
 
<P> 
In testimony before Congress in early 1991, RAND corporation economist 
Peter Reuter stated that, &quot;Source country programs, whether 
they be crop eradication, crop substitution or refinery destruction, 
hold negligible prospect for reducing American cocaine consumption 
in the long-run.&quot; Reuter's analysis shows that: 
<UL> 
<LI>Coca leaf farmers receive less than 1% of the final retail 
price of cocaine, 
<LI>Earnings for cocaine exporters and smugglers comprise less 
than 15% of the final price. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
Because over 85% of cocaine profits are made outside the source 
countries, source-country efforts will not drive up the retail 
price in the U.S. enough to significantly reduce cocaine consumption. 
According to this analysis, even if interdiction efforts were 
able to stop the extremely unlikely figure of 50% of cocaine shipments 
from Colombia, the retail price of cocaine in-the United States 
would rise by less than 3%. No one has presented data to refute

<H2><A NAME="item5">IV. THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ANDEAN 
STRATEGY </A></H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The Andean strategy is not only unworkable but directly harmful 
to U.S. interests in the region. U.S. narcotics-related aid is 
directly contributing to counterinsurgency campaigns characterized 
by widespread and systematic human rights violations in Colombia 
and Peru. As the militarization of the drug war proceeds in 1991, 
U.S. policy is likely to exacerbate those abuses. The Andean strategy 
is also undermining civilian control of powerful militaries and 
cementing their impunity from prosecution for human rights violations. 
Ironically, the strategy appears to have already contributed to 
the Shining Path guerrillas recruitment in Peru, and poses the 
serious danger of sparking armed unrest in Bolivia's volatile 
Chapare coca-growing region. 
<H3><A NAME="item6">A. Human Rights</A> </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
U.S. antinarcotics training, assistance, and equipment is going 
to military and police forces in Colombia and Peru which engage 
in systematic human rights abuses including disappearances, torture, 
and extrajudicial executions. In Bolivia, government human rights 
violations, disturbingly reminiscent of previous dictatorships, 
increased last year. 
<P> 
<B>Peru:</B> Peru's civil war is a source of systematic and flagrant 
human rights abuses on both sides. Peruvian military and police 
forces are among the worst violators of human rights in the hemisphere. 
The 1990 State Department human rights report describes Peru's 
counterinsurgency campaign as one of &quot;widespread and egregious 
human rights violations.&quot; The report notes &quot;widespread 
credible reports of summary executions, arbitrary detentions, 
and torture and rape by the military, as well as less frequent 
reports of such abuses by the police.&quot; Rape by members of 
the security forces is reported to be so frequent that &quot;such 
abuse can be considered common practice, condoned - or at least 
ignored - by the military leadership.&quot; For the fourth consecutive 
year, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights declared Peru 
the country with the most reported cases of disappearances in 
the world. 
<P> 
<B>Colombia:</B> While the sources of violence in Colombia are 
multiple and complex, state-sanctioned political violence is widespread. 
The State Department reports that in 1990 Colombian security forces 
were responsible for &quot;extrajudicial executions, torture, 
and massacres&quot; against leftist politicians, human rights 
monitors, and labor and peasant leaders. Colombian human rights 
groups have documented the use of U.S.-furnished A-37 airplanes 
to bomb civilian populations as part of counterinsurgency operations. 
Right-wing paramilitary groups continue to work closely with the 
military and police in carrying out political killings and disappearances. 
<P> 
<B>Bolivia:</B> While of a far lesser scale than in Peru or Colombia, 
state-sanctioned human rights violations in Bolivia resurged late 
last year. In 1990, the State Department documented cases of extrajudicial 
executions of detainees, as well as torture and cruelty by police 
and army intelligence units. These abuses are more widespread 
than in previous years, and some Bolivian prisoners have been 
used as slaves, beaten, tortured, and murdered. 
<P> 
U.S. antinarcotics policy contributes to human rights violations 
in a number of ways: 
<UL> 
<LI>U.S. equipment and training is being used directly for Colombia's 
counterinsurgency campaign, characterized by consistent human 
rights violations against civilians. Colombia's fleet of A-37's, 
all of which were sold or given to Colombia by the U.S., has been 
used to bomb civilian populations. The link with counterinsurgency 
will be even more explicit in support to Peru's military. 
<LI>U.S. military aid represents a vote of confidence in the military 
despite its human rights record. 
<LI>Military aid will augment the institutional strength of the 
armed forces, decreasing the chances that civilian rulers will 
to take them on and press for accountability for human rights 
violations. 
</UL> 
 
<H3><A NAME="item7">B. Civilian Control of the Military</A> </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
Congress has included provisions in the International Narcotics 
Control Act of 1990 and in the Defense Authorization Act of 1990 
aimed at ensuring that U.S. antinarcotics assistance does not 
undermine the fragile civilian governments in the Andes. While 
military coups continue to be unlikely at the present time, military 
influence has increased in Peru and Bolivia, and the high levels 
of military assistance to Colombia threaten to cement impunity 
for human rights violations there. 
<P> 
In <U>PERU</U>, the increase in military autonomy is clearest. 
Since taking office in July 1990, President Fujimori has ceded 
greater policymaking roles to the military. He has declared additional 
provinces &quot;emergency zones,&quot; placing all civilian authorities 
under military control. These zones, in which human rights abuses 
are most concentrated, now cover 42% of the national territory. 
Fujimori has also named active-duty officers to head the Interior 
Ministry and the Defense Ministry. Not a single military officer 
has been convicted for a human rights violation. 
<P> 
In <U>BOLIVIA</U>, according to one Bolivian government official, 
U.S. pressure to involve the armed forces in the war on drugs 
has already eroded the authority of Paz Zamora's government vis-a-vis 
the military. Although Bolivia does not face insurgencies like 
those in Colombia and Peru, the country has a longer history of 
military rule. The country has had 188 military coups in 166 years 
of independence, and most recently the brutal &quot;cocaine regime&quot; 
of Gen. Garcia Meza (1980-1981) dramatized the extent of the military's 
corruption and its tendency for political intervention. 
<P> 
Despite <U>COLOMBIA</U>'s history of civilian rule, the Colombian 
armed forces maintain great autonomy from civilian control. Colombia 
is the only country in South America whose police are institutionally 
part of the Defense Ministry. All military personnel are immune 
from prosecution in civilian courts for human rights violations. 
The military has acquired almost complete control over counterinsurgency 
policy in strategy in recent years. 
<H3><A NAME="item8">C. Internal Political Stability</A> </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
In Peru and Bolivia, the involvement of the army in drug-related 
law enforcement activities is extremely unpopular because of concerns 
that the military will abuse its expanded authority. The destabilizing 
effect of U.S. troops is of special concern. Peruvian analysts 
claim that, as peasants seek protection from coca suppression 
programs, support for the Shining Path has increased. Growing 
nationalist resentment of the U.S. presence and influence could 
also help the guerrillas. Referring to U.S. anti-drug assistance, 
one high-ranking Peruvian military officer said, &quot;It will 
allow Sendero to wave the nationalist banner and win legitimacy.&quot; 
<P> 
In Bolivia, militarization is occurring in a particularly explosive 
situation. Sectors throughout Bolivia fear that army involvement 
will lead to political unrest. The Chapare coca-growing region 
is the most politically volatile in the country, and the coca 
growers the best organized workers where few profitable alternatives 
exist. 
<HR> 
 
<H2><A NAME="item9">V. TOWARD AN ALTERNATIVE POLICY</A> </H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
One official of the U.S. Southern Command summed up his opinion 
of the drug war as of early 1991: 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
&quot;There's an increasing sense that this is a 'holding action'. 
We're not stopping drug supply because it moves. And we could 
never get the resources to shut down the whole hemisphere. The 
evidence is that we haven't affected price or supply. Is this 
the way we want to spend U.S. dollars? I think not.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Rather than sinking millions of dollars into expanding an unworkable 
strategy to the entire hemisphere, Congress should heed the expert 
testimony presented before it. The Defense Department has repeatedly 
told Congress that the Pentagon's role cannot be the decisive 
one in the war on drugs. Ultimately, this country's drug abuse 
problem must be solved at home. 
<P> 
Yet for the past three years the administration's National Drug 
Control Strategy has maintained a roughly 70/30 ratio in favor 
of supply control measures. Shifting resources to the demand side 
will be more effective in solving the problems of drug abuse and 
drug-related violence. 
<P> 
It will also remove a major factor undermining human rights, democratization, 
and political stability in the Andes. U.S. antinarcotics aid is 
now contributing to counterinsurgency campaigns characterized 
by abhorrent human rights violations - torture, murder, and bombing 
of civilian populations. By strengthening abusive and politicized 
Andean armed forces, that aid will further erode weak civilian 
rule. 
<P> 
Shifting away from military assistance will allow the United States 
to pursue a more balanced foreign policy in the hemisphere. Latin 
American governments are focused on improving economic performance 
and strengthening civilian rule. They have requested trade concessions 
and debt relief. Rather than militarizing anti-drug efforts throughout 
the region, the U.S. is in a position to respond to their requests, 
to spend its antinarcotics monies more effectively, and to promote 
U.S. interests in human rights and democratization simultaneously. <p>

</i></center> 
<hr> 
<p> 
November 15, 1996 
<p> 
Proposition 215 has created a new exemption from criminal penalties 
for medical use of marijuana. This brochure will provide a general description of how that exemption  
applies to Californians (this format was adapted from a handout brochure). It represents the best of our  
knowledge as of the date printed above. Be sure to speak with a lawyer for an up-to-date interpretation and  
any specific questions about your own situation. 
<p> 
Prop. 215 does not legalize marijuana. It changes how certain 
people - medical patients and their "primary caregivers" - will be treated by the State of California's court  
system. Patients with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana in medical treatment have a new legal  
defense available to them. 
<p> 
If arrested on marijuana charges, patients can claim entitlement to 
an exemption from the law. The burden of proof is largely on the patient, to prove his or her medical need  
and to prove that marijuana was used with the recommendation of a doctor. Because compliance is so  
important, take time to understand the new law. 
 
<p> 
<h3>Who is affected by Prop. 215?</h3> 
 
Proposition 215 was designed to protect seriously and terminally 
ill patients from criminal penalties for using marijuana medically. Only people with their doctor's  
recommendation to use marijuana in medical treatment can take advantage of Prop. 215 as a legal defense  
against marijuana charges. 
<p> 
A doctor must judge whether marijuana is appropriate for treatment 
of a specific illness. Most of the people who use marijuana as a medicine suffer from cancer, AIDS, or  
glaucoma, while some people report that it helps treat symptoms of epilepsy and other diseases in which  
muscle spasms or seizures are common. But simply having one of these diseases does not automatically  
qualify anyone for the marijuana exemption under Prop. 215. Only a doctor's recommendation can do that. 
<p> 
<h3>For what diseases is marijuana useful?</h3> 
 
Marijuana has been used for centuries by doctors all over the world. Some conditions for which marijuana  
was formerly a common treatment, such as simple pain relief, are now treatable by other, more effective,  
medications. In other cases, marijuana, alone or in combination with other drugs, remains an effective  
treatment. 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nausea reduction in cancer and AIDS patients. The most common 
medical application of marijuana is for the reduction of extreme nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy  
and AIDS treatment. Patients facing such treatments often find that just a small amount of marijuana -  
whether inhaled, baked into foods or consumed in liquids - can immediately quell nausea or even prevent  
its onset. Several scientific studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed marijuana's value for reducing  
cancer patients' nausea. 
 
<li>Increasing appetite. Marijuana also reportedly increases appetite 
for patients with nausea or other conditions, permitting more normal food intake and preventing dangerous  
weight loss. This is particularly important to patients with AIDS "wasting syndrome." 
 
<li>Reducing eye pressure in glaucoma patients. Glaucoma is a 
progressive disease of the eye which can lead to blindness. It results from a buildup of pressure within the  
eye. Marijuana reduces the pressure within the eye, holding off some of the damage. 
 
<li>Controlling muscle spasms, seizures and chronic muscular pain. 
Marijuana is also used medically by patients with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, spinal cord injuries  
and other conditions which are characterized by muscle spasticity, seizures and severe chronic pain. 
</ul> 
<p> 
<h3>What about the pill form of marijuana?</h3> 
 
There is a pill form of one chemical in marijuana, THC, available by prescription under the trade name  
Marinol. Marinol's use is currently restricted to only cancer and AIDS treatment.  
<p> 
For some people, Marinol works fine, at least for a while. But for many patients, it is too expensive -  
costing up to $30,000 a year - or too powerful. Some patients say that this highly concentrated  
psychoactive drug "knocks them out," as opposed to marijuana in its whole form, which permits dosage to  
be better controlled, with milder effects. 
<p> 
<h3>How do I get a marijuana prescription?</h3> 
 
Even though Prop. 215 is now law, it is still not possible to get a standard prescription for marijuana from a  
doctor. Pharmacies cannot carry marijuana, due to federal laws that ban the drug. 
<p> 
Instead, Prop. 215 permits doctors to make recommendations for 
medical marijuana use, either in writing or verbally. Never should a marijuana recommendation be made  
lightly. If you are arrested and charged with a marijuana offense, the doctor may be required to testify on  
your behalf. For this reason, the doctor needs to be clear about the rationale for the recommendation, and  
should monitor the patient's progress carefully. It is best to be conservative and cautious in obtaining the  
recommendation and in trying to keep it valid. 
<p> 
<h3>Can a doctor's recommendation expire?</h3> 
 
Yes. For as long as the marijuana-recommending physician is in 
charge of the patient's care, and for as long as the physician continues to believe marijuana is helpful, the  
patient is protected under California law from criminal penalties for marijuana. However, if a patient  
changes doctors, or if the recommending doctor changes his or her opinion of marijuana's importance to  
treatment, the patient may not be protected any longer. Common sense suggests that the recommendation  
must be current to be valid when used as a legal defense, and therefore should be periodically renewed by  
the physician. 
<p> 
<h3>How can patients buy marijuana?</h3> 
 
For the near future, most patients have to rely on the black market 
for marijuana. The acts of selling or buying marijuana remain illegal, but a patient who possesses  
marijuana upon a doctor's recommendation is protected from criminal penalties for possession. 
"Cannabis buyers' clubs" may be an option for some. There is no 
fully legal means available to buy marijuana, but, in some cities, these clubs operate under some  
supervision by local authorities. These facilities typically require patients to provide written, verifiable  
documentation of their physician's recommendation to use marijuana. If the operators are satisfied that a  
person has a true medical need, they will register the patient and permit that person to buy marijuana at the  
club. 
<p> 
<h3>Can I grow marijuana?</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Yes. Under Prop. 215, the cultivation of marijuana plants for the 
personal, medical use of a patient is permitted. However, the seeds necessary to begin cultivating marijuana  
are no more legal or available than before. Again, a patient must go to the black market for seeds or  
seedlings, and the transaction itself is still illegal. 
Cultivation remains a felony in most cases under state and federal 
law. A person arrested and charged under state law has the right to use a Prop. 215 defense. Federal agents  
are believed to be unlikely to arrest and prosecute small-time growers of marijuana for medical use,  
because small-scale cases are not a high priority to federal law enforcement. Still, prosecutions by federal  
agencies are possible. 
 
<li>Cultivation guidelines. It is important to take steps to keep any 
medical marijuana cultivation within the boundaries suggested by Prop. 215. 
First off, grow no more marijuana than you need for personal 
consumption. There is no concrete standard for numbers of plants under Prop. 215. Generally speaking, a  
few healthy plants should satisfy a patient's needs. 
Do not distribute or sell marijuana under any circumstances to 
anyone - especially non-patients. Any evidence of distribution puts a person at very high risk. A Prop. 215  
defense will not work for someone who distributes or sells any amount of marijuana, because the new law  
applies only to a patient's personal, medical supply. If prosecutors discover evidence of sale or distribution,  
they are likely to charge a person with felony counts that could result in years of prison time, regardless of  
that person's medical condition or medical authorization to use marijuana. 
</ul> 
<p> 
<h3>If I'm caught, how does 215 protect me?</h3> 
 
If you are caught with marijuana that you are using with a doctor's 
authorization, you will have a few opportunities to prove that you are a legal, medical user of the drug.  
Though Prop. 215 does not specifically prevent arrests, police officers are now being trained in ways to  
determine legitimate medical use versus illegal, social use, when they discover a person with marijuana.  
You can make a policeman's job easier, and protect yourself, by carrying written documentation of your  
medical need for marijuana, including a copy of your doctor's recommendation, if it is in writing. 
<p> 
If a police officer has any reason to doubt that a patient is using 
marijuana -- or cultivating it -- for only personal, medical use, the officer is free to make an arrest. On  
November 6, 1996, the Attorney General issued broad guidelines for officers to help determine who has a  
legitimate medical-use claim under Prop. 215. These guidelines can also be helpful to patients. In part,  
officers have been instructed to ask about or investigate: 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li>the person's status as patient or caregiver, and the documented medical condition of the patient in  
question; 
<li>the name of the physician who has ordered marijuana use; * quantity and packaging of the marijuana;  
and 
<li>the presence of pay/owe documents, weapons, police radio scanners, or other evidence of conduct  
associated with drug dealing. 
</ul> 
<p> 
If you are a legitimate, medical user of marijuana, and are arrested despite attempts to prove that you are  
exempt from the law, you will still have opportunities to avoid prosecution. 
<p> 
Most legitimate cases of patients and specified caregivers facing charges for strictly medical use of  
marijuana should be dismissed before proceeding to trial. Local police investigators or prosecutors ought to  
be able to determine, from evidence presented by arrested persons, who is and who is not entitled to an  
exemption from the marijuana laws under Prop. 215. Some cases may go to trial, in which case the patient  
and physician involved should expect to testify under oath about the reasons for the patient's medical  
marijuana use. 
<p> 
<h3>Who qualifies as a "caregiver?"</h3> 
 
Prop. 215 was designed primarily to protect patients from prosecution for medical use of marijuana.  
However, the new law recognizes that some patients may be in such ill health that a family member or  
close friend may need to obtain and possess marijuana for that patient. Or, a patient may live with someone  
who could be subject to criminal or civil charges for the patient's marijuana kept on the same property. In  
this spirit, so-called "primary caregivers" to medical marijuana patients are also exempted from marijuana  
charges. 
<p> 
So who is a "primary caregiver?" The Prop. 215 text defines such a person as "the individual designated by  
the ... [patient] who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health or safety of that  
person." The fact that a person must have "consistently assumed responsibility" for the patient's welfare  
could narrow the definition of "primary caregiver" considerably.  
<p> 
Family members, very close friends and roommates of patients will fit under this definition most readily. 
The best advice at this time is to be conservative in designating a 
caregiver or in considering yourself to fit under the new law's definition. Ultimately, a judge may have to  
decide each case on its individual merits. 
<p> 
<h3>Banned activities for marijuana patients:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Prop. 215 does not give a broad freedom to medical marijuana 
patients to use marijuana anywhere, any time. 
<li>Prop. 215 contains a provision ensuring that "conduct that 
endangers others" remains illegal. Such conduct is likely to include driving under the influence of  
marijuana, operating heavy machinery, or other similar activities, in which there is a realistic risk that a  
person's marijuana use could impair judgment and lead to harm to other people. 
Courts would probably also consider smoking marijuana in public or 
in the workplace to be a danger to others, permitting sanctions against anyone for doing so. 
</ul> 
<p> 
<h3>A warning to all marijuana users:</h3> 
 
<blockquote>Prop. 215 was designed to protect a specific class of people - the 
seriously and terminally ill. It does not apply to recreational users of marijuana who simply feel they get  
some "medical" benefit. It does not even apply to terminally ill patients who fail to get their physicians'  
approval. Prop. 215 enables the courts to sort out who is entitled to these new protections, and who is not. 
Every detail, from proof of illness to the form and reasons for a 
marijuana recommendation, is a potential weak link in a person's case.</blockquote>

The marihuana, cannabis, or hemp plant is one of the oldest psychoactive plants known to 
humanity. It is botanically classified as a member of the family Cannabaceae and the genus 
<i>Cannabis</i>. Most botanists agree that there are three species: <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, the 
most widespread of the three, is tall, gangly, and loosely branched, growing as high as twenty 
feet; <i>Cannabis indica</i> is shorter, about three or four feet in height, pyramidal in shape and 
densely branched; <i>Cannabis ruderalis</i> is about two feet high with few or no branches. 
There are also differences among these species in the leaves, stems, and resin. According to an 
alternative classification, the genus has only one highly variable species, <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, 
with two subspecies, <i>sativa</i> and <i>indica</i>. The first is more northerly and produces 
more fiber and oil; the second is more southerly and produces more of the intoxicating resin. 
<p> 
Cannabis has become one of the most widespread and diversified of plants. It grows as weed and 
cultivated plant all over the world in a variety of climates and soils. The fiber has been used for 
cloth and paper for centuries and was the most important source of rope until the development of 
synthetic fibers. The seeds (or, strictly speaking, akenes - small hard fruits) have been used as 
bird feed and sometimes as human food. The oil contained in the seeds was once used for 
lighting and soap and is now sometimes employed in the manufacture of varnish, linoleum, and 
artists' paints. 
<p> 
The chemical compounds responsible for the intoxicating and medicinal effects are found mainly 
in a sticky golden resin exuded from the flowers on the female plants. The function of the resin 
is thought to be protection from heat and preservation of moisture during reproduction. The 
plants highest in resin therefore grow in hot regions like Mexico, the Middle East, and India. 
When the reproductive process is over and the fruits are fully ripe, no more resin is secreted. 
<p> 
The cannabis preparations used in India often serve as a folk standard of potency. The three 
varieties are known as <i>bhang</i>, <i>ganja</i>, and <i>charas</i>. The least potent and 
cheapest preparation, bhang, is produced from the dried and crushed leaves, seeds, and stems. 
Ganja, prepared from the flowering tops of cultivated female plants, is two or three times as 
strong as bhang; the difference is somewhat akin to the difference between beer and fine Scotch. 
Charas is the pure resin, also known as hashish in the Middle East. Any of these preparations 
can be smoked, eaten, or mixed in drinks. The marihuana used in the United States is equivalent 
to bhang or, increasingly in recent years, to ganja. 
<p> 
The marihuana plant contains more than 460 known compounds, of which more than 60 have the 
21-carbon structure typical of cannabinoids. The only cannabinoid that is both highly 
psychoactive and present in large amounts, usually 1-5 percent by weight, is (-)3,4-trans-delta-l- 
tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as delta-1-THC, delta-9-THC, or simply THC. A few other 
tetrahydrocannabinols are about as potent as delta-9-THC but present in only a few varieties of 
cannabis and in much smaller quantities. A number of synthetic congeners (chemical relatives) 
of THC have been developed under such names as synhexyl, nabilone, and levonatradol. The 
other two major types of cannabinoid are the cannabidiols and the cannabinols. It appears that 
the plant first produces the mildly active cannabidiols, which are converted to 
tetrahydrocannabinols and then broken down to relatively inactive cannabinols as the plant 
matures. 
<p> 
The recent discovery of nerve receptors in the brain stimulated by THC (and the cloning of the 
gene that gives rise to these receptors) suggests that the body produces its own version of the 
substance. The receptors are found mainly in the cerebral cortex, which governs higher thinking 
and in the hippocampus, which is a locus of memory (1). 
<p> 
A native of central Asia, cannabis may have been cultivated as long as ten thousand years ago. It 
was certainly cultivated in China by 4000 B.C. and in Turkestan by 3000 B.C. It has long been 
used as a medicine in India, China, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South Africa, and South 
America. The first evidence for medicinal use of cannabis is an herbal published during the reign 
of the Chinese emperor Chen Nung five thousand years ago. Cannabis was recommended for 
malaria, constipation, rheumatic pains, "absentmindedness," and female disorders. Another 
Chinese herbal recommended a mixture of hemp, resin, and wine as an analgesic during surgery. 
In India cannabis has been recommended to quicken the mind, lower fevers, induce sleep, cure 
dysentery, stimulate appetite, improve digestion, relieve headaches, and cure venereal disease. In 
Africa it was used for dysentery, malaria, and other fevers. Today certain tribes treat snake bites 
with hemp or smoke it before childbirth. Hemp was also noted as a remedy by Galen and other 
physicians of the classical and Hellenistic eras, and it was highly valued in medieval Europe. 
The English clergyman Robert Burton, in his famous work <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, 
published in 1621, suggested the use of cannabis in the treatment of depression. The <i>New 
English Dispensatory</i> of 1764 recommended applying hemp roots to the skin for 
inflammation, a remedy that was already popular in eastern Europe. The <i>Edinburgh New 
Dispensary</i> of 1794 included a long description of the effects of hemp and stated that the oil 
was useful in the treatment of coughs, venereal disease, and urinary incontinence. A few years 
later Nicholas Culpeper summarized all the conditions for which cannabis was supposed to be 
medically useful. 
<p> 
But cannabis did not come into its own in the West as a medicine until the middle of the 
nineteenth century. During its heyday, from 1840 to 1900, more than one hundred papers were 
published in the Western medical literature recommending it for various illnesses and 
discomforts (2). It could almost be said that physicians of a century ago knew more about 
cannabis than contemporary physicians do; certainly they were more interested in exploring its 
therapeutic potential. 
<p> 
The first Western physician to take an interest in cannabis as a medicine was W B. 
O'Shaughnessey, a young professor at the Medical College of Calcutta who had observed its use 
in India. He gave cannabis to animals, satisfied himself that it was safe, and began to use it with 
patients suffering from rabies, rheumatism, epilepsy, and tetanus. In a report published in 1839, 
he wrote that he had found tincture of hemp (a solution of cannabis in alcohol, taken orally) to be 
an effective analgesic. He was also impressed with its muscle relaxant properties and called it 
"an anticonvulsive remedy of the greatest value" (3). 
<p> 
O'Shaughnessey returned to England in 1842 and provided cannabis to pharmacists. Doctors in 
Europe and the United States soon began to prescribe it for a variety of physical conditions. 
Cannabis was even given to Queen Victoria by her court physician. It was listed in the United 
States Dispensatory in 1854 (with a warning that large doses were dangerous and that it was a 
powerful "narcotic"). Commercial cannabis preparations could be bought in drug stores. During 
the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia, some pharmacists carried ten pounds or more 
of hashish (4). 
<p> 
Meanwhile, reports on cannabis accumulated in the medical literature. In 1860 Dr. R. R. 
M'Meens reported the findings of the Committee on Cannabis Indica to the Ohio State Medical 
Society (5). After acknowledging a debt to O'Shaughnessey, M'Meens reviewed symptoms and 
conditions for which Indian hemp had been found useful, including tetanus, neuralgia, 
dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), convulsions, rheumatic and childbirth pain, asthma, 
postpartum psychosis, gonorrhea, and chronic bronchitis. As a hypnotic (sleep-inducing drug) he 
compared it to opium: "Its effects are less intense, and the secretions are not so much suppressed 
by it. Digestion is not disturbed; the appetite rather increased; ... The whole effect of hemp being 
less violent, and producing a more natural sleep, without interfering with the actions of the 
internal organs, it is certainly often preferable to opium, although it is not equal to that drug in 
strength and reliability." Like O'Shaughnessey, M'Meens emphasized the remarkable capacity of 
cannabis to stimulate appetite. 
<p> 
Interest persisted into the next generation. In 1887, H. A. Hare recommended the capacity of 
hemp to subdue restlessness and anxiety and distract a patient's mind in terminal illness. In these 
circumstances, he wrote, "The patient, whose most painful symptom has been mental trepidation, 
may become more happy or even hilarious" (6). He believed cannabis to be as effective a pain 
reliever as opium: "During the time that this remarkable drug is relieving pain, a very curious 
psychical condition sometimes manifests itself; namely, that the diminution of the pain seems to 
be due to its fading away in the distance, so that the pain becomes less and less, just as the pain 
in a delicate ear would grow less and less as a beaten drum was carried farther and farther out of 
the range of hearing" (7). Hare also noted that hemp is an excellent topical anesthetic, especially 
for the mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue - a property well known to dentists in the 
nineteenth century. 
<p> 
In 1890, J. R. Reynolds, a British physician, summarized thirty years of experience with 
<i>Cannabis indica</i>, recommending it for patients with "senile insomnia" and suggesting that 
"in this class of cases I have found nothing comparable in utility to a moderate dose of Indian 
hemp." According to Reynolds, hemp remained effective for months and even years without an 
increase in the dose. He also found it valuable in the treatment of various forms of neuralgia, 
including tic douloureux (a painful facial neurological disorder), and added that it was useful in 
preventing migraine attacks: "Very many victims of this malady have for years kept their 
suffering in abeyance by taking hemp at the moment of threatening or onset of the attack." He 
also found it useful for certain kinds of epilepsy, for depression, and sometimes for asthma and 
dysmenorrhea (8). 
<p> 
Doctor J. B. Mattison, urging physicians to continue using hemp, in 1891 called it "a drug that 
has a special value in some morbid conditions and the intrinsic merit and safety of which entitles 
it to a place it once held in therapeutics" (9). He reviewed its uses as an analgesic and hypnotic, 
with special reference to dysmenorrhea, chronic rheumatism, asthma, and gastric ulcer, and 
added that "it has proved an efficient substitute for the poppy" in morphine addicts. One of his 
cases was "a naval surgeon, nine years a ten grains daily subcutaneous morphia taker ... [who] 
recovered with less than a dozen doses" (10). The use of cannabis in treating drug addiction had 
already been reported in 1889 by E. A. Birch. He treated a chloral hydrate addict and an opiate 
addict with pills containing <i>Cannabis indica</i> and found a prompt response in both cases, 
with improved appetite and sound sleep (11). 
<p> 
But for Mattison the most important use of cannabis was in treating "that opprobrium of the 
healing art - migraine." Reviewing his own and earlier physicians' experiences, he concluded 
that cannabis not only blocks the pain of migraine but prevents migraine attacks (12). Years later 
William Osler expressed his agreement, saying that cannabis was "probably the most satisfactory 
remedy" for migraine (13). Mattison's report concluded on a wistful note: 
<p> 
<blockquote>Dr. Suckling wrote me: "The young men rarely prescribe it." To them I specially 
commend it. With a wish for speedy effect, it is so easy to use that modern mischief maker, 
hypodermic morphia, that they [young physicians] are prone to forget remote results of 
incautious opiate giving. 
<p> 
Would that the wisdom which has come to their professional fathers through, it may be, a hapless 
experience might serve them to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient has gone a 
wreck. 
<p> 
Indian hemp is not here lauded as a specific. It will, at times, fail. So do other drugs. But the 
many cases in which it acts well entitle it to a large and lasting confidence (14).</blockquote> 
<p> 
As he noted, the medical use of cannabis was already in decline by 1890. The potency of 
cannabis preparations was too variable, and individual responses to orally ingested cannabis 
seemed erratic and unpredictable. Another reason for the neglect of research on the analgesic 
properties of cannabis was the greatly increased use of opiates after the invention of the 
hypodermic syringe in the 1850s allowed soluble drugs to be injected for fast pain relief; hemp 
products are insoluble in water and so cannot easily be administered by injection. Toward the 
end of the nineteenth century, the development of such synthetic drugs as aspirin, chloral 
hydrate, and barbiturates, which are chemically more stable than <i>Cannabis indica</i> and 
therefore more reliable, hastened the decline of cannabis as a medicine. But the new drugs had 
striking disadvantages. Five hundred to a thousand people die from aspirin-induced bleeding 
each year in the United States, and barbiturates are, of course, far more dangerous yet. One 
might have expected physicians looking for better analgesics and hypnotics to have turned to 
cannabinoid substances, especially after 1940, when it became possible to study congeners 
(chemical relatives) of THC that might have more stable and specific effects. 
<p> 
But the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 undermined any such experimentation. This law was the 
culmination of a campaign organized by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics under Harry Anslinger 
in which the public was led to believe that marihuana was addictive and caused violent crimes, 
psychosis, and mental deterioration. The film Reefer Madness, made as part of Anslinger's 
campaign, may be a joke to the sophisticated today, but it was once regarded as a serious attempt 
to address a social problem, and the atmosphere and attitudes it exemplified and promoted 
continue to influence American culture today. 
<p> 
Under the Marihuana Tax Act, anyone using the hemp plant for certain defined industrial or 
medical purposes was required to register and pay a tax of a dollar an ounce. A person using 
marihuana for any other purpose had to pay a tax of $100 an ounce on unregistered transactions. 
Those failing to comply were subject to large fines or prison terms for tax evasion. The law was 
not aimed at medical use of marihuana - its purpose was to discourage recreational marihuana 
smoking. It was put in the form of a revenue measure to evade the effect of Supreme Court 
decisions that reserved to the states the right to regulate most commercial transactions. By 
forcing some marihuana transactions to be registered and others to be taxed heavily, the 
government could make it prohibitively expensive to obtain the drug legally for any other than 
medical purposes. Almost incidentally, the law made medical use of cannabis difficult because 
of the extensive paperwork required of doctors who wished to use it. The Federal Bureau of 
Narcotics followed up with "anti-diversion" regulations that contributed to physicians' 
disenchantment. Cannabis was removed from the United States Pharmacopoeia and National 
Formulary in 1941. 
<p> 
A reading of the hearings in which the bill was examined by the House Ways and Means 
Committee before its passage shows how little data supported the judgment that marihuana was 
harmful and how much mass hysteria surrounded the subject. The only dissident witness was W. 
C. Woodward, a physician-lawyer serving as legislative counsel for the American Medical 
Association. He supported the aims of Congress but argued for less restrictive legislation on the 
grounds that future investigators might discover substantial medical uses for cannabis. In 
reference to marihuana "addiction," Woodward commented: 
<p> 
<blockquote>The newspapers have called attention to it so prominently that there must be some 
grounds for their statements. It has surprised me, however, that the facts on which these 
statements have been based have not been brought before this committee by competent primary 
evidence. We are referred to newspaper publications concerning the prevalence of marihuana 
addiction. We are told that the use of marihuana causes crime. 
<p> 
But as yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of Prisons to show the number of prisoners 
who have been found addicted to the marihuana habit. An informal inquiry shows that the 
Bureau of Prisons has no evidence on that point. 
<p> 
You have been told that school children are great users of marihuana cigarettes. No one has been 
summoned from the Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit among 
children. 
<p> 
Inquiry of the Children's Bureau shows that they have had no occasion to investigate it and know 
nothing particularly of it. 
<p> 
Inquiry of the Office of Education - and they certainly should know something of the prevalence 
of the habit among the school children of the county, if there is a prevalence of the habit - 
indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate and know nothing of it. 
(15)</blockquote> 
<p> 
Congressmen questioned Woodward closely and critically about his educational background, his 
relationship to the American Medical Association, and his views on medical legislation of the 
previous fifteen years. His objections to the quality and sources of the evidence against cannabis 
did not endear him to the legislators. Representative John Dingell's questions are typical: 
<p> 
<blockquote><i>Mr. Dingell</i>: We know that it is a habit that is spreading, particularly 
among youngsters. We learn that from the pages of the newspapers. You say that Michigan has 
a law regulating it. We have a State Law, but we do not seem to be able to get anywhere with it, 
because, as I have said, the habit is growing. The number of victims is increasing each year. 
<p> 
<i>Dr. Woodward</i>: There is no evidence of that. 
<p> 
<i>Mr. Dingell</i>: I have not been impressed by your testimony here as reflecting the sentiment 
of the high-class members of the medical profession in my State. I am confident that the medical 
profession in the State of Michigan, and in Wayne County particularly, or in my district, will 
subscribe wholeheartedly to any law that will suppress this thing, despite the fact that there is a 
$1 tax imposed. 
<p> 
<i>Dr. Woodward</i>: if there was any law that would absolutely suppress the thing, perhaps 
that is true, but when the law simply contains provisions that impose a useless expense, and does 
not accomplish the result- 
<p> 
<i>Mr. Dingell</i>: (interposing): That is simply your personal opinion. That is kindred to the 
opinion you entertained with reference to the Harrison Narcotics Act. 
<p> 
<i>Dr. Woodward</i>: If we had been asked to cooperate in drafting it- 
<p> 
<i>Mr. Dingell</i> (interposing): You are not cooperating in drafting this at all. 
<p> 
<i>Dr. Woodward</i>: As a matter of fact, it does not serve to suppress the use of opium and 
cocaine. 
<p> 
<i>Mr. Dingell</i>: The medical profession should be doing its utmost to aid in the suppression 
of this curse that is eating the very vitals of the Nation. 
<p> 
<i>Dr. Woodward</i>: They are. 
<p> 
<i>Mr. Dingell</i>: Are you not simply piqued because you were not consulted in the drafting of 
the bill (16)?</blockquote> 
<p> 
Woodward was finally cut off with the admonition: "You are not cooperative in this. If you want 
to advise us on legislation you ought to come here with some constructive proposals rather than 
criticisms, rather than trying to throw obstacles in the way of something that the Federal 
Government is trying to do" (17). His testimony was futile. The bill became law on October 1, 
1937. Many state laws, just as punitive and hastily conceived, followed. 
<p> 
One of the few public officials who responded rationally to the issue of marihuana in the 1930s 
was New York's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. In 1938 he appointed a committee of scientists to 
study the medical, sociological, and psychological aspects of marihuana use in New York City. 
Two internists, three psychiatrists, two pharmacologists, a public health expert, the 
commissioners of Correction, Health, and Hospitals, and the director of the Division of 
Psychiatry of the Department of Hospitals made up the committee. They began their 
investigations in 1940 and presented detailed findings in 1944 under the title "The Marihuana 
Problem in the City of New York." This largely disregarded study dispelled many of the myths 
that had spurred passage of the tax act. The committee found no proof that major crime was 
associated with marihuana or that it caused aggressive or antisocial behavior; marihuana was not 
sexually overstimulating and did not change personality; there was no evidence of acquired 
tolerance. 
<p> 
In September 1942 the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> published "The Psychiatric 
Aspects of Marihuana Intoxication," by two of the study's investigators, Samuel Allentuck and 
Karl M. Bowman. Among other things, Allentuck and Bowman wrote that habituation to 
cannabis is not as strong as habituation to tobacco or alcohol. Three months later, in December, 
an editorial in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> described Allentuck and 
Bowman's article as "a careful study" and mentioned potential therapeutic uses of cannabis in the 
treatment of depression, appetite loss, and opiate addiction. But in the next few years that 
journal's editors were induced to change their minds under government pressure. They received 
and published letters denouncing the LaGuardia report from Bureau of Narcotics Director Harry 
Anslinger in January 1943 and from R. J. Bouquet, an expert working for the Narcotics 
Commission of the League of Nations, in April 1944. Finally, the American Medical 
Association expressed its agreement with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in the following 
editorial, published in April 1945: 
<p> 
<blockquote>For many years medical scientists have considered cannabis a dangerous drug. 
Nevertheless, a book called <i>Marihuana Problems</i> by the New York City Mayor's 
Committee on Marihuana submits an analysis by seventeen doctors of tests on 77 prisoners and, 
on this narrow and thoroughly unscientific foundation, draws sweeping and inadequate 
conclusions which minimize the harmfulness of marihuana. Already the book has done harm ... 
The book states unqualifiedly to the public that the use of this narcotic does not lead to physical, 
mental or moral degeneration and that permanent deleterious effects from its continued use were 
not observed on 77 prisoners. This statement has already done great damage to the cause of law 
enforcement. Public officials will do well to disregard this unscientific, uncritical study, and 
continue to regard marihuana as a menace wherever it is purveyed.</blockquote> 
<p> 
In the words of A. S. deRopp, the journal had "abandoned its customary restraint and voiced its 
editorial wrath in scolding tones. So fierce was the editorial that one might suppose that the 
learned members of the mayor's committee ... had formed some unhallowed league with the 'tea- 
pad' proprietors [owners of places where marihuana users gathered to smoke] to undermine the 
city's health by deliberately misrepresenting the facts about marihuana" (18). For more than 
forty years after that editorial, the American Medical Association steadfastly maintained a 
position on marihuana closely allied to that of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and its successor 
agencies. 
<p> 
Although virtually no medical investigation of cannabis was conducted for many years, the 
government did not entirely lose interest. Shortly after one of us (L.G.) published a book on 
marihuana in 1971, a chemist who had read it told us that his employer, the Arthur D. Little 
Company, had been given millions of dollars in government contracts to identify military uses 
for cannabis. He said they had found none but had come across important therapeutic leads. He 
visited us to discuss the economic feasibility of developing cannabinoid congeners 
commercially, but he could not give us the evidence because it was classified. 
<p> 
In the 1960s, as large numbers of people began to use marihuana recreationally, anecdotes about 
its medical utility began to appear, generally not in the medical literature but in the form of 
letters to popular magazines like <i>Playboy</i>. Meanwhile, legislative concern about 
recreational use increased, and in 1970 Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act. This law 
assigned psychoactive drugs to five schedules and placed cannabis in Schedule I, the most 
restrictive. According to the legal definition, Schedule I drugs have no medical use and a high 
potential for abuse, and they cannot be used safely even under a doctor's supervision. By that 
time the renaissance of interest in cannabis as a medicine was already well under way. Two 
years later, in 1972, the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana Laws (NORML) 
petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (formerly the Federal Bureau of 
Narcotics) to transfer marihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally prescribed by 
physicians. As the legal proceedings have continued, other parties have joined, including the 
Drug Policy Foundation and the Physicians Association for AIDS Care. 
<p> 
The hearings before the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) were instructive. As 
one of us (L.G.) waited to testify on the medical uses of cannabis, he witnessed the effort to place 
pentazocine (Talwin ), a synthetic opioid analgesic made by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, on the 
schedule of dangerous drugs. The testimony indicated several hundred cases of addiction, a 
number of deaths from overdose, and considerable evidence of abuse. Six lawyers from the drug 
company, briefcases in hand, came forward to prevent the classification of pentazocine or at least 
to ensure that it was placed in one of the less restrictive schedules. They succeeded in part; it 
became a Schedule IV drug. In the testimony on cannabis, the next drug to be considered, there 
was no evidence of overdose deaths or addiction - simply many witnesses, both patients and 
physicians, who testified to its medical utility. The government refused to transfer it to Schedule 
II. Might the outcome have been different if a large drug company with enormous financial 
resources had a commercial interest in cannabis? 
<p> 
In rejecting the NORML petition, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs failed to call for 
public hearings as required by law. The reason it gave was that reclassification would violate 
U.S. treaty obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Substances. 
NORML responded in January 1974 by filing a suit against the BNDD. The U.S. Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals reversed the bureau's dismissal of the petition, remanding the case for 
reconsideration and criticizing both the bureau and the Department of Justice. In September 
1975, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), successor to the BNDD, acknowledged that 
treaty obligations did not prevent the rescheduling of marihuana but continued to refuse public 
hearings. NORML again filed suit. In October 1980, after much further legal maneuvering, the 
Court of Appeals remanded the NORML petition to the DEA for reconsideration for the third 
time. The government reclassified synthetic THC as a Schedule II drug in 1985 but kept 
marihuana itself - and THC derived from marihuana - in Schedule I. Finally, in May 1986, the 
DEA administrator announced the public hearings ordered by the court seven years earlier. 
<p> 
Those hearings began in the summer of 1986 and lasted two years. The parties who sought 
rescheduling were NORML, a membership-funded educational organization, founded in 1970, 
which opposes all criminal prohibitions against marihuana and marihuana smoking; the Alliance 
for Cannabis Therapeutics, a nonprofit organization founded in 1980 to make marihuana 
available by prescription; the Cannabis Corporation of America, a pharmaceutical firm 
established with the intention of extracting natural cannabinoids for therapeutic use when 
cannabis is placed in Schedule II; and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, which considers 
marihuana a sacred plant essential to its religious rituals. These groups were opposed by the 
DEA, the International Chiefs of Police, and the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free 
Youth, another membership-funded educational organization. 
<p> 
The lengthy hearings involved many witnesses, including both patients and doctors, and 
thousands of pages of documentation. The record of these hearings constitutes the most 
extensive contemporary exploration of the evidence on cannabis as a medicine. Administrative 
law judge Francis J. Young reviewed the evidence and rendered his decision on September 6, 
1988. Young said that approval by a "significant minority" of physicians was enough to meet the 
standard of "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States" established by the 
Controlled Substances Act for a Schedule II drug. He added that "marijuana, in its natural form, 
is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man .... One must reasonably 
conclude that there is accepted safety for use of marijuana under medical supervision. To 
conclude otherwise, on the record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious." Young 
went on to recommend "that the Administrator [of the DEA] conclude that the marijuana plant 
considered as a whole has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, that 
there is no lack of accepted safety for use of it under medical supervision and that it may lawfully 
be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II (19). 
<p> 
In determining what "currently accepted medical use" meant for legal purposes, Judge Young 
was adopting the view of the petitioners and rejecting that of the DEA, whose criteria were the 
result of a previous legal challenge involving the drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
(MDMA). In 1984 the DEA placed this previously unscheduled drug in Schedule I. The 
placement was challenged by a group of physicians and others who believed that MDMA had 
therapeutic potential. After extensive hearings, the administrative law judge rejected the DEA's 
position that MDMA had no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and agreed 
with the challengers that it should be placed in Schedule III rather than Schedule I. The DEA 
administrator rejected this recommendation. The challengers appealed to the U.S. First Circuit 
Court of Appeals, which ruled in their favor, finding that formal approval for marketing by the 
Food and Drug Administration, the DEA's criterion for "accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States," was unacceptable under the terms of the Controlled Substances Act (20). 
<p> 
The DEA administrator responded with the following new criteria for accepted medical use of a 
drug: (1) scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its chemistry; (2) scientific 
knowledge of its toxicology and pharmacology in animals; (3) effectiveness in human beings 
established through scientifically designed clinical trials; (4) general availability of the substance 
and information about its use; (5) recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted 
pharmacopoeia, medical references, journals, or textbooks; (6) specific indications for the 
treatment of recognized disorders; (7) recognition of its use by organizations or associations of 
physicians; and (8) recognition and use by a substantial segment of medical practitioners in the 
United States. These were the criteria rejected by Judge Young in his marihuana decision. 
<p> 
The DEA disregarded the opinion of its own administrative law judge and refused to reschedule 
marihuana. The agency's lawyer remarked, "The judge seems to hang his hat on what he calls a 
respectable minority of physicians. What percent are you talking about? One half of one 
percent? One quarter of one percent?" DEA Administrator John Lawn went further, calling 
claims for the medical utility of marihuana a "dangerous and cruel hoax" (21). In March 1991 
the plaintiffs appealed yet again, and in April the District of Columbia Court of Appeals 
unanimously ordered the DEA to reexamine its standards, suggesting that they were illogical and 
that marihuana could never satisfy them. An illegal drug could not be used by a substantial 
number of doctors or cited as a remedy in medical texts. As the court pointed out, "We are hard 
pressed to understand how one could show that any Schedule I drug was in general use or 
generally available" (22). The court returned the case to the DEA for further explanation, but it 
offered no direct challenge to the central dogma that marihuana lacks therapeutic value. The 
DEA issued a final rejection of all pleas for reclassification in March 1992. 
<p> 
In spite of the obstructionism of the federal government, a few patients have been able to obtain 
marihuana legally for therapeutic purposes. State governments began to respond in a limited 
way to pressure from patients and physicians in the 1970s. In 1978, New Mexico enacted the 
first law designed to make marihuana available for medical use. Thirty-three states followed in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s (23). In 1992, Massachusetts became the thirty-fifth to enact such 
legislation. 
<p> 
But the laws proved difficult to implement. Since marihuana is not recognized as a medicine 
under federal law, states could dispense it only by establishing formal research programs and 
getting FDA approval for an IND (Investigational New Drug) application. Many states gave up 
as soon as the officials in charge of the programs confronted the regulatory nightmare of the 
relevant federal laws. Nevertheless, between 1978 and 1984, seventeen states received 
permission to establish programs for the use of marihuana in treating glaucoma and the nausea 
induced by cancer chemotherapy. Each of these programs has fallen into abeyance because of 
the many problems involved. 
<p> 
Take the case of Louisiana, where a law was passed in 1978 establishing a program that allowed 
a Marihuana Prescription Board to review and approve applications by physicians to treat 
patients with cannabis. The board would have preferred a simple procedure in which medical 
decisions would be entrusted to the practicing physician, but federal agencies would not supply 
cannabis without an IND. That would have required an enormous amount of paperwork and 
would have made the program intolerably cumbersome. The board therefore decided to use an 
approved research program operated by the National Cancer Institute, which was limited to 
cancer patients and employed only synthetic THC. Marihuana itself was not made legally 
available to any patient in Louisiana. With these limitations, the program proved ineffective 
Patients felt compelled to use illicit cannabis, and at least one was arrested (24). 
<p> 
Only ten states eventually established programs in which cannabis was used as a medicine. 
Among these New Mexico was the first and the most successful, largely because of the efforts of 
a young cancer patient, Lynn Pierson. In 1978 the state legislature enacted a law allowing 
physicians to prescribe marihuana to patients suffering from the nausea and vomiting of cancer 
chemotherapy. The law was later modified to comply with federal IND regulations requiring a 
research program. Considerable friction immediately developed between the FDA and the 
people in charge of the New Mexico program. The FDA demanded studies with placebos 
(inactive substances) as controls; the physicians in the New Mexico program wanted to provide 
sick patients with care. The FDA wanted to proceed slowly; the attitudes of the physicians 
reflected the urgency of their patients' needs. Eventually a compromise was reached. Patients 
would be assigned at random to treatment with marihuana cigarettes or synthetic THC capsules. 
But prolonged delays suggested to the New Mexico officials that the FDA was not dealing in 
good faith, and tensions began to grow. At one point state officials even considered using 
confiscated marihuana, and the Chief of the State Highway Patrol was asked whether it could be 
supplied. 
<p> 
In August 1978, Lynn Pierson, who had made such a heroic effort to establish a compassionate 
program, died of cancer without ever having received legal marihuana. Now the FDA approved 
the New Mexico IND, only to rescind the approval a few weeks later, after the public furor 
surrounding Pierson's death had died down. At that point New Mexico officials considered 
holding a public press conference to condemn federal officials for "unethical and immoral 
behavior." Finally, in November 1978, the program was approved; supplies of marihuana were 
promised within a month, but not delivered for two months. 
<p> 
The random design of the program was soon violated. Patients discussed among themselves the 
relative merits of the two types of treatment and switched when they wanted; this also gave them 
a sense of control over their own care. But many believed, despite the denials of the National 
Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), that the cigarettes they received were not of adequate potency. 
The state never conducted an independent assay. Some patients left the program in order to buy 
cannabis on the streets, saying it was better than either government marihuana or synthetic THC. 
<p> 
From 1978 to 1986 about 250 cancer patients in New Mexico received either marihuana or THC; 
after conventional medications failed to control their nausea and vomiting. For these patients 
both marihuana and THC were effective, but marihuana was superior. More than 90 percent 
reported significant or total relief from nausea and vomiting. Only three adverse effects were 
reported in the entire program - anxiety reactions that were easily treated by simple reassurance 
(25). 
<p> 
The successful programs in other states resembled the one in New Mexico. It was understood 
that "research" was merely a disguise; the aim was to relieve suffering. Although the results did 
not meet the methodological standards for controlled clinical research, they did confirm the 
effectiveness of cannabis and the advantage of smoked marihuana over oral THC. Incidentally, 
none of the programs reported problems with abuse or diversion of either THC or marihuana 
cigarettes. 
<p> 
A New York State Department of Health report on the therapeutic use of cannabis asked why 
more patients and physicians had not enrolled in the New York Program. it concluded that there 
were several reasons. First, physicians were skeptical because of their limited training and 
experience. Second, bureaucratic obstacles were enormous. As the report states, "Hospital 
pharmacists and administrators complain about paperwork and procedures. Physicians complain 
about burdensome reporting and application requirements. At least 16 physicians have inquired 
into the availability of marijuana, but have chosen not to enroll in the program because they 
perceive a large amount of bureaucratic procedure." A third possibility was that many patients 
and physicians decided it was easier to get marihuana of good quality on the street. 
<p> 
At about the same time the state programs were being instituted, growing demand forced the 
FDA to institute an Individual Treatment IND (commonly referred to as Compassionate Use IND 
or compassionate IND) for the use of individual physicians whose patients needed marihuana. 
The application process was not easy, because INDs were designed for an entirely different 
purpose - making pharmaceutical companies assure the safety of new drugs. First the patient in 
need of cannabis had to persuade a physician to apply to the FDA for an IND. The physician 
then had to file a special form with the DEA covering Schedule I drugs. If the application was 
approved by both agencies, the physician then had to fill out special order forms for marihuana, 
which were sent to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). NIDA grew cannabis on a 
farm at the University of Mississippi - the only legal marihuana farm in the United States and 
sent it to North Carolina, where it was rolled into cigarettes that were supposed to have the same 
potency as street marihuana (2 percent THC). NIDA then shipped the marihuana to a designated 
pharmacy that had to comply with stringent DEA regulations for drug security. The application 
process took four to eight months. Both the FDA and the DEA required constant prodding and 
rarely responded within the time specified by law. According to the Alliance for Cannabis 
Therapeutics, which helped a number of patients and physicians through the process, government 
agencies routinely seemed to lose some of the application forms, and the doctor had to resubmit 
them, sometimes more than once. Understandably, most physicians did not want to become 
entangled in the paperwork, especially since many also believe there is some stigma attached to 
prescribing cannabis. 
<p> 
In 1976 Robert Randall became the first patient to receive a Compassionate IND for the use of 
marihuana. In the next 13 years the government reluctantly awarded about a half dozen more. 
Then, in 1989, the FDA was deluged with applications from people with AIDS. A case that 
called attention to the absurd and appalling consequences of the medical ban on marihuana was 
the government assault on Kenneth and Barbra Jenks, a Florida couple in their twenties who 
contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion given to the husband, a hemophiliac. Both were 
suffering from nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss caused by AIDS or AZT; their doctor feared 
that Barbra Jenks would die of starvation before the disease killed her. In early 1989 the Jenks 
learned about marihuana through a support group for people with AIDS. They began to smoke it 
and for a year they led a fairly normal life. They felt better, regained lost weight and were able 
to stay out of the hospital; Kenneth Jenks even kept his full-time job. 
<p> 
Then someone informed on them. On March 29, 1990, ten armed narcotics officers battered 
down the door of their trailer home, held a gun to Barbra Jenks' head, and seized the evidence of 
crime, two small marihuana plants they had been growing because they could no longer afford 
the street price of the drug. Cultivation of marihuana is a felony in Florida; the Jenkses faced up 
to five years in prison. At their trial in July the Jenkes used the defense of medical necessity, 
which is rarely successful. The judge rejected this defense and convicted the Jenkses, although 
he imposed no real punishment. The conviction was later overturned by a higher court and the 
defense of medical necessity sustained. 
<p> 
The case received national publicity and the Jenkses were able to obtain a Compassionate IND. 
Now the FDA was inundated with new requests from AIDS sufferers. The number of extant 
Compassionate INDs rose from five to thirty-four in a year. In early June 1991, Deputy National 
Drug Control Policy Director Herbert D. Kleber assured a national television audience that 
anyone with a legitimate medical need for marihuana would be able to get a Compassionate IND. 
But a few weeks later, on June 21, James O. Mason, chief of the Public Health Service, 
announced that the program would be suspended because it undercut the administration's 
opposition to the use of illegal drugs. "If it is perceived that the public Health Service is going 
around giving marihuana to folks, there would be a perception that this stuff can't be so bad," 
Mason said. "It gives a bad signal. I don't mind doing that if there is no other way of helping 
these people... But there is not a shred of evidence that smoking marihuana assists a person with 
AIDS." Since then, no new Compassionate INDs have been granted, despite hundreds of 
applications. 
<p> 
After keeping the program in limbo "under review" for nine months, the Public Health 
Service discontinued it in March 1992. Twenty-eight patients whose applications have already 
been approved (including some whose stories follow) will not be supplied with the promised 
marihuana. Twelve patients now receiving marihuana will continue to receive it. After more 
than twenty years in which hundreds of people have worked through state legislatures, federal 
courts, and administrative agencies to make marihuana available for suffering people, these 
twelve are the only ones for whom it is not still a forbidden medicine.

<p> 
Shortly after his arrest last May, Ronald "Stich" Miller showed off what was left of his marijuana-growing 
facility and recalled his plants, more than 100 of them, with pride. He boasts that the confiscated crop of 
"Seattle Blue" clones he was cultivating in a Bainbridge Island, Washington, mobile home could have been 
featured in <i>High Times</i>, the marijuana aficionado's journal. The police who arrested Miller and 
JoAnna 
McKee, his live-in companion, were similarly impressed, according to McKee. "The police told us they 
never 
had seen anything as clean as our plants," she says. 
<p> 
The police shouldn't have been surprised. Miller and McKee are the founders and operators of 
Green+Cross 
Patient Coop, Washington state's sole above-ground medical-marijuana network, an open secret on the 
island 
and in Seattle, a half-hour ferry ride to the east. Earlier in the year, Miller was shown delivering marijuana 
on a 
Seattle PBS program called <i>Health Notes</i>, in a segment originally produced for the <i>McNeil- 
Lehrer 
NewsHour</i>. In 1994, McKee unsuccessfully lobbied the Bainbridge Island City Council for a 
resolution 
urging local police to deprioritize arrests of pot users with painful medical conditions. The resolution also 
urged 
the federal government to permit the use of doctor-prescribed marijuana. 
<p> 
Looking through Miller and McKee's files after the arrest, the police would have seen the signed doctors' 
letters 
required by Green+Cross, certifying that the patients had informed their physicians of their intent to seek 
marijuana from the coop. The couple also kept a mission statement: "GCPC will not sell cannabis. Instead, 
it 
will be given away with the understanding that financial contributions will be accepted and should be 
sufficient 
to maintain our operation costs. Persons who are unable to make a financial contribution shall not be 
denied 
cannabis because of their inability to pay." 
<p> 
Judging by the middle-aged couple's modest home, from which they were evicted shortly after their arrest, 
Miller and McKee were not turning many people away. A "Don't Tread on Me" banner next to their front 
door, 
which police kicked open to serve a search warrant, advertised their attitude. (In September, a Kitsap 
County 
Superior Court judge threw out the county's case against Miller and McKee because police overstepped the 
limits of the search warrant.) Inside the mobile home, the couple didn't have much in the way of 
possessions. 
They are frank about their marijuana use and about why they started Green+Cross. Money wasn't one of 
the 
reasons. "In a year's production, if we were providing for the street, we'd be able to make $500.000," 
Miller 
says. "We did everything for donation and cost." McKee says patients did not donate any set amount. "It 
was 
always pay what you want." 
<p> 
Green+Cross, which had been up and running for a little less than two years before the bust, was well 
known in 
Seattle's AIDS community. Shortly after Miller and McKee were arrested, Bill and Jim, partners and co-op 
members from Seattle, dropped in on the couple for a visit and stayed for an interview I had scheduled with 
Miller and McKee. Bill and Jim had found out about Green+Cross through an AIDS treatment clinic in 
Seattle. 
"A lot of doctors don't really want to talk about it," Bill says. "It was a case worker who slipped a number 
to me 
and said, 'You might want to get in touch.'" Neither man has much to lose by getting involved with Miller 
and 
McKee. Bill has been struggling with AIDS for nine years, while Jim suffers from degenerative arthritis, 
prostate cancer, and a history of strokes. 
<p> 
The two vouch for the quality of the product provided by Green+Cross. Although his face is gaunt, Bill 
says he 
has gained six pounds since he started using Green+Cross marijuana, which helps him with his appetite. 
Smoking marijuana also helps Bill with another constant of AIDS. "It's like running a marathon. and you 
ache 
all the time," he says. "Marijuana helps relieve that feeling." He especially appreciates that Green+Cross's 
product is, as the police had remarked, "clean," meaning free of molds that can cause respiratory infections, 
which can prove deadly to people with AIDS. 
<p> 
Jim appreciates Green+Cross for another reason: He had been on harder stuff under doctors' orders. He is 
using 
Green+Cross marijuana in a tea form and credits it with getting him out of a wheelchair and onto crutches. 
He 
says the pot tea is preferable to pharmaceuticals prescribed through the Veterans' Administration. "They 
saved 
my life, but they're too freehanded with hard drugs," Jim says of his V.A. doctors. "I wanted off morphine 
and 
codeine." 
<p> 
With 70 members, Green+Cross may be unique for Washington state, but it is just one of many above- 
ground 
marijuana "buyers' clubs" in the United States. Club members suffer from various diseases, with AIDS, 
cancer, 
arthritis, and glaucoma the most common. Many also suffer from the side effects of AIDS treatment and 
cancer 
chemotherapy. They seek marijuana to relieve pain, control muscle spasms and seizures, overcome 
nausea, 
stimulate appetite, and (in the case of glaucoma) relieve intraocular pressure that can lead to blindness. 
With 
the exception of eight people who receive marijuana under the federal government's "compassionate use" 
program, which has been closed to new patients since 1992, the drug is not legally available as a medicine. 
<p> 
In 1988 the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, concluded 
that 
the federal government should reclassify marijuana so doctors could prescribe it, but he was overruled by 
DEA 
Administrator John C. Lawn. Many political bodies and health organizations, including 35 state 
legislatures, 
the American Public Health Association, the American Bar Association, and the California Medical 
Association, also say the ban on medical marijuana should be lifted. In November U.S. Rep. Barney Frank 
(D- 
Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618, which would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for a variety of conditions. 
But 
the buyers' clubs are not waiting for a change in policy. 
<p> 
With some 6,000 registered members, the San Francisco-based Cannabis Buyers Club is the largest and 
most 
conspicuous of the clubs. Born in the city's gay Castro District, the club works with the tacit approval of 
City 
Hall. As John Entwistle, the club's volunteer coordinator, notes, the city's policy of looking the other way 
prevents otherwise law-abiding citizens from supporting the street trade in marijuana. Non-enforcement 
also 
saves the San Francisco Police Department the bad publicity of arresting and jailing people with terminal 
conditions, many of them members of the city's politically powerful gay community. 
<p> 
The club recently moved from a small storefront to a 29,000-square-foot commercial space on Market 
Street, 
just a few blocks away from City Hall and the state and federal buildings. Club director Dennis Peron says 
rent 
for the multi-level space is nominal, thanks to a club sympathizer whose wife died of cancer. At the street- 
level 
entrance a group of bouncers screens club members, would-be members, and visitors. A flight of steps 
brings 
you to the club's offices; another flight up is the membership desk, where photo IDs and letters of diagnosis 
are 
inspected before membership is granted. 
<p> 
Hazel Rodgers, a 76-year-old volunteer working the desk, says it's rare that people con their way into the 
club. 
Indeed, buying marijuana around the corner in the Civic Center is much easier and can be done any time of 
the 
day or night. Jeffrey Reed, an HIV-positive registered nurse who moved from Fort Worth to San Francisco 
to 
work at the club, says intuition and knowledge of the AIDS culture play a big part in screening out healthy 
people with bogus medical claims. "You can tell," he says. "People who have HIV, we have a vernacular 
other 
people don't." Entwistle says the club provides comfort and sanctuary for AIDS patients who are 
approaching 
the end. "Doctors don't know what to do with them," he says. "If they die, they die happy." 
<p> 
Although the club gets most of its referrals through the gay community, not all of its members have AIDS. 
Peron, who started the club after he was arrested for providing his ailing lover with marijuana, believes that 
practically any painful medical condition can be treated with marijuana. This broad approach may leave 
the 
club open to criticism. Along with letters of diagnosis from physicians at respected medical centers such as 
Berkeley's Alta Bates Hospital and the University of California at San Francisco, a file that Peron showed 
me 
included more than a few letters from chiropractors attesting to painful conditions that are difficult or 
impossible to verify objectively. 
<p> 
A skeptic may also be troubles by the almost festive atmosphere at the Cannabis Buyers Club. Beyond the 
registration desk is a paraphernalia counter and, most stunning of all the club's features, a third floor not 
unlike 
an Amsterdam marijuana bar. There club members smoke pot and socialize. A counter serving the lunch- 
time 
crowd also sells marijuana in leaf form, in baked goods, and in salves. Behind the counter a price board 
lists the 
available marijuana along with prices, the best being a AAA-rated "California green" variety priced the day 
I 
visited at $75 per one-eighth ounce. A Mexican variety costing $20 an eighth was also available. Peron 
says 
the club sells roughly 10 pounds of marijuana, which he purchases, inspects, and grades, a week. 
<p> 
The flagrant nature of the club's activities makes some members of the medical marijuana movement 
uneasy. 
Even Green+Cross's Miller says he doesn't want his operation to be tagged as a "party room" because the 
Cannabis Buyers Club has advised it. The San Francisco club had a close call last April, when the DEA 
and the 
FBI put it under surveillance and went to the city police department for help. The SFPD declined to get 
involved, and word about the surveillance got out, which gave Peron the chance to organize a 
demonstration in 
front of the city's federal building. The investigation was ultimately called off. 
<p> 
While Peron's in-your-face style may raise eyebrows, he deserves respect for his organizational and 
political 
skills. The club also serves as headquarters for Californians for Compassionate Use, which is trying to get 
a 
medical marijuana initiative on the 1996 ballot. The most important provision of the initiative would 
simply 
recognize what's already going on between many patients and doctors: "No physician in the State of 
California 
shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for recommending marijuana to it patient for treatment 
of 
nausea, appetite loss, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or other intractable illness for 
which 
marijuana provides relief, providing that such medicinal use of marijuana would, in such physician's 
professional medical judgment, be of benefit to his or her patient." 
<p> 
There's reason to believe that the 600,000 signatures needed to get the initiative on the ballot will be 
gathered if 
people line up to what they've been telling pollsters. Americans are generally sympathetic to patients 
seeking 
medical marijuana. (In fact, many are surprised to learn it is not legally available.) A November 1995 poll 
commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union found that 79 percent of Americans think letting 
physicians prescribe marijuana is a "good idea." Eighty-five percent of respondents said they would favor 
making marijuana legally available for medical uses where it has proven effective. 
<p> 
In California, where Gov. Pete Wilson has twice vetoed medical marijuana bills, a March 1995 poll by 
David 
Binder Research found that 66 percent of registered voters support legalizing marijuana for medicinal 
purposes 
(compared to 22 percent who favored legalization of marijuana use by adults). Support in some parts of 
the 
state is even stronger. In San Francisco in 1991, about 80 percent of voters approved a referendum urging 
the 
legalization of medical marijuana. In 1992, 77 percent of Santa Cruz County voters favored pot by 
prescription. 
The state legislature has repeatedly expressed support for the idea by large margins, as have county and 
city 
boards of supervisors around the state. Major California newspapers, including the <i>San Francisco 
Chronicle</i>, the <i>Oakland Tribune</i>, and the <i>Orange County Register</i>, have editorialized in 
favor 
of marijuana use for medical purposes. 
<p> 
The medical marijuana movement continues to attract support from conservatives as well as liberals and 
libertarians. Journalists Such as William F. Buckley Jr. and Richard Brookhiser have long argued that 
patients 
should have access to pot, and on the campaign trail conservatives are coming to share that view. During a 
July 
meeting with the editorial board of <i>The Charlotte Observer</i>, Republican presidential candidate 
Patrick 
Buchanan said the use of marijuana as a medicine should be a matter between patient and physician. "If a 
doctor indicated to his patient that this was the only way to alleviate certain painful symptoms," Buchanan 
told 
the <i>Observer</i>, "I would defer to the doctor's judgment." 
<p> 
The question that elicited this response was Submitted by Rick Doblin, a Charlotte resident who heads the 
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which supports pot by prescription. Buchanan's 
answer 
"was eminently reasonable," Doblin says. "We've done a lot of lobbying of sympathetic Republicans, but 
they 
were afraid to take a public position. When Buchanan said that, it was refreshing." 
<p> 
One person in particular found Buchanan's statement more than refreshing and would later ask the 
candidate to 
confirm it. George McMahon of Bode, Iowa, suffers from Nail Patella Syndrome, a painful and terminal 
neurological and bone disorder. He is one of eight Americans who may legally smoke marijuana, provided 
by 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse. McMahon smokes the marijuana to ease the pain caused by his 
condition 
and by the numerous operations he has undergone. He has another reason to want marijuana rescheduled 
so that 
it can prescribed: His 24-year-old daughter also has Nail Patella Syndrome. 
<p> 
At an October campaign stop in Bode, McMahon asked Buchanan what he thought about pot by 
prescription. 
According to the <i>Storm Lake Pilot Tribune</i>, Buchanan reversed himself, saying doctors should not 
prescribe pot because it's a worse drug than alcohol. But when McMahon told Buchanan about his 
condition, 
the candidate said, "If everything you say is true, and I choose to believe you, I would support you in a 
second." 
What wasn't reported by the local newspaper was McMahon's meeting with Buchanan after the campaign 
stop 
officially ended. "I went and talked to him later, and he said he couldn't understand why the DEA was 
controlling my medicine," McMahon says. "He seemed very sincere to me." 
<p> 
Less prominent conservatives also support medical marijuana. A conservative Christian from Poulsbo, 
Washington, began using marijuana years ago, at the recommendation of his oncologist, while undergoing 
treatment for testicular cancer. The man, who asked me not to use his name, described himself as a 
supporter of 
his area's Republican state representative, also a conservative Christian, and a backer of a statewide anti- 
gay 
rights initiative. "I think I have an opportunity as a conservative and a Christian to bring some credibility 
to the 
[medical marijuana] issue and bridge a gap," he says. 
<p> 
Although medical marijuana may seem a natural issue for the left, the conditions that can be treated with 
pot 
affect people across the political spectrum. Personal experiences with the medical benefits of marijuana 
have a 
powerful impact not only on patients but on their relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Their testimony 
makes 
medical marijuana a humanitarian issue that transcends partisan differences. Supporters of Barney Frank's 
medical marijuana bill note that it reads a lot like a 1981 bill co-sponsored by a second-term congressman 
from Georgia named Newt Gingrich.

<blockquote> 
The antinausea and antivomiting effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in children  
receiving cancer chemotherapy were compared with those of metoclopramide syrup and  
prochlorperazine tablets in two double-blind studies. THC was found to be a significantly better  
antinausea and antivomiting agent, but not all patients obtained relief of nausea and vomiting with  
THC.  In some patients, THC enhanced appetite during a course of chemotherapy.  In two patients,  
a "high" associated with THC administration was reported.  Drowsiness was reported significantly  
more frequently with THC.</blockquote> 
<p> 
Nausea and vomiting resulting from the administration of cancer chemotherapeutic agents are one  
of the major causes of morbidity, and seriously diminish the quality of life during treatment which  
may last from six months to two years Currently available antiemetic agents usually do not  
effectively control these symptoms. Sallan et alii have reported that oral administration of delta 9  
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), when compared with a placebo, caused a significant reduction in the  
frequency of nausea and vomiting (1). 
<p> 
This paper reports two double blind studies in which the antiemetic properties of THC were  
compared with those of Metoclopramide (Maxolon) and prochlorperazine (Stemetil). 
<p> 
<b>Patients and Methods</b> 
<p> 
Nineteen children with various neoplastic diseases requiring chemotherapy were entered into the  
study which compared the antiemetic effects of THC with those of metoclopramide. Informed  
consent was obtained from the parents and the children, who were informed that THC was a  
purified form of marihuana. THC was obtained in a limited amount, in the form of brown 5 mg and  
2.5 mg capsules. Included in the first study were 15 males and four females. Their ages ranged from  
five to 19 years with a median age of 11 years The study was designed to be double blind. As THC  
was presented in the form of brown capsules and metoclopramide could not be obtained in the same  
form it was decided to dispense metoclopramide in the form of a syrup at a concentration of 1  
mg/ml. Placebo capsules made of soft gelatin containing peanut oil and placebo syrup were  
dispensed together with the antiemetic preparations Thus, the patients were taking either THC and  
placebo syrup or metoclopramide syrup and placebo capsules.  THC was administered in a dose of  
10 mg/m2 with a maximum dose of 15 mg. It was given two hours before chemotherapy and at four,  
eight, 16 and 24 hours after the first dose. Metoclopramide was given in a dose of 10 mg for patients  
with body surface area (SA) greater than 0.7 m2, and in a dose of 5 mg for patients with SA less  
than 0.7 m2. It was given on the same time schedule as THC but, to prevent neurological toxicity  
the four hour dose was always a placebo. 
<p> 
To compare the antiemetic properties of the two agents in the same patients receiving the same  
chemotherapy, a crossover study was designed. For 50 patients, five consecutive courses of the  
same chemotherapy were randomized so that the patients received antiemetic agents in all possible  
combinations, except those which allowed the use of the same antiemetic on five consecutive  
occasions Thus, patients could receive any of eight combinations (for example, THC, THC, THC,  
THC, metoclopramide (M); or THC, THC, THC, M, M or THC, THC, M, M, M, and so on)  
Patients who received at least one course of THC and one of metoclopramide during repeated  
courses of the same chemotherapy were considered suitable for analysis in the crossover studies 
<p> 
During the course of the first study, it seemed likely that one of the agents was associated with a  
high incidence of post chemotherapy nausea and vomiting which caused patients to refuse to  
continue with the study. When the code was broken, this was found to be metoclopramide. In eight  
patients, it was possible to compare the effects of metoclopramide and THC by the crossover  
method. 
<p> 
With the remainder of the THC, a new double blind study was undertaken, this time comparing the  
antiemetic effect of THC with prochlorperazine. After informed consent, 14 other patients were  
entered into the study, seven males and seven females, whose ages ranged from six to 19 years, with  
a median age of 14 years. In this study, crossover was possible in seven children. 
<p> 
The design of this study was altered only by eliminating placebo syrup and replacing it with placebo  
tablets of an identical appearance to prochlorperazine The doses of prochlorperazine were as  
follows: for children with SA from 0.7 m2 to 1.1 m2 - 5 mg two hours before chemotherapy, a  
placebo four hours after chemotherapy, and 5 mg at eight, 16, and 24 hours after chemotherapy, for  
those with SA from 1.1 m2 to 1.4 m2 - 10 mg two hours before chemotherapy, a placebo four hours  
after chemotherapy, 10 mg at eight hours, and 5 mg at 16 hours and 24 hours after chemotherapy for  
those with SA greater than l.4 m2 all doses were l0 mg with placebo given at four hours after  
chemotherapy. 
<p> 
The results of the study were analyzed by asking the patients and the family to complete a  
questionnaire which assessed presence or absence of nausea, anorexia and drowsiness, frequency of  
vomiting, and the presence of symptoms suggestive of a "high." The family and patients were asked  
to note unusual euphoria, agitation, dreams or altered behavior. When patients were admitted to  
hospital, or received chemotherapy in the day treatment room, response was assessed by the nurses.  
Significance of difference in symptoms was analyzed by Fisher's exact probability test. 
<p> 
<b>Results</b> 
<p> 
In the first study, the code was broken before equal numbers or episodes had been randomized.  
Thus, 17 courses of anticancer chemotherapy were randomized to receive THC and 25 courses to  
receive metoclopramide. Patients were treated with essentially similar chemotherapy regimens  
(Table 1 ). There was significantly lower incidence of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in the THC  
group. Drowsiness was reported more often in THC treated patients (Table 2).  In eight patients,  
there was crossover of anti-emetic drugs (Table 3).  Patients who received THC had significantly  
less nausea and vomiting, but reported drowsiness significantly more often. In the crossover  
episodes, there was no significant difference in the reports of anorexia, but an increase in appetite  
was reported only in the THC group on four occasions. 
<p> 
In the second study, 18 episodes were randomized to receive THC and 18 to receive  
prochlorperazine.  Patients were treated with essentially similar chemotherapy regimens (Table 4).   
The results are shown in Table 5. There was a significantly lower incidence of nausea and vomiting,  
and an increase in the incidence of drowsiness in the THC group.  There was no significant  
difference in the incidence of anorexia, but three patients who were receiving THC reported an  
increase in appetite. 
<p> 
In seven patients, crossover of antiemetic drugs was possible. Nausea and vomiting were  
significantly less frequent in the THC group, while drowsiness was more common.  There was no  
significant difference in the incidence of anorexia. 
<p> 
Agitation, anxiety, and bad dreams were reported by only one patient who was receiving THC.   
Another patient reported a feeling of euphoria, lightness and increased appetite.  The only other  
cerebral effects noted consistently were drowsiness. 
<p> 
<b>Discussion</b> 
<p> 
The results of this study demonstrate that in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, THC is a  
significantly better antiemetic agent than either metoclopramide syrup or prochlorperazine tablets.  
The superior effect of THC may be ascribed to its pharmacological properties or to a more effective  
dose schedule for THC than for the other agents.  The doses of metoclopramide and  
prochlorperazine used in this study were the maximum that can be safely administered to children.   
Thus, within the safe therapeutic range, THC appears a superior antiemetic agent. In the first study,  
metoclopramide was dispensed in the form of a syrup.  This proved to be an unfortunate choice of  
presentation, as patients claimed that the appearance and texture of a syrup was nauseating.  In the  
second study, this problem was overcome by using tablets, and THC was once again shown to be a  
superior antiemetic agent. 
<p> 
THC appeared to be effective in controlling nausea and vomiting with diverse chemotherapeutic  
regimens, including high dose methotrexate (7.5 g/m2) and combination chemotherapy with drugs  
such as nitrogen mustard, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and  
prednisolone.  Not all patients however, obtained complete relief of vomiting with THC. From this  
study, we are unable to assess what factors may predict a failure to respond to THC. 
<p> 
Only two patients reported a "high" while receiving THC. In one patient, this proved so unpleasant  
that further treatment with THC was refused.  Drowsiness, however, was more common in the THC  
treated patients.  The "high" with marihuana is usually biphasic and includes a phase of drowsiness.   
As this study was conducted in children, it is possible that the hallucinatory effects were reported  
because of difficulty in understanding and expressing these symptoms by children in this age group.   
The only undesirable short term side effect of THC was a bad "trip" in one patient. As, in many  
patients, THC is more effective than currently available antiemetics, its use in cancer chemotherapy  
under medical supervision appears warranted.

<p> 
Last week the Public Health Service announced that it will phase out its program of allowing 
seriously ill patients to smoke marijuana. The reason seems to have little to do with the 
effectiveness of pot in relieving various medical symptoms and a lot to do with the politics of the 
"drug war." With the recent attention pot has received as an appetite-enhancer in AIDS cases, the 
government correctly anticipated a flood of applications from AIDS patients for 64 
"compassionate" approval of the drug. AIDS activists, who have had much success in 
liberalizing the prescription drug approval process, may have met their match. 
<p> 
The debate over the medical use of marijuana started two decades ago and has hinged on its 
effectiveness in treating glaucoma, spasticity, and chemotherapy-induced nausea. Pot, like 
heroin, is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule I drug, which means 
it has a high potential for abuse, induces harmful side effects, and has "no currently accepted 
medical use in treatment in the United States." Pot advocates argue that marijuana should be 
moved to the category of Schedule II drugs, which also have a high potential for abuse and can 
have bad side effects, but are considered to be useful medically and thus can be prescribed by 
physicians. Interestingly, cocaine - the drug war's No. 1 bogey - is a Schedule II drug. 
<p> 
In 1985 the government did recognize that the principal active ingredient in marijuana - delta-9- 
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC - has medical use. A synthetic drug containing THC is now 
available by prescription under the name Marinol, manufactured by Unimed Pharmaceuticals. 
Why does the government allow THC pills but not marijuana joints? THC has been put through 
a level of testing acceptable to the Food and Drug Administration. Because of the expense, this 
typically requires a pharmaceutical-industry corporate sponsor, which pot - a plant that grows 
like a weed and requires no processing - is unlikely to attract. 
<p> 
Nevertheless, in response to a 1972 petition for rescheduling filed by NORML and other pot 
advocacy groups, in 1988 DEA administrative law judge Francis L. Young ruled that the ban on 
prescription pot is "unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious." The DEA chose to ignore his 
recommendation for rescheduling, calling the medical use of marijuana a "cruel and dangerous 
hoax." Then this April the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. ordered the DEA to change three of its 
eight criteria for reclassification. Under those three criteria, a drug can be removed from 
Schedule I only if it is generally (i.e., legally) available and used in the medical community; by 
definition, the court noted, these are conditions that an illegal drug can never meet. The decision 
might appear to be a big victory for the medical use of marijuana. But the court did approve five 
of the DEA criteria, and pot advocates, who think the DEA will have no trouble reshaping the 
other three to satisfy the court, see this judicial path to rescheduling as effectively closed. 
<p> 
The only other path (short of congressional action) is through the FDA, which has the authority 
to tell the DEA that a drug has "currently accepted medical use" and that it should be 
rescheduled. The hope among pot and AIDS activists had been that the onslaught of 
"compassionate" approval applications by AIDS patients and their doctors - which began last 
year when two AIDS patients, Barbara and Kenny Jenks, were arrested for growing marijuana to 
treat themselves - would force the FDA to recognize marijuana's medical use. Instead, the Public 
Health Service, which oversees the FDA, has supported its decision with the same argument the 
DEA has been using for years: evidence of the medical value of marijuana is purely anecdotal 
and the drug has not been rendered safe. 
<p> 
Pot advocates acknowledge that although there is copious research on marijuana, they are short 
on the kinds of institutionally sponsored studies that would typically satisfy the FDA. And since 
marijuana treatment of appetite loss in AIDS patients is very new, there are no formal studies. 
Nevertheless, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the medical benefits of using marijuana 
outweigh the risks. The debate call be boiled down to three questions: (1) Is the drug safe? (2) 
Does it work? and (3) How does it compare with other available drugs? 
<p> 
The DEA argues that marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals, which appear in widely 
varying proportions and whose chemical properties are not completely known. Marijuana's side 
effects, it claims, are extensive, though not fully understood. Pot causes acute changes in heart 
and circulation rates, has "produced genetic and non-genetic birth defects in many animal 
species," can reduce sperm count, and "may also have a toxic effect on the human brain." Lately, 
the government, especially Herbert Kleber of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, has 
been pointing out the irony of using marijuana - which itself suppresses the immune system - in 
treating Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. 
<p> 
Although pot advocates dispute the extent of marijuana's side effects, they point out that all drugs 
have side effects, and that in the case of pot, as with other drugs, such reactions (even immune 
suppression) need to be weighed against the benefits. They note that government-approved THC 
also suppresses the immune system. (It gets you high too.) They add that common anti-emetic 
(anti-vomiting) drugs such as Compazine and Decadron can have side effects far worse than 
those of marijuana, such as liver damage and death. Dr. Ivan Silverberg, an oncologist who has 
spoken with hundreds of cancer patients who use marijuana, testified in 1988 that "the only side 
effect I've seen would be sedation," which he characterized as "mild." A study conducted by the 
state of New Mexico found adverse effects in only three of 250 patients tested. And if we may 
venture into the realm of "anecdotal" evidence, it is worth noting that tens of millions of 
Americans - including U.S. senators, prospective Supreme Court judges, and maybe even First 
Ladies - have smoked pot without suffering noticeable damage. No one has ever died of a 
marijuana overdose; the lethal dosage is so high that no human could ever smoke enough pot to 
kill himself. 
<p> 
So is pot effective? The DEA argues that its use in treating nausea, glaucoma, and spasticity has 
not been sufficiently proved by double-blind studies. And the evidence for AIDS treatment, it 
claims, is nonexistent. Yet in 1973 Dr. Leo E. Hollister of the Veterans Administration Hospital 
in Palo Alto proved scientifically what anyone who has ever smoked pot will tell you: marijuana 
gives you the munchies. Dr. Ernest Abel of Berkeley confirmed Hollister's results later that year. 
In a now-famous 1975 study, Drs. Steven Sallan and Norman Zinberg at Boston's Sidney Farber 
Cancer Research Center also confirmed that pot is effective as an anti-emetic. And a 1979 
double-blind and placebo-controlled study by Dr. Alfred Chang of the National Cancer Institute 
confirmed the 1975 results. Several states, including New Mexico, Michigan, and New York, in 
independent studies over the last twenty years, have also proved pot's effectiveness as an anti- 
emetic. And besides, notes Dr. John Morgan of CUNY Medical School, there is no rule that says 
a drug must be the best at what it does to warrant approval. If it is effective in even a small 
number of cases, it deserves serious attention as a therapeutic product. 
<p> 
The new Health and Human Services policy directive says that patients applying for medicinal 
marijuana must first try Marinol. But pot advocates point out that marijuana is more effective 
than Marinol. In a 1988 study by Dr. Vincent Vinciguerra published in the <i>New York State 
Journal of Medicine</i>, 29 percent of those who did not respond to oral THC did respond to 
smoked marijuana. The NCI/Chang study found that smoke from marijuana, absorbed through 
the lungs, acts on the brain almost immediately, while orally ingested pills can leave a nauseous 
cancer patient to suffer for several hours. Besides, notes CUNY's Morgan, "It is absurd that we 
only have an oral tablet" to treat vomiting. It's like treating diarrhea with a suppository. 
<p> 
But if the government is truly looking to satisfy its "currently accepted medical use" criteria, 
officials should turn to a just-published study in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>, 
conducted by Richard Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman of Harvard's Kennedy School. Forty- 
eight percent of oncologists responding said they would prescribe marijuana to some of their 
patients if it were legal. Fifty-four percent said they thought smoked marijuana should be 
available by prescription, and 44 percent said they had recommended pot to a patient, even 
though it is illegal. 
<p> 
In justifying the new decision, PHS chief James O. Mason told me: "It puts the government in 
sort of a tenuous situation to be passing out marijuana cigarettes that can be used by a person that 
can cloud their judgment if they choose to use an automobile or get out in the street or in the 
context of sexual behavior. I think it sends a signal that's not the best signal." Mason's rationale 
was uncannily prophesied by Judge Young in his 1988 decision: "There are those who, in all 
sincerity, argue that the transfer of marijuana to Schedule II will 'send a signal' that marijuana is 
'OK' generally for recreational use. This argument is specious.... If marijuana should be placed in 
Schedule II, in obedience to the law, then that is where marijuana should be placed, regardless of 
misinterpretation of the placement by some." The fact that AIDS has been added to the list of 
conditions treatable by pot should have helped, not hindered, efforts at reclassification. 
<p> 
Marijuana, it seems, does indeed cloud the mind. But in this instance, the clouded minds are in 
government buildings, not in doctors' offices or patients' sick rooms.

<b>Summary</b>
<p>
The chronic motor handicaps of a 30-year-old multiple  
sclerosis patient acutely improved while he smoked a marihuana cigarette.  This effect was  
quantitatively assessed by means of clinical rating, electromyographic investigation of the leg  
flexor reflexes and electromagnetic recording of the hand action tremor.  It is concluded that  
cannabinoids may have powerful beneficial effects on both spasticity and ataxia that warrant  
further evaluation. 
<p> 
<b>Introduction</b> 
<p> 
This study was prompted by a young man with multiple sclerosis (MS) who used marihuana as a  
remedy for his various motor, micturition and sexual handicaps. After smoking a marihuana  
cigarette on the ward, he clinically. improved. He agreed to the beneficial effects of marihuana  
being investigated by means of quantitative clinical and electrophysiological assessment. 
<p> 
<b>Case Report</b> 
<p> 
This male patient, born in 1955, had had MS since 1983. At the time of our experiments he was  
bound to a wheelchair because of severe limb and gait ataxia and spastic tetraparesis. After  
micturition, his residual urine volume was 100-150ml. He complained of impotence, with  
erections lasting less than 5 min and lacking ejaculation. He tried a marihuana cigarette in about  
1984 and noted an instantaneous improvement of his motor and sexual functions lasting for  
several days. Since then, he regularly took some marihuana biscuits each week, which enabled  
him to climb stairs, to walk on even ground, and to have erections for more than 30min, allowing  
him a quite satisfactory sexual life. 
<p> 
<b>Methods</b> 
From 12 October 1985 the patient abstained from all drugs, including marihuana. He was  
hospitalized between 17 October and 25 October. On 22 October, one "experimental" marihuana  
cigarette was allowed, and various electrophysiological experiments were performed as described  
below. 
<p> 
<i>Clinical rating</i> was performed daily by the same neurologist and on 22 October before  
and after the "experimental" cigarette. Rating comprised motor functions relevant to the  
electrophysiological tests described below (see Fig. 1). 
<p> 
The <i>flexor reflex</i> was elicited by a painful electrical shock to the foot sole and recorded  
from the quadriceps (Q), posterior biceps (PB), gastroenemius (G) and tibialis anterior (TA)  
muscles.  The EMG was full-wave rectified, and eight consecutive reflexes were summated.   
Five control series of eight consecutive reflexes each were run at intervals of about 5 min.  The  
patient was then asked to take one whiff of his "experimental" cigarette, and further series of  
reflexes were run in the manner described above (for details see [12]). 
<p> 
<i>Finger movements</i> were recorded in a standardized pointing task performed before and  
after both the "experimental" cigarette and the flexor reflex experiment.  Basically, the recording  
device consisted of a three-coil-transmitter system generating non-homogeneous magnetic fields,  
and a miniaturized receiver coil attached to the finger tip.  When the finger moved through the  
magnetic fields a signal was induced in the receiver coil, allowing the computation of the two- 
dimensional movement trajectory (for details see [15]).  Ten trials were performed before and  
after marihuana smoking, each consisting of a pointing movement of the right index finger over a  
10-cm distance.  The forearm rested on a stable support, but the finger and hand could not reach  
the target. 
<p> 
<b>Results</b> 
<p> 
<i>Clinical rating</i> showed a moderate deterioration of motor functions between 17 October  
and 22 October (Fig. 1).  On 22 October, before the "experimental" cigarette, he was incapable of  
walking a few steps even with support; his muscle force in the legs did not exceed MRC grade 3.  
Muscle tone ranged between slightly and moderated increased, and the leg deep tendon reflexes  
were exaggerated or clonic with sustained ankle and knee clonus.  The receptive field of the  
Babinski sign covered the whole foot and the shin.  Ataxia in the arms was severe and could not  
be tested in the legs because of distinct hip flexor paresis. 
<p> 
About 45 min after the marihuana cigarette, muscle force was somewhat increased in the knee  
extensors and ankle flexors (but not in the hip flexors), and muscle tone was reduced.  The leg  
deep tendon reflexes showed normalization, too, corresponding to a clear shortening of the  
periods of clonus.  The receptive field of the Babinski sign was confined to the lateral foot sole  
margin.  Ataxia in finger-nose testing was moderate.  After the flexor reflex experiment, the  
patient was able to walk a few metres between the couch and his wheelchair with support.  Some  
of these improvements lasted beyond 23 October and even 24 October (Fig. 1). 
<p> 
The <i>flexor reflex</i> showed the desynchronized and prolonged reflex pattern typical of  
spastic paresis (Fig. 2a; cf [13]).  As soon as 2 min after the whiff of the marihuana cigarette, a  
clear attenuation of the reflex activity was noted.  Attenuation was about equal in all four  
muscles (20%-30% of the last three control recordings) and progressed until 17 min after the  
whiff.  A second whiff (18 min after the first one) did not induce further reflex attenuation.   
Single sweep recordings showed that the reflex attenuation after marihuana was not due to  
enhanced habituation: after marihuana even the first of the eight consecutive reflex responses  
was attenuated. 
<p> 
<I>Electromagnetic recording of action tremor</I> revealed a coarse 3 Hz hand and finger  
tremor with an amplitude between 1 and 3cm, persisting throughout nearly the whole movement.   
Hours after the "experimental" cigarette, action tremor was almost completely abolished,  
although the movements were made at about the same speed (Fig. 2b). 
<p> 
<b>Discussion</b> 
<p> 
Our findings clearly show that there are indeed motor actions of marihuana which were (a)  
reproducible in a laboratory situation most exhaustive to the patient, (b) quantitatively assessable  
by means of electrophysiological testing, and (c) in line with the results of clinical rating.  Our  
findings further correspond with earlier anecdotal clinical reports [4, 6, 11, 14]. 
<p> 
Little is known about the neurophysiological background of the antispastic and antiataxic actions  
of marihuana seen in our patient.  However, some findings in experimental animals seem  
relevant to our observations.  Cannabinoids in higher dosages attenuate the monosynaptic reflex  
[1, 2, 17, 18] principally corresponding to the attenuation of both deep tendon reflexes and  
clonus in our patient (Fig. 1).  Polysynaptic reflexes were also attenuated after  
tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives in experimental animals [1, 7, 20], fitting in well with the  
narrowing of the receptive field of the Babinski sign (Fig. 1) and with the results of our flexor  
reflex experiment.  As cannabinoids have analgesic properties [16, 20], attenuation of the  
pathological flexor reflex in the present case could represent analgesic rather than antispastic  
effects of the drug.  However, analgesic effects are also attributed to several antispastic drugs  
[10, 21] and, on the other hand, classical analgesics such as opioids may improve spastic  
symptoms [19].  One might, therefore, indeed wonder whether both the antispastic and analgesic  
actions of such drugs are in fact at least to a substantial degree based on common neuronal  
mechanisms such as an increase of presynaptic inhibition or a decrease of postsynaptic excitation  
of multireceptive interneurones at various levels of the neuraxis.  Whatever the mechanism, the  
antispastic actions of marihuana in both clinical rating and electrophysiological testing are  
similar to those seen in spastic patients after either 0.3 mg tizanidine [13], 150 mg clonidine, or  
10 mg diazepam (unpublished observations).  The important difference is that marihuana  
apparently also has antiataxic actions (Fig. 2b; see also [4]) not ascribed to any antispastic drug. 
<p> 
The biochemical basis of the motor effects of marihuana is obscure.  Available data, although  
somewhat controversial, suggest that cannabinoids release brain serotonin from its storage sites  
and block its re-uptake [8], inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins within the CNS [9] and - in  
large doses - elevate brain acetylcholine and reduce its utilization [5].  The relationship of these  
neurotransmitters to spasticity and ataxia is unknown: none of the well-established antispastic  
drugs is thought to interfere with them; they are onlv scarcely, if at all, found within the  
cerebellum [3].

Inscribed on the facade of the Ministry of Truth, these words summarize the federal medical and 
scientific policies in the field of moral pharmacology. With this most recent groupthink revision 
of scientific newspeak, cannabis history now starts in 1981 in response to the introduction of a 
bill in Congress (H.R. 4498) "to provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations 
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illness and to provide adequate supplies of 
marijuana for such use," and promises a review of the literature, which, except for one citation in 
1889, one in 1947 and one in 1953, the expunged literature is now comprised mostly of research 
conducted in the 1970's. Thus, the perspective of the Committee is based on minimal experience 
in therapeutic applications, deprived of the practical experience from clinical access enjoyed by 
their colleagues of half a century ago when cannabis was available by prescription. 
<p> 
Most important in therapeutic potential and medical uses of marijuana are the omissions. Left 
out was the fact that cannabis presentations were widely used in Western medicine from 1839 to 
the early 1940's. Omitted: concise and accurate descriptions of the medicinal applications of 
cannabis that appeared in the <i>U.S. Pharmacopoeia</i> and Goodman and Gilman's textbook 
of pharmacology, second edition (1955). Forgotten: primary scientific, structure-activity and 
pharmacologic studies by Professor S. Loewe (1950) in the 1940's and early 1950's. Neglected: 
comprehensive clinical research by the Mayor's Committee on Marihuana in 1944.

A reasonably fair assessment of variable results with different varieties of the illness. Indeed, 
topical application would be desirable in nonneurogenic glaucoma, but solubility characteristics 
of cannabinoids would appear to be intrinsically irritating. It would appear that slow titration 
with natural or synthetic cannabinoids orally (Reynolds 1890) would enhance the possibility of 
favorable results with the greatest medical safety.

<center><b>ANTIEMETIC ACTION</b></center> 
<p> 
Indeed, the discovery of cannabis as an antiemetic is a most important and truly new discovery 
that was not known to medicine when it was available. It is exciting to learn of the positive 
results, and one can only wonder why an inhalant cannot be developed to deliver purified natural 
and synthetic cannabinoids. The inhaled route is inherently preferable especially when nausea 
and vomiting are inhibiting gastrointestinal retention and absorption. Autotitration is also made 
possible because of this comparatively short latency period after administration by this route.

Medical practitioners of more than a century ago (e.g., McMeens 1856, O'Shaughnessy 1839) 
would turn over in their graves to read that a major drug for certain nervous disorders had 
retrogressed to a preclinical status of "showing promise" in a 15-subject seizure disorder study in 
1980.

It is encouraging to see cannabis rediscovered as an antiasthmatic agent. McMeens (1860) and 
Waring (1874) noted cannabis to be useful in some cases of asthma and hay fever where an 
"irritable nervous system" seemed to be involved. Cannabis as a treatment for asthma was 
mentioned in India in 1954.

<center><b>ANTIANXIETY-ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECT</center></b> 
<p> 
This section by the Committee demonstrates the methodological problems involved in translating 
commonly observed cannabis-use behavior into a scientific presentation that is oriented to 
therapeutic utilization. This author's personal observations of chronic users clearly show 
cannabis' applications to closely approximate those of the benzodiazepines or alcohol. Like other 
sedatives, the onset of effects may be an initial stimulation. Alcohol and cannabis share this 
property. After the stimulation phase there is a calming effect. The intensity of the stimulation 
(and sedation) is directly dose-related. Low dose (two or fewer joints/day) chronic use of 
cannabis appears to have an effect comparable to five mg of diazepam (Valium) twice a day. 
Chronic cannabis users also show a slight stimulant effect with a mental lift and an EEG shift 
from predominantly alpha/theta (four to 13 Hz) to mostly beta waves (>14 Hz). 
<p> 
Low and moderate dose cannabis use appears to decrease affectual reactivity and subjective 
sense of pressure with reduction of concomitant multisystem stress. The site of activity is 
probably at the thalamo-cortical level, as postulated by Walton (1938). The reddened eyes of 
cannabis users reflect an apparent specific meningeal/vasomotor response. Cannabis, as 
compared with other psychotropics, has remarkably minimal brain stem and other peripheral 
effects.

<center><b>ANALGESIC ACTION</b></center> 
<p> 
Not referenced nor mentioned: Animal models showing analgesic effects for cannabis and its 
derivatives starting as far back as Hare (1887) and Marshall (1898), as well as overlooking the 
extensive bioassay protocol utilized by the pharmaceutical industry to standardize the strength of 
cannabis preparations in reference to U.S.P. standard preparations available from the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration until 1938. 
<p> 
The "mental clouding" side effect reported in 1976 when using THC as an analgesic for cancer 
pain control might have been avoided by emulating Dr. J. Russell Reynold's protocol of gradual 
upward titration of cannabis tincture, as described in <i>Lancet</i> in 1890. (Perhaps, using a 
U.S.P. standard cannabis tincture might have been more effective than THC.) 
<p> 
Ignored: Numerous descriptions of cannabis as the treatment of choice for migraine headache, as 
listed in materia medica, journals and texts with the latest (and unfortunately last) in the 
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> by Morris Fishbein (1942) 4O years, ago.

<center><b>ALCOHOLISM</b></center> 
In this author's limited clinical and social experience, the substitution of cannabis as a 
euphoriant/sedative is possible in some cases. The success of substitution depends on support 
groups of other cannabis users. Failure is usually due to denial and rigidly habituated behavior 
patterns usually involving other alcoholics or alcohol abusers. Another significant source of 
failure is the deterrence by its illegal status and uncertain supply of the drug.

<p> 
It should be said that the reason there are no efforts to follow up on Birch's (1889) and Mattison's 
(1891) early clinical experiences is because of the excessively restrictive multiagency federal 
involvement. In the moral pharmacologic regulatory reality, the treatment of discomfort brought 
on by the abuse of another illegal drug is low priority.

<center><b>SUMMARY</b></center> 
<p> 
The lack of clinical experience is a serious impediment to a realistic appraisal of the therapeutic 
potential of cannabinoids. The federal bias toward pushing THC for scientific "purity" and the 
inability to grow or process cannabis would appear to constitute another negative influence. It is 
gratifying that despite these difficulties the Committee is in favor of further research into the 
medicinal applications of cannabis. 
<p> 
There is sufficient clinical data, both recently and historically, to warrant the restoration of 
cannabis products for general prescribing. The Committee is generally correct in their favorable 
findings in glaucoma and antiemetic applications, but grossly underestimates the utility of 
cannabinoids as sedative, anticonvulsant and antimigraine agents because of inadequate 
experimental protocol, a less than thorough review of the medical literature and dog-in-the- 
manger interagency conflict-based federal policy.

<center><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH</b></center> 
<p> 
The development of nonirritating purified natural cannabinoid aerosol preparations should be a 
top priority effort. The reality is that because the smoked route is smoked route is used, there 
will be huge numbers of chronic cannabis smokers subjecting their tracheobronchial trees to 
irritation from pyrrolized impurities that technology could prevent. Precisely how much 
morbidity and mortality, which could have been prevented through appropriate research and 
development, remains to be answered in the distant future. 
<p> 
Cannabis homologues have been studied since the late 1930's. The compounds synthesized and 
studied by Loewe (1950) have yet to be adequately reevaluated and would be of potential benefit 
to the present knowledge of chemical structure-activity relationships in cannabinoids - the only 
complex nonnitrogenous water insoluble psychotropic agents known.

<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b>  Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an effective antiemetic as  
compared with placebos in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.  In this study we compared THC  
with prochlorperazine (Compazine) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with patients who had  
failed to benefit from standard antiemetic therapy.  Regardless of the emetic activity of the  
chemotherapeutic agents, there were more complete responses to THC courses (in 36 of 79 courses) than  
to prochlorperazine (in 16 of 78 courses).  Of 25 patients who were treated with both drugs and who  
expressed a preference, 20 preferred THC (P = 0.005).  Among patients under 20 years of age there was  
a higher proportion of complete responses to THC courses (15 of 20) than among older patients (21 of  
59 courses; P = 0.004). 
<p> 
Increased food intake occurred more frequently with THC (P = 0.008) and was associated with the  
presence of a "high."  Of 36 THC courses resulting in complete antiemetic responses, 32 were associated  
with a high. 
<p> 
We conclude that THC is an effective antiemetic in many patients who receive chemotherapy for cancer  
and for whom other antiemetics are ineffective. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Nausea and vomiting of central origin occur after the administration of a variety of chemotherapeutic  
agents for cancer and frequently constitute the major illness resulting from such treatment.  Control with  
classic antiemetics has been incomplete and variable (1). 
<p> 
Phenothiazines have traditionally been the drugs of choice in both the control and prevention of  
vomiting.  Controlled studies of the antiemetic effects of phenothiazines in patients receiving  
chemotherapy for cancer have demonstrated that the phenothiazines are more effective than placebos but  
generally do not adequately control nausea and vomiting (2).  Another oral agent, delta-9- 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the active ingredient of marihuana), has been shown to have antiemetic  
properties superior to those of placebos in reducing vomiting caused by chemotherapy (3).  In addition,  
THC has been proved to stimulate appetite and food consumption (4). 
<p> 
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of orally administered THC with the effects of  
prochlorperazine (Compazine), one of the most commonly prescribed phenothiazine antiemetics, on  
nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. 
<p> 
<b>Methods</b> 
<p> 
Eighty-four patients known to have neoplasms were enrolled in the study.  Fifty-one were male and 33  
female, and their ages ranged from nine to 70 years (average age, 32.5 years).  All but two patients had  
received previous chemotherapy (including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate,  
cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine), their nausea and vomiting were inadequately controlled by  
conventional antiemetics, including the phenothiazines.  Pregnant women and patients with a history of  
emotional instability or untoward reactions to psychoactive drugs were not eligible. 
<p> 
The study was thoroughly explained to the patients.  They were told that they would receive either a  
conventional antiemetic or a marihuana-like drug to control nausea and vomiting.  Five subjects known  
to use marihuana agreed not to smoke it during the course of the study. 
<p> 
THC was supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  The drug was suspended in 0.12 ml of  
sesame oil and supplied in gelatin capsules to blind the study.  The THC dosage was 10 mg per square  
meter of body-surface area, with 15 mg the amount most commonly administered.  On the basis of our  
previous experience with variability of response, the five patients with body-surface areas of less than 1  
square meter each received 10 mg of THC (3).  Prochlorperazine tablets were crushed, and 10 mg of the  
drug was placed with a filler of powdered lactose into opaque capsules that were identical in appearance  
to those containing the THC. 
<p> 
The experimental plan was a randomized, double-blind design in which each patient was to receive three  
one-day courses of a study drug (two courses with one drug and one course with the other).  Neither the  
person administering the drug nor the one recording the patient's response knew which drug the patient  
received.  The study days were arranged so that chemotherapy regimens were the same for each of the  
three courses.  If the chemotherapy changed, the patient was not evaluated for comparison.  Each drug  
course consisted of three doses given every four hours; the first dose was administered one hour before  
chemotherapy, and the other two doses three and seven hours after chemotherapy,.  Each patient was  
randomized to one of the six distinct ways of arranging two drugs in a sequence of three trials: TTP,  
PPT, TPT, PTP, TPP, or PTT, where T refers to THC and P to prochlorperazine.  In this way any effects  
of order were balanced. 
<p> 
Nausea, vomiting, food intake, and the development of a "high" were assessed by the patient on the day  
after treatment through the use of a self-administered questionnaire (the questionnaire is available to  
readers on request).  In addition, the patient, nurses, and other ward and clinic personnel in contact with  
the patient were interviewed by one of the authors, who also reviewed the questionnaire and nurses'  
notes. 
<p> 
On the basis of responses to the questionnaires, the antiemetic effect of each study drug was rated as one  
of the following: complete response, defined as no nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy; partial  
response, a reduction in the severity of nausea and vomiting; or no response, no reduction in the severity  
of nausea and vomiting.  Food intake during the 24 hours after chemotherapy was rated by the patient as  
no food intake, less than usual, average, or more than usual.  Patients indicated whether or not they had  
become high and were asked to describe the condition if they so desired.  For the purpose of this study, a  
high was characterized as a mood change that consisted of a tendency to laugh, elation, heightened  
awareness, mild aberrations of fine motor coordination, or minimal distortion of activities and  
interactions with others. 
<p> 
The significance tests reported in this paper are all two-sided tests.  They are either tests associated with  
2-by-2 contingency tables or the sign test.  All P values were computed with exact tests. 
<p> 
<b>Results</b> 
<p> 
To assess the antiemetic activity of the two study drugs, the analysis was carried out in two parts.   
Patients who received both antiemetics were analyzed according to their antiemetic preference, whereas  
patients who received only one antiemetic were analyzed by means of comparison with other patients.   
The analysis of preference is more precise because it supplies information on the individual patient, thus  
eliminating many variables.  The results were further assessed on the basis of emetic potential of the  
chemotherapeutic agents administered and the development of a high. 
<p> 
The study randomized 84 patients; however, not all patients completed the assigned three courses of  
drug treatment <a name="back1"></a><a href="#tab1"><b>(Table 1)</b></a>. 
<p> 
Twenty-seven patients received only one course and were removed from the study for various reasons:  
two died of cancer; four had THC toxicity, characterized as being too high; one refused to accept the risk  
of vomiting with subsequent courses of other antiemetics after having a complete response to THC;  
seven had changes in chemotherapy regimens and thus became ineligible for comparison according to  
study criteria; and the remaining 13 patients vomited during the first course and chose to quit the study.   
Of these 27 who were removed from the study, 15 had received THC, and 12 prochlorperazine.  Six  
patients had a complete response, and nine had no response to THC; with prochlorperazine, one patient  
had a complete response, and 11 had no response.  The rate of complete response to THC (six patients of  
15) was significantly higher than the rate for prochlorperazine (one patient of 12; P = 0.05). All six  
patients who had complete responses to THC became high, whereas only two of the nine patients who  
had no response to THC became high. 
<p> 
Response and preference may depend on the emetic activity of the chemotherapeutic agents that the  
patient is taking.  Various cancer drugs and drug combinations were separated into classes A, B, and C;  
class A includes the strongest emetics, class B the moderate emetics, and class C the weakest emetics  
<a name="back2"></a><a href="#tab2"><b>(Table 2)</b></a>. 
<p> 
The response to THC and prochlorperazine as a function of the total number of antiemetic courses and  
class of emetic activity is summarized in <a name="back3"></a><a href="#tab3"><b>Table 3</b></a>. 
This analysis compares responses between patients  
and not within individual patients and thus reflects the antiemetic effect regardless of the number of  
study courses completed.  Complete responses resulted from 36 of 79 THC courses and 16 of 78  
prochlorperazine courses. 
<p> 
The antiemetic preferences of patients who received two or three drug courses are summarized in <a 
name="back4"></a><a href="#tab4"><b>Table 4</b></a>. Of 25 patients who expressed a preference, 20 
preferred THC to prochlorperazine (P = 0.005). The degree of preference for either antiemetic did not 
depend on the class of emetic activity of the patient's chemotherapy for cancer.  However, eight patients 
without an antiemetic preference took class A treatments, as compared with 13 who took class B and C 
treatments.  This trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.14) 
<p> 
The antiemetic response to THC correlated with the development of a high.  As summarized in <a 
name="back5"></a><a href="#tab5"><b>Table 5</b></a>, 32 of 41 courses associated with a high also 
resulted in a complete response, whereas only four of 38 courses without a high resulted in a complete 
response (P<0.0001). 
<p> 
The ages of patients in each antiemetic group having more than one course are the same by virtue of the  
experimental design.  The average ages of the single-drug groups are 34.2 years for THC and 33.4 years  
for prochlorperazine.  An analysis of response by age showed that THC was superior to prochlorperazine  
in patients of every age.  The rate of complete response to prochlorperazine, 16 courses of 78, did not  
change markedly with age.  On the other hand, complete responses to THC numbered 15 of 20 for  
patients under 20 and 21 courses of 59 for patients 20 or older (P = 0.004). 
<p> 
Food intake after chemotherapy was evaluated in 28 patients who completed three courses of antiemetic  
therapy.  Responses were obtained from the questionnaire and were categorized into one of three  
outcomes: more food intake with THC, more food intake with prochlorperazine, or the same food intake  
with both drugs.  <a name="back6"></a><a href="#tab6"><b>Table 6</b></a> summarizes the 
preferences of the patients according to occurrence of a high  
and of increased food intake.  Eight of the 28 patients ate more during the prochlorperazine courses, and  
19 ate approximately the same amount during all courses. We found a very strong association between  
increased food intake during the THC course and the presence of a high.  Eight of 16 patients who  
became high reported an increased food intake that was conditional on the high; none of the 12 who  
failed to become high reported a greater intake (P = 0.008). 
<p> 
<b>Discussion</b> 
<p> 
The results of this randomized, double-blind study demonstrate that THC is superior to prochlorperazine  
as an antiemetic in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.  However, our conclusions are  
conditional in that the patients in this study were presumed refractory to conventional antiemetics  
including the control drugs, the phenothiazines.  Of these presumed refractory patients, 23 had a  
complete or partial response to prochlorperazine.  This variability of response is consistent with  
experimental evidence in the prevention of apomorphine-induced vomiting in normal human volunteers.   
In those volunteers the same doses of apomorphine had different emetic effects, and the same doses of  
antiemetics had variable antiemetic effects (5). 
<p> 
Failure to attain a high after ingesting oral THC and the concomitant absence of an antiemetic effect may  
be explained by either pharmacologic or psychologic phenomena.  Relatively little is known about  
human gastrointestinal absorption of this highly water-insoluble cannabinoid.  Oral administration may  
result in erratic absorption, thereby precluding standardization of the THC dose.  Plasma levels would  
provide important information in determining THC activity.  An attempt to correlate the antiemetic  
activity of THC with its plasma concentrations has demonstrated the existence of a relatively steep dose- 
response curve (6). Variability in achieving a high has been reported in subjects who have never used  
marihuana.  Many persons do not become high on their first exposure to marihuana, as has been reported  
anecdotally by regular users over the years (7). It has been hypothesized that prior pharmacologic  
sensitization or repeated exposure to marihuana reduces psychologic inhibition and is necessary to  
experience a high state. 
<p> 
We attempted to evaluate the influence of the study day on the antiemetic effect by examining patients  
who had different responses to the same antiemetic drug on different study days.  We found that there  
was no influence of drug sequences on response, which supports the findings of Herman et al (8). As in  
our previous study, the time of onset and duration of the high were unrelated to previous marihuana use  
(3). However, one patient who had used marihuana routinely before the study found the intensity of the  
THC high to be much greater than that previously induced by marihuana, possibly because of the  
development of a reverse tolerance (9). He found the THC high unpleasant and refused further THC  
treatment after the first study day.  It is important to note that except in the previously mentioned four  
patients who had THC toxicity, no side effects of either study drug were reported by any patient.  The  
absence of reports of somnolence differs from our initial experience (3). Although we observed  
somnolence in some patients, we cannot explain their failure to report it. 
<p> 
Synthetic analogues of THC, such as the cannabinoid nabilone, are also potent antiemetics.  A recent  
study comparing prochlorperazine with nabilone showed that nabilone was superior to prochlorperazine  
in controlling nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy (8). A limited number of our patients who  
responded favorably to THC have continued using the drug during subsequent chemotherapy.  Several  
of these patients have reported a diminution in the antiemetic effect of THC with repeated doses.  This  
anecdotal finding contradicts a previous report (9) of the development of reverse tolerance in persons  
who use marihuana often.  THC analogues may prove advantageous if they appear effective with  
repeated courses of chemotherapy. 
<p> 
We attempted to correlate the degree of emetic activity of the chemotherapeutic agents with the extent of  
response to the antiemetic agents.  Although THC was apparently a better antiemetic than  
prochlorperazine, no distinction could be drawn between the degree of antiemetic activity and the degree  
of emetic stimulation.  This finding agrees with the results from studies of nabilone, (8) indicating that  
both THC and nabilone provide antiemetic activity against many chemotherapeutic agents. 
<p> 
Experimental evidence demonstrating the antiemetic effects of both chlorpromazine and THC has been  
reported by ten Ham and de Jong (10). Using animal models of stereotypic behavior after apomorphine  
administration, they compared the activity of THC with that of chlorpromazine in Wistar rats and  
homing pigeons.  Whereas THC was shown to antagonize low doses of apomorphine but not high doses,  
chlorpromazine appears to have a very strong antiapomorphine effect, even at high doses of  
apomorphine.  Further studies of the pharmacology of THC and other cannabinoids in monkeys, dogs,  
and other laboratory animals are ongoing.  However, it is important to consider species differences in  
vomiting behavior.  Some laboratory animals, such as monkeys, are known to be poor models for  
vomiting, (11) and the so-called crop vomiting of pigeons may have an entirely different mechanism  
from that of the vomiting activity of mammals (12). 
<p> 
In summary, these data demonstrate that THC is a safe and effective antiemetic for patients receiving  
chemotherapy for cancer.  In many patients, THC was comparable to the most commonly used  
phenothiazine, and THC was preferred by most patients who expressed preferences.  Failure to respond  
to THC may be due to pharmacologic factors such as failure of absorption.  THC can be used safely at a  
dosage of 10 mg per square meter every four hours for at least three doses.  Further investigation is  
indicated for THC and other cannabinoid derivatives, alone and in combination with other approaches to  
the control of vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy.

<p> 
<b>Introduction</b> 
<p> 
Nausea and vomiting of central origin occur after the administration of a variety of cancer  
chemotherapeutic agents and frequently constitute the major morbidity associated with such treatment.  
Control with classic antiemetics is incomplete and variable. 
<p> 
Anecdotal accounts from patients suggested that smoking marihuana before receiving intravenous anti- 
tumor drugs resulted in diminution of nausea and vomiting, and, in contradistinction to the usual post- 
therapeutic anorexia, some were able to take food shortly after therapy.  Effects of marijuana on nausea 
and  
vomiting in human beings deserve to be reported.  It has been demonstrated that oral delta-9- 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) causes the same physiologic effects as smoking marijuana (1,2). 
<p> 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of orally administered THC on nausea and vomiting  
in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. 
<p> 
<b>Patients, Materials and Methods</b> 
<p> 
Twenty-two patients known to have a variety of neoplasms were enrolled in the study.  Ten males and 12  
females ranging in age from 18 to 76 years (median of 29.5) participated.  Twenty patients had previously  
received cancer chemotherapeutic agents known to cause nausea and vomiting (adriamycin, 5-azacytidine,  
nitrogen mustard, imidazole carboxamide, procarbazine, high-dose cyclophosphamide or high-dose  
methotrexate, or combinations thereof).  Twenty of the 22 were known to be refractory to conventional  
antiemetics.  The other two patients had never been treated with chemotherapy before entering the study.   
Pregnant women and patients with a past history of emotional instability or untoward reactions to  
psychoactive drugs were not eligible. 
<p> 
The study was thoroughly explained to the patients.  They were told that they would receive a placebo or a  
"marihuana-like drug for the purpose of controlling nausea and vomiting."  Subjects agreed not to smoke  
marihuana during the course of the study. 
<p> 
THC was supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  The drug was suspended in 0.12 ml of sesame  
oil and supplied in gelatin capsules.  Identical-appearing placebo capsules contained only sesame oil.   
Initially, THC dosage was 15 mg given every four hours for three doses.  Because of some variability in  
responses, the dose was changed to 10 mg per square meter body-surface area per dose.  Nineteen patients  
received 15-mg doses, and three 20-mg doses. 
<p> 
A randomized, "double-blind," crossover experiment was employed, each patient t being used as his own  
control.  Optimally, patients received three one-day courses of drug (either THC or placebo).  Each course  
consisted of three doses of drug, the first taken two hours before and the other two and six hours after  
chemotherapy.  Patients were randomized to receive courses in one of four sequences: THC-placebo-THC;  
THC-placebo-placebo; placebo-THC-placebo; or placebo-THC-THC. 
<p> 
Nausea, vomiting, and food intake were assessed by the patient on the day after treatment through the use  
of self-administered questionnaires.  In addition, the patient, nurses, and other personnel in contact with the  
patient were interviewed by one of us (S.E.S.), who also reviewed the questionnaires and nurses' notes. 
<p> 
<b>Results</b> 
<p> 
Definitions of responses are based upon a comparison of THC and placebo courses. 
<p> 
Complete response to THC means that there was no vomiting in patients for whom the same antitumor  
drugs caused unequivocal moderate to severe vomiting after placebo.  Conversely, a complete response to  
placebo theoretically is possible, but never occurred. 
<p> 
Partial response to THC means that there was at least a 50 per cent reduction in vomiting as compared to  
placebo after the same chemotherapy.  Included in this group are the patients whose vomiting, which  
occurred shortly after chemotherapy during a placebo course, was delayed until escape from control of  
THC.  These patients attained a "high" that wore off before the next dose, or after the last dose of THC, and  
during this time vomiting "broke through." A partial response to placebo is also a theoretical possibility but  
never occurred. 
<p> 
No response to the THC means that there was either no decrease or less than a 50 per cent reduction in  
vomiting as compared with placebo after the same antitumor drugs.  No response to placebo means that the  
patients vomited after chemotherapy as often or more often than after THC. 
<p> 
Absence of vomiting after both THC and placebo makes the response unevaluable because there was  
neither demonstrable emetic effect of chemotherapy nor antiemetic effect of THC or placebo.  One patient  
who had no prior chemotherapy before entering the study, was excluded from analysis for this reason. 
<p> 
Eleven patients completed three courses of treatment, two completed two courses, and nine completed one  
course. 
<p> 
One of the 11 never vomited and was excluded from evaluation as noted above.  The remaining 10 patients  
received 30 courses of drug, but a single course was excluded from analysis because the dose of cancer  
chemotherapeutic agent was reduced by 50 per cent.  Therefore, 29 courses were evaluated: 14 placebo and  
15 THC.  All courses of placebo resulted in no response.  Of the THC courses, there were five complete  
responses, seven partial responses, and three no responses.  The therapeutic response derived from the THC  
was independent of the sequence of THC or placebo courses administered.  Accepting complete and partial  
responses as positive responses, the difference between THC and placebo is highly significant (chi-square  
with Yates's correction P<0.001). 
<p> 
Of the two patients who completed two courses in the study, one died of disease, and the other decided to  
smoke marihuana, thus becoming ineligible to continue.  Both these patients had no response after placebo;  
after THC, both had partial responses. 
<p> 
Nine patients received one course of treatment.  Six had placebo only, and five of them vomited after  
chemotherapy.  The patient who did not vomit after placebo had no prior chemotherapy.  His response to  
placebo, therefore, is unevaluable because of the impossibility of differentiating an antiemetic effect of  
placebo from the emetic effect of chemotherapy.  Of the six, two voluntarily withdrew from the study  
because they did not want to risk another placebo course, one had chemotherapy discontinued, one died of  
disease, and two are still in the study.  Three had THC only.  Of these, two vomited and left the study, and  
the third went off study because of THC toxicity. 
<p> 
In summary, 20 courses of THC were administered, resulting in five complete responses, nine partial  
responses, three no responses, and three unevaluable responses.  Twenty-two courses of placebo resulted in  
no complete responses, no partial responses, 16 no responses, and six unevaluable responses. 
<p> 
<b>Side Effects</b> 
<p> 
Of 16 patients receiving THC, 13 (81 per cent) experienced a "high."  This effect was characterized by  
mood changes, which varied and consisted of one or more of the following: easy laughing; elation;  
heightened awareness; mild aberrations of fine motor co-ordination; and minimal distortion of their  
activities and interactions with others.  There were no hangovers or delayed effects. 
<p> 
The next most common side effect was somnolence.  For one third of the patients, somnolence curtailed  
activities for two to six hours, but the patients were easily aroused.  Another third had somnolence which  
did not curtail activities; the remainder experienced no somnolence. 
<p> 
Toxicity characterized by paranoid ideation, apprehension, fear, panic, and frightening visual 
hallucinations  
has been reported after single THC doses of 35 mg (2).  Only two of our patients (9 per cent) experienced  
THC toxicity, both after three doses of 20 mg.  One had visual distortions lasting for a few seconds, and the  
other reported visual hallucinations of 10 minutes' duration and depression of several hours. 
<p> 
 
<b>Discussion</b> 
<p> 
The results of this placebo-controlled "double-blind" study demonstrate that THC has antiemetic effects. 
<p> 
The study was designed to compare THC with placebo.  It was not designed to evaluate placebo effect.  No  
comparisons were made between placebo and absence of placebo, or between placebo and retrospective  
emesis control.  If a placebo effect exists in this clinical and investigative setting, THC cannot be 
evaluated. 
<p> 
No patient vomited while experiencing a subjective "high."  No "highs" were reported after placebo.  In  
some patients, the "high" wore off before the next THC dose, and during this interval, nausea and vomiting  
frequently occurred.  After this study, patients taking THC received their next dose as soon as the "high"  
began wearing off.  Preliminary results indicate that this dose-scheduling adjustment sustains the 
antiemetic  
effect of THC. 
<p> 
Variability in gastrointestinal absorption of orally administered THC between, but not within, individual  
subjects has been reported (2).  Three of our patients (19 per cent) reported the absence of a "high" after  
THC.  The lack of THC effect ("high" and antiemesis) in at least some patients may be related to failure of  
absorption.  Some patients who did not attain a "high" after the initial dose were able to do so with  
subsequent doses.  This effect may be analogous to the experience of Weil et al (3) with smoked  
marihuana: failure to respond to an initial dose of marihuana, and then response to subsequent doses.  This  
phenomenon may also be related to induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes necessary for drug  
metabolism as suggested by Lemberger er al (4). 
<p> 
Patients became "high" 20 to 60 minutes after ingestion of drug.  The duration of the "high" varied from  
one to five hours, but was usually two to three hours, suggesting that the rigid four-hourly schedule  
between doses was probably too long for some patients, and possibly explaining some partial responses.   
When dosage was based on body-surface area, less variability in onset and duration of effects was noted. 
<p> 
Time of onset, duration of effect, and intensity of "high" were unrelated to previous marihuana use.  Six  
patients admitted prior use of marihuana, but only one was considered more than an occasional user  
(defined here as smoking less than once a week). 
<p> 
It has been demonstrated that orally administered THC results in the same physiologic effects as inhaled  
marihuana (1,2).  The previous studies showing inhaled marihuana to be more potent than oral THC (1)  
were probably in error because the THC was delivered in poorly absorbed vehicles (2).  Inhalation appears  
to be more suitable for patients with suboptimal gastrointestinal absorption. 
<p> 
Hollister has shown that the effects of smoked THC clearly resemble those of marihuana (5).  We have  
made preliminary observations comparing the antiemetic effect of smoked marihuana and oral THC.  The  
marihuana belonged to individual patients and, therefore, was neither qualitatively nor quantitatively  
controlled.  For most patients, both smoked and oral routes had identical effects.  Theoretically, smoking  
might be the preferable route since it may result in less variability of absorption than the gastrointestinal  
route.  Moreover, smoking provides greater opportunity for individual patient control by permitting the  
patient to regulate and maintain the "high." 
<p> 
THC has been reported to have a biphasic clinical effect, with initial stimulation and elation followed by  
sleepiness and tranquillity (6).  With other antiemetics, such as the phenothiazine derivatives, sedative  
effect seems to parallel antiemetic effect (7).  Although somnolence occurred in about two thirds of out  
patients, in the dosage used, THC prevented or reduced vomiting in most patients without appreciable  
curtailment of activities. 
<p> 
Appetite stimulation follows the smoking of marihuana (8).  Four of our patients reported food intake  
"more than usual" after chemotherapy when taking THC.  No patient reported this effect after placebo. 
<p> 
These data demonstrate that THC is an effective antiemetic for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.   
Failure of response in 19 per cent of patients receiving THC perhaps is explicable on the basis of  
pharmacologic factors.  THC can be used safely in the dosage of 10 mg per square meter per dose every  
four hours for at least three doses.  Lack of effectiveness for some patients might be correctable by  
shortening the interval between doses to maintain a "high."  The safety of such a dose-schedule adjustment  
is still to be determined.

<b>Summary</b> 
<p> 
This pilot study provides an initial examination of the possible therapeutic uses of 
marijuana by persons with AIDS/HIV (PWAs) living in Honolulu, HI. Its original 
purpose was to determine the existence of a group of medical marijuana users in Hawaii, 
and estimate their degree of political support for a legal reform campaign. A sample of 
one hundred twenty three PWAs living in Honolulu, HI, answered a questionnaire survey 
about their knowledge <a name="back1"></a><a href="#note1">(1)</a> of medical uses 
of marijuana, especially in connection with AIDS/HIV, their patterns of marijuana use, 
their preference for marijuana or Marinol for treating symptoms, their attitudes toward 
legal reform, and their level of political motivation on the marijuana issue. Knowledge 
about medical marijuana was high: 98.4% had heard of medical uses for marijuana, and 
86.9% had heard of marijuana being used specifically to treat AIDS-related symptoms. 
Moreover, at least one third (36.9%) had themselves used marijuana as therapy for 
AIDS/HIV, and of those who had used both marijuana and prescription antiemetics, 
marijuana was preferred by 80%. Nine of every ten respondents favored legal reform to 
allow medical use of marijuana, even in the absence of conclusive testing. Respondents 
considered the therapeutic marijuana issue to be important to them (74.8%), and indicated 
a high level of political motivation: 72% were registered voters, 58.5% had voted in the 
most recent gubernatorial election, and 89% said they would actively support legal 
reform. The most striking finding was that respondents were more than twice as likely to 
have spoken with their friends (65.9%) as their doctor (31.7%) about medical marijuana. 
This pattern of communication held even for the 45 PWAs who have used marijuana to 
treat themselves, although to a lesser degree: 97.8% of this group had spoken with their 
friends, 66.7% with their doctor. 
<p> 
Absence of demographic questions and a control group are a limitation of this study. No 
claim is made about the relationship of the sample population to either the clientele of the 
AIDS outreach and casework organization from which the sample population was drawn, 
or to the population of persons with HIV at any other location or scale. 
<p> 
 
<b>Background</b> 
<p> 
T'he issue of therapeutic uses of marijuana is mired in political controversy [Hollister 
1992; Grinspoon and Bakalar 1993, Hall et al. 1994], and key agencies of the U. S. 
federal government have resisted facilitating a clinical assessment of marijuana efficacy 
[Lehrman 1995, Grinspoon et al. 1995, Abrams 1995]. Even in the absence of such 
studies, however, a growing body of ethnographic evidence exists to support the assertion 
that marijuana can be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of medical conditions, 
including pain, glaucoma, muscle spasticity, nausea and the diminished appetite 
associated with AIDS Wasting Syndrome [cf. Randall 1991; Grinspoon and Bakalar 
1993]. With or without government sanction or regulation, some people are using 
marijuana to treat symptoms of their medical conditions. Marijuana is reportedly being 
used by some PWAs to control nausea and increase their appetites [Randall 1991, 
Grinspoon and Bakalar 1993]. Under the current system of marijuana prohibition, quasi- 
legitimate marijuana "buyers clubs" have sprung up around the country to distribute 
marijuana to clients who demonstrate a medical need, and grassroots organizing has 
begun to introduce "compassionate use" legislation into some states that would allow 
persons with medical need to possess, purchase, and even grow marijuana for personal 
consumption. 
<p> 
<b><i>Problem statement</i></b> 
<p> 
This study sought first to identify if there was a group of PWAs who are informed about 
marijuana's possible use as medicine, who use marijuana themselves to treat their 
symptoms, and who are politically motivated. A secondary aim was to find out how 
these people share information about medicinal marijuana. 
<p> 
 
<b>Methodology</b> 
<p> 
<b><i>Subjects, sampling design and response rates</i></b> 
<p> 
PWAs were contacted through a large Honolulu-based AIDS outreach and casework 
program. Four hundred questionnaire surveys and stamped return envelopes were 
distributed inside a monthly client newsletter. 374 newsletters were delivered through the 
mail to 310 PWAs and to 64 HIV- persons also on the mailing list. Of these, 4 were 
separated from the newsletter in transit and returned by the post office undelivered. An 
additional 26 newsletters were distributed directly from the organizational offices of the 
outreach program, primarily to HIV- persons. It is not known with certainty how many 
of those questionnaires distributed at the office were received by PWAs and how many 
by other non-PWAs, although an organization representative estimated that very few 
were distributed at the office to PWAs who would have already received a copy of the 
client newsletter through the mail. Thus the total number of questionnaires distributed 
through the mail and from the office was 396. Overall, 140 questionnaires were returned, 
a response rate of 35.4%. Moreover, it is estimated that between 306 and 336 PWAs 
received a copy of the questionnaire (taking into account losses in mail transit and the 
unlikely possibility that all surveys from the office went to PWAS). One hundred 
twenty-three PWAs returned the questionnaire for a response rate of somewhere between 
36.6% and 40.2 % among the target PWA group. 
<p> 
<b><i>Instrument</i></b> 
<p> 
The instrument asked simple yes/no questions concerning PWAs' awareness of the 
medical marijuana claims, their patterns of communication with friends and doctors, 
whether they had taken prescribed antiemetics or marijuana to treat their symptoms, 
whether they had used marijuana non-medically, and their voter status. Respondents 
were also asked to complete five questions on a Likert-type scale about their attitudes 
toward various kinds of legal reform, the importance of the medical marijuana issue to 
them, and the estimated likelihood that they would use marijuana themselves if it were 
made legally available. A final question asked what level of activity they might take on 
to support a legal reform campaign. The instrument included a section for optional 
comments where respondents could make a personal statement of some sort. 
<p> 
The primary limitation to this study is the absence of demographic data. Because of the 
precarious social position of PWAs, and the currently illicit nature of the activity being 
studied, no demographic information was gathered. The primary concern of this study 
was to make an initial investigation into medical use of marijuana among PWAs. 
Although some demographic data could have been gathered without jeopardizing a 
person's identity, it was decided that the combined issues of AIDS and illicit drug use was 
so delicate that asking any personal questions might scare off respondents. 
<p> 
<b>Results</b> 
<p> 
The questionnaire sought inforrnafion in four general areas: awareness and 
communication about medical marijuana, patterns of therapeutic use and use for pleasure, 
attitudes toward legal reform, and political motivation. Descriptive statistics of their 
responses are presented below, along with some added remarks given by respondents in 
the optional comments section of the questionnaire. Fifty-six PWAs (45.5%) provided 
such comments. 
<p> 
<i>Awareness and Communication</i> 
<p> 
The first four questions deal with respondents' knowledge about medical marijuana and 
the people with whom they speak about their knowledge. Of the sample, 121 (98.4%) 
had heard it asserted that marijuana could be used for some medical purposes, and 107 
(87.0%) had heard of marijuana being used specifically in connection with AIDS/HIV. 
Respondents were more than twice as likely to have spoken with their friends (65.9%) 
than their doctors (31.7%) about potential medical uses of marijuana. Even persons 
treating themselves with marijuana were less likely to have spoken about it with their 
doctor (66.7%) than with their friends (97.8%). 
<p> 
Most of the comments offered that pertained to this section were informational items 
about marijuana's medicinal value. For instance one respondent said: "I believe the use of 
marijuana with HIV/AIDS victims is sometimes to offset the negative effects of 
medication, not symptoms of the disease directly [37]." Another commented about 
marijuana that it "certainly has less side effects than AZT and does seem to help friends 
feel and eat better [541]." Several respondents suggested the use of marijuana to elevate 
the mood of the sick person: 
<blockquote> 
Marijuana is the only drug that takes the place of an aid for appetite, mood elevation, 
relaxation, or motivation. Used as a medication it's doctor-recommended, and in 
moderation a very unique, fast-acting, and useful helper. When depressed from knowing 
you're dying, it really moves your mind to a better location [29]. 
<p> 
I believe that marijuana has psychological benefits in addition to any physiological 
benefits. You just <i>feel</i> better; so many AIDS patients find it hard to cope with the 
general feeling of not being healthy on a constant basis. Relief like pot is a temporary 
godsend. They can feel "normal" for a few hours of their stress-filled life [7; emphasis in 
original].</blockquote> 
 
<p> 
<i>Use Patterns</i> 
<p> 
The use of marijuana was more prevalent among respondents than use of prescription 
antiemetics like Marinol. More respondents with HIV had used marijuana as a medicine 
(36.9%) than Marinol or other antiemetics (27.3%). A relatively small number (25), 
comprising 23.6% of the marijuana-infonned respondents, had tried both marijuana and 
Marinol or another prescribed antiemetic drug. Of those who reported a definite 
preference (23), 20 (87%) reported that marijuana produced the more desirable effect. 
Two thirds of respondents (66.7%) reported having used marijuana for non-medical 
purposes at least once in their lives. 
<p> 
Several respondents discussed further the relative worth of marijuana and Marinol 
(specifically) in their comments. For example: 
<blockquote> 
Much suffering could be eased if marijuana could be furnished. Instead the [government] 
charges the taxpayer $400 a month for Marinol which 8 out of 10 times does nothing but 
intoxicate [136]. 
<p> 
Whenever I am suffering from nausea or cannot eat, marijuana is the <i>only</i> thing 
thus far that has an immediate result and does not contribute to unpleasant side effects. 
Marinol has made me sick several times [39; emphasis in original]. 
<p> 
Marinol is not an adequate substitute for marijuana. I had to stop taking it in the hospital. 
All it did was make me very groggy without enhancing my appetite [34].</blockquote> 
<p> 
 
 
<i>Attitudes Toward Legal Reform</i> 
<p> 
Questionnaire recipients were asked to give their opinions about legal reform issues on a 
Likert-type scale. Respondents expressed strong or some support for making marijuana 
legally available by doctors' prescriptions (91.1%) and even in the absence of conclusive 
tests on marijuana (93.5%). A majority of respondents (68.3%) anticipated that they 
would be either "very likely" or "somewhat likely" to use marijuana if it became legal. 
Another 8% were uncertain about how their use might change. A majority (59.0%) either 
strongly favor, or favor somewhat, legalization of marijuana for non-medical use. 
<p> 
Clearly there was overwhelming support for legal reform. Most of the comments 
addressed this issue, and several mentioned that this issue has broad appeal that crosses 
political boundaries. This respondent put it best: 
<blockquote> 
I believe there are quite a number of people who oppose marijuana as a recreational drug 
but would support the use of marijuana for medical purposes--as long as there is some 
evidence to substantiate the claim [that marijuana is] medically beneficial. Even my 
straight-laced conservative mother would approve of using marijuana--"whatever it takes 
to make you better," as she put it one day [49].</blockquote> 
<p> 
Others commented on why they make an exception in the case of marijuana. For 
example: 
<blockquote> 
 
 
I consider marijuana an addictive drug that, when used for recreation, can very easily lead 
to more serious drug use. I am a recovering drug addict (11 years sober) and have seen 
this happen. However, I think special circumstances require special actions. Marijuana 
used medically could relieve suffering and should be legalized for that use [46]. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Many others expressed exasperation about the difficulties of using marijuana as a 
medicine, and their support of making it legal: 
<blockquote> 
Anything that can be done to help those who suffer should be available to them. 
Marijuana is used extensively by well persons, so why not legally for those who could 
benefit medically [38]. 
<p> 
I feel in my heart that if this could help people like myself and my husband who have 
HIV, then it should by all means be legal for treatment only. We really must open our 
minds to what can be done for this disease [35]. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Several respondents also explicitly referred to a perceived hypocrisy in the law. For 
example: 
<blockquote> 
I find it crazy that thousands die each year ftom legalized alcohol--marijuana is a nature 
drug, which is a blessing for those of us who benefit from it [26]. 
<p> 
I would really support the legalization of marijuana. It has helped me to sleep, relax, and 
eat more. There are legal things that are more harmful and that effect your mind worse 
than marijuana (e.g. cigarettes, liquor) [50]. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
On the other hand, some respondents expressed ambivalence on the issue and concern 
that medical use would not be properly regulated: 
<blockquote> 
I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. I also work in the AIDS field. I feel the 
legalization of marijuana (medical) would be beneficial for some but feel many would 
use their HIV status to perpetuate existing addictions for which I am very unsupportive 
[57]. 
<p> 
My concern is with all the alcohol and drug abuse is that legalizing [marijuana] would 
only make it more available for the trade through unethical practices by patients and 
medical care persons. I know of persons using Marinol who don't need it but have found 
the access. Anything that would make my life seem better would be good, but I am more 
concerned about the masses than myself as a person [55]. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Finally, in one notable exception to the norm, a respondent writes that: 
<blockquote> 
 
There are other medications that treat nausea and other complications just as well if not 
better than marijuana. Marijuana is simply a drug to get high with. [People who] are 
seeking to get it for medical use are using their ailments for an excuse to get marijuana 
[32].</blockquote> 
<p> 
 
 
<i>Political Motivation</i> 
<p> 
Respondents indicated a high level of political motivation: 92 (74.9%) claimed to be 
registered voters, although only 72 (58.5%) had actually voted in the most recent election 
for governor. Most (56.9%) considered themselves to be Democrats. Another 35 
(30.2%) claimed to be "Independent" voters, and only 13 (11.2%) consider themselves 
Republicans. Two respondents (1.7%) were members of another political party. On the 
issue of medical marijuana, 92 people (74.8%) answered that it is either very (37.4%) or 
somewhat (37.4%) important to them personally. Moreover, 107 (89.1%) indicated that 
they would actively support a legalization campaign by "signing a petition" (38.3%), 
"calling representatives, writing letters to the editor or carrying a petition" (33.3%), or by 
some higher level of activity such as "organizing others, designing pamphlets, talking to 
groups," etc. (17.5%). 
<p> 
Some respondents explained why they considered this to be an important issue to them 
personally. For example: 
<blockquote> 
 
The issue of marijuana used for medical purposes is an extremely important one. Those 
who say it's not might want to watch a close friend turn from a vibrant human being into 
a walking skeleton; they just might change their opinion. Anything that works is fine by 
me [36]. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Several respondents suggested ways they would specifically like to help a legal reform 
campaign. Here are some notable examples: 
<blockquote>I'm an entertainer in Hawaii and around the world. I'd love to do 
fundraisers and anything else to help [139]. 
<p> 
As a member of PWAC [Persons with AIDS Coalition], I would like to publish articles in 
our newsletter to show medical value re HIV, and in support of legalization [3]. 
<p> 
They have a place in San Francisco called the Buyers Club on Market Street that deals in 
this as a medical problem. Maybe we could get a program started here [28]. 
<p> 
This is an issue that my company will support [52]<a name="back2"></a><a 
href="#note2">(2)</a>. 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p> 
The pilot study succeeds in identifying a group of informed, politically motivated 
population of persons, many of whom are using marijuana illicitly for self treatment of 
their medical condition. Further study should be attempted to determine whether this 
group is representative of PWAs in Honolulu and Hawaii as a whole.

Increasing the availability of sterile syringes and needles through syringe exchange programs 
(SEPs) and 
pharmacies has numerous public health benefits. It reduces needle sharing, curtails the 
transmission of 
HIV/AIDS and other diseases such as hepatitis, increases the safe disposal of used syringes, and 
helps 
injecting drug users (IDUs) obtain drug information, treatment, detox, and primary health 
care.(1) Yet the 
U.S. government prohibits federal funding of SEPs, and many state governments criminalize 
possession, 
distribution, and sale of clean syringes. By contrast, national and local governments in Western 
Europe, 
Australia, and Canada have made sterile syringes widely accessible. 
<p> 
<i><b>The scientific community strongly supports measures to increase needle and syringe 
availability.</b></i><br> 
<ul> 
<li>Virtually every scientific body that has studied SEPs supports them: the National Research 
Council/Institute of Medicine, U.S. Centers for Disease Control, National Commission on AIDS, 
General 
Accounting Office, American Medical Association, American Public Health Association.(2) 
<li>The National Commission on AIDS concluded "Legal sanctions on injection equipment do 
not reduce 
illicit drug use, but they do increase the sharing of injection equipment and hence the spread of 
AIDS."(3) 
</ul> 
<p> 
<i><b>Syringe exchanges reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as other blood-borne diseases 
such as 
hepatitis.</i></b><br> 
<ul> 
<li>In a comprehensive review of fourteen scientific studies on SEPs, ten showed beneficial 
effects 
regarding the frequency of syringe sharing, four showed mixed or neutral effects, and none 
showed 
negative effects.(4) 
<li>Regular participation in SEPs reduced the risk of HIV infection by approximately 50% 
among New 
York City IDUs. SEP participants reported a 73% decrease in the use of rented or used 
syringes.(5) 
 
<li>Participants in a Portland SEP decreased their renting and sharing of syringes by two- 
thirds.(6) 
<li>Prevention Point, an SEP in San Francisco, disposed of approximately 8600 HIV- 
contaminated 
syringes in one month in 1992.(7) 
<li>The SEP in New Haven was associated with an estimated 33% relative reduction in HIV 
incidence.(8) 
<li>Participation in SEPs has a "powerful retardant effect" on the spread of hepatitis.(9) 
<li>Many people visit SEPs not only to exchange syringes, but also to get referrals to detox and 
treatment.(10) In 1991 and 1992, a Tacoma SEP was the largest single source of recruitment to 
methadone 
maintenance programs in the country.(11) 
<li>SEPs do not encourage people to either increase their drug use or start injecting drugs.(12) 
Three years 
after a San Francisco SEP opened, only 1.1% of its clients had been using drugs for less than a 
year.(13) 
From 1987  a year after the SEP opened  to 1992, the mean age of IDUs increased by five 
years from 36 
to 42, and the minimum age remained virtually the same.(14) 
<li>SEPs do not increase the total number of discarded syringes on the street.(15) After the 
establishment 
of the Portland SEP Outside-In, the number of syringes discarded in the exchange's 
neighborhood 
dropped.(16) 
</ul> 
<p> 
 
<i><b>Pharmacy sale of syringes should be legal so the greatest number of IDUs can have 
access to sterile 
syringes.</b></i><br> 
<ul> 
<li>Pharmacy sale offers an established network of outlets that provide medical resources to 
people at all 
hours of the day and in all areas of the country, including rural and suburban areas which often 
can't 
sustain syringe exchanges. 
<li>Over 80% of Connecticut pharmacies are now selling needles and syringes over the counter. 
The 
major source of needles and syringes has shifted to the pharmacies from the street, where used 
and possibly 
infected equipment is often rented or sold.(17) 
<li>Diabetic IDUs who can legally buy syringes at pharmacies had significantly lower rates of 
HIV than 
non-diabetic IDUs  9.8% versus 24.3%  even though the duration and intensity of drug use 
were 
similar.(18) 
<li>Pharmacy sale is common in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
Italy, New 
Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, and some U.S. states.(19) 
<li>In over a dozen European and Australian cities, syringes also are available from vending 
machines 
which provide a clean syringe when a used one is deposited.(20) 
</ul> 
<p> 
 
<i><b>The costs of AIDS are rapidly rising in both human and economic terms.</b></i><br> 
<ul> 
<li>About two-thirds of new U.S. HIV infections stem from injection drug use: 50% through 
sharing 
infected syringes, and an additional portion through fetal transmission or sexual contact 
involving an 
IDU.(21) 
<li>Over 170,000 U.S. AIDS cases stemmed from injecting drug use by June 1995.(22) 
<li>An estimated 50% of all IDUs in New York City are HIV positive; in Toronto, where 
syringe 
exchanges have never been illegal, an estimated 7.6% of IDUs are HIV positive.(23) 
<li>AIDS is the leading cause of death among Americans aged 25 to 44.(24) 
<li>The cumulative cost in the U.S. of treating all people with HIV or AIDS was $15.2 billion in 
1995(25) 
<li>SEPs have a median annual budget of $169,000.(26) Since the lifetime cost of treating one 
person 
with AIDS is $102,000,(27) each program more than pays for itself by preventing the 
transmission of 
HIV/AIDS to less than two people. Pharmacy sale of syringes would be cost effective for the 
government, 
with costs incurred only from educating pharmacists and ensuring proper disposal of syringes. 
</ul> 
<p> 
 
<i><b>Current drug paraphernalia and prescription laws encourage the dangerous behavior of 
sharing 
needles.</b></i><br> 
<ul> 
<li>The sharing of needles among IDUs dropped 40%, and needle stick injuries to police 
decreased after 
Connecticut changed its paraphernalia and prescription laws in 1992 to allow for possession and 
sale of up 
to ten syringes.(28) 
<li>All but five U.S. states have drug paraphernalia laws that criminalize the possession or 
distribution of 
syringes except for "legitimate medical purposes."(29) Nine states and Washington, D.C. 
prohibit the 
purchase of syringes without a prescription.(30) These laws  in states like New York, 
California, and 
Illinois which have large IDU and HIV/AIDS populations  affect the vast majority of IDUs.(31) 
Some 
state and municipal authorities have granted limited exemptions to these laws to deal with the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic. 
<li>Because of state and federal laws limiting SEPs, only about 10% of U.S. narcotics users 
have access to 
the 85 SEPs operating in 25 states and Puerto Rico.(32) 
<li>By the late 1980s, virtually all developed countries other than the U.S. had made legal access 
to sterile 
injection equipment a primary component of AIDS prevention. Sweden is the only European 
country with 
a prescription law. The two other countries in Europe and Oceania to enact such laws  France 
and Austria 
 repealed them in the mid-1980s.(33) 
</ul> 
<p> 
 
<i><b>The government should accept the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control, 
National 
Research Council, American Medical Ass'n, etc. and make specific policy changes to curtail the 
spread of 
HIV/AIDS.</b></i><br> 
<ul> 
<li>State governments should repeal their drug paraphernalia laws so possession, sale, and 
distribution of 
syringes are legal. 
<li>The nine state governments with prescription laws should repeal those laws so that 
pharmacies and 
SEPs can legally sell or distribute syringes without requiring a prescription. 
<li>Local governments should provide exemptions to the paraphernalia and prescription laws 
until those 
laws are repealed. 
<li>The federal government should repeal the ban on federal funding of SEPs. It should 
authorize funding 
for SEPs to expand the network of needle exchanges and increase their hours of operation, both 
of which 
would make sterile syringes more accessible.

<a href="#con">IV. CONCLUSION</a>
<p>
<a name="intro"></a>
<b>I.  Introduction</b>
<p>
This is a case involving a legitimate public health action taken to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS in New Jersey.
<p>
The spread of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) through the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.  In New Jersey, a panel of public health experts appointed by the Governor recently found that a "major epidemic" of AIDS is devastating the State.
<p>
HIV transmission principally occurs in the following ways: (1) Unprotected sexual activity involving the exchange of body fluids; (2) Blood transfusions involving HIV-contaminated blood products; (3) the sharing of HIV-contaminated needles by injection drug users; and (4) transmission of the virus from mothers to children in utero or through breast milk.
<p>
The risk behavior causing the most HIV infections and new AIDS cases in New Jersey is the sharing of HIV-contaminated needles by injection drug users.  New Jersey has the highest rate of AIDS caused by injection drug use of any state in the United States. More than half of New Jersey's AIDS cases are caused by injection drug use - twice the national average.  The vast majority of these injection-related AIDS cases involve persons of color.
<p>
Worse, this epidemic of injection-related AIDS in New Jersey is exploding exponentially.  Since 1991, nearly 10,000 injection-related AIDS cases have been reported - 63 percent of all such cases in the history of New Jersey's AIDS epidemic.
<p>
As this epidemic devastates New Jersey citizens, public health officials and activists in numerous states, cities and communities across the nation have responded to their own AIDS crises by adopting needle exchange programs as disease control measures to save lives.  Through needle exchanges, injection drug users exchange used needles for clean ones, and receive other cleansing materials designed to slow the relentless, rising tide of HIV transmission among drug users.
<p>
The evidence that needle exchange can reduce the rate of HIV transmission among injection drug users continues to grow.  Moreover, the mounting empirical evidence strongly suggests that not only does needle exchange help reduce the spread of AIDS, it does so without increasing injection drug use or creating new users.  In fact, some evidence suggests needle exchange may help decrease injection drug use, as users gain access to treatment information through the exchange.
<p>
Of the dozens of needle exchanges now in operation, about one-fifth operate without a clear legal basis.  About half the exchanges have been authorized by legislative amendments to or judicial interpretations of drug paraphernalia or needle prescription laws, or been exempted from them by state executive action.  And, under a claim of legality relevant to this case, eleven communities have adopted needle exchange by taking the reasonable legal position that drug paraphernalia or needle prescription laws were not intended to apply to bona fide disease control measures, and so do not prohibit needle exchange programs.
<p>
Defendants are volunteers with a needle exchange in New Brunswick.  They are charged by the State with violating N.J.S.A. 2C:36-6, a drug paraphernalia statute prohibiting the possession, sale, or distribution of paraphernalia, including hypodermic needles, with the intent that they will be used to introduce illicit or controlled substances into the body.
<p>
Defendants will ask this Court to dismiss the charges against them pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:2-11, which grants the Court discretion to dismiss criminal charges where the defendant's conduct "did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense".  Alternatively, Defendants will ask this Court to dismiss the charges pursuant to its inherent judicial power to fashion needed and appropriate remedies, because the paraphernalia law does not apply to disease control measures such as needle exchange.  Lastly, if the Court does not grant this Motion to Dismiss, Defendants will ask for a hearing to adduce more evidence on the efficacy and legality of their needle exchange.
<p>
The harm sought to be prevented by the Legislature in enacting 2C:36-6 was illicit narcotics usage and the commercial drug paraphernalia industry.  The Legislature never envisaged AIDS when it passed 2C:36-6. The Legislature never envisaged the epidemic of injection-related HIV devastating drug users in New Jersey, who transmit HIV to their sexual partners and offspring.  And the Legislature certainly never envisaged needle exchange as a valid and legal public health intervention designed to slow the spread of this deadly epidemic and save lives.
<p>
The effective intervention of clean needle exchange practiced by defendants and by public health officials and activists across America - is a <i>disease control measure</i> that the evidence will show can and is saving lives.  Under any reasonable interpretation of law, it simply is not criminal conduct, committed with criminal intent, of the kind 2C:36-6 was designed to prohibit.
<p>
At current infection rates, a new person contracts injection-related HIV in New Jersey every four hours.  To slow this fast-moving epidemic will require a committed public health response.  Considering the nature of such truly unprecedented attendant circumstances, this Court can and must dismiss the charges against Defendants.  In the alternative, it should grant Defendants a hearing to adduce more evidence as to the efficacy and legality of their needle exchange as a disease control measure to save citizens' lives in New Brunswick and the surrounding area.

<b>II.  Proffer of Evidence to be Adduced at a Hearing</b>
<p>
A.  The Spread of HIV, Particularly HIV Caused by Injection Drug Use, has Been Classified as a "Major Epidemic" in New Jersey
<p>
Fact: As of December, 1995, documented infections with HIV had caused 28,730 men, women and children in New Jersey to develop AIDS (2).  Because the time lag between HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis is so long - an estimated eight years, on average public health experts believe the actual number of New Jerseyians infected with HIV is far greater, and may range as high as 50,000 people (3). To place these numbers in some perspective, some 53,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War.
<p>
Fact: Of the principal modes of transmission of the AIDS virus (Unprotected sex involving exchange of bodily fluids; transfusions of HIV-contaminated blood products; sharing of HIV-contaminated needles by injection drug users; in utero transmission from mother to child), injection drug use is, by far, the chief cause of the spread of AIDS in New Jersey.  More than half of New Jersey's AIDS cases are related to injection drug use - twice the national average (4).
<p>
Fact: The overwhelming number of injected-related AIDS cases in New Jersey involve persons of color.
<p>
The explosion of injected-related AIDS across New Jersey is cause for official alarm.  As the Governor's Advisory Council recently found:
<p>
<blockquote>
The rate of new HIV infection in New Jersey is alarming.  Recent reports show that three of the top 20 U.S. metropolitan areas in terms of newly reported AIDS cases are in this State (5). Moreover, New Jersey ranks first among all States in terms of the proportion of AIDS cases among adults and adolescents that are related to injected drug use.  By the end of 1994, over 13, 000 New Jersey residents aged 13 and over were living with injection-related AIDS, or had died from it (6).</blockquote>
<p>
The Governor's Advisory Council also officially noticed the distressingly disproportionate devastation that infection-related AIDS is inflicting of New Jersey citizens of color:
<p>
<blockquote>Although African Americans are less than 20 percent of the population of New Jersey, they accounted for almost 60 percent of new injection-related AIDS cases in 1994.  By the end of 1994, over 8,400 New Jersey African-Americans aged 13 and over were living with injected-related AIDS, or had died from it (7).</blockquote>
<p>
Before making policy recommendations to the Governor, the Advisory Council made it clear that New Jersey's response to AIDS thus far has fallen woefully short:
<p>
<blockquote>Despite the state's best efforts, however, the response to date has not been sufficient to avert a major epidemic among injection drug users (8).</blockquote>
<p>
Since the Governor's Advisory Council filed its report, sounded its alarm, and officially recommended the State immediately adopt the policy of needle exchange as a public health measure to slow the spread of HIV and save lives, little has changed in terms of official policy in New Jersey.  But the numbers on new HIV and AIDS cases have changed:
<ul>
<li>1,514 new AIDS cases have been reported.
<li>400 new injection-related AIDS cases have been diagnosed.
<li>The 1995 rate of injected-related AIDS cases involving persons of color was reported as 81 percent - up one-third over the soaring 1994 rate that caused the Advisory Council to sound its alarm.
</ul>
<p>
The State also released a new set of numbers that tell the ultimate toll of AIDS on New Jersey citizens: To date, 19,778 men, women and children have died of AIDS or HIV illness during the epidemic.
<p>
B.  The Evidence that Needle Exchange Can Reduce the Rate of HIV Infection Among Injecting Drug Users Continues to Grow
<p>
HIV is transmitted from one injection drug user to another through the sharing of HIV-contaminated needles among users.  Once infected, the HIV-positive user may then transmit the virus to their sexual partners, who may in turn transmit it to any children conceived.  Two primary reasons why injection drug users share used and potentially HIV-contaminated needles are: (1) because drug paraphernalia and needle prescription laws prohibit the distribution of needles, making them scarce and difficult to obtain, and (2) because such drug laws make users reluctant to possess needles on their person, so they share syringes available at the source of their drugs.
<p>
In the past five years, the evidence that needle exchange can effectively reduce the rate of HIV transmission among injection drug users continues to grow (9). The growing weight of the evidence is that needle exchanges work by providing injection drug users with a free, reliable source of sterile needles, which has the effect of reducing users' sharing of used needles, and the intended result of reducing HIV incidence rates among needle-exchange participants (10). These same studies, along with others, have similarly documented no increase in injection drug use, and in fact, some studies suggest injection rates actually decline as needle exchange participants gain access to information about drug treatment and counseling along with sterile needles (11).
<p>
The most recent study to document that needle exchanges work in protecting injection drug users from contracting - and further spreading - HIV was reported two weeks ago in the prestigious public health journal, <i>The Lancet</i>.
<p>
The study, by a respected public health expert in the HIV prevention field (12), is significant for three reasons: (1) it reports on the effect of needle exchange programs in New York City, a city with vast numbers of injection drug users (170,000 to 200,000) and high HIV-positive rates among users (an estimated 50 percent infected with the virus); (2) No study has previously compared HIV infection rates among needle exchange participants and non-participants in an area with so many users and so much HIV; and, most importantly, (3) The study documents that injection drug users who regularly use needle exchanges are four times less likely to contract HIV than users who do not use a needle exchange (13). As the authors conclude:
<p>
<blockquote>We found that not using the exchanges resulted in a substantially higher hazard for incident HIV infection (14) that continued use of the exchanges .... Our findings show that [injection drug users] participating in syringe-exchange programs in the high-seroprevalence (15) multidrug-problem environment of New York City achieved a low HIV incidence rate.</blockquote>
<p>
When a New Jersey court first considered the issue of whether needle exchange programs had had any tangible effect on reducing the sharing of HIV-contaminated needles among injection drug users and reducing the spread of HIV, the court, understandably overwhelmed by a deluge of novel public health data and issues presented, suggested there was as yet "no consensus" on these issues.  State v. Sorge, 249 N.J. Super. 144 (Law Div. 1991).
<p>
It is beyond dispute that, since 1991, a consensus has emerged, and it is this: Where offered, needle exchange has been heavily used by injection drug users.  Needle exchange has not led to any increase in illicit drug use.  In some cases, it has actually been found to facilitate a decline in injection drug use.  Needle exchange has led to significant decreases in the sharing of used needles among drug users.  Most importantly, numerous studies since 1991 have documented that injection drug users who participate in needle exchange programs have significantly lower rates of HIV infection than drug users who either do not participate in needle exchange - or do not have access to one.  And, when injection drug users use needle exchanges and lower their rates of HIV infection, their sexual partners and offspring have a better chance of never contracting HIV or developing AIDS as well (16).
<p>
C.  Defendants' Conduct was a Bona Fide Disease Control Measure to Slow the Spread of HIV Among Injection Drug Users and Save Lives
<p>
1.  Needle Exchanges are Operating Effectively as Disease Control Measures to Reduce HIV Among Drug Users in Dozens of American Communities
<p>
Needle exchange or distribution programs, operated by public health officials and activists as bona fide disease control measures to reduce HIV rates among injection drug users, are today operating in at least 18 states and more than 50 cities and communities across the nation (17).
<p>
The rapid expansion of needle exchanges across the country is directly related to the alarming explosion of HIV infection and new AIDS cases related to injection drug use.  About 125,000 AIDS cases - one-third of all infected Americans - are the result of injection drug use (18). As the numbers and percentages of HIV infections and AIDS cases attributable to injection drug use continue to rise, public health officials and activists across the country have sprung into action and begun conducting needle exchange, combined with education and counseling, to attempt to slow the spread of the epidemic.
<p>
The results of American needle exchanges are increasingly demonstrating that these disease control measures are reducing the sharing of potentially HIV-contaminated needles among injection drug users, and reducing HIV infection rates among drug users who participate regularly in needle exchanges (19).  In addition to the New York City experience, needles exchanges in Connecticut reported a 39 percent decline in needle sharing among injecting drug users following the increase in legal access to needle exchange (20). In New Haven specifically, the prevalence of HIV in used needles returned to a needle exchange by exchange participants declined 33 percent after the exchange began operating (21).
<p>
2.  Defendants Operate a Needle Exchange to Reduce HIV Among Injection Drug Users in New Jersey, Where a "Major Epidemic" Exists of Injected-related AIDS
<p>
In 1994, as needle exchanges were becoming known across the nation as effective public health interventions in the effort to reduce injection-related HIV infections and AIDS, a clean needle distribution program began in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
<p>
New Brunswick was a particularly appropriate site for a needle exchange.  A working class community of 41,000 people in Middlesex County, it was common knowledge among police officials as well as AIDS prevention activists that the majority of injection drug users in the county came to New Brunswick to secure drugs and needles.  And, the grim tide of AIDS cases, particularly injection-related AIDS, confirmed New Brunswick was home to a growing epidemic of HIV.  As of March, 435 AIDS cases had been reported in New Brunswick, meaning more than 1 percent of the town's entire population has contracted the fatal disease (22). Of that total, 224 or 53 percent were injection-related AIDS cases (23), a percentage mirroring New Jersey's soaring statewide injection-related AIDS rate - which ranks first in the nation.  Overall, New Brunswick's per capita AIDS rate placed it among the top 20 communities in the country (24).
<p>
The New Brunswick needle exchange was named the Chai Project.  In Hebrew, chai means "Life."  As soon the needle exchange began operating in 1994, it found injection drug users interested in its services, which not only included the distribution of free, sterile needles, but other sterilizing materials such as bleach and alcohol wipes, antibiotic ointments, and information about drug treatment and counseling as well.  In addition to reducing the risk of HIV infection, the needle exchange was established to help reduce the spread of other blood-borne diseases prevalent among injection drug users, including Hepatitis B and C (25).
<p>
Initially, the Chai Project did not insist on a one-for-one exchange of clean for used needles, as it sought to build up trust with the area's injection drug users.  But the program kept careful records of needles distributed and returned.  In 1994, its first year, it distributed 2,000 clean needles, and 153 used syringes were returned.  In 1995, as the program grew and more drug users sought access to its supply of free, sterile needles, cleansing materials, and condoms (26), the Chai Project distributed 20,186 sterile needles - while receiving 8,235 used ones in exchange.  Through the first three months of 1996, before the arrests of exchange volunteers at issue here, the program distributed approximately 14,348 clean needles, and took in 9,530 used ones in return.  The careful documentation by the exchange of its clean needles distributed/used needles returned ratio demonstrates that injection drug users who participate in the exchange are reducing their behavior of sharing needles, which in turn reduces their likelihood of contracting HIV from a contaminated, used needle (27).
<p>
In addition to documenting needles distributed and returned, the Chai Project developed other responsible protocols to better understand its clientele and the face of the injection-related AIDS epidemic in its community.  Through a questionnaire given to each exchange participant, prepared to respect each person's right to privacy, the Chai Project developed coded information about its users:
<ul>
<li>A majority of the exchange's participants, 54 percent, are persons of color.
<li>30 percent are female.
<li>Participants come to New Brunswick seeking the exchange's disease control services from 25 New Jersey communities in six counties.  Three of those counties, Middlesex, Somerset and Union, have injection-related AIDS rates that increased 227 percent, 200 percent and 166 percent, respectively, in the last five years (28).
</ul>
<p>
Along with operating under careful protocols, the Chai Project reached out to local police in 1994 - its first year.  The exchange communicated with New Brunswick Police Department officials and explained their purpose as a disease control program to help reduce HIV infections among injection drug users in the community.
<p>
Following that outreach by the exchange, New Brunswick Police Director Michael Beltranena was publicly quoted in several news articles as saying that he intended to lawfully exercise his discretion as a law-enforcement officer and allow the exchange to continue operating, since he understood its purpose as a public health program intended to slow the spread of HIV, and not as criminal conduct intended to promote illicit narcotics use.  Beltranena explained his Police Department's official position in one news article:
<p>
<blockquote>
This group is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS and is urging people to get drug treatment. It's commitment is admirable.  Are we going to allow drug dealing?  Of course not.  But here in New Brunswick there is a concern about AIDS and we must be sensitive to it.  My officers would have discretion, depending on the situation, to summons and release them or just send them on their way.</blockquote>
<p>
Despite the Police Department's reasonable legal position, Defendants were eventually arrested on April 18, 1996, at the direction of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office - two weeks after the Governor's Advisory Council publicly recommended that New Jersey adopt needle exchange as a disease control measure to reduce HIV transmission among injection drug users.
<p>
While the highest levels of New Jersey government were conferring on a disorderly persons charge against disease control activists trying to stem the tide of an epidemic, that tide continued its inexorable, deadly rise.
<p>
In 1995, 1,932 New Jersey citizens were diagnosed with AIDS attributable to injection drug use.  That number includes injection drug users.  It includes their sex partners infected by the users.  And it includes their offspring, infected in the womb.

<b>III. Argument</b>
<p>
A.  The Charges Against Defendants Should be Dismissed, Because the Drug Paraphernalia Law Under Which They Were Charged was Not Intended to Apply to Disease Control Measures such as Needle Exchange
<p>
1.  Eleven U. S. Communities Have Adopted Needle Exchanges Based on the Reasonable Legal Basis that Drug Paraphernalia Laws Were Not Intended to Apply to Public Health Measures such as Needle Exchange
<p>
The literature on needle exchange has generally assumed that programs not explicitly approved under drug paraphernalia or needle prescription laws are illegal ( 31). Yet, while most states have drug paraphernalia or prescription laws that may be reasonably be interpreted to bar needle exchange, these laws have rarely been enforced, and most people charged under them have been acquitted (32).
<p>
Moreover, evidence of the efficacy of needle exchange as a bona fide disease control measure in reducing HIV infections continues to grow (33).
<p>
Under these circumstances, local officials and their legal advisors in 11 cities and counties have found it equally reasonable - and imperative from a public health perspective - to take the legal position that drug paraphernalia and needle prescription laws, adopted by legislatures long before the AIDS epidemic appeared, were not intended to apply to bona fide disease control measures such as needle exchanges (34).
<p>
Los Angeles adopted this reasonable legal position in supporting needle exchange to reduce HIV transmission and AIDS despite the existence of California drug paraphernalia and needle prescription laws (35). San Francisco and six other communities in California adopted the same legal position to support needle exchange - despite the same drug statutes (36).
<p>
Philadelphia adopted this legal position to authorize needle exchange as a public health response to HIV and AIDS - despite Pennsylvania drug laws identical in all relevant aspects to the California laws (37).  Cleveland has taken the same legal position to support needle exchange - despite the Ohio drug paraphernalia law (38).  In Colorado, the Boulder County health department adopted this position and proceeded on its own authority to adopt needle exchange, without declaring an emergency or taking any other legal step - despite the state's drug paraphernalia law.
<p>
In adopting the reasonable legal position that drug paraphernalia and needle prescription laws were not intended to apply to bona fide disease control measures such as needle exchange, each local government has also relied on state or local public health laws that empower public health officials at the state and local level with a broad reservoir of authority to take necessary action to prevent the transmission of disease (39).
<p>
However, it should be noted that in several of the communities where this reasonable legal position has led to official support of needle exchange, the exchange itself is actually operated by private HIV prevention activists.  The experience in Philadelphia illustrates the essential role private activists are playing under the legal position that drug paraphernalia and needle prescription laws were not intended to apply to a bona fide disease control measure such as needle exchange.  Once Philadelphia's mayor issued an executive order finding an AIDS epidemic existed in the city and required an urgent public health response, the city provided funding to private activists, who were already operating a needle exchange without a clear legal basis.  The private activists still operate Philadelphia's exchange program, but now do so under the reasonable legal position that Pennsylvania's drug laws do not apply to a disease control measure such as needle exchange.
<p>
In addition to the 11 American communities operating needle exchanges under this reasonable legal position, 27 additional exchanges in five other states are operating based on authorization by legislative amendment to or judicial interpretations of such drug laws, or been exempted from them by state executive action (40).
<p>
In one such instance, public health officials in Spokane County, Washington, went to court seeking declaratory judgment that broad local and state public health laws authorized public health programs such as needle exchange, and drug paraphernalia laws, narrowly prohibiting criminal conduct committed with criminal intent, did not prohibit exchanges.  The State Supreme Court agreed, and in its persuasive decision so held:
<p>
<blockquote>
[P]laintiffs argue ... the drug paraphernalia act, which is aimed at criminal conduct, simply does not apply to their actions.  We agree, finding the [county's] needle exchange program permissible under the constitution and [public health] statutes of this state....  Defendants [county prosecutor and state Attorney General] contend the needle exchange program conflicts with the drug paraphernalia act and is therefore not authorized by the constitution.  This argument lacks merit (41).</blockquote>
<p>
2.  The Charges Against Defendants Should be Dismissed Pursuant to 2C:2-11, as Their Conduct in Operating a Disease Control Program Did Not Cause the Harm Sought to be Prevented by Drug Paraphernalia Laws
<p>
Under N.J.S.A. 2C 2-11, the Assignment Judge has discretion to dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the conduct charged to constitute an offense and the nature of the attendant circumstances, he finds that the defendant's conduct:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Was within a customary license or tolerance, neither expressly negated by the person whose interest was infringed nor inconsistent with the purpose of the law defining the offense;

<li>Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction; or

<li>Presents such other extenuations that it cannot reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the legislature in forbidding the offense.<br>
N.J.S.A. 2C:2-11
</ol>
<p>
2C:2-11 permits dismissal if any one of its three subparts fits defendant's conduct.  Here, all three subparts apply to defendants' actions and support dismissal of these charges.
<p>
The headnote of 2C:2-11 refers to "de minimis infractions", and subpart (b) of the statute refers to defendant conduct "too trivial" to warrant condemnation.  However, New Jersey courts have noted 2C:2-11 may be used to dismiss even the most "<i>serious offenses</i>" - including a murder indictment - if defendant's conduct "did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law".  State v. Evans, 193 N.J. Super. 560, 566 (Law Div. 1984) (Emphasis added).  The dismissal of "trivial" charges is an "alternative proviso".  Id. (Emphasis in original).
<p>
Defendants do not argue their conduct is too trivial to warrant prosecution.  Defendants argue their conduct is a serious public health response to a "major epidemic" of injection-related AIDS in New Jersey.  Defendants further argue that under any reasonable construction of the intended purpose of 2C:36-6 together with the demonstrated efficacy of needle exchange as a disease control measure, Defendants' conduct did not cause 
the harm or evil sought to be prevented by New Jersey's drug paraphernalia statute.  Defendants' conduct was, and is, a bona fide public health response to control the AIDS epidemic, and was not intended to be prohibited by 2C:36-6.
<p>
2C:36-6 prohibits any person from possessing or distributing drug paraphernalia, including needles, with the intent they will be used to introduce illicit drugs into the body.
<p>
During the 40 years since New Jersey first enacted its drug paraphernalia statute and through subsequent updates, the legislative purpose beneath the law has always been clear: Curb illegal drug use by prohibiting the commercial drug paraphernalia industry.  In separate statements concerning 1980 predecessors of 2C:36-6, New Jersey's governor and General Assembly both clarified the law's purpose:
<p>
<blockquote>
The bill is directed at so-called "head shops" which promote items used in connection with the ingestion ... of controlled dangerous substances. ... By virtue of the State's interest in promoting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens ... the purpose of [a drug paraphernalia statute] is a legitimate one.  Further, there appears to be a sufficiently rational relationship between drug paraphernalia and illegal drug use to permit State regulation of the manufacture, sale and distribution of the former (42).
<p>
The New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act [citation omitted] does not control the manufacturing, possession, advertising, sale or use of so-called drug paraphernalia.  The purpose of this bill is to proscribe such activities. ... The availability of drug paraphernalia has reached epidemic levels.  An entire industry has developed which promotes, even glamorizes, the illegal use of drugs by adults and children alike.  Sales of drug paraphernalia are reported as high as three billion dollars a year (43).
</blockquote>
<p>
The legislative history of the state's drug paraphernalia statute is devoid of any reference to HIV or the AIDS epidemic.
<p>
Nothing in Defendants' conduct in operating a needle exchange to provide free, sterile needles and other cleansing materials to injection drug users, along with condoms, drug treatment and counseling information, as a bona fide disease control measure to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS in New Brunswick and six surrounding counties, can remotely be construed as promoting or glamorizing illicit drug use.  Neither can Defendants' conduct in any way be construed as a commercial attempt to profit from the drug trade by selling drug paraphernalia.
<p>
Every clean needle Defendants ever distributed to an injection drug user was free.  Defendants are volunteers in this public health program.  The Chai Project has no paid staffers.  Its sole purpose is to conduct needle exchange as a bona fide disease control measure to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS.  Evidence of the effectiveness of needle exchange in reducing the spread of AIDS continues to grow (44).  Some studies of needle exchanges actually report that illicit injection drug use decreases among injection drug users who regularly participate in needle exchanges (45) - the express purpose of New Jersey and other state drug paraphernalia laws.
<p>
Under a reasonable interpretation of the harm sought to be prevented by 2C:36-6 - curbing illicit drug use by criminalizing the commercial drug paraphernalia industry, construed together with the equally reasonable legal position now taken by 11 communities across the country (46) that paraphernalia laws were not intended to apply to bona fide disease control measures such as needle exchange, this Court can and must exercise its discretion under 2C:2-11 to dismiss the charges against Defendants.
<p>
Not only did Defendants' conduct in operating a needle exchange to reduce HIV among injection drug users not cause or threaten the harm sought to be prevented by 2C:36-6, their conduct was also clearly within a "customary license or tolerance", and not otherwise inconsistent with 2C:36-6's purpose, and so should be dismissed pursuant to 2C:2-11(a).
<p>
For at least one and a half years (most of its existence) the conduct of the Chai Project needle exchange in distributing clean needles to injection drug users to reduce HIV transmission was known and tolerated by the New Brunswick Police Department.
<p>
After direct communications between the Chai Project and police officials in the fall of 1994, New Brunswick Police Director Michael Beltranena was publicly quoted in the news media as stating the needle exchange's actions would be tolerated and not prosecuted by police because he understood the program was a bona fide public health measure trying to reduce the spread of AIDS in his community.
<p>
After several such public statements over a year's period (47), Police Director Beltranena was asked again about the exchange just weeks before the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office ordered Defendants' arrests, and he responded that his police officers had "higher priorities" than to arrest needle exchange workers "trying to reverse a dangerous trend" (48).
<p>
For at least one and a half years, the conduct of Defendants in operating a bona fide disease control program of needle exchange was tacitly licensed and publicly tolerated by the New Brunswick Police Department, because that conduct was not inconsistent with the purpose of 2C:36-6 - curbing illicit -drug use and the commercial paraphernalia trade.  Under 2C:2-11(a), this Court has clear statutory discretion to dismiss these charges.
<p>
In a 1991 case involving needle exchange workers arrested and prosecuted in Jersey City under the same paraphernalia law at issue here, the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to 2C:2-11.  State v. Sorge, supra.
<p>
Sorge was a case of first impression in New Jersey (49).  It was decided by a court of equal statute to this Court.  As such, it is not binding authority.  As discussed previously and below in this brief, the data as to the efficacy of needle exchange which the court reviewed in Sorge is now antiquated.  Even as persuasive authority, then, the decision is of little value now.  In denying defendants' motion to dismiss, the court in Sorge stated defendants were "exacerbating" the social costs associated with illicit drug use.  Id. at 148.  The court opined that defendants' assertions that needle exchanges can have an ameliorative impact on injection drug use were "not supported by any evidence".  Id. at 149.  The court stated there was as yet "no consensus" on these and other issues regarding the efficacy of needle exchange.  Id.
<p>
Much has changed concerning the evidence on needle exchange since Sorge.  Numerous studies by respected public health experts have been completed on the efficacy of needle exchange as a disease control measure to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS (50). A consensus has emerged, and it is this: The evidence shows needle exchange works by reducing the sharing of used, potentially HIV-contaminated needles among injection drug users.  It shows, in some instances, an actual decline in injection drug use, as more users gain access through needle exchanges to information about treatment and counseling.  It shows, most importantly, that needle exchange reduces the rate of HIV infection among injection drug users who use exchanges, compared with drug users who do not use them (51).
<p>
Respected government and public health organizations have gone, on record since Sorge was decided, supporting needle exchange as a bona fide disease control program that can reduce HIV infections and save lives.  The U.S. General Accounting Office has endorsed the concept of needle exchange.  So has the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation's preeminent disease prevention agency, has published studies that endorse needle exchange as a public health measure to control the spread of HIV and AIDS.  The Medical Society of New Jersey is on record supporting needle exchange to reduce HIV infection rates in New Jersey.  And, last April - two weeks before Defendants' arrest - the Governor's Advisory Council found that a "major epidemic" of injection-related AIDS exists in New Jersey, and urged the state to adopt needle exchange as an official disease control policy.
<p>
The statistics have changed, too, since Sorge.
<p>
Since 1991, 9,730 new AIDS cases related to injection drug use (52) have been diagnosed in New Jersey.  That means 63 percent of all injection-related AIDS cases in the history of the epidemic in New Jersey have been diagnosed since the Sorge decision.
<p>
Given such devastatingly attendant circumstances, never envisaged by the legislature in drafting 2C:36-6 in a different time, before this epidemic, this Court can and must exercise its statutory discretion under 2C:2-11 and dismiss all charges against Defendants.
<p>
3.  The Charges Against Defendants Should be Dismissed Pursuant to the Court's Inherent Power to Fashion Needed and Appropriate Remedies, Because 2C:36-6 Does Not Apply to Needle Exchanges
<p>
It is well established that the judicial article of the New Jersey Constitution reposes in our courts the power to create and apply remedies once jurisdiction has been invoked.  State v. Abbati, 99 N.J. 418 (1985) (53).  This is particularly true in the criminal justice field.  The Court's power to fashion remedies in the realm of criminal justice is unquestioned.  Id. It has long been recognized that the judiciary has inherent power to dismiss criminal charges, particularly where the prosecution of charges would violate defendants' constitutional rights.  Id.
<p>
For all of the reasons articulated in Section A, parts 1 and 2 of this Memorandum of Law, this Court can and must exercise its inherent judicial power under the New Jersey Constitution to dismiss these charges against Defendants.
<p>
Moreover, the Court should particularly exercise its inherent power to dismiss these criminal charges, because the prosecution of them have the effect of violating the Chai Project needle exchange participants' Due Process Rights to life and bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution, and the participants' right to Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment as well.
<p>
B.  The Charges Against Defendants Should be Dismissed as Violative of the Needle Exchange Participants' Fundamental Right to Life Under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions
<p>
The fundamental right of every person to his or her life predates the United States and New Jersey Constitutions and the founding documents of this country.  The Supreme Court of this State has so recognized:
<p>
<blockquote>The importance of the preservation of life is memorialized in various organic documents.  The Declaration of Independence states as self-evident truths "that all men... are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness." This ideal is inherent in the Constitution of the United States.  It is explicitly recognized in our Constitution of 1947 which provides for "certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life ..."  N.J. Const. (1947) Art.  I, par. 1. Our State government is established to protect such rights, N.J. Const. (1947), Art.  I, par. 2, and, acting through the Attorney General ... it enforces them (54).
</blockquote>
<p>
As a Federal constitutional matter, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause "protects an interest in life as well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining medical treatment." Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri-Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990).  The right to preserve one's own life is so clearly "rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental" under the United States Constitution.  Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934) . This right to life is, likewise, fundamental under the New Jersey Constitution, which protects the right of "enjoying and defending life".  N.J. Const., Art.  I, par. 1.
<p>
As a fundamental right, New Jersey may interfere with a person's right to life and bodily integrity only by showing its actions are necessary to serve a compelling state interest.  If a fundamental right is not implicated, a state still must show a rational relationship between a legitimate state goal and the means employed to achieve that goal.
<p>
The fundamental right to life of every injection drug user who participates in the Chai Project needle exchange has been violated by the State's arbitrary decision, after a year and a half of following a stated, rational policy of tolerance and acquiescence of the exchange's operations, to arrest Defendants under 2C:36-6.
<p>
Defendants have standing to assert their exchange participants' fundamental right to life, because Defendants' interests in operating a bona fide disease control program to slow the spread of HIV are intertwined with exchange participants' interests in obtaining access to free, clean needles - a potentially lifesaving device in the midst of a "major epidemic" of injection-related AIDS in New Jersey.  In this intertwining of interests, Defendants are like "vendors and those in like positions [who] have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting operations by acting as advocates for the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function" (55).
<p>
The only state interest that could possibly be considered compelling is New Jersey' s acknowledged interest in curbing illicit drug use and the commercial paraphernalia industry.  But, for all of the reasons previously stated, the application of 2C:36-6 to prohibit Defendants' conduct here not only does not further that state interest, it actually inhibits it.
<p>
The evidence that needle exchange is a bona fide disease control measure that can slow the spread of HIV and AIDS continues to grow.  Moreover, the evidence suggests needle exchange not only reduces injection drug users' chances of contracting HIV, it contributes to a decline in injection drug use as well (56). By providing injection drug users with a free, reliable supply of sterile needles, exchanges also reduce the demand on the streets for black-market needles, which cost $5 to $7 apiece on the streets of New Brunswick.  Thus needle exchange helps curb illicit drug paraphernalia commerce as well - the explicit, stated purpose of 2C:36-6.
<p>
For all of these reasons, the application of 2C:36-6 to prohibit Defendants from operating a bona fide disease control program to reduce HIV infections among injection drug users fails the compelling state interest test, and violates the fundamental right to life that exchange participants possess, like every person, under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions.
<p>
Applying this drug paraphernalia law to prohibit needle exchange not only serves no compelling state interest, it fails the less restrictive rational relationship test as well.
<p>
While the State certainly could have asserted, before the AIDS epidemic, that 2C:36-6 bore a rational relationship to New Jersey's legitimate goal of curbing illicit drug use and the commercial paraphernalia trade, such an argument today, in the face of a raging "major epidemic" of injection-related AIDS in this state, must obviously fail.
<p>
Every leading public health organization in the United States and New Jersey with a stake in controlling the AIDS epidemic and the explosion of injection-related AIDS in particular has endorsed needle exchange as the most effective disease control measure yet available.  As the prestigious National Research Council and Institute of Medicine found last fall:
<p>
<blockquote>Needle exchange programs reduce the spread of HIV - the virus that causes AIDS - without increasing either the injection of illegal drugs among program participants or the number of new initiates to injection drug use (57).</blockquote>
<p>
The application of 2C:36-6 to prohibit the Chai Project from conducting needle exchange to reduce HIV infections and potentially curb injection drug use, bears no rational relationship to the statute's purpose in curbing illicit drug use and the commercial paraphernalia trade.
<p>
The use of 2C:36-6 as applied in this case not only violates the fundamental constitutional right to life of needle exchange participants, it may, literally, sentence them to death.
<p>
Returned to the streets of New Brunswick to secure used needles, the exchange's participants may see their chance of contracting HIV rise, perhaps by as much as fourfold (58).
<p>
New Brunswick already has one of the 20 highest per capita rates of AIDS in the United States.  More than half of that soaring AIDS rate is injection-related.
<p>
For each exchange participant denied his fundamental right to life through access to sterile needles at the Chai Project exchange, by virtue of Defendants' arrests, infection with HIV is a death sentence.
<p>
C.  The Charges Against Defendants Should be Dismissed as Violative of the Needle Exchange Participants, Fundamental Right to Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
<p>
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees every person "equal protection of the laws".  U.S. Const., Amdt.  XIV, Sect. 1. The Equal Protection Clause serve as a restriction on discriminatory state action.
<p>
The "core guarantee" of the Equal Protection Clause is "ensuring citizens that their State will not discriminate on account of race." Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  State action that implicates racial classifications must be subjected to the strictest scrutiny, justifiable only by the weightiest considerations.  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976). The invidious quality of a law claimed as racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a discriminatory purpose for a finding of unconstitutional state action.  Id. An invidious, unconstitutional discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.  Id.
<p>
The application of 2C:36-6 to prohibit Defendants from distributing free, clean needles to injection drug users in New Brunswick and six surrounding counties, is violative of the fundamental right of injection drug users who are persons of color to equal protection of the laws (59).
<p>
A panel of public health experts, appointed by the New Jersey Governor to study the AIDS crisis and recommend policies to confront it, earlier this year found that a "major epidemic" of injection-related AIDS exists in the state (60). The Governor's Advisory Council took particular note of the disproportionate devastation that injection-related HIV and AIDS was wreaking on the minority community:
<p>
<blockquote>Although African-Americans are less than 20 percent of the population of New Jersey, they accounted for almost 60 percent of new injection-related AIDS cases in 1994.  By the end of 1994, over 8,400 New Jersey African Americans age 13 and over were living with injection-related AIDS, or, had died from it (61).</blockquote>
<p>
In the fast-moving AIDS epidemic, those distressing, disproportionate statistics - released six months ago - are already out of date.  In 1995, there were 1,932 new persons diagnosed with injection-related AIDS - and 81 percent of those were persons of color.  By the end of 1995, nearly 10,000 New Jersey African Americans or other persons of color age 13 and over living with injection-related AIDS, or had died from it.
<p>
In New Brunswick, a majority of the Chai Project needle exchange's injection drug users who participate in the program are minority citizens, according to data kept by the exchange.
<p>
The totality of the relevant facts concerning the current state of the injection-related AIDS epidemic in New Jersey, the disproportionate devastation that injection-related AIDS is inflicting on the minority community, and the ethnic makeup of the injection drug users who participate in the Chai Project exchange at issue here all lead to the inescapable conclusion that the application of 2C:36-6 bears much more heavily on minority citizens than on any other similarly situated class.  Given the rising tide of injection-related HIV and AIDS in the African-American community - a fact noted by the governor's own commission - the application of the drug paraphernalia law to shut down a needle exchange program serving a predominately minority clientele at this point in the epidemic's history raises sufficient questions of an invidious discriminatory purpose by the state to trigger the strictest judicial scrutiny.
<p>
Moreover, for all of the reasons argued in Section III, part B of this Memorandum, it is beyond rational dispute that the State cannot make the required showing under the strict scrutiny test of legitimate state action narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  The evidence that needle exchange is effective in reducing HIV infection rates among injection drug users, reducing users' high-risk behavior of sharing needles, and, in some cases, actually helping to reduce injection drug use among exchange participants continues to grow (62). Applying 2C:36-6 to inhibit the operations of the only needle exchange known to be operating in the New Brunswick area clearly fails, under any reasonable interpretation, to further the government interest of decreasing drug use and curbing the commercial drug paraphernalia trade.
<p>
For the same reasons, based on the totality of the circumstances and evidence, the application of 2C:36-6 fails to meet even the less-strict rational relationship test.  The twin scourges of the AIDS epidemic and injection drug use are ravaging injection drug users in New Jersey.  They are ravaging drug users' sex partners.  And they are ravaging their offspring.  The rate at which these twin plagues are ravaging minority citizens in New Jersey was three times higher than their proportion of the state's population in 1994.  In 1995, that rate of minority injection-related AIDS continued to rise, to four times the percentage of minority population in the state.
<p>
The totality of all these facts reveals the invidious presence of a discriminatory purpose in the application of 2C:36-6 to arrest Defendants and inhibit needle exchange in New Brunswick and surrounding areas, thus making it more likely than not that more minority citizens will contract HIV and, ultimately, perish.
<p>
The application of 2C:36-6 in this case violates the fundamental right of needle exchange minority participants to Equal Protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.  On that basis, the charges against Defendants must be dismissed.

<b>IV. Conclusion</b>
<p>
In 1991, a New Jersey court first considered whether a needle exchange program, intended to reduce needle-sharing among injection drug users and slow the spread of HIV, was the kind of criminal conduct intended to be prohibited by 2C:36-6, the state's drug paraphernalia law.  Defendants were ultimately acquitted at trial.  Neither the appellate nor Supreme Court of New Jersey has yet considered this issue, and there have been no other cases in the trial courts.
<p>
Five years have passed since the Sorge decision.
<p>
Much has changed.
<p>
In those five years, a clear public health consensus has emerged that needle exchange works by reducing needle-sharing among injection drug users, which in turn causes HIV infection rates among exchange participants to decline.
<p>
In those five years, dozens of American communities have responded to the crisis of AIDS fueled by injection drug use by adopting needle exchange programs.  Eleven communities have done so by taking the reasonable legal position that drug paraphernalia laws were not intended to apply to bona fide disease control measures, and so do not prohibit needle exchange programs.
<p>
One thing has not changed: the inexorable pace of the AIDS epidemic in New Jersey.  In those five years, 9,730 more New Jerseyians - injection drug users, their sex partners, and their offspring were diagnosed with injection-related AIDS.
<p>
In those five years, Jersey City went from the fifth highest per capita rate of AIDS in the country to the highest rate.  The number of people with AIDS in Jersey City more than doubled.
<p>
AIDS is now the leading killer of women in Jersey City.
<p>
And in those five years, the alarmingly disproportionate rate of injection-related AIDS among persons of color in New Jersey continued to rise.  Last year, it hit 81 percent.
<p>
As of last March, 29,639 men, women and children in New Jersey had developed AIDS.
<p>
19,778 of those citizens of New Jersey have already died.
<p>
Official estimates of total HIV infections in New Jersey range as high as 50,000 people.
<p>
There is no known cure.
<p>
But there is a public health intervention that can work to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS, and save lives: Needle exchange.
<p>
Needle exchange works.  Needle exchange is a legal public health disease control measure.

The rise in cocaine use and appearance of crack cocaine in the 1980s spurred fears about its effects on the 
developing fetus.  Cocaine use during pregnancy is certainly inadvisable, yet many of the initial reports 
cited dangers that later studies do not support, and policies fostered during those years may have caused 
more harm than good.  Recent press and politics have not reflected changes seen in the scientific realm.
<p>

<b><i>Many reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use can lead to an array of fetal, newborn and 
child development problems.</i></b>
<ul>

<li>In 1985, a case study by Ira Chasnoff, et al., <a name="back1"></a><a href="#note1">(1)</a> which 
reported damaging effects of cocaine use during pregnancy, touched off a massive media response which 
continues today. <a name="back2"></a><a href="#note2">(2)</a> 
<li>Further studies reported problems associated with cocaine use during pregnancy including increased 
exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, <a name="back3"></a><a href="#note3">(3)</a> maternal 
weight loss, nutritional deficits <a name="back4"></a><a href="#note4">(4)</a> and polydrug use, <a 
name="back5"></a><a href="#note5">(5)</a> premature detachment of the placenta, <a 
name="back6"></a><a href="#note6">(6)</a> premature birth and reduced/low birth weight, reductions in 
newborn body length and head circumference, <a name="back7"></a><a href="#note7">(7)</a> and rare 
birth defects including genito-urinary tract malformations <a name="back8"></a><a href="#note8">(8)</a> 
and extremely rare bone <a name="back9"></a><a href="#note9">(9)</a> and neural tube <a 
name="back10"></a><a href="#note10">(10)</a> abnormalities.
<li>Capitalizing on this research and the media excitement, many politicians enacted laws requiring health 
care professionals to report pregnant illicit drug users to child welfare authorities, <a 
name="back11"></a><a href="#note11">(11)</a> initiated policies requiring authorities to separate 
children from mothers who used drugs while pregnant, <a name="back12"></a><a 
href="#note12">(12)</a> and pursued legislation making drug use during pregnancy a criminal offense. <a 
name="back13"></a><a href="#note13">(13)</a>
<li>In July, 1996, South Carolina's Supreme Court became the first to uphold the criminal prosecution of 
women for child abuse by way of prenatal drug use (penalized with a prison sentence of up to 10 years). <a 
name="back14"></a><a href="#note14">(14)</a>
</ul>
<p>

<b><i>Analyses of this early research found methodological flaws and most researchers now put forth more 
cautious conclusions about the effects of prenatal cocaine use.</i></b>
<ul>
<li>A meta-analysis of most 1980s studies on prenatal cocaine use found serious methodological flaws 
including 1) the lack of control groups, <a name="back15"></a><a href="#note15">(15)</a> 2) failure to 
distinguish cocaine use from the use of other drugs, <a name="back16"></a><a href="#note16">(16)</a> 
3) failure to study the ensuing health of the newborn, <a name="back17"></a><a href="#note17">(17)</a> 
and 4) the use of case reports alone. <a name="back18"></a><a href="#note18">(18)</a>
<li>Medical personnel working with cocaine-exposed children often report them to be indistinguishable 
from other children. <a name="back19"></a><a href="#note19">(19)</a>  Early studies which suggested a 
'fetal cocaine withdrawal syndrome' were non-blind (the observers were told which infants had been 
exposed to cocaine). Subsequent blind studies (in which the observers did not know the status of the infants) 
were unable to detect the phenomenon. <a name="back20"></a><a href="#note20">(20)</a>  
<li>Well controlled studies find minimal or no increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) 
among cocaine-exposed infants.  <a name="back21"></a><a href="#note21">(21)</a>  Early studies which 
reported an increased risk of SIDS <a name="back22"></a><a href="#note22">(22)</a> did not control for 
socioeconomic characteristics.
<li>A 1989 study by Gideon Koren, et al., in The Lancet, found that scientific results describing harmful 
effects of cocaine use during pregnancy were more likely to be accepted for conference presentation and 
publication than studies of equal or superior methodology showing few or no effects. <a 
name="back23"></a><a href="#note23">(23)</a>
<li>Many animal studies <a name="back24"></a><a href="#note24">(24)</a> and some human studies <a 
name="back25"></a><a href="#note25">(25)</a> of chronic cocaine use (along with human studies of 
social cocaine use <a name="back26"></a><a href="#note26">(26)</a>) find no direct effects on newborn 
health or development.  Others encounter varied and inconsistent results, <a name="back27"></a><a 
href="#note27">(27)</a> leading many researchers to believe different factors may be responsible. <a 
name="back28"></a><a href="#note28">(28)</a>
</ul>
<p>

No causal link has been established between cocaine use and poor fetal development because these studies 
are correlational in nature. <a name="back29"></a><a href="#note29">(29)</a>  And among the general 
population there has been no detectable increase in any birth defects which may be associated with cocaine 
use during pregnancy. <a name="back30"></a><a href="#note30">(30)</a>  However, cocaine, like all 
recreational substances, enters the bloodstream of the developing fetus and has the potential to affect 
development. <a name="back31"></a><a href="#note31">(31)</a>
<p>

<b><i>Much evidence points to the lack of quality prenatal care and the use of alcohol and tobacco as 
primary factors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine users.</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Of all birth defects, 10-15% are due to environmental agents, <a name="back32"></a><a 
href="#note32">(32)</a> 10-15% are hereditary, <a name="back33"></a><a href="#note33">(33)</a> 1-
5% <a name="back34"></a><a href="#note34">(34)</a> are from chemical (including drug) exposure, and 
the rest are due to unknown factors. <a name="back35"></a><a href="#note35">(35)</a>
<li>The lack of quality prenatal care services is associated with prematurity, low birth weight, and other 
fetal development problems. <a name="back36"></a><a href="#note36">(36)</a>  Provision of quality 
prenatal care to heavy cocaine users (with or without drug treatment) has been shown to significantly 
improve fetal health and development. <a name="back37"></a><a href="#note37">(37)</a>
<li>Abuse of alcohol, <a name="back38"></a><a href="#note38">(38)</a> more than any other 
recreational drug, causes the greatest number of and most severe birth defects: 0.19% of all newborns (about 
7,600, or 1% of all newborns exposed to alcohol <a name="back39"></a><a href="#note39">(39)</a>) are 
diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, <a name="back40"></a><a href="#note40">(40)</a> and a larger 
number experience "fetal alcohol effects."
<li>Tobacco use is strongly associated with low birth weight, prematurity, growth retardation, Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome, <a name="back41"></a><a href="#note41">(41)</a> cognitive, achievement and 
behavioral problems <a name="back42"></a><a href="#note42">(42)</a> and, in some cases, mental 
retardation. <a name="back43"></a><a href="#note43">(43)</a>
<li>Other factors strongly associated with poor fetal development include poverty, <a 
name="back44"></a><a href="#note44">(44)</a> lead exposure, <a name="back45"></a><a 
href="#note45">(45)</a> psychiatric problems including major depression, <a name="back46"></a><a 
href="#note46">(46)</a> and depressive symptoms associated with life stress, lack of social support, low 
weight gain, and poly-drug use. <a name="back47"></a><a href="#note47">(47)</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>Political and legal responses to the perceived hazards of prenatal cocaine use may cause more harm than 
good.</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Criminalizing substance abuse during pregnancy discourages substance-using or abusing women from 
seeking prenatal care, drug treatment, and other social services <a name="back48"></a><a 
href="#note48">(48)</a> and sometimes leads to unnecessary abortions. <a name="back49"></a><a 
href="#note49">(49)</a>
<li>Overloaded child welfare services are often unable to find homes for otherwise healthy children branded 
as "crack babies." <a name="back50"></a><a href="#note50">(50)</a>
<li>Pejoratively labeling children lowers teacher and parent expectations. <a name="back51"></a><a 
href="#note51">(51)</a> Presented with children randomly labeled as 'cocaine-exposed' and 'normal,' 
childcare professionals ranked the performance of the 'cocaine-exposed' children below that of the 
'normal.' <a name="back52"></a><a href="#note52">(52)</a>
<li>Regardless of similar or equal levels of illicit drug use during pregnancy, <a name="back53"></a><a 
href="#note53">(53)</a> African-American and Latina women constitute 80% of those prosecuted for 
delivering drug-exposed children <a name="back54"></a><a href="#note54">(54)</a> and are much more 
likely than Caucasian women to be reported to child welfare agencies for prenatal drug use . <a 
name="back55"></a><a href="#note55">(55)</a>
</ul>
<p>
Cocaine use, like other drug use, is not advisable during pregnancy.  Nonetheless, dozens of studies over the 
past decade now indicate that 1) the pharmacological impact of cocaine has been greatly exaggerated, 2) 
other factors are responsible for most of the ills priorly associated with cocaine use and 3) political and legal 
responses have done more to exacerbate than alleviate the situation of poor and/or drug-using pregnant 
women.

<p>
A small number of drug treatment programs in the US will accept pregnant addicts and provide child care 
services. <a name="back56"></a><a href="#note56">(56)</a>  Most important, however, is the need for 
social services which do not judge pregnant women for their drug use, but instead try to minimize potential 
hazards. <a name="back57"></a><a href="#note57">(57)</a>  Addressing risk factors beyond cocaine use 
- including inadequate nutrition and health care and the use of legal drugs - increases the likelihood of a 
healthy mother and child.

<p> 
With the massive increase in cocaine use in the United States in the med-1980's, a 
troubling new phase has become part of our vocabulary - "crack babies". This media has 
seized this catch-phrase and is using it as a shorthand expression of society's frustration 
and anger in its inability to come to grips with the terrible problem of drug use during 
pregnancy. Headlines such as "The Crack Children," "Crack in the Cradle," and "Crack 
Babies: Genetic Inferiors" fill our nation's press. Radio and television networks have 
devoted many prime-time hours to "crack babies". Even a New York State Senator's 
admirable investigative efforts, for which I served as a consultant, resulted in monograph 
with the unfortunate title, "Crack Babies: The Shame of New York". 
<p> 
It is certainly undeniable that cocaine use has soared during the past five years, wreaking 
havoc on our society. It is also true that cocaine use during pregnancy has dramatically 
increased, with a 20 fold increase in drug-exposed babies in New York over the past 
decade. I also know that this cocaine epidemic is linked to transmission of diseases such 
as syphilis and AIDS from drug-using mothers to their children. 
<p> 
Why, then, does the term "crack babies" trouble me so greatly? First, in my twenty years 
of research on drug use during pregnancy, I have never before witnessed such media- 
supported pressure to alarm the nation about the fate of a group of diverse infants. 
Despite very little firm medical documentation of the effects of cocaine on the newborn 
infant and young child, the media has already concluded that "crack Babies" are 
prematurely born, tiny brain-injured, unlovable, unteachable, unreclaimable, and even 
unadoptable. The media portrays "crack babies" as children incapable of positive 
learning experiences and condemned to a joyless childhood. If this were true, why would 
society want to allocate resources to help this unfortunate group of babies? In fact, what 
is really being presented to the public from ? of interviews with "experts" is a 
patchwork quilt of untested assumptions, individual impressions, and anecdotal 
experiences which may or may not stand the test of time. 
<p> 
Although responsible researchers are working actively to answer many questions about 
these infants, this process of discovery takes time and patience and should unfold in an 
environment free of political pressure and "media hype". Remember that pediatricians 
have never before been asked to predict the future of hundreds of thousands of diverse 
drug-exposed infants who may face a multiplicity of high-risk factors: low birth weight, 
prematurity, mothers who are frequently poor, malnourished, underprivileged, homeless, 
battered, lacking prenatal care, alcoholic, and HIV positive. Since each of these factors is 
known to be associated wit poor infant outcome, it becomes extremely difficult to 
identify a mother's cocaine use as a single variable which might adversely affect her 
child. 
<p> 
Second, since science may influence or even determine public policy, bad science may 
lead to bad public policy. As a consultant to educational planning groups and child 
foundations, I know the frustration and urgency which they feel as this generation of 
"crack babies" come towards them. If, in fact, specific medical and educational services 
are needed for this group of infants, strategies to approach these needs should be based on 
carefully gathered, peer-reviewed data rather than on "blind men feeling the elephant" 
impressions which currently predominate. 
<p> 
Third, since most of the media presentations which I have seen target drug use in 
minority populations, this portrayal contributes to the racial stigmatization of our drug 
epidemic. It is well known that racially unbalanced urine testing at delivery has given the 
impression that drug use during pregnancy is largely confined to women of minority 
groups. Such testing has led to a cascade of interventions, including summary removal of 
the child from the mother and prosecutions. Drug using women are being prosecuted in a 
least nine states, including Florida, where I served as an expert witness for the defense for 
one such unfortunate woman. Since evidence demonstrates that drug use to varying 
degrees is also prevalent in the white middle and upper classes, I suspect that this 
prosecutorial approach would be quite different if every baby's urine was tested and 
subsequent judicial actions taken on a race-blind and economics-blind basis. 
<p> 
Fourth, the term "crack babies" shifts the focus away from real needs of our society 
which the drug epidemic symbolizes - the need to assure economic and social 
opportunities to every person in our society. Many programs with such a focus have 
suffered major cutbacks during the past decade. Expenditures of this sort seem to me a 
very wise investment in our country's economic and social future. Since we know that 
programs such as "headstart" work to promote child health, we should bolster these 
programs as we await information on cocaine-exposed babies to determine whether these 
programs need specific adaptations for this drug-exposed group of infants. 
<p> 
Cocaine is a plague which has ripped gaping holes in our society through which we stare 
with horror. If it eventually proves true that cocaine directly damages the brains of our 
young children, this would represent an American tragedy of immense proportions. It is 
certainly true that a tragedy of such proportions, poverty and homelessness, is already 
affecting mothers and children. If, in his recent United Nations speech, President Bush 
was serious about our nation's commitment to children, the resources needed to deal with 
this crisis would make a mockery of current budgetary expenditures allotted to fight the 
"war on drugs". In the meantime, we should abandon the term "crack babies" and 
remember that drug-exposed infants are a diverse group of babies with a heterogeneity as 
complex as our country itself. As sound medical data accumulates, we may then develop 
medical and educational interventions to offer these children lives filled with 
opportunities to realize their full potentials.

<P> 
In the early 1990s use of heroin has grown into epidemic proportions 
in Macedonia. <STRONG>There are presently an estimated 5000 to 
6000 heroin users</STRONG> on a total population of two million 
citizens. The number of heroin users is expected to grow over 
the coming years to three to four times the current size of the 
population. <STRONG>Heroin use seems to have emerged in all ethnic 
groups, but may be more widespread among Albanians.</STRONG> Among 
ethnic Macedonians heroin use seems largely concentrated among 
15 to 25 years olds, while in the Albanian community its use may 
have spread to all age groups. While reportedly mainly an urban 
phenomenon, some informants believe that heroin is also used among 
rural (Albanian) populations in the west of Macedonia. 
<P> 
Only a minority of heroin users inject. Most users snort, smoke 
the drug in cigarettes, or chase it from aluminum foil. Drug injecting 
is an important risk factor for HIV infection. The fieldwork suggests 
that <STRONG>the level of HIV risk behaviors among injecting drug 
users (IDUs) is unacceptably high.</STRONG> This suggestion is 
corroborated by the 100% hepatitis C seroprevalence in a small 
treatment sample. Likewise, knowledge about the virus and safer 
drug use skills are very limited; among IDUs as well as among 
treatment providers. HIV is not on the agenda of treatment agencies 
in any meaningful way. 
<P> 
At present, HIV seroprevalence among treatment populations is 
zero. This merely indicates that HIV has not yet been introduced 
into the networks of IDUs in Macedonia. This should not be taken 
as a reassurance, because, when introduced, the virus could spread 
like wildfire. However,<STRONG> through rapid and aggressive implementation 
of a &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; based HIV prevention campaign 
aimed at IDUs, it may be possible to contain an HIV epidemic in 
this population.</STRONG> 
<P> 
There is a need for epidemiological and ethnographic research 
to collect necessary information about: the nature and prevalence 
of the use of different drugs; which groups are using drugs (in 
terms of e.g. ethnicity and subcultural orientation); HIV prevalence 
in out-of-treatment populations; nature and extent of HIV risk 
behaviors; etc.. 
<P> 
Drug treatment, drug education, and HIV prevention services aimed 
at drug users have either not been developed or are in their infancy. 
Knowledge and experience of treatment providers is limited and 
overemphasize psychopathology. The demand for drug treatment is 
expected to grow rapidly. <STRONG>In order to meet the rising 
demand for drug treatment, it is advised to involve primary health 
care providers in the treatment and care for drug addicts </STRONG>and 
to reconsider the current barriers (e.g. methadone prescription 
regulations) that complicate their involvement. 
<P> 
A comprehensive drug policy is presently absent in Macedonia. 
<STRONG>We recommend to develop a drug policy based on the following 
Public Health objectives: 1. Management of the current heroin 
epidemic, and 2. Prevention of a large scale drug related HIV 
epidemic.</STRONG> It will be impossible to eradicate the use 
of heroin and the heroin epidemic will certainly grow. However, 
it is possible to manage and contain the heroin epidemic and to 
limit its negative consequences --of which an HIV epidemic is 
the gravest-- through the implementation of a pragmatic &quot;Harm 
Reduction&quot; policy. 
<P> 
Such a policy concentrates on the provision of &quot;low threshold&quot; 
treatment and other practical services to drug users, whereas 
law enforcement interventions are secondary to Public Health goals. 
They are generally restricted to high level organized drug trafficking. 
Drug use, possession of small quantities and consumer level exchanges 
are not an enforcement priority, except where it results in nuisance 
for other people. 
<P> 
<STRONG>One must not forget that the young people who are getting 
involved with drugs are the children of Macedonia. They are the 
country's future. </STRONG>The question must be posed whether 
to criminalize these children (with all the negative consequences, 
ranging from imprisonment and social stigma to AIDS and other 
grave health consequences), or to help them through this difficult 
period. We believe the latter to be the obvious choice. 
<P> 
The Open Society Institute can contribute to the development of 
an effective response to the drug problem in Macedonia in various 
ways: 
<OL> 
<LI>Use its influence to establish a pragmatic Public Health oriented 
drug policy in Macedonia, based on scientific research and respect 
for human rights. 
<LI>Help to raise the level of knowledge and skills of all professionals 
who are dealing with drugs and drug users. This can be pursued 
through the following examples: 
<UL> 
<LI>Providing a reader of translated state-of-the-art articles 
on different drugs, epidemiology, ethnography, drug policy, HIV/AIDS, 
harm reduction, human rights, treatment and prevention, etc.; 
<LI>Making the information on drug use and AIDS issues that is 
available on the internet/World Wide Web accessible through the 
establishment of local dial-in connections; 
<LI>Organize trainings locally with international harm reduction 
experts;<BR> 
 
<LI>Sponsor conference visits and internships at innovative harm 
reduction projects elsewhere (the latter in particular when starting 
up new harm reduction projects. 
</UL> 
 
<LI>Support the establishment of an outreach project, which would 
offer needle exchange and other HIV prevention services, low threshold 
medical care and social support, while simultaneously collecting 
systematic information on the nature and extent of drug use and 
HIV risk behaviors. 
<LI>Support the Center on Treatment and Prevention of Drug Abuse 
in moving to a more central location in Skopje and in involving 
the primary health care system in the treatment of drug problems. 
<LI>Support the development of a credible drug information campaign 
aimed at young adolescents.

<P> 
There are several indications that in the first half of the 1990s 
the prevalence of drug use has risen sharply in the Republic of 
Macedonia. While there is little reliable scientific data on the 
phenomenon, increasing police seizures for instance, rising numbers 
of applications for treatment, media coverage and other anecdotal 
information have induced serious concerns among many individuals 
and organizations. The Open Society Institute Macedonia (OSI-M) 
is among them and has initiated a program, &quot;The Macedonia 
Drug Initiative&quot; (MDI), to help develop adequate responses. 
The first problem MDI encountered is the absence of even the most 
basic insight in nature and extent of drug use and drug related 
problems. Likewise, the institutional responses that have been 
developed so far have often, while well intended, been only partially 
successful. 
<P> 
In particular the absence of specialized knowledge and experience 
in addressing drug problems have motivated OSI-M to request for 
assistance and expertise from the umbrella organization, the Open 
Society Institute New York (OSI-NY). Within OSI-NY issues around 
illicit drugs have recently become a priority, inspiring the establishment 
of The Lindesmith Center (TLC), a drug policy and research center, 
headed by Dr. Ethan Nadelmann. For that reason OSI-M's request 
has been relegated to TLC, which appointed Dr. Jean-Paul C. Grund, 
Research Fellow in Residence at TLC, and Dr. Dusan Nolimal of 
the Institute of Public Health of Slovenia to make a first assessment 
of the Macedonian situation regarding the use of illicit drugs, 
related problems and the availability and quality of treatment 
modalities, and to provide both OSI-M and the New York office

The information in this report was collected during a fact-finding 
mission to Macedonia from March 6 to 16, 1995, carried out by 
Jean Paul Grund and Dusan Nolimal. During this visit a series 
of interviews and discussions with representatives of key governmental 
and non-governmental institutions and individuals knowledgeable 
about drug-related issues in Macedonia were held. Gathering information 
on the nature of drug use in Macedonia, problems caused by their 
use, affected populations, and the available or potential resources 
and control measures that can be brought to bear on these problems 
was the first task undertaken. 
<P> 
Several knowledgeable individuals were identified prior to arrival 
in Macedonia. Some of them suggested other people with whom to 
talk. All were interviewed to learn what they believe to be the 
major drug problems and what short-term and long-term approaches 
could be developed. Notes were taken of each conversation. 
<P> 
<EM>A review of documents</EM> 
<P> 
Existing documents directly or indirectly related to drugs were 
reviewed. Some general information on health was available at 
National Institute of Public Health, more specific information 
on drug treatment demands was available at psychiatric centers. 
Information on drugs seizures and drug offenders was available 
at the Narcotics Department of the State Ministry of Interior. 
These documents provided information on the public and professional 
awareness and concern about drug use and various health, social 
and legal problems, as well as about individuals and organizations 
responding to drug problems. 
<P> 
<EM>A questionnaire </EM> 
<P> 
A questionnaire on new drugs and drug patterns, developed by the 
National Institute of Public Health of Slovenia, was administered 
to a number of key individuals to enhance the quality of the information. 
The topics the questionnaire explored are: Which drugs or drug 
taking habits are considered new in your country? What is at present 
your main source of information about the emergence of new drugs 
or drug-taking habits? What are the main advantages or disadvantages 
of these sources of information? What are the practical results 
of this information? Is there any statistical information on drug 
use and users? Which other expert(s) in your country would you 
advise us to contact for more detailed information on these matters? 
Are there any prevention or intervention projects with regard 
to new drugs in your country?

<P> 
An important objective of the visit was to collect first hand 
information on the local drug scene of Skopje --which is believed 
to be the country's &quot;drug capital&quot;-- to complement the 
information from &quot;official&quot; spokespersons. Because the 
visit was limited to only 10 days in total, it was decided that 
ethnographic fieldwork methods would be utilized to obtain information 
on the extent to which use of various drugs occurs, the types 
of users and use patterns, the availability of drugs in different 
local settings, risk behaviors for HIV, etc.. 
<P> 
The ethnographic methodology relies on establishing contacts and 
developing a level of trust with certain key individuals who are 
knowledgeable about the field under study and are respected by 
their peers. In addition to contributing information about themselves 
and their own experiences, those &quot;key informants&quot; provide 
quick and smooth access to people and places that would otherwise 
take considerably more time to explore. The main data collection 
tools used in this ethnographic &quot;mini study&quot; have been 
&quot;participant observation&quot; and &quot;informal interviews.&quot; 
 
<P> 
Applied in the field of drug use, the information generated by 
ethnographic methodologies provides essential insights into the 
characteristics and functioning of drug markets, drug consumption 
patterns, user groups and motivations for use. Ethnography is 
an especially valuable method when dealing with new, rather unexplored 
issues. As Lambert and Wiebel (1990) explained, &quot;[e]thnographic 
research methods are appropriate for topics about which little 
is known, primarily because ethnography is by its nature fundamental 
and exploratory, preparing the way for more rigorous studies that 
strive for precision and quantification. ... Ethnography serve[s] 
to fill knowledge gaps and set[s] the groundwork for further scientific 
inquiry. ... It is at this exploratory, descriptive stage of research 
that ethnographic and qualitative methods can make significant 
contributions to the knowledge and understanding of problems&quot; 
(Lambert &amp; Wiebel 1990). 
<P> 
The fieldwork in Skopje went surprisingly well. Some of our discussion 
partners (e.g. at the Narcotics Department of the State Ministry 
of Interior) supplied us with some names of bars and clubs where 
they thought that drugs were being used and sold. Thus, a first 
objective of the fieldwork became to check out the assumption 
that drugs are used and sold in the entertainment circuit. Early 
in the visit we were introduced to a young (+/- 20 years) person 
with extensive knowledge of Skopje's drug scene and of the bars 
and clubs where the Macedonian youth gather and socialize. This 
turned out to be an essential contact, who guided me (Dr. Grund) 
through Skopje's entertainment circles and introduced me to many 
(ex-) users of heroin, marihuana and other drugs. During these 
nightly field trips nine (coffee) bars and clubs were visited 
which, according to my field contacts, represented the most popular 
hang-outs of Skopje's youth. In the night of Saturday March 11 
I visited a &quot;Techno Rave&quot; where I contacted the DJ, 
Goran Putica, who is the editor of &quot;Channel 103 Free Radio 
Skopje,&quot; the local independent radio station. This station 
plays eclectic and alternative music and caters to a largely young 
and western oriented audience. The station is actively promoting 
discussion on drug use and has broadcasted pro marihuana and anti 
heroin messages. Being an important participant in, and observer 
of, Skopje's youth culture, Mr. Putica provided an expert opinion 
on several key issues and another entry into the scene of Skopje. 
<P> 
The information generated by these combined methodologies has 
been compiled and will be presented according to topic in the 
following chapters. <A href="#app">Appendix 1.</A> provides an 
overview of the persons and organizations contacted during the 
visit.

<P> 
It needs to be stressed that the information gathered in this 
report provides only an initial assessment of the drug use situation 
in Macedonia. Largely because of the limited time available, many 
issues could only be addressed superficially. In addition, structured 
data collection on drug use and drug related problems in Macedonia 
is almost absent. Therefore, to a large extent the researchers 
had to distill an understanding of the situation from anecdotal 
information, impressions, opinions and incomplete statistics. 
In this situation the ethnographic fieldwork not only functioned 
to gather first hand information, but also to check some of the 
information collected during the meetings with official spokespeople. 
 
<P> 
Thus, while the preliminary character of the report must be emphasized, 
the combination of approaches has resulted in an informed conception 
of drug use, drug related problems and the institutional responses, 
which can serve as a basis for further development of research, 
policy, professional training, and services for those who have 
come into problems with the use of drugs.

<P> 
Macedonia is one of the countries established after the collapse 
of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and one of the 
youngest independent states in south-eastern Europe, with 2073 
thousand inhabitants in 1993. The majority of inhabitants are 
Macedonians, about 23 % are ethnic Albanians and some are ethnic 
Turks (3.8%), Romanies (2.6%) and Serbs (2.1%). The proportion 
of ethnic Albanians in the population is considerable in the municipalities 
of Tetovo (71%), Gostivar (63%), Kicevo (46%) and some other cities. 
The highest percentage of ethnic Turks live in Brod ( 31%). The 
concentration of ethnic Serbs is highest in Kumanovo. The Constitution 
of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of religious 
expression and the Macedonian orthodox church and the Islamic 
religious community are the largest religious structures. The 
official language of the country is Macedonian which is written 
in the Cyrillic alphabet. Albanian, Turkish and Serbo-Croatian 
are also taught in many schools. Also, newspapers and media programs 
are available in the languages of the minorities. According to 
the Macedonian Constitution, the language and alphabet of minorities 
are used officially in the units of local self-government, with 
considerable proportions of minority inhabitants. Nevertheless, 
recent disturbances around the establishment of an Albanian language 
university in Tetovo show that these rights are not automatic. 
<P> 
The level of health care in the country is being slowly improved 
in cooperation with the World Health Organization and other international 
organizations. The WHO health care policy and strategy &quot;Health 
for All&quot; has been introduced as part of the health care policy 
of the country and the developing policy includes an emphasis 
on prevention and primary health care, as well as the promotion 
of healthy life styles and a healthy environment. Important changes 
in the health care system have been introduced, including private 
enterprise in treatment, care and pharmacy activities. This privatization 
process has attracted considerable attention over the past four 
years. The level and improvements in the health care standards 
of the population can be observed by the following indicators: 
The total number of physicians in the country increased from 873 
in 1961 to 4.487 in 1991. The life expectancy in Macedonia increased 
from about 55 years for both sexes in the mid-1950s to over 74 
for women and 70 for men in 1990. The natural infant mortality 
rate is still very high compared to the Western Europe, but was 
reduced from 45.9 per 1000 live births in 1986 to 34.5 in 1990 
and 24.1 in 1993. The birth rate (live births per 1000) has fallen 
from 18.7 in 1986 to 15.6 in 1993. The country is also faced with 
an absolute decrease in number of births from 38.234 in 1986, 
to 35.401 in 1990 and 32.374 in 1993. The mortality rate (deaths 
per 100.000 population) has been moving between 686.9 (in 1990) 
to 752.1 (in 1993) in the period 1986 - 1993. The main causes 
of death in both sexes in 1993 were diseases of heart and circulatory 
system, and cancers. 
<P> 
An estimated 1.314.000 inhabitants are considered part of the 
&quot;able-to-work&quot; population in 1994. About 948.000 persons 
are &quot;active&quot; and the number of employed individuals 
was estimated to be 458.000 in 1994. 117.151 persons were seeking 
employment in 1980 compared to 174.848 in 1993. The unemployment 
rate is rising. In 1994 a social welfare program envisaged a transfer 
of welfare funds to about 45.000 households including 180.000 
inhabitants. In 1992, 6.000 households were covered under this 
program.

The use of illegal drugs in Macedonia dates back to at least 1969, 
when the first cases of drug addiction became visible to the authorities. 
Before 1969 use of drugs or drug trafficking were almost absent 
in the caseloads of the police and courts. Between 1945 and 1980 
only 40 cases were brought for Macedonia's criminal courts. Between 
1980 and 1990 the courts heard an average of 5 to 10 cases per 
year. After 1990 +/- 100 cases came to the attention of the courts 
and especially after 1992 a strong increase was experienced. Law 
enforcement data for the period of 1979 to 1983 show 40 cases 
of illegal drug trafficking with 60 perpetrators. In comparison, 
for the period of 1990 to 1994 these numbers are 231 cases with 
419 offenders. Table 1 provides an overview of these cases.

<P> 
Clearly, the number of cases and involved offenders have increased 
considerably and the almost five-fold increase in the latter period 
predicts a continuing growth --a trend anticipated by local law 
enforcement authorities. The major feature of the 1990 - 1994 
statistics is the increase in the quantity of heroin seized. Though 
cocaine has been reported to be increasingly available on the 
illicit market, only in 1990 the drug was confiscated. According 
to the police most of the seized marihuana was domestically grown. 
 
<P> 
As it concerns all infractions of article 245 (unauthorized production 
of, and/or trafficking in, psychoactive drugs) of the Penal Code 
of the Republic of Macedonia, the data presented in table 1 do 
not distinguish between users, dealers or dealing users. However, 
Mr. Stojanovski from the Narcotics Department of the Ministry 
of Interior explained that about 40% involves recidivist, professional 
drug traffickers, partly involved in international organizations. 
Most of the offenders are between 25 and 30 years of age. Both 
Macedonians and Albanians are among the arrested, as are a number 
of foreigners (Turks). The number of Albanians is disproportionately 
high in comparison with their representation in the population. 
 
<P> 
Table 1 suggests that opium, marihuana and especially heroin are 
the main drugs on Macedonia's illicit market. The Republic of 
Macedonia is renowned for its legal production of high quality 
poppy plants. The harvested opium is processed into morphine and 
other opiates for the pharmaceutical industry by &quot;Alkaloid,&quot; 
a pharmaceutical company in Skopje. However, not all harvested 
opium ends up in this state controlled industry; the traditional 
poppy farmers often keep some aside for their own stock, which 
is used for medicinal or recreational purposes. According to several 
informants, raw opium has been stockpiled for many years. Over 
the years an unknown proportion of this opium was diverted into 
illicit channels, supplying a rather small group of users. Opium 
was smoked, ingested (poppy tea) and, to a lesser degree, injected. 
&quot;Compote&quot; (a home brew of several opium alkaloids, including 
heroin) has only been observed incidentally. On a small scale, 
raw opium can still be found on the illicit market as the result 
of old stocks in the houses of the traditional producers. However, 
the rising availability of cheap, high quality heroin has pushed 
opium to the margins of the market. 
<P> 
Climatological conditions in Macedonia are favorable for the cultivation 
of Cannabis and the plant grows in many parts of the country. 
According to police sources the production of marihuana is increasing 
--generally grown for personal consumption or distribution among 
friends. The fieldwork provides the following picture of marihuana 
use: Marihuana is probably the most widely used illegal drug and 
the drug has a high level of acceptance among (westernized) youth. 
A matchbox full of the locally grown product sells for about 10 
&quot;Deutsch Mark&quot; (DM, the German mark is the financial 
standard). All the marihuana encountered during the fieldwork 
was from Macedonia and of poor quality. Both police sources and 
cannabis users contacted in the field contended that marihuana 
is usually sold through friendship networks; a sophisticated marihuana 
trafficking industry is absent. Not only is the available marihuana 
of limited quality, frequently it is hard to find. Several fieldwork 
respondents complained about its unstable availability and compared 
it to the relatively small effort it takes to buy heroin. As one 
of them explained: &quot;Often you cannot get grass, but 14 and 
15 year olds have easy access to heroin.&quot; 
<P> 
Heroin has become increasingly available since 1990. While reliable 
statistical data are absent, all the information available indicates 
that a considerable and growing number of people are involved 
in heroin use. All consulted parties consider heroin a major concern. 
In the following chapters we will discuss several aspects of heroin 
use in detail. 
<P> 
Cocaine has not been detected by the police since 1990. However, 
several fieldwork respondents have either used cocaine themselves 
or know people who have used it. But it is not easy to buy cocaine 
and it is expensive (150-250 DM per gram). Some of the heroin 
users interviewed have self-prepared cocaine base and smoked the 
drug --a technique they learned while working in Germany. Amphetamines 
do not seem to play a significant role in Macedonia's drug markets. 
Psychedelics, such as LSD and Ecstasy (MDMA) are only sporadically 
available. While treatment providers associate their consumption 
with &quot;the heaviest drug users,&quot; in fact, we found a 
considerable interest in these drugs among the young, westernized 
adolescents. Availability and use of these drugs may well rise 
as they are often associated with the rave culture, which has 
emerged in Skopje only very recently. According to one field respondent, 
who had used both LSD and Ecstasy while traveling abroad, &quot;you 
can only get these drugs when a friend brings them along when 
returning from a trip to Europe.&quot; He continued: &quot;That 
we cannot buy them here, is probably because they (the local dealers) 
haven't realized their value yet.&quot; Inhalation of solvents 
or glue does not seem to be an issue of importance in Macedonia. 
 
<P> 
Several psychoactive medications which in western Europe would 
require a prescription, can be purchased in many (private) Macedonian 
pharmacies without one. Some pharmacies sell Heptanon (methadone) 
without a prescription, which is illegal. But, according to some 
fieldwork respondents, a variety of analgesics, tranquilizers 
and sleeping tablets, such as Mogadon, Carson, Flormidal, Diazepam 
(Auparin), Prazine, Trodon, Lexilium and Phenobarbital can be 
bought fairly easily, several of these even in their injectable 
form. Many &quot;junkies&quot; reportedly experiment with a wide 
variety of pharmacy drugs to either substitute or boost heroin 
use. 
<H4><A NAME="chap4_2">4.2 Estimates of the Number of Drug Users 
</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Reliable data on the number of drug users in Macedonia are absent. 
Household or school surveys into the use of drugs have not been 
conducted. Likewise, data on drug-related emergency room admissions 
or drug-related deaths (e.g. reported by medical examiners) are 
not available. Therefore, estimating the extent of drug use is 
a precarious endeavor. The little information available comes 
from the two psychiatric hospitals that offer treatment for drug 
addiction, the State Penitentiary in Skopje, a register at the 
ministry of interior and a 1994 WHO country survey. 
<P> 
Until 1990, about 600 individuals applied for drug treatment to 
Bardovci hospital in Skopje. Yearly, 20 to 25 previously unknown 
people were admitted to the hospital. In the period 1989 - 1993 
Bardovci treated 181 drug addicts; 150 of them in the out-patient 
Center for Treatment and Prevention of Drug Abuse. In March 1995 
80 - 90 people were in treatment at the out-patient center and 
an additional 14 were treated in the hospital. In 40% of cases 
it concerned new patients. 95% of patients were between 15 and 
25 years old. Prof. Dr. Jordan Jovev, director of Bardovci estimates 
that there are currently 1400 &quot;heavy drug users&quot; in 
Skopje, 300 in Kumanovo and 300 in Ohrid. 90% of them are heroin 
users. 
<P> 
The Neuropsychiatric department of the Medical center in Ohrid 
admitted 40 patients for treatment of drug problems during the 
past two years (1993 &amp; 1994). Ages were between 19 and 21 
years. Only 5 of these patients had been treated before. Dr. Sotiroski, 
the psychiatrist in charge of drug treatment, reports that at 
the end of 1994 there were 200 &quot;registered drug addicts&quot; 
in Ohrid on a population of 75,000 people. 
<P> 
On any given day, the State Penitentiary in Skopje houses 20 to 
30 drug addicts between the ages of 18 and 38 years, but according 
to the prison doctor, Mihael Levenski, young people are in the 
majority and on the increase. 
<P> 
A national register of drug users was set up in 1971. Both treatment 
and law enforcement sources contribute to this register, which 
includes individuals who are or have been in treatment and offenders 
who are known drug consumers. By March 1995 about 850 individuals 
were included in this register. Whereas between 1972 and 1990 
the number of newly registered drug users varied from 25 to 30 
annually, after 1990 a strong increase was experienced: 50 new 
persons were registered in 1991 and 390 in 1994. Mr. Trpe Stojanovski, 
statistical analyst at the Narcotics Department of the State Ministry 
of Interior explains that the age of the new entries is decreasing 
and that the &quot;dark number&quot; (the total population of 
drug users) is much larger. 
<P> 
Finally, a 1994 WHO country survey mentions that &quot;the total 
number of drug users is above 6210.&quot; This number is extrapolated 
by multiplying the number of known cases (621) --based on the 
national register-- by ten. 
<P> 
In addition to these institutional &quot;guestimates,&quot; a 
number of heroin users (all males) were asked how many other heroin 
users they knew personally. A 26 years old Albanian chaser said 
he knows 40 other users personally. A 19 years old Macedonian 
injection drug user (IDU) knew &quot;about 50&quot; other users. 
A 32 year old Macedonian IDU knew &quot;more than 60&quot; other 
users. A 20 years old Albanian dealer knew &quot;at least 100&quot; 
others. His friend and colleague, a 21 years old Albanian said 
he knew 200 other users. He continued by telling in German that 
10 other junkies live in his street. On asking, he answers that 
in total about 100 people live in his street which is located 
in the old Albanian quarter of Skopje. A 28 years old Macedonian 
IDU said &quot;In my telephone book I have 40 junkies, so you 
understand how many I know.&quot; All these users agreed that 
heroin use has increased tremendously in the past five years --they 
all started using within this period-- and that the drug is popular 
among the youth. They all foresee a continuing increase in the 
number of users. 
<P> 
Except for the state register data, these figures are all estimates. 
In addition, these information sources all have their own specific 
limitations. Because of the considerable time between the moment 
people start using heroin and the first treatment contacts, treatment 
data generally reflect a situation of two to three years back 
in time. Treatment may furthermore not be very attractive to drug 
users, or only to certain categories of drug users. For example, 
it may not be attractive to Albanians (see table 2.). The state 
register has been built up from 1971. Since then, several people 
may have stopped using or died. The register also does not differentiate 
between a marihuana smoker and a heroin addict. Likewise, it is 
not very likely that prison records reflect the larger population 
of drug users. In particular new and younger users are not very 
likely to be incarcerated. Finally, the estimates of the heroin 
users are highly anecdotal. However, the cited sources provide 
us with a number of rather different perspectives on the same 
issue. <STRONG>Therefore, put together, these figures may not 
give us a reliable estimate of the number of drug users, but they 
do indicate that the use of drugs has been increasing substantially 
over the last few years and this trend is likely to continue.</STRONG>

Our interviews with treatment providers from Bardovci (both the 
in-patient facility at the psychiatric hospital and the out-patient 
center) in Skopje and from the Medical Center in Ohrid provided 
some information on the people for whom the use of drugs has become 
a problem. In both agencies patient data is hand recorded in patient 
files and not arranged in a systematic and accessible format. 
Therefore, a one page questionnaire was used to generate an estimated 
overview of patient characteristics. Table 2. presents these estimates.

This chapter provided a first look at drug use in Macedonia. While 
one can, and should, have certain reservations concerning the 
validity of each piece of information, when the pieces are put 
together a picture starts emerging of the drug problem in Macedonia. 
Since 1990, the amount of heroin seized by the police more than 
tripled. In the same period the number of drug users known to 
the authorities increased greatly and a growing number of people 
applied for help with a drug problem, the drug being heroin. The 
age of those applying for help is decreasing, a phenomenon also 
observed in the state register and among those incarcerated. It 
becomes clear that a substantial number of young people in Macedonia 
have gotten involved with heroin. In the next chapter we will 
take a closer look at heroin.

For many years the former Yugoslav republic has been an important 
transshipment country on the so-called &quot;Balkan Route,&quot; 
which brings heroin produced in south-west Asia to western Europe. 
The collapse of communism and the conflicts in the former Yugoslav 
republic have all contributed to the re-routing and proliferation 
of the Balkan route. An important branch now runs from Bulgaria 
through Macedonia to Albania, from where it is shipped by boat 
to south Italy. Another branch runs from Macedonia into Kosovo 
and Northwards. However, the early 1990s have shown a considerable 
spillover from these shipments into local distribution channels, 
resulting in the abundant availability of high quality heroin. 
 
<H4><A NAME="chap5_2">5.2 The Demand Side: Dancing on the Volcano</A>

<P> 
Several of our discussion partners emphasized the importance of 
the social determinants of the expansion in drug use in Macedonia. 
The collapse of the Yugoslav Republic has resulted in the breakdown 
of traditional societal structures. The current transition towards 
a democratic society has lead to the devaluation of traditional 
institutions and values, while developing new ones is a burdensome 
task, fraught with new, previously unanticipated problems. The 
introduction of a free economy has not been equally beneficial 
to all Macedonians and, in combination with a more general economic 
decline, the economic blockades and the return of migrant workers, 
it has resulted in a high unemployment rate (30%) and a lack of 
economic perspective for many young people. 
<P> 
Conversations with young people during the fieldwork confirm this 
view. Many young Macedonians feel betrayed by the older generation, 
who, in their opinion, have made a mess of the country. They see 
little economic opportunities, even those who have jobs or are 
still in school. At the same time they are very interested in, 
and oriented toward, western culture and experience the current 
socio-political situation as a barrier to reaching their goals. 
A recurrent theme in these conversations was the unstable political 
future of the country and the threat of ethnic conflict or war. 
In one group of friends of mixed ethnicity (Macedonians, Serbs 
and Turks) this was a particular concern. They sketched the horrors 
of the Bosnian conflict and asked rhetorically &quot;will I have 
to fight my friends when the politicians mess up?&quot; Some of 
the young people spoken with even wondered whether Macedonia would 
still exist as a separate entity in a few years. 
<P> 
The resulting mindset is a mixture of insecurity and indifference, 
expressing itself in a dismissal of the established societal structures 
and hedonistic experimentation. As the philosopher Wittgenstein 
once said of the medieval plagues, &quot;as the suicides increased, 
so did the waltzing.&quot; Use of drugs, and heroin especially, 
fits well in that mindset, as heroin provides the user with a 
chemical sense of security, well-being and belonging. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Thus, in the early 1990s we can witness a situation in 
Macedonia in which the presence of abundant supplies of high quality 
heroin coincides with a mindset among the youth conducive to the 
use of this drug.</STRONG> 
<H4><A NAME="chap5_3">5.3 Centers of Use </A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The use of heroin has first become visible in Skopje, Macedonia's 
capital. More recently it has become apparent in other, smaller 
cities, such as Ohrid and Kumanovo. Dr. Jovev of Bardovci hospital 
estimates about 300 users in both cities. According to one field 
respondent heroin use started in Kumanovo one to one and a half 
years ago and is on the increase. The Medical Center in Ohrid 
started experiencing a rise in treatment applications for drug 
problems about two years ago. Heroin use, and drug use in general 
is generally viewed as an urban phenomenon. However, according 
to Dr. Klekovski of the Macedonian Center for International Cooperation 
(MCIC) in Skopje this is an incomplete picture. MCIC is conducting 
developmental aid programs in several Albanian settlings in western 
Macedonia. They have found that many of the families in the villages 
in the areas of Debar, Gostivar and Tetovo are involved in trafficking 
and/or use of heroin. &quot;No single family is without use or 
smuggling.&quot; Within the time frame of the study visit it was 
not possible to research this account, but it seems certainly 
worthwhile to follow up on this lead. 
<H4><A NAME="chap5_4">5.4 Demographics of Heroin Users</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Heroin users come from various socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. 
The drug treatment centers seem to be primarily in contact with 
young male users from ethnic Macedonian families with relatively 
affluent social and economic positions. Information from police, 
prison and treatment centers suggests that, although ages range 
from 15 to 45 years, heroin users are becoming increasingly younger. 
Users in treatment often live with their parents. Relatively few 
women apply for drug treatment or get into problems with the police 
(see table 2.). 
<P> 
The fieldwork corroborated this picture to some extent. All fieldwork 
respondents were male. During the tours of Skopje's night life 
only a few female heroin users were pointed out. Although all 
respondents knew some, they believed female users were not common. 
Respondents thought that women are much less inclined to use heroin 
or drugs in general. However, young women do socialize with male 
users. As one respondent explained: &quot;When I was 17-18, it 
was very hip to have a junkie boyfriend.&quot; Most users were 
in their early twenties and these younger users were initiated 
into use of heroin when they were 15 to 17 years old. Many felt 
that heroin users are starting at increasingly younger ages: &quot;... 
14 to 15 year olds have easy access to heroin.&quot; On the other 
hand, some of the respondents knew a number of older users of 
Albanian ethnicity. In fact, they suggested that many of the Albanian 
families involved in consumption level dealing were using their 
merchandise themselves, from the 18 year old son, to the grandfather 
and grandmother: &quot;Where do you find whole families on heroin? 
... In Macedonia, in Ghazi Baba!&quot; 
<P> 
Another, related, point of interest is that there may exist different 
pathways into heroin use for Macedonian and Albanian users. Macedonians 
more often seem to start using during adolescence within a context 
of experimentation among friends and, perhaps, rebellion against 
parental and social order. In contrast, Albanians may have been 
involved in heroin selling prior to initiating its use. Heroin 
use may than be initiated as a response to the stress of dealing 
or simply because many friends and relatives are also using the 
drug. One Albanian business man in his thirties (not a drug dealer) 
explained his heroin use in terms of &quot;just getting through 
the day,&quot; increasing work performance and lowering general 
stress. 
<P> 
<TABLE border=5> 
<TR><TD><EM>Intermezzo: Risto</EM> 
<P> 
Risto is a 19 years old Macedonian from relatively affluent family. His father owns part of a factory. Risto 
is still in school and wants to study abroad after his graduation. His father is willing to pay for his studies 
abroad, as he currently doing for Risto's car, clothes and spending money. Risto started to use heroin when 
he was 16 and has been using for three and a half years now. He started to smoke the drug in cigarettes, 
sniffed it and chased for a long time. More recently he initiated injecting. When he started using, Risto was 
hanging out with his friends who were dealing. In the beginning he did not pay or only little money for the 
heroin. His friends shared their drugs generously. For Risto heroin use is very much a social experience. 
With a group of friends he would pool money and than he would buy the drugs, because of his good 
connections. When the drugs were bought, they would go to the apartment of one of the group members to 
use and relax, or sometimes, when an 
apartment was not available, they would use in an elevator or in a car. Currently Risto is clean. He stopped 
using about 4 months ago. He went into Bardovci, but walked out after ten days, because his treatment 
consisted of little more than a bed and drugs were all around in the hospital. Since he left the hospital he 
has used once. However, as he is taking Naltrexone, an opium antagonist, he did not feel any effect of the 
heroin.

<H4><A NAME="chap5_5">5.5 Where Drugs are Sold and Used</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Several of our discussion partners were under the impression that 
heroin and marihuana are sold and (sometimes openly) used in certain 
bars and clubs. This assumption has been investigated during the 
fieldwork. 
<P> 
When drugs are sold in bars and clubs, transactions generally 
do not find place in the center of the venue, but in the more 
remote, less well lighted and transient areas, such as hallways 
and restrooms. The restrooms are also the place where illegal 
(powder) drugs are ingested. Often this leads to small groups 
hanging out in and around the restroom area. 
<P> 
In all the bars and clubs that were patronized, a visit was paid 
to the restroom and other remote areas where drug activity might 
be expected. Garbage in trashcans and on the floor was inspected. 
No indications of drug use or drug dealing were found. At the 
Techno Rave I visited, I made several rounds through the venue 
in search of drug activity. Again, nothing indicated the presence 
of drug dealing. The restroom area was not a hang-out. After the 
party ended I searched the floor, but did not find any drug related 
rubble. 
<P> 
I discussed the issue of drug use and dealing in bars and clubs 
with several field respondents and they provided a rather unanimous 
view with regards to both drug use and drug dealing: Drugs are 
not used in the bars and clubs, an important reason being fear 
of undercover police or police informers. If people use drugs 
when they go out, they do so just before entering the club, for 
example, they may smoke a &quot;joint&quot; (a marihuana cigarette) 
in the car in the parking lot. Likewise, drugs are generally not 
sold in the bars and clubs they and their peers frequent. Marihuana 
selling is rather loosely organized within friendship networks. 
When available, drugs such as Ecstasy or LSD also find their way 
from one friend to another. 
<P> 
Mr. Stojanovski of the Narcotics Department of the Ministry of 
Interior contended that all ethnic groups are involved in drug 
trafficking, although Albanians are overrepresented in comparison 
with their proportion in the population. From the accounts of 
the fieldwork respondents it becomes clear that consumption level 
heroin dealing is almost exclusively in the hands of Albanians. 
Sometimes Macedonian users work for Albanian dealers or buy in 
bulk (on consignment) and distribute the drug among their using 
friends. Apparently only few Macedonians are trusted enough to 
be able to do so. Two of the Albanian respondents (ages 20 and 
21 years) were dealing. 
<P> 
In Skopje, heroin sales are to a large degree localized in one 
Albanian neighborhood, Ghazi Baba. Many of the people living in 
Ghazi Baba are apparently involved in the heroin trade. The early 
evening (between 5 and 10 p.m.) is the busiest period. Most transactions 
are conducted in the street: the buyer requests a certain quantity 
(minimum 0.25 or 0.5 gram) and hands the money to a runner, who 
subsequently goes into one of the houses and returns with the 
drug. Only well known and trusted (Albanian) customers are allowed 
inside. Heroin can also be purchased in many of the Albanian teahouses, 
but often these only sell to Albanian users. The average price 
of a gram of heroin is DM 70.-, but when buying in bulk or when 
having &quot;good contacts&quot; the price may go down. Sometimes 
users drive across the Bulgarian border to buy heroin in some 
quantity for DM 25 - 30 per gram. 
<H4><A NAME="chap5_6">5.6 Mode of Administration</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
For many people, heroin is automatically associated with injecting 
drug use. Injecting paraphernalia --needles and syringes, spoons 
and tourniquets-- have become strong symbols for this psychoactive 
drug. In fact, globally speaking, this association is only valid 
for a minority of heroin users. Heroin, and most other opiates, 
can be taken into the body in other, although less efficient, 
ways. Simple oral ingestion (mixed with food or drink or not), 
snorting and smoking all produce similar states of intoxication. 
Injecting is only one of several routes of heroin self-administration, 
yet the most direct and efficient. Globally, heroin injectors 
are outnumbered by those who ingest this drug by method of smoking 
or, more correctly, vapor inhalation. 
<P> 
The most common form of heroin smoking is called &quot;chasing 
the dragon,&quot; or abbreviated, &quot;chasing.&quot; Sometimes, 
for example in the Netherlands, it is called &quot;chinesing,&quot; 
revealing its Eastern origins. When chasing, the user puts some 
heroin powder on an oblong piece of aluminum foil and heats the 
powder drug from underneath. The drug melts and vaporizes and 
the vapors are inhaled through a tube held between the lips. 
<P> 
Heroin users in Macedonia administer the drug in various ways. 
They may inject the drug --under the skin (subcutaneously), in 
a muscle (intramuscularly), or in the vein (intravenously). The 
latter seems to be the norm among Macedonian IDUs, while the former 
two may signify a transition stage from non-parenteral administration 
modes towards injecting. Another mode is to chase the drug from 
aluminum foil, known locally as &quot;pu&#154;enje na foliji,&quot; 
or by the English term &quot;chinesing.&quot; The use of the latter 
term is rather peculiar, as it originates in the Netherlands. 
Heroin is also smoked in specially prepared cigarettes. In addition, 
some people use the drug intranasally (snorting), which is somewhat 
odd, as the heroin available in Macedonia is the brown heroin 
base and not well suited to nasal inhalation. This type of heroin 
is designed for smoking. It has a low melting point, but does 
not dissolve easily in water (or in the mucous membranes of the 
nose). For this reason, IDUs add an acidifier (e.g. lemon juice 
or ascorbic powder) to the heroin, when preparing a shot. 
<P> 
Among the users in treatment 50% usually inject their heroin and 
the other half utilize various non-injection administration modes. 
However, discussions with fieldwork respondents suggest that among 
out-of-treatment users the prevalence of injecting may well be 
much lower. Whether this is really the case should be the object 
of systematic research, but several observations support this 
hypothesis: On average, the heroin sold in Skopje is of rather 
high quality, reducing the economic pressure towards injecting. 
Only very few Albanians inject, they reportedly mainly smoke the 
heroin in cigarettes or chase the drug (see Intermezzo: Ali &amp; 
Muhammed). Ethnic Macedonians may be more inclined to inject. 
 
<P> 
<TABLE border=5> 
<TR><TD>Intermezzo: Ali and Mohammed 
<P> 
&quot;He used to own a Mercedes, a BMW and an Audi,&quot; says Ali, pointing at Mohammed, 
&quot;but he lost it all, smoked them up, one by one.&quot; With a mixture of embarrassment and 
laughter, Mohammed nods acknowledging. Risto is driving up Vodno mountain. Macedonia's president 
and several ministers are living here, apparently. Risto just picked me up at the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; 
and introduced me to his two Albanian friends. Ali, 20 years, and Mohammed, 21 years, have been using 
heroin for about five years now. They started using heroin and cocaine in Germany, where they were 
working for a relative, selling the two drugs to German &quot;Fixer&quot;. They worked in several 
German cities, staying with relatives who were all part of the same Albanian heroin trafficking network. 
When the ground became to hot under their feet, they moved back to Macedonia, where they continued 
dealing. &quot;Before we went working in Germany, only few people were into using heroin, but when we 
returned it seemed as if everybody in Skopje was starting to use. ... That was in 1992.&quot; They speak 
fondly of that period: &quot;We used to sell a lot of heroin, make a lot of money...&quot; They spent it 
just as fast, on clothes, cars and heroin. Lots of heroin. &quot;We used to smoke at least 5 grams a day and 
also gave a lot away.&quot; Ali explains that they got the heroin on consignment from his father, who lives 
just across the Bulgarian border, where he owns a brothel and wholesales heroin. At somepoint they found 
themselves spending more money on heroin, than they were making by selling it. Things were getting out 
of hand and little of their wealth remained. They are still dealing. Ali uses about 1.5 grams per day, 
Mohammed is enrolled in a methadone program. Risto parks the car at a &quot;scenic overlook&quot; as 
far from the road as possible. &quot;If the police shows up, then I'm just showing you the view of 
Skopje.&quot; The view is, indeed, very beautiful as the city is slowly sinking into t 
he twilight. The Vardar is as a silver twine running through the landscape. As soon as Risto turned the 
engine off, Ali takes a little paper package from his pocket. He opens it and shows me the contents --about 
half a gram of brown south-west Asian heroin. With a piece of paper, he scoops a considerable amount of 
the powder on the back of his cigarette box and shapes it into one line. Through a rolled up bill he snorts it 
into one of his nostrils. In the meantime, Mohammed took out a cigarette and is heating the tobacco, gently 
moving the flame up and down the cigarette. & 
quot;The tobacco comes out easier, when you dry it a little,&quot; he explains in German. He pulls some 
of the tobacco out of the cigarette and massages what is left, so that is evenly divided. He gets the heroin 
package from Ali and, by scooping and tapping, fills the cigarette with heroin. Then he twists the tip close 
and, after some additional massaging and tapping, he lights the cigarette and starts smoking. After Ali 
snorted the line, he takes a piece of aluminum foil, which was sitting behind the cellophane of the cigarette 
box, and unfolds it. Carefully, he tears of a strip of about 2 inches wide (+/- 5 cm.) and, after rubbing out 
all the crinkles with his thumb, he rolls it around a cigarette into a tube. Subsequently he tears of another 
oblong piece, rubs out the wrinkles and heats it &quot;... to burn of the coating, you don't want to inhale 
that stuff.&quot; He performs all these tasks with great care and concentration, signifying their (ritual) 
merit. He scoops a littl 
e heap of heroin onto the foil, puts the pipe between his lips and starts chasing. Heated from beneath, the 
powder turns into a drop and starts to run slowly along the foil, closely followed (chased) by the pipe, 
through which the vapors disappear into Ali's lungs. They are uncertain which mode is practiced most, 
chasing or smoking in cigarettes. &quot;We do it both. I guess it depends on where you are or who you are 
with. Sometimes I snort it,&quot; explains Ali. When I ask him whether he has ever injected, Ali almost 
gets upset. He vehemently shakes his head and very resolutely says he never did and never will inject: 
&quot;That's very bad, it's dirty. You will never see an Albanian injecting.&quot; He rapidly translates my 
question to Mohammed, who underscores his partner's assertion: &quot;Nein, nein, nicht gut. Man soll das 
nimmer machen.&quot; 
</TD></TR> 
 
</TABLE> 
 
<P> 
Recent research suggests that whether heroin users inject or not 
is determined by a combination of economic and cultural factors 
(Grund &amp; Blanken 1993). The economic factor embodies variables 
such as the availability, price and quality of the drug. If heroin 
is very expensive and, in particular, of low purity, users are 
driven towards injecting. When the drug is relatively cheap and 
of reasonable quality, users feel no pressure to initiate injecting. 
Over a longer period, stabile resources of constant and adequate 
potency allow, for example, for the formation of a chasing culture 
--which happened during the 1970s and 1980s in the Netherlands. 
Such a culture is built around the development of knowledge (folklore), 
(ritualized) skills, rationalizations, rules and sanctions (taboos) 
that all support the maintenance of the &quot;chasing ritual&quot; 
(Grund &amp; Blanken 1993; Grund 1993; Zinberg 1984). 
<P> 
Being initiated into heroin use in such a situation generally 
equals initiation into chasing, while the likelihood of initiation 
into injecting is rather small. When economic pressure is low 
or absent, transitions towards injecting later on are less likely. 
First of all, people tend to stick with the administration mode 
of initiation (Grund et al. 1992a). Likewise, there are simply 
less IDU role models around and injecting knowledge and skills 
are less available. Additionally, becoming known as an injector 
among chasing friends may lead to stigmatization and ostracization. 
 
<P> 
A totally opposite situation developed in the United States where 
a highly marginalized injecting subculture evolved around the 
use of heroin of extremely poor quality (Des Jarlais et al. 1991; 
O'Donnell &amp; Jones 1968). 
<P> 
Within the Macedonian context we can observe evidence of both 
developments and they seem to be distributed unevenly along ethnic 
lines. While the current heroin availability (in terms of price 
and purity) in general is favorable to the development of a heroin 
smoking culture (both chasing and smoking in cigarettes), among 
Albanian users the phenomenon seems stronger and further developed. 
Because of their involvement in heroin trafficking, they will 
experience very few availability problems. The claim of some respondents 
that &quot;they are sitting on kilo's,&quot; and their smoking 
the drug in cigarettes (which is a very wasteful way of using 
the drug) both attest to this assumption. Likewise, smoking heroin 
cigarettes seems to constitute a fairly integrated practice, crossing 
generational boundaries. Finally, injecting is perceived as an 
appalling activity, a taboo. Ethnic Macedonian users, in contrast, 
are more likely to be just customers, having to raise money with 
other, more harmful and stigmatizing, and less consistent and 
profitable activities. What's more, among ethnic Macedonians, 
heroin use seems much more an activity of adolescent youth, strongly 
disapproved of by the older generation. In that context, injecting 
may serve as the ultimate symbolic protest, expressing the total 
rejection of parental values and control. 
<H4><A NAME="chap5_7">5.7 Injecting Drug Use and Risks for HIV 
Transmission </A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The prevalence of HIV in Macedonia is currently probably still 
very low. Of 22 HIV cases 3 consisted of IDUs, who were presumably 
infected abroad. Both in Skopje and Ohrid all drug users admitted 
to treatment are tested for HIV antibodies and all persons tested 
have been negative. However, nothing is known about sero-prevalence 
among out-of-treatment populations or about nature and prevalence 
of risk behaviors of Macedonian IDUs. 
<P> 
An important objective of the visit was to gather information 
about the context of drug injecting and its potential HIV risks. 
Based on discussions with IDUs --both in and out of treatment-- 
the following picture emerges: Drug users' knowledge about HIV/AIDS 
and ways to prevent transmission is very limited. While many users 
have heard of AIDS, it is an empty concept for them and they do 
not pay much attention to it. The users in the ambulatory methadone 
program in Skopje were aware of the (zero) HIV antibody prevalence 
in the clinic's sample, but their interpretation of this statistic 
seemed to be that they were not at risk, and therefore did not 
need to worry about it: &quot;There is no AIDS in Macedonia, that 
is not a problem for us here.&quot; 
<P> 
Indeed, the fact that the virus has not yet been substantially 
introduced into the networks of IDUs is probably the only reason 
for the low prevalence. While there are very few barriers to obtaining 
sterile syringes --IDU respondents acknowledge their unrestricted 
availability in the pharmacies-- IDUs may well be sharing needles 
and syringes on a regular basis. As one respondent explained: 
&quot;Sometimes you have just enough money to buy the heroin, 
but nothing left for a syringe, and some junkies don't want to 
spend the money for a new syringe, so they never even bother.&quot; 
The limitation of daytime opening hours in pharmacies was mentioned 
as a reason for sharing needles during the night. Another frequent 
reason for sharing is apparently when an IDU would unexpectedly 
meet a friend: &quot;I would run into another guy and then we 
would use together. If one of us would not have a syringe, we 
would use each other's syringe without much thought.&quot; 
<P> 
A related matter of great concern is that the police is apparently 
testing confiscated needles for drug residue to make cases against 
drug users or to secure their cooperation in cases against other 
defendants. Many studies have shown that this discourages IDUs 
from carrying their own drug injecting equipment, inducing episodes 
of 'needle sharing' and (potential) transmission of HIV and other 
bloodborne pathogens. This matter was brought to our attention 
by some fieldwork respondents and, upon questioning, acknowledged 
by Mr. Stojanovski of the Narcotics Department of the Ministry 
of Interior. 
<P> 
In particular American research has documented that IDUs apply 
several strategies to prevent police detection (Zule 1992). While 
lowering the risks of police detection and arrest, these strategies 
may increase the risks for HIV infection (Connors 1992). One such 
strategy is the use of shooting galleries, places where IDUs go 
primarily to inject drugs. Use of shooting galleries has been 
positively associated with the chance of being infected with HIV 
(Schoenbaum et al. 1989). During the fieldwork I was brought to 
a house where reportedly many people go to inject and which fits 
the definition of a shooting gallery (see Intermezzo: A Shooting 
Gallery in Skopje).

This evening Abdul takes me to a house in the old Albanian part of town, across the stone pedestrian 
bridge over the Vardar. We walk through a maze of little streets and enter a fenced backyard through a 
gate. When Abdul knocks on the door, a voice asks who there is. After Abdul identifies himself and me, 
the door is opened by Ahmed, a +/- 28 years old Albanian man. A 2ml. syringe is dangling in his right fist, 
half filled with a mixture of drug solution and blood. I shake his left hand, which is covered with abscesses 
and sores. We enter a room, which is sparsely furnished, a double bed, a table and a few chairs, a TV and a 
few paintings on the walls. After we came in, Ahmed withdrew in the adjacent room and finished his shot. 
Another, +/- 40 years old Albanian man is watching television and after a few minutes he starts to nod a 
little. Perhaps he snorted some heroin just before we entered. Before we entered, Abdul told me that this 
house is frequented by many IDUs. While not as many as in Ghazi Baba, ther 
e are a considerable number of dealers in this neighborhood. People who buy heroin and cannot or do not 
want to wait to get back home come here to inject their drugs. Others do not have a place where they can 
quietly get high, e.g. because they live with their parents or spouse, who are ignorant of their use. Again 
others run out during lunch break from work, buy drugs and get high quickly at this place. In return for this 
service Ahmed 
 gets a &quot;taste&quot; (a small portion) of their heroin. Other users come here and ask Ahmed to buy 
heroin for them. They wait in the house while Ahmed goes out to buy and use when he returns. They also 
pay Ahmed with a taste. The place has many characteristics of an informal shooting gallery. It was unclear 
whether Ahmed also provides injecting equipment to visitors, but given the reasons why some people visit 
the place, this may well be the case. This and similar places may become important vectors in the spread of 
HIV. It could, however, also serve as an important locale of education and prevention, as is the case in 
several cities in the Netherlands, where outreach workers provide such locales with sterile syringes and 
HIV information (Grund et al. 1992b).

</TABLE> 
 
<P> 
While the dangers of sharing needles and syringes are well recognized, 
another class of drug injecting related HIV risk behavior has 
gotten much less attention. In Macedonia this behavior may also 
play a significant role. Much of the pleasure and attraction of 
using psychoactive substances --whether these are legal or illegal-- 
is in sharing the resulting experience. For that reason, psychoactive 
substances are often used and shared in a social setting. Think, 
for example of offering coffee to guests at the beginning of a 
social visit, having a cigarette with a classmate during the morning 
break, sharing drinks during the happy hour in the favorite haunt, 
passing a marihuana joint at a rock concert, or taking heroin 
with one or more friends in an elevator stopped between two flights 
--the behavior and symbolic meaning are the same, the drugs are 
different. 
<P> 
When IDUs share drugs, they often share the liquefied drug and 
use syringes to measure out doses. This behavior is termed Syringe-Mediated 
Drug Sharing (SMDS). SMDS has been observed around the world and 
includes various techniques, dependent on the type of syringe 
(e.g. one-part vs. two-part syringes) (Grund et al 1991; Jose 
et al. 1993; Grund et al. 1995). The basic procedure goes as follows: 
a certain amount of heroin is prepared as usually (cooked in a 
spoon or bottle cap) and drawn into one (donor) syringe. From 
a second (receptive) syringe the needle is removed and the plunger 
is drawn back. The needle of the donor syringe is then inserted 
through the hub at the front of the receptor syringe, and a part 
of the solution squirted in. This procedure, termed &quot;Frontloading,&quot; 
and other drug sharing techniques puts IDUs at risk for infection 
with HIV and other bloodborne pathogens. 
<P> 
Frontloading may well be widely practiced among Macedonian IDUs. 
All the fieldwork respondents with injecting experience were aware 
of the technique and within their networks it is a very frequent 
occurrence. During the discussion with methadone patients at the 
Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse in Skopje, 
a wave of recognition went through the room when a photograph 
of frontloading was shown. This was followed by a lively discussion 
among members of the group. 
<P> 
Finally, it is not clear what role (female) heroin users play 
in prostitution. There does not seem to be an open street prostitution 
area (a stroll) in Skopje or Ohrid. Evidence of the involvement 
of drug users in prostitution has not been found. 
<P> 
While it would be premature to draw definitive conclusions about 
this issue, the level of drug use related HIV risk behaviors seems 
to be unacceptably high. This preliminary assessment is corroborated 
by a study into the prevalence of hepatitis C at the Center for 
the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse in Skopje. While the 
sample consisted of only twenty subjects, a 100% prevalence was 
found.

<P> 
The only profession seriously involved in treating drug problems 
is psychiatry. In Skopje drug treatment is provided by the hospital 
for Nervous and Mental Diseases &quot;Bardovci.&quot; In 1990 
Bardovci created drug detoxification facilities in the hospital 
and a drug treatment project, &quot;the Center for the Prevention 
and Treatment of Drug Abuse,&quot; at another location in Skopje. 
At this moment +/- 80 people receive treatment in this out-patient 
facility. Another 14 patients are treated on the forensic ward 
of Bardovci. In Ohrid, the Department of Neuropsychiatry of the 
Medical Center Ohrid is providing drug treatment. Two years ago 
the number of people applying for help increased significantly 
and since then +/- 40 people have been treated. 
<P> 
Treatment in the psychiatric hospitals consists of detoxification, 
which may be accompanied by medication and/or vitamin therapy. 
Drug users share accommodations with patients with a wide variety 
of other psychiatric complaints. Treatment plans, when present, 
seem often improvised and not based on established criteria. 
<P> 
The Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse offers 
somewhat more comprehensive treatment, ranging from 'cold turkey' 
detoxification to long term methadone maintenance. Currently there 
are two patient groups: An older group of &quot;hard core addicts,&quot; 
who have a long history of opiate use. These patients receive 
weekly prescriptions of methadone on a maintenance basis. The 
other group consists of younger users with shorter drug use histories. 
These come daily or several times per week, often with their parents. 
Methadone is prescribed on a reduction basis in combination with 
psychotherapy and family counseling. 
<P> 
Methadone is mainly dispensed in liquid (oral) form. The use of 
methadone in the treatment of heroin dependent persons used to 
be an anathema, but with the advent of the AIDS epidemic this 
situation changed. Prof. Jovev, the medical director of Bardovci, 
explained that many addicts traveled frequently and concerns over 
the introduction of HIV into the Macedonian population via injection 
drug users (IDUs) infected abroad has led to a pragmatic adaptation 
of this policy. 
<P> 
When alcohol and drug addicts are sentenced to serve prison time, 
their sentence may get extended to include the, so called, &quot;Protective 
Measure,&quot; which is a form of compulsory treatment. Under 
this provision some treatment is available in Skopje's prison, 
which may include methadone. However, Dr. Levenski, the prison 
doctor, is not very positive about the results. 
<P> 
Sentenced drug addicts may also end up in a closed ward of Bardovci 
hospital (currently +/- 10). However, security is insufficient 
and apparently many addicts escape. Prison authorities, Bardovci 
and the ministry of justice are currently discussing the establishment 
of a treatment prison for addicts who have received prison sentences. 
 
<P> 
Treatment of heroin addiction and other drug problems in Macedonia 
is still in its infancy. The visits to the treatment facilities 
and the discussions with staff, patients and fieldwork respondents 
with treatment experience indicated some serious problems. 
<UL> 
<LI>There is currently no comprehensive system of care, treatment 
and social rehabilitation. What is presently available are detoxification 
and some methadone maintenance slots. There are no follow-up social 
reintegration programs, nor are there care and support services 
available for users who are unable or unwilling to stop using 
drugs. HIV prevention programs for (injecting) drug users are 
absent. 
<LI>Treatment philosophies are unclear or under-developed and 
tend to put too much emphasis on psychopathology. Social and health 
perspectives do not play a substantial role. This is reflected 
in the staffing of current programs: psychiatrist outnumber social 
workers and health care workers. This is in great contrast with 
western Europe and the US, where an average drug treatment program 
has maximally one half-time psychiatrist on staff. A related problem 
is that the level of knowledge and skills of staff regarding drug 
use and addiction is rather limited, while up-to-date information 
on the topic is unavailable. There is no access to the professional 
literature. Bardovci, which is a teaching hospital, has not received 
a foreign publication in 6-7 years. In such a situation one has 
to reinvent the wheel, time after time, copying the mistakes made 
elsewhere, without the possibility of learning from these examples. 
<LI>While the level of heroin use among Albanians is reportedly 
very high, few partake in treatment. There may be several reasons 
for this: Current treatment services may not be equipped to work 
with Albanians (e.g. absence of Albanian staff). Albanian users 
may distrust drug treatment services and suspect ties with law 
enforcement. An important reason may well be that, because they 
have a steady supply of heroin, they have less of a need for treatment. 
<LI>The five fieldwork respondents with a treatment history were 
rather negative about their experiences. In-patient treatment 
in Bardovci, they feel, consists of little more than a bed. Some 
did not receive medication at all. The temptation to use drugs 
was high in the hospital, as drugs were easy to get. &quot;It 
was easier than outside, the dealer would come to my window.&quot; 
Three ex-users thought that current methadone treatment only sustained 
their addiction, as there was no help with their other problems. 
One respondent, who was on methadone at the time of the interview, 
had experienced a methadone shortage: &quot;Three days without 
methadone, then you are forced to use heroin.&quot; 
<LI>The unstable methadone availability is a result of the conflicts 
in the region and the economic blockades. While Macedonia has 
a legal opiate industry (Alkaloid in Skopje), it does not manufacture 
methadone. The drug is imported. 
<LI>The Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse 
is currently located in a poorly maintained building on the outskirts 
of Skopje. The latter, without doubt, creates a large threshold 
to treatment for people without access to a car. 
<LI>A problem more generally experienced are the limited financial 
resources available for treatment services. According to the staff, 
both in Skopje and Ohrid, many activities and improvements are 
simply impossible because of financial limitations. 
<LI>The primary health care system is not structurally involved 
in the care and treatment of problem drug users. This may partly 
be due to the practice that methadone can only prescribed to addicts 
by the psychiatric hospitals. General practitioners (GPs) can 
prescribe opiates, but not in the context of addiction treatment. 
This rule is enforced by the Macedonian Medical Association (of 
which Prof. Jovev is the president), which has the authority to 
withdraw medical licenses.

Very few drug prevention activities have been developed. OSI-M 
funded a drug prevention poster campaign some years ago and in 
the neighborhood of the Grand Hotel we spotted some drug posters 
in a public display. Drugs are a regular and heavily debated topic 
in the media, but, according to our sources, these discussions 
are rather emotional and rarely based on factual information. 
The local alternative radio station &quot;Channel 103&quot; has 
profiled itself as an advocate of drug policy reform. The station 
has broadcasted public service announcements both advocating the 
decriminalization of cannabis and educating their audience on 
the dangers of heroin. The editor of the station explained that 
they have a close tie with their, largely adolescent, audience 
and see the problems brought about by heroin use at close range. 
The station is willing to cooperate in developing future drug 
education programs.

<P> 
HIV prevention is currently not part of the treatment plan in 
the treatment centers in Skopje and Ohrid. In terms of knowledge 
and counseling skills, treatment staff does not seem equipped 
to provide efficient HIV/AIDS education or counseling. 
<P> 
Although the former Yugoslav Federal Law, Article 246 (concerned 
with issues of &quot;enabling the use of drugs&quot;) criminalizes 
the sale of syringes to drug users, needles and syringes can be 
purchased freely in public and private pharmacies. This was acknowledged 
by several respondents and during the visit three pharmacies were 
visited, where syringes could be purchased without a problem. 
Dr. Sotirovski, the president of the National AIDS Committee, 
asserted that IDUs &quot;can get free syringes in the hospitals 
and health clinics.&quot; However, other discussion partners took 
this statement with a grain of salt. Dr. Sotirovski, also said 
that, because of the &quot;high promiscuity among addicts,&quot; 
the government had been distributing condoms free of charge among 
addicts. However, there was no information available on e.g. the 
number of distributed condoms. 
<P> 
HIV prevention campaigns have been directed at the general population 
and have emphasized sexual transmission. As far as we could see, 
no focused education campaigns have been directed at (injecting) 
drug users --or at the gay population, for that matter. These 
campaigns have been organized by a non governmental organization 
(NGO), the Macedonian Anti AIDS Association. 
<P> 
Several people emphasized that most Macedonian doctors are not 
ready to work on AIDS and drugs issues. There is apparently much 
resistance to acknowledging the necessity of AIDS awareness and 
prevention campaigns. The National Institute of Public Health 
is said to be very conservative and not capable of organizing 
prevention campaigns. It was suggested to organize prevention 
efforts within an NGO framework.

<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
Over the past few years, the police has become increasingly involved 
in drug enforcement. The number of discovered offenses (art. 245) 
has increased more than 4.5 times between 1990 and 1994, and the 
number of persons prosecuted for drug-law offenses, rose to 153 
in 1994, some three times more than in 1990. In the period of 
1991 - 1994 both the quantities of drugs seized and number of 
seizures have increased significantly. The early 1990s witnessed 
a considerable rise in the amount of confiscated heroin. While 
cocaine was reportedly the new drug on the block, there was only 
one particularly large seizure of cocaine in 1990. The police 
also reported increased seizures of marihuana, mostly from domestic 
sources. (see table 1.) During the last two years more drug seizures 
were made at local level. 
<P> 
We have little information on enforcement priorities (we were 
promised several statistics and documents, but never received 
them), but some of our discussion partners and several fieldwork 
respondents commented on the role of the police, while others 
spoke of their personal experiences with the police. 
<P> 
Several people said that the police chase after heroin users and 
small dealers, while leaving the big traffickers in peace. The 
users and ex-users complained about being beaten up by the police 
in efforts to get the names of dealers. Others felt that the police 
put too much pressure on marihuana users and petty transactions 
in the drug, instead of focusing on heroin. They relate the increase 
of heroin use among teenagers to this matter: &quot;If the police 
would lock off Ghazi Baba and search the houses, they would find 
hundreds of kilo's of heroin, but they bother small-time grass 
dealers instead.&quot; Two respondents, independently, brought 
up that the police differentiates between heroin sales to Macedonians 
and Albanians: &quot;I don't know whether it is true or just a 
rumor, but I heard that the police is telling dealers that as 
long as they sell to their own people (Albanians), they will leave 
them alone, but if they sell to Macedonians they would get a bullet.&quot; 
 
<P> 
Another worry, expressed by several people, was that an arrest 
for the mere possession of one marihuana joint leads to the opening 
of a police record, which might give them problems later in life, 
e.g. in applying for a job. 
<P> 
An important observation is that the level of violence in Skopje's 
drug scene seems to be very low. None of our discussion partners 
or the fieldwork respondents mentioned violence to be an issue.

There is presently no comprehensive drug policy in place in Macedonia. 
The republic is a signatory of the 1961 International Convention 
on Narcotic Drugs as amended by the 1972 Protocol and of the 1971 
Convention on Psychotropic Drugs. The drug laws currently on the 
book are those of the former federal Yugoslav republic. Drug consumption 
itself is not penalized, but drug possession, drug production 
and trafficking are penalized with punishment ranging from fines 
to imprisonment (Article 245 of the PA SFRY). &quot;Enabling the 
use of drugs&quot; is also penalized (Article 246 of the PA SFRY). 
The latter can include offering a place to somebody to use drugs 
and providing sterile syringes, although the latter is not enforced. 
There does not seem to be much coordination between public health 
policy and law enforcement policy. 
<P> 
Given the political situation in Macedonia it is unrealistic to 
expect significant short term changes. However, in the beginning 
of 1995 a commission was set up to prepare a revision of Macedonia's 
drug laws. This commission is considering whether to criminalize 
use of drugs (which is currently not an offense), whether and 
how to improve the &quot;protective measure&quot; and the situation 
of drug addicts in prison; can the prison system be used to provide 
adequate drug treatment. On the other hand, possibilities of decriminalization 
or legalization of marihuana are also discussed in this commission.

and Prognosis</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
In the first half of the 1990s a large number of, primarily young, 
people in Macedonia have gotten involved with heroin. Reliable 
estimates of the number of users are absent, because scientific 
studies into the prevalence and nature of use have not been undertaken. 
Current estimates of the total number of heroin users in the country 
vary between 2000 and 6210. At the end of 1994, the State Register 
of drug users included +/- 850 individuals. These people have 
either applied for treatment of problematic drug use (which in 
9 out of 10 cases concerns heroin) or have gotten into trouble 
with the law (who reportedly are primarily heroin addicts, but 
may include marihuana users). Before 1990 some 20 to 30 new names 
were registered each year. In 1991 this number was 50, while 390 
new entries were added to the register in 1994. 
<P> 
These known cases can be perceived as &quot;the tip of the iceberg.&quot; 
The actual number of users, the &quot;dark number,&quot; can only 
be estimated. In order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the 
actual number of users, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 
multiplying the number of known cases with a factor of 6 to 10. 
Applying this formula to the State Register would result in an 
estimated number of heroin users between 5100 and 8500. Considering 
that not all registered individuals are heroin users and that 
some may have stopped using or died over the years, <STRONG>a 
fairly conservative estimate of the total number of heroin users 
would be between 5000 and 6000.</STRONG> 
<P> 
We can conceptualize the use of heroin in Macedonia in terms of 
an epidemic. Drug epidemics have &quot;a beginning, a middle and 
end&quot; and go through some specific developmental cycles (Hamid 
1992). At this moment in time, the heroin epidemic in Macedonia 
seems to have entered a period of widespread diffusion and, unless 
the availability of heroin can be reduced to (near) zero, it is 
expected that the number of heroin users will grow considerably 
in the coming years. Given the Macedonian socio-political context 
it is unrealistic to expect that (law enforcement) efforts to 
decrease heroin availability will have significant results. Following 
the epidemic model, we can expect heroin use in Macedonia to reach 
its peak in about 5 to 7 years, at a number of users three to 
four times as high as the current number. <STRONG>Thus, around 
the year 2000 there may be 15,000 to 20,000 heroin users in Macedonia.</STRONG> 
 
<P> 
We expect that the use of other drugs will also increase. In addition 
to marihuana, psychedelics, such as LSD and MDMA (Ecstasy), will 
become more available and popular in the coming years among recreational 
drug users and in certain segments of nightlife. Cocaine use may 
also grow, both among recreational users --who will primarily 
be snorting the drug-- and among the current heroin users --who 
can be expected to use this drug as they use heroin, i.e. by smoking 
and injecting. In particular the latter is a matter of concern 
as this will lead to a multiplication of current drug problems. 
The over-the-counter availability of several strong psychoactive 
drugs will also be responsible for a further growth of drug use. 
Use and abuse of these pharmacy drugs is and will not be limited 
to &quot;typical&quot; drug users. One of the respondents explained 
that both of his parents were using 50mg. of Diazepam daily. Increased 
regulation of these pharmacy drugs is advised. 
<P> 
Macedonia's socio-economical and political situation is conducive 
to a further increase of drug use. Limited economic perspectives 
and the loss of traditional values have resulted in a mindset 
among Macedonian youth that is favorable to drug use. This will 
result in a high level of experimentation and, in combination 
with the absence of balanced and honest drug information, a considerable 
number of problematic users. Interventions aimed at prevention 
of use will suffer to a large extent from credibility problems, 
as many Macedonian youth simply do not trust official (governmental) 
sources of information. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Thus, a significant increase in drug use prevalence is 
anticipated and this increase will occur fairly independent of 
policy interventions.</STRONG> 
<H4><A NAME="chap9_2">9.2 HIV/AIDS and Drug Use</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
All around the world, the advent of the AIDS epidemic among IDUs 
has changed the shape of the drug problem entirely. Whereas addiction 
is not necessarily a terminal condition, AIDS is. In many countries 
HIV has afflicted large segments of the (injecting) drug using 
population and this has resulted in major changes in the provision 
of services to this population. 
<P> 
The current situation regarding HIV and drug use in Macedonia 
can be summarized as follows: HIV antibody prevalence among treatment 
populations is (close to) zero. A minority of heroin users are 
injecting. Only very few Albanians seem to inject, whereas ethnic 
Macedonians are more inclined to do so. In countries, such as 
the Netherlands and Great Britain, IDUs and Chasers are generally 
part of different networks. In Macedonia this may not be the case. 
A considerable number of users seem to alternate between injecting 
and smoking and snorting, while IDUs and smokers seem to mix to 
a larger extent. The level of HIV risk behaviors (needle sharing, 
frontloading, etc.) among IDUs seems to be unacceptably high. 
(The 100% hepatitis C seroprevalence in the, albeit small, treatment 
sample is a poor omen.) Knowledge about HIV and safer use is very 
low or absent. HIV prevention activities specifically aimed at 
IDUs have not been developed and HIV is not really addressed in 
treatment programs. 
<P> 
The absence of HIV in the Macedonian drug injecting population 
can only be contributed to the fact that the virus has not yet 
been introduced into the networks of IDUs. This presents a paradoxical 
situation: All the ingredients are present for the development 
of a human tragedy, which will gravely and greatly overshadow 
the personal and familial misery and community expense of drug 
addiction. On the other hand, because the virus has not made its 
entrance among Macedonia's IDUs, it may be possible to prevent 
a large scale HIV epidemic in the country's drug using population. 
<P> 
The potential catastrophe is exemplified by the rapid spread of 
HIV infection in southeast Asia. In Bangkok, HIV prevalence among 
drug injectors was below 1% until 1987. In September 1988 it reached 
32-43%. In Northern Thailand prevalence among IDUs increased from 
1% in 1988 to 61% in 1989 (Stimson 1994). The alternative scenario 
is presented by Australia, where, as a result of the timely and 
aggressive implementation of a harm reduction based HIV prevention 
strategy, the prevalence of HIV among IDUs remains under 5 per 
cent (Wodak &amp; Crofts 1994). 
<P> 
<STRONG>Thus, in respect to HIV/AIDS, Macedonia is currently in 
the privileged, but paradoxical position of having a very low 
HIV prevalence among its drug using population, which is engaging 
in high levels of HIV risk behaviors. It may well be possible 
to prevent an epidemic of HIV/AIDS among IDUs in Macedonia, but 
this will require a major educational effort, which must be started 
immediately.</STRONG>

At present there is almost no treatment infrastructure in Macedonia 
to deal with the problem of heroin abuse, while a rise in the 
demand for drug treatment and care services is to be expected. 
With regards to drug treatment the following problems can be distinguished: 
<UL> 
<LI>Provision of addiction treatment is not systematically organized 
and limited to only two psychiatric institutions. 
<LI>Treatment models are underdeveloped and dependent on the individual 
concepts of psychiatrists. 
<LI>Drug addicted patients are often mixed with alcoholics and 
other psychiatric patients --an undesirable situation for all 
parties. 
<LI>Public health services and primary health care providers, 
such as general practitioners (GPs) have no considerable role 
in prevention and treatment. 
<LI>There are not enough trained professionals in the field. 
<LI>In the present situation methadone can only be prescribed 
by psychiatric hospitals. When prescribed, it is generally on 
a reduction basis, maintenance is an exception. 
<LI>The legal availability of methadone to treatment providers 
is unstable, which has resulted in patients not receiving their 
medication. As the drug is imported, this problem results from 
the economic blockade. 
<LI>The geographical location of the Center for the Prevention 
and Treatment of Drug Abuse on the outskirts of Skopje constitutes 
an important barrier to treatment. 
<LI>Follow-up services after detoxification or social reintegration 
programs for people who terminated heroin use or who are maintained 
on methadone are absent. 
<LI>Harm reduction and HIV prevention services for people who 
are unable or unwilling to give up drugs, such as medical care, 
overdose and abscess prevention, syringe exchange, or legal counseling, 
are equally absent. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
In order to provide drug treatment and care to the growing number 
of heroin users this situation will need serious improvements. 
However, given the precarious economic situation of the country, 
the development of a separate and independent system of specialized 
treatment and care does not seem likely. It is also not desirable, 
as it would contribute to stigmatization and alienation. Likewise, 
we cannot expect only one profession, the psychiatrists, to effectively 
deal with the rising demand for services. 
<P> 
It is therefore of crucial importance to include the primary health 
care system in the care and treatment of drug abusers. General 
practitioners, social workers and related professionals will need 
to be involved and trained in the provision of services to drug 
users. Only when certain services cannot be organized within general 
(health care) structures, separate provisions should be created. 
<P> 
Many studies have shown that methadone substitution and in particular 
methadone maintenance is the most effective treatment for heroin 
addiction (Drucker 1995). It is for that reason advisable to establish 
methadone maintenance as the basis of the treatment system. Whereas 
maintenance will provide its foundation, flexibility is the main 
characteristic of such a prescription policy, tailoring treatment 
to the needs and capabilities of individual clients. A comprehensive 
treatment system provides a range of options, from maintenance 
to detoxification. The latter could be both ambulatory and in-patient; 
with or without substitution drugs. 
<P> 
The current restrictions on the prescription of methadone and 
other heroin substitutes might be relaxed, so that GPs are able 
to prescribe these drugs in the course of addiction treatment. 
To improve the legal availability of methadone, the local factory 
&quot;Alkaloid&quot; could perhaps produce methadone. Other pharmacological 
interventions could also be considered, e.g. Buprenorphine or 
Dihydrocodeine substitution, which is used in Germany, or Naltrexone 
in relapse prevention. 
<P> 
Methadone treatment works best when part of a comprehensive approach. 
Thus, medical care, help with social problems, psychotherapy and 
legal counseling, offered on a voluntary basis, would certainly 
improve the effectivity of treatment. 
<P> 
Relapse prevention and social reintegration programs further increase 
success rates of treatment. Such services might emphasize job 
training and forge collaborations with local businesses in order 
to provide jobs to former and stabilized drug users. 
<P> 
The agency best equipped to organize the described treatment program 
seems to be the Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug 
Abuse in Skopje. This agency should be relocated to a more central 
location in town. From there, it can initiate cooperations with 
primary health care providers, such as community health centers 
and GPs. The Center might also develop a cooperative relationship 
with the drug treatment providers of the Medical Center in Ohrid 
in order to share knowledge and organize joint training sessions. 
<P> 
There are currently negotiations going about the establishment 
of a treatment prison. Experiences elsewhere indicate that results 
of those facilities are far from impressive, while they are very 
expensive. Therefore, as long as voluntary treatment has not been 
properly organized, it makes little sense to put scarce resources 
into compulsory treatment.

<P> 
Drug education and prevention of drug abuse have not been developed 
yet in Macedonia. Such services ought to be organized in a professional 
way. At least two types of education programs can be distinguished: 
1. primary prevention and provision of general drug information, 
and 2. information aimed at (potential) drug consumers. The first 
may include school based drug education curricula and information 
for parents, while the second pertains to e.g. specific consumer 
information about certain drugs, intended to reduce the harm associated 
with the use of these drugs. In both types of programs, information 
should be presented in a forthright, factual manner and based 
on scientific research. Campaigns utilizing fear based messages 
can better be avoided, as these have been notorious failures, 
both in preventing drug use, and as credible information sources 
for consumers. Several good examples of both types of programs 
have been developed in Great Britain, the Netherlands and Australia. 
These could be translated and adapted to fit the Macedonian context. 
<P> 
Given the existence of a large number of young adolescents who 
are currently experimenting with drugs, we suggest to first develop 
the second type of education. Good drug education for adolescent 
drug consumers targets this group with relevant health information 
through credible and culturally recognizable sources. Although 
well acquainted with effects of drugs and the potential harmful 
consequences of their use, ex-addicts generally do not have the 
necessary credit, in particular for (experimenting) adolescents, 
because they do not provide recognizable role models. More crudely 
put, adolescent drug experimenters do not recognize themselves 
in &quot;fuck-ups.&quot; Skopje's independent radio station &quot;Channel 
103,&quot; because of their popularity among many (westernized) 
youth, may well provide a good medium to reach the target group. 
The station has expressed an interest in working on drug information 
campaigns.

<P> 
The Macedonian HIV/AIDS situation has been extensively discussed 
above. Here we will discuss some measures to counter the outbreak 
of an HIV epidemic among IDUs. First of all, drug treatment personnel 
must be trained to provide HIV education and safer drug use skills 
to clients. Treatment programs should also start making sterile 
injecting equipment, bleach kits and condoms available to their 
(drug injecting) clients. However, it is at least equally important 
to reach (injecting) heroin users, who are presently not in treatment. 
This can be established through an outreach effort in which medical 
professionals, peer educators and ethnographic researchers cooperate. 
Such an effort will provide systematic information about the nature, 
extent and social context of risk behaviors, while simultaneously 
offering low threshold medical care, diffusing HIV information, 
teaching safer drug use (and safer sex) skills and providing sterile 
injecting equipment to IDUs. 
<P> 
The Macedonian Anti-AIDS Association (MACA) has expressed a willingness 
to organize such an outreach effort. This organization has contacts 
with several young, enthusiastic and unemployed doctors who are 
interested in working on this project. 
<H4><A NAME="chap9_6">9.6 Development of Drug Policy</A></H4> 
 
<P> 
<A href="#TOC"><I>(Return to Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
In the coming period Macedonia will need to develop a drug policy 
to deal with the expanding use of heroin and other drugs. This 
will not be an easy task, as, for understandable reasons, drug 
problems do not rank high on the political agenda. However, this 
is not necessarily a disadvantage, as the drug issue can potentially 
become the object of political polarization, for example between 
Albanians and Macedonians. <A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#note1">(1)</A> 
It should be understood that such would be a disastrous development, 
aggravating the problems at all levels. The drug problem can best 
be dealt with outside of the political spotlight. 
<P> 
A choice must be made between a policy that emphasizes law enforcement 
(a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; approach) or a policy that puts the 
emphasis on health goals (a &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; approach). 
Some of our discussion partners expressed the hope that it would 
be possible to eradicate the use of drugs in Macedonia. In many 
countries around the world this desire has provided the justification 
for drug policies emphasizing War on Drugs strategies. However, 
The international experience of the past decades shows that, despite 
ever increasing law enforcement efforts, the prevalence of drug 
use has not decreased. In contrast, in most countries drug problems 
have increased, while the global availability of drugs such as 
heroin is larger than ever. The latter has resulted in the diffusion 
of drug use into new and previously unaffected areas. The emergence 
of heroin in Macedonia provides a perfect example. 
<P> 
Not only are its chances of eliminating drug use very small, a 
choice for a War on Drugs policy will have several other negative 
consequences. Drug related violence is presently not a big issue. 
Because of the large financial interests involved in the drug 
trade, a War on Drugs policy will lead to a spiral of ever increasing 
violence. Likewise, most heroin users do not inject, which, in 
terms of public health, is highly desirable, because IDUs are 
at great risk for contracting and spreading HIV. When a War on 
Drugs policy would be able to reduce the purity of the drugs on 
the black market, many heroin users would be pushed towards injecting. 
 
<P> 
In recent times, several countries have begun implementing &quot;Harm 
Reduction&quot; drug policies, which prioritize the reduction 
of drug related problems above the reduction of drug use per se. 
Recognizing the link between injecting drug use and the global 
AIDS epidemic, WHO has recently become a strong proponent of harm 
reduction approaches to drug problems. The Netherlands provides 
the best example of this approach. In contrast with many neighboring 
countries, the drug problem in this country, while highly visible 
and in the open, has been stabilized to manageable proportions 
(Leuw &amp; Haen Marshall 1994). Dutch law enforcement does play 
an important role in managing the drug problem, but it is subservient 
to, and coordinated with, public health policy. In fact, several 
authors attribute the success of Dutch drug policy more to intelligent 
policing than to treatment variables. 
<P> 
In many countries AIDS and heroin use have become inextricable 
&quot;Twin Epidemics.&quot; In Macedonia it is still possible 
to develop a drug policy that will prevent, or at least minimize 
such a disaster. This requires that policy making is based on 
pragmatism and scientific analysis, and not on wishful thinking 
(Des Jarlais 1995). For these reasons we advise to develop a drug 
policy based on Public Health and Harm Reduction principles.

<EM>Monday, 03-06-1995</EM> 
<P> 
On the day of arrival the team met with Dr. Ratka Kuljan, program 
coordinator at OSI-M and Dr. Ivan Tulevski, chairman of the OSI-M 
working group on the drug abuse program. This meeting served as 
a mutual introduction in which the goals of the mission and the 
schedule of the visit were discussed. Dr. Tulevski, chief of the 
Center for Treatment and Prevention of Drug Abuse of the psychiatric 
hospital Bardovci, has accompanied us at many of the meetings, 
often providing important background information. Over the course 
of the visit the other members of the working group, Ljupcho Todorovski 
and Dancho Chevreski were also met. Mr. Todorovski, a narcotics 
officer, has also been present at many of the scheduled meetings. 
 
<P> 
<EM>Tuesday, 03-07-1995</EM> 
<P> 
<U>Hospital for Nervous and Mental Diseases &quot;Bardovci&quot;</U> 
in Skopje, Prof. Dr. Jordan Jovev, dir., Prim. Dr. Ivan Duridanov, 
dep. dir. and Du&#154;anka Crvenova, principle nurse. Also present 
is Prim. Dr. Ivan Tulevski, head of the out-patient drug treatment 
clinic (see Monday, March 13) and one of our hosts. 
<P> 
Bardovci is a psychiatric hospital, built more than 20 years ago 
and very poorly maintained. Premises and furnishing are in a dilapidated 
condition. Medical equipment present (e.g. EEG machine, dental 
clinic) is about just as old as the buildings and also in substandard 
condition. The hospital's library (Bardovci is also a teaching 
hospital) has not received a foreign language book or professional 
journal in 6-7 years. 
<P> 
Bardovci houses about 750 patients in total, of whom +/- 300 go 
home on the weekends. Until recently the hospital had a joint 
department for the treatment of addiction to alcohol and drugs, 
but these were separated last year because of the increase in 
the number of drug users applying for (or being sent to) treatment 
at the hospital. For that reason they have created a new team 
solely dedicated to drug treatment. 
<P> 
The first cases of drug addiction became visible in 1969: 11 cases, 
but these consisted mainly of doctors, nurses and other medical 
providers with easy access to opiates and other drugs. Before 
1990 they were mostly confronted with use of raw opium and morphine, 
which was mainly injected. Until 1990 there were about 20-25 new 
cases yearly. Individuals would apply for treatment voluntary, 
brought by the police, or sentenced by the court to receive compulsory 
treatment (called &quot;a protective measure&quot;). In those 
days, Prof. Jovev says, they have treated 600 addicts, of whom 
400 stopped using. They were left with about 100 &quot;hard core&quot; 
opium addicts. 
<P> 
Prof. Jovev explains that drug addiction is a very contemporary 
problem, but that alcoholism is a much larger chronic problem 
in Macedonia (he estimates the number of alcoholics in Skopje 
at +/- 15.000 and for Macedonia at +/- 40.000). He hopes that 
the problem of drug addiction can still be extinguished. 
<P> 
<U>Youth Council of Macedonia</U> in Skopje, Darvo Serafimovski, 
General Secretary 
<P> 
The Youth Council of Macedonia (YCM) is an umbrella NGO, representing 
around 100.000 (Macedonian) youth in 20-30 youth organizations. 
The organization has taken the place of the former Communist Youth 
Leagues and is well-locked into the government and European youth 
organizations. Although in 1993 YCM organized a round table on 
the legalization of soft drugs (cannabis), the drug issue is not 
a high priority on YCM's agenda. Knowledge about drug use and 
related problems is limited, perhaps largely because the organizations 
YCM represents are not the environments in which initial experimentation 
with illicit drugs is likely to occur. However, the organization 
is generally aware of the problem and considering future activities 
around information provision and education. 
<P> 
<EM>Wednesday, 03-08-1993</EM> 
<P> 
<U>The Narcotics Department of the State Ministry of Interior</U>, 
in Skopje, Mr. Trpe Stojanovski, law enforcement officer and statistical 
analyst. Later we are joined by the deputy minister of interior 
affairs. 
<P> 
Mr. Stojanovski opens the meeting with a quote of the minister 
of interior: &quot;80% of the drugs that are brought into Macedonia 
are caught.&quot; Mr. Stojanovski emphasizes that this is the 
opinion of the minister and says that he does not brag about the 
data he is about to present. What follows is a fairly open presentation 
of and discussion about law enforcement information on use and 
sales of illicit drugs. However, this open atmosphere changes 
when the deputy minister enters the meeting. Our original schedule 
included meetings with local law enforcement in Tetovo and Ohrid, 
but Mr. Stojanovski explains that this was not deemed opportune 
at the ministry. 
<P> 
<U>Macedonian Center for International Cooperation</U> (MCIC) 
in Skopje, Sasho Klekovski, M.D. 
<P> 
MCIC is a humanitarian relief and development organization funded 
by a.o. European ecumenical churches. One of their main projects 
is improving the water quality in the villages in the western 
part of Macedonia. Many of these are Albanian settlings and, according 
to Mr. Klekovski, the drug trade has become a strong undercurrent. 
Many of the families are not only involved in trafficking, but 
also use heroin. &quot;No single family is without use or smuggling.&quot; 
Mr. Klekovski emphasizes the social determinants of the expansion 
in drug use in Macedonia: the breakdown of traditional societal 
structures; loss of values and perspective; the economic decline; 
a 30% unemployment rate; the return of migrant workers. Mr. Klekovski 
observes a lot of resistance in Macedonian society when it comes 
to acknowledging issues around homosexuality, drug use and AIDS. 
He wonders whether the national public health system is capable 
of adequately responding to these health crises. 
<P> 
<EM>Thursday, 03-09-1995</EM> 
<P> 
Ms. Teuta Arifi, television journalist in Tetovo 
<P> 
Mrs. Arifi, an Albanian journalist has little information on the 
drug issue as such, but provides us with a larger socio-historical 
perspective on the transition Macedonia is undergoing with an 
emphasis on the ethnic and gender ingredients. She, too, emphasizes 
that the reasons to use drugs are present: unemployment, depression, 
lack of perspective, hopelessness. She feels that the school system 
could play an important educational role in building an open multi-ethnic 
society, but is currently not doing so: &quot;Children loose a 
lot of time in school learning about the number of power plants 
in the Czech republic, instead they should get health education, 
human rights and tolerance.&quot; 
<P> 
<EM>Friday, 03-10-1995</EM> 
<P> 
<U>Medical Center Ohrid, Department of Neuropsychiatry</U> in 
Ohrid, Dr. Nikola Tuntev, director, Gjuladin Gjuladin, deputy 
director, Prim. Dr. Pavel Sotiroski, Dr. Snezana Strezoska, Dr. 
Tanja Tockova (all three psychiatrists) 
<P> 
Ohrid is the main town at lake Ohrid, the largest natural lake 
in the country. It is a beautiful lake which draws many foreign 
and (increasingly since the boycott and visa requirements) Macedonian 
tourists. Because of its touristic status, Ohrid experiences many 
&quot;big city phenomena,&quot; such as gambling, prostitution 
and drug use. 
<P> 
We meet in the director's office which is decorated with a large 
portrait of marshall Tito. The medical center started to experience 
a rise in drug problems about two years ago. Currently, there 
are about 200 &quot;registered drug addicts&quot; on a population 
of 75.000, but our discussion partners still feel that drug use 
is incidental and they hope to prevent it from happening/spreading. 
The meeting has a somewhat forced character, in particular when 
subjects such as HIV prevention and condoms are addressed. For 
that reason, Dr. Tulevski (our escort) proposes not to burden 
the directors' busy agendas any longer and to continue the meeting 
with the psychiatrists only. 
<P> 
It is made clear that knowledge about and experience with drug 
problems is still limited, which is reflected in the treatment 
approach: drug users are mixed with patients with a wide variety 
of psychiatric complaints and addiction treatment is often improvised 
and not based on established criteria. Likewise, many basic resources 
are absent. Dr. Sotiroski asks for support in establishing a separate 
drug treatment facility, computers, research and laboratory facilities. 
HIV awareness is limited and prevention activities are not part 
of treatment. 
<P> 
<EM>Sunday, 03-12-1995</EM> 
<P> 
<U>Macedonian Anti-AIDS Association</U> (MACA) in Skopje, Sofija 
Matovska Kunovska &amp; Goran Vesov, M.D. 
<P> 
Ms. Matovska and Dr. Vesov represent the management of the Macedonian 
Anti-AIDS Association, a NGO involved in information-based HIV 
prevention (AIDS awareness) campaigns. They are a member of EUROCASA 
and have received funding from OSI-M and MCIC. Their activities 
include &quot;countless&quot; media presentations, production 
and distribution of information brochures in Macedonian and Albanian, 
a coordinated poster campaign, badges, etc. Campaigns have been 
aimed at the general population, drug users (or gays) have not 
been targeted as a group. Likewise, there is very little knowledge 
about drug use and (beyond &quot;don't share needles&quot;) the 
relationship with HIV within MACA. This lack appears to be more 
general, as Dr. Vesov thinks that there is no conception in Macedonia 
about how to deal with HIV issues or how to include these in (drug) 
treatment and prevention. While there are several governmental 
commissions erected around AIDS, non are viewed as very active 
or effective. MACA is currently thinking about new projects. The 
question whether this organization would be able and willing to 
provide the organizational framework for an HIV prevention (outreach) 
effort aimed at (injecting) drug users comes somewhat as a surprise 
but generates a serious interest. Dr. Vesov and Ms. Matovska will 
investigate the feasibility of such a venture. (Note: later communications 
with Dr. Vesov confirm MACA's interest. Dr. Vesov has identified 
several young, enthusiastic, but unemployed doctors who are interested 
in working on the project.) 
<P> 
<EM>Monday, 03-13-1995</EM> 
<P> 
<U>Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse</U> in 
Skopje, Prim.Dr. Ivan Tulevski, psychiatrist and head of the department, 
Dr. Slavica Gaidazdis Knezevik, Dr. Violeta Kiteva, Dr. Dimitar 
Bonevski (all three psychiatrists), Anica Zdravevska, psychologist, 
Slavica Sekutkovska, social worker 
<P> 
The center is the outpatient drug treatment clinic of Bardovci 
hospital. My visit consists of 3 parts: first I am introduced 
to the group of parents involved in the treatment of their heroin 
addicted children. Next I talk with the patients and then I meet 
with Dr. Tulevski and his staff. 
<P> 
A group of parents of drug addicted children is almost never a 
happy gathering and this was no exclusion. One by one these tormented 
elders told their stories. colored by fear and worries about the 
health of their children, misunderstanding and ignorance about 
their drug use, fear of stigmatization, doubts about the treatment, 
and the burden of their participation in the program (many of 
them drive their children across town to the treatment center 
--which is located on the outskirts of Skopje-- to pick up methadone 
or undergo group- or psycho-therapy). While staff was in the room, 
parents were, although subdued, vocal about these problems. After 
a while the meeting got interrupted by several requests from patients 
for their methadone. Apparently parents and children had been 
waiting for my arrival (and in the case of the patients, their 
methadone) some time, and the young men were getting impatient. 
<P> 
When the patients entered the room, parents and staff left and 
I was left with my interpreter and a room full of rather hostile 
adolescents, mostly men between 18 and 25 years of age. I was 
the reason for the delay in their being medicated, but by asking 
a series of questions about issues that are meaningful to them 
(the whereabouts of scoring, preparing and using dope), I was 
able to engage them in some dialogue about drug use and administration 
patterns, HIV risk behaviors, HIV awareness and safer use. Their 
stories and answers to my questions provided support to several 
assumptions and testimonies, generated by the fieldwork, about 
the distribution of use, administration, and selling patterns 
in different ethnic groups, the level of HIV risk behavior among 
injecting heroin users, etc.. 
<P> 
The discussion with Dr. Tulevski and his team revealed the difficulties 
of providing adequate drug treatment services with severely limited 
(financial) resources. It has happened more than once that patients 
could not be medicated, because the clinic was not able to secure 
the necessary Heptanon (methadone). Likewise, their facility is 
in a poor state of maintenance, located in a very remote neighborhood 
with dilapidated access roads. This location presents a significant 
barrier to services for people for whom a car is not available. 
Not only the building is in bad shape, the little furniture available 
as well. Some rooms are furthermore empty: the windows cannot 
be closed tightly, but there is also no furniture to equip them. 
 
<P> 
<EM>Tuesday, 03-14-1995</EM> 
<P> 
<U>State Penitentiary</U> in Skopje, Mr. Stoiko Antovski, prison 
director Dr. Mihail Levenski, medical director and Ms. Milka Ristova, 
a former criminal judge, currently working at the ministry of 
justice and member of a working group which is preparing a revision 
of Macedonia's drug laws. 
<P> 
Of the +/- 200 prisoners in this jail 20-30 are (known) drug addicts, 
their primary drug being mostly heroin (within a polydrug use 
pattern). These offenders are 18-38 years old, but the younger 
ones are in the majority and on the increase. They significantly 
disturb the prison regime, in particular when they &quot;get into 
a crisis&quot; (withdrawal). Opiate dependent prisoners may be 
put on methadone, followed by &quot;treatment.&quot; It is, however, 
unclear what this treatment consists of. Dr. Levenski experiences 
problems with procuring methadone. When methadone is not available, 
it is substituted by neuroleptics, but this is not really successful. 
 
<P> 
A number of sentenced drug addicts are sent to a closed ward in 
Bardovci hospital (currently +/- 10), but security is insufficient. 
For that reason, Mr. Antovski would like to see a treatment prison 
for addicts who have received prison sentences. Negotiations on 
this matter are going on between prison authorities, Bardovci 
and the ministry of justice. 
<P> 
When she was a judge, ms. Ristova presided over many drug cases. 
The courts have experienced a considerable increase in drug cases. 
Between 1945 and 1980 there were only 40 drug cases in total. 
In the 1980s there were about 5-10 drug cases yearly. From 1990 
on the courts have dealt with +/- 100 cases and especially after 
1992 drug cases increased strongly. Ms. Ristova explains that 
known alcohol/drug addicts, when sentenced for e.g. acquisition 
crime, can also be sentenced to a, so called, &quot;protective 
measure,&quot; which is a form of compulsory treatment. When such 
treatment fails, the offender is sent back to prison to finish 
the sentence; when successful the sentence is reviewed. In practice 
the latter hardly happens: the results of the protective measure 
have been zero with drug using offenders. It is felt that this 
is largely the result of the absence of resources to provide adequate 
treatment. 
<P> 
Ms. Ristova is also a member of a commission set up in the beginning 
of 1995 to prepare a revision of Macedonia's drug laws. This commission 
is considering whether to criminalize use of drugs (which is currently 
not an offense), whether and how to improve the protective measure 
and the situation of drug addicts in prison; can the prison system 
be used to provide adequate drug treatment. On the other hand, 
possibilities of decriminalization or legalization of marihuana 
are also discussed in this commission. 
<P> 
Brian Shott, program officer at International Resources Exchange 
(IREX) in Skopje. 
<P> 
Mr. Shott, an American anthropologist has been studying Macedonian 
society, in particular the relationships between the different 
ethnic groups, as field research for a Ph.D. study. He does not 
have specific information on drug use and trafficking, but feels 
that this issue has a potential of being politicized in inter-ethnic 
conflicts. His organization would be interested in helping to 
develop internet-based information dissemination to improve the 
development of drug policy and services. 
<P> 
Mirche Tomovski, editor of Puls, a weekly magazine 
<P> 
Mr. Tomovski can provide only limited information on specific 
drug matters, but sketches the larger picture of the transitions 
Macedonia is going through: It is a complicated time; the transition 
process has lead to the devaluation of traditional institutions 
and values, while new ones to replace them have not been developed 
yet. Organizing democracy and a free economy are not easy tasks 
and lead to new, previously unanticipated problems. The people 
of Macedonia are divided, economically, religiously and ethnically. 
However, at the level of ordinary people these differences are 
not so sharp, but politicians politicize and sharpen these differences. 
Interestingly, Mr. Tomovski notes, the relationships between Albanians 
and Macedonians in drug dealing circles is better than average: 
&quot;You do not worry whether the relationships between different 
national groups will be okay as long the relationships between 
criminals of the different groups is okay.&quot; 
<P> 
While Skopje is the (legal) business center of Macedonia and the 
main drug scene, according to Mr. Tomovski it is not the center 
of the drug business. The bulk of the large transactions are conducted 
in Tetovo, Ohrid and the smaller (Albanian) villages. &quot;In 
Ohrid the fish is cheap...&quot; Many of these villages maintain 
dynamic connections with &quot;a diaspora of migrant workers.&quot;

<U>The Public Health Institute of the Republic of Macedonia</U> 
in Skopje, Prim. Dr. Sotir Sotirovski, Epidemiologist, President 
of the National AIDS Committee, Head Department of Tropical and 
quarantine diseases, AIDS 
<P> 
Dr. Sotirovski presents me with the official government version 
of Macedonia's response to HIV. He explains that Macedonia has 
a great capacity to deal with infectious diseases through the 
national public health system and regional health centers. There 
is, however, a lack of funds to maximize the use of these human 
resources. 
<P> 
In 1985 Macedonia initiated an AIDS program, consisting of two 
parts: 
<OL> 
<LI>Implementing HIV prevention in the health system, e.g. abandoning 
glass syringes, testing the blood supply, etc.; 
<LI>Health education for the general population through regional 
health centers. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
A big school campaign is planned. However, only modest funds are 
provided. 
<HR> 
 
<H3>Footnote:</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A NAME="note1"><STRONG>1.</STRONG>Macedonian politicians may 
blame the availability and use of heroin on Albanians, who, indeed, 
seem to dominate heroin trafficking. However, the Albanian population 
is, at minimum, equally afflicted by heroin use. Overall, heroin 
use cannot be explained by just one factor -- the availability--, 
but is the result of a combination of many, often intertwined, 
factors. Nevertheless, the potential for politization is present 
and in the current conflict with Greece it is already exploited. 
Just like Macedonia, Greece has experienced a considerable increase 
in heroin use in the first half of the 1990s. Hardline greek politicians 
claim that Macedonia is behind this, trying to corrupt the Greek 
youth, so that they would not be able to defend their country 
in case of &quot;a Macedonian invasion.&quot; </A><A HREF="#back1">(back)</A><p>

<LI>&quot;The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of

needle exchange services and to expanding research into these  
programs.&quot;  
<LI>&quot;State governments in the ten states and the District of Columbia  
that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.&quot;

<P>About 12,000 copies of various volumes of the report distributed  
  
<H3><A NAME="first">The first review</A></H3>  
  
<P>  
On October 15, 1993, Joe Boufford, Principal Deputy Assistant  
Secretary for Health (Lee's office), writes to CDC Director David  
Satcher requesting a review of the UC report and providing opinions  
and recommendations for federal action in response to needle exchange.  
<P>  
CDC consults with NIH (NIDA), FDA, HRSA and SAMSHA (Substance  
Abuse Mental Health Services Administration). Their comments are  
attached as tabs to the review.  
<H4>Conclusions:</H4>  
  
<UL>  
<LI>&quot;The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically  
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle  
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to injection  
drug users.&quot; (page 1) &quot;The UC team used stringent scientific  
standards in its analysis and interpretation of the collected  
published and unpublished studies ... The UC report is the most  
extensive and comprehensive study of needle exchange ever published.&quot;  
(page 6)  
<LI>After reviewing several lines of evidence similar to the four  
points listed above, the review concludes: &quot;Taken together, these  
observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV transmission,  
even though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do not definitively  
demonstrate decreases or increases in HIV transmission.&quot;  
(page 2) &quot;Several findings strongly support the conclusion that  
NEPs reduce HIV transmission.&quot; (page 10)  
<LI>&quot;No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either  
drug use or in the number of discarded syringes.&quot; (page 2)  
&quot;We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are quite  
limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related increases in  
community levels of drug use.&quot; (page 10)  
<LI>&quot;... we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component  
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed  
the theoretical risks of such programs.&quot; (page 2)  
<LI><STRONG>&quot;We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs  
should be lifted to allow communities and States to use Federal  
funds to support NEPs as components of comprehensive HIV prevention  
programs.&quot;</STRONG> (page 2)  
<LI><STRONG>&quot;We also recommend that States consider the repeal of  
laws requiring a physician's prescription to buy needles and syringes  
and the removal of criminal penalties for the possession of needles  
and syringes&quot;</STRONG> (page 2)

<H3>Fate of the first review</H3>  
  
<P>  
Review signed by Satcher and sent to Boufford on December 10, 1993.  
<P>  
Review has never been made public.  
<P>  
Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under condition that  
it not be released to the public.  
<P>  
Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; a  
request by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was denied recently.  
<P>  
Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN in  
August 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994.  
<H3><A NAME="second">The second review</A></H3>  
  
<P>  
In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the Assistant Secretary  
for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update on information since  
the University of California Report.  
<P>  
This second review, much shorter and less expansive than the first  
review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS (James  
Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and HIV  
Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, and presumably  
forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.  
<H4>The review contains the following:</H4>  
  
<UL>  
<LI>Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decrease  
in HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes that &quot;although  
the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible.&quot; (page 1)  
<LI>Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIV  
risk behavior (page 3)  
<LI>No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study  
(page 3)  
<LI>New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and C infections  
associated with needle exchange is now seven- to eight-fold. <STRONG>&quot;this  
study demonstrates more clearly than any previous research that  
use of NEPs is associated with decreases in blood borne infections.&quot;</STRONG>  
(Page 4)  
<LI>Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higher  
rates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infection  
among NEP clients that &quot;require further study.&quot; (page  
<LI>This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing that  
NEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a good  
thing).  
<LI>No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy.  
<LI>The existence of this review has never been made public.  
</UL>  
  
<H4>Public health significance</H4>  
  
<P>  
Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injections drug  
users, their sex partners and their children.  
<P>  
Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any given  
day.  
<P>  
Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their children  
contract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infections  
per hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,  
according to the New Haven mathematical model.<HR>

<H3>Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and Laws Related to  
Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession</H3>  
  
<CENTER>DRAFT</CENTER>  
  
<H4>1. Background</H4>  
  
The following information is provided in response to the request of Brian  
Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, for an update on (a)  
studies of needle exchange programs (NEPs) since the 1993 release of the  
University of California (UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs   
<A HREF="#note1">[1]</A> and  
(b) recent developments related to laws related to NEPs and possessions  
and/pr sale of syringes.<p>  
  
<H4>2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHA Conference</H4>  
<UL>  
<LI> At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA) Conference, Dr.  
Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of an approximate 50% reduction in  
rates of new HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in  
New York City (NYC).  
  
<LI>This estimate was based on several small follow-up studies of HIV  
incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidence among IDUs in a  
vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies in methadone maintenance.  
<A HREF="#note2">[2]</A>  
A manuscript based the APHA oral presentation is being prepared. Until this  
study is more fully described, it is difficult to assess the basis for this  
estimate of NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small, the  
estimate is plausible.  
</UL>  
  
<H4>3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale of syringes</H4>  
<UL>  
<LI>In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode  
Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states (Connecticut and  
Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEP legislation.  
  
<LI>In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council of Los Angeles declared a  
"local state of emergency." The declaration was based on "... finding that  
an emergency in connection with the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of  
HIV through contaminated needles does exist, and that this emergency  
threatens to cause extraordinary loss of life." <A HREF="#note3">[3]</A>  
This state of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing support for  
"responsible" NEPs.  
  
<LI>In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states of emergency have been  
made in nine other California cities and counties - Alameda, Berkeley,  
Marin, Oakland, Salinas, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West  
Hollywood.  
  
<LI>A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several laws that restrict  
the purchase, distribution, and possession of syringes. These laws include  
"prescription laws," under which a prescription is required to purchase  
syringes and "drug paraphernalia laws," which establish felony and/or  
misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/or distribution of  
syringes for nonmedical purposes. About nine states have prescription laws  
and more than 40 states have drug paraphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine  
repealed its prescription law.  
  
<LI>In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drug paraphernalia and  
prescription laws. The new laws allow purchase of as many as 10 syringes  
without a prescription and possession of as many as 10 syringes without a  
medical condition. A CDC and Connecticut Health Department evaluation of  
the impact of these new laws found that IDUs reported substantially less  
multiperson use ("sharing") of injection equipment. Also, after the change  
in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sell syringes without  
a prescription and, for drug injectors, there was a dramatic shift from  
"black market" sources of syringes to purchases in pharmacies.

<H4>4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation to use sterile  
syringes</H4>  
  
Several studies published in a special section of the July 1994 <EM>Journal  
of AIDS</EM> indicate that while bleach disinfection can reduce the HIV  
transmission risk of IDU reuse of syringes, it is not as safe as using a  
new, sterile syringe. The following quotation summarizes the argument:<p>  
  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs should use sterile  
needles and syringes; ideally only once and then safely dispose of them.  
IDUs should be told never to re-use injection equipment that had been  
previously used by someone else.... If one re-uses injection equipment,  
consistent and thorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such as  
full-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorter periods of  
time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIV transmission  
risk. <A HREF="#note5">[5]</A>  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
  
<P>The following sections present additional information on NEPs that has  
become available since the release of the UC report.  
  
<H4>5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients</H4>  
  
The following data from San Francisco and New York, cities with high volume  
NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviors reported by NEP clients:<p>  
<UL>  
<LI>Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increased use of the  
NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs. <A HREF="#note6">[6]</A>  
  
<LI>Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPs in New York  
City. <A HREF="#note7">[7]</A>  
  
<LI>Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drug detoxification  
programs in New York City who injected with a use syringe and who lent used  
syringes to others, associated with the opening of NEPs in that city.  
</UL>  
  
<H4>6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, a city with  
a high-volume NEP</H4>  
  
The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of the highest volume  
NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes were exchanged during the  
Spring of 1992. The following data come from repeated surveys (from 1988 to  
1992) of IDUs in San Francisco:<p>  
  
<UL>  
<LI>The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per day in the Fall  
of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992. <A HREF="#note8">[8]</A>  
  
<LI>The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in San Francisco increased  
from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42 years in the Spring of 1992.  
<A HREF="#note6">[6]</A>  
  
<LI>The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that they first injected  
drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% in the Spring of 1989 to  
1.1% in the Spring of 1992. <A HREF="#note6">[6]</A>  
</UL>  
  
Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significant numbers of  
persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city with a high-volume NEP.<p>  
  
<H4>7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUs using  
the New Haven NEP</H4>  
  
Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicated that the rate  
of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in New Haven, CT, was reduced by  
33% by their use of the NEP. Updated estimates from that model suggest that  
the reduction is more than 40%. <A HREF="#note9">[9]</A><p>  
  
<H4>8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using the Tacoma NEP</H4>  
  
A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington, using  
multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographic characteristics of the  
IDUs found that, compared with nonusers of the NEP, IDUs who had ever used  
the Tacoma NEP were seven times less likely to become infected with  
hepatitis B and eight times less likely to become infected with hepatitis  
C. <A HREF="#note10">[10]</A> This study demonstrates more clearly than  
any previous research that use of NEPs is associated with decreases in  
blood-borne infections.<p>  
  
<H4>9. Substantial entry into drug treatment of New Haven NEP clients</H4>  
  
Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients (19%) in New  
Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUs who did not exchange  
syringes were referred to drug treatment by the NEP. <A HREF="#note#11">  
[11]</A><p>  
  
<H4>10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs</H4>  
  
One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs. Studies from  
two cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City and San Francisco, indicate  
that substantial proportions of IDUs surveyed report use of the NEPs.<p>  
<UL>  
<LI>Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearly half (46%) of  
IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP. <A HREF="#note2">[2]</A>  
  
<LI>Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 found that 45%  
"usually" obtained their syringes from the San Francisco NEP. <A   
HREF="#note6">[6]</A>  
</UL>  
  
<H4>11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States</H4>  
  
The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the United States as of  
September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70 NEPs were in operation  
in the United States. <A HREF="#note12">[12]</A><p>  
  
<H4>12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDS prevention</H4>  
  
In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 national telephone  
survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) of respondents favored  
"Implementing needle exchange programs to reduce the spread of diseases  
such as AIDS." <A HREF="#note13">[13]</A><p>  
  
<H4>13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the National Academy of  
Sciences</H4>  
  
A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by the Institute of  
Medicine, described NEPs as "highly promising" and called for the lifting  
of the ban on the use of federal funds for NEP services. "The weight of  
evidence suggests that needle exchange does more good than harm," concluded  
the authors. <A HREF="#note14">[14]</A><p>  
  
<H4>14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs</H4>  
  
The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canada have been  
reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St. Luc IDU cohort that  
among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half (54%) reporting use of a  
Montreal NEP had higher HIV seroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with  
nonattenders. Among the 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site,  
the seroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs. 3.5 per 100 person-years  
[p<0.0001]) among IDUs using an NEP. <A HREF="#note15">[15]</A><p>  
  
A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a Montreal NEP reported  
higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who did not use a NEP).  
Montreal NEP attenders were more likely than non-attenders, to have same  
sex partners, to work in the sex industry, to report injecting with needles  
used by an HIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment  
without cleaning. <A HREF="#note16">[16]</A><p>  
  
The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIV risk factors  
among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP require further study.<p>  
  
<H4>15. Comments and conclusions</H4>  
  
Since the 1993 release of the UC report:<p>  
  
<UL>  
<LI>The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states and localities  
have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration of sates of emergency;  
  
<LI>In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantial proportions of IDUs  
report using the NEP;  
  
<LI>Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virus transmission  
among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger for hepatitis than HIV;  
  
<LI>There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs, NEP clients  
have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and  
  
<LI>Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using the Montreal NEP were  
documented and must be further investigated.  
</UL>  
  
<P>Needle exchange programs continue to be controversial.  Even so, the  
available evidence suggests that NEPs can effectively reach substantial  
numbers of IDUs and provide them with new, sterile syringes and thereby  
reduce the number of blood-contaminated syringes being used to inject  
drugs.  In general, interaction of IDUs with NEPs is associated with  
decreases in HIV risk behaviors, particularly for risks associated with  
drug use.  
  
<P>Discussion of the role of NEPs in HIV prevention and public health should  
always recognize that the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws enforced  
in many states and localities are substantial barriers to IDUs access to  
sterile syringes.  
  
<P>Exchanging syringes is a single action/intervention that should not be  
implemented or evaluated by itself but as part of a comprehensive HIV  
prevention program for drug users that includes efforts to reduce sexual  
risk behaviors, to increase the quantity and quality of drug abuse treatment,  
and to reduce drug use in the community.

<H4>Appendix IV</H4>   
<H2>Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange   
Programs</H2>   
   
EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office (GAO), titled   
"NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research Suggests Promise as an AIDS   
Prevention Strategy."<p>   
   
Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in addition to the   
Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA)   
Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisions prohibiting or   
restricting use of federal funding for needle exchange programs and   
activities. These provisions are contained in:<p>   
<UL>   
<LI>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health   
Amendments Act of 1988;   
<LI>The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988;   
<LI>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990; and   
<LI>The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and   
Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990, 1991, and 1993 (the   
Appropriations Act of 1992 did not contain such a provision).   
</UL>   
   
<P>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments   
Act of 1988 required states, as a condition for receiving ADAMHA block   
grant funds under title XIX of the PHS Act, to agree that funds would not be   
used   
   
<BLOCKQUOTE>"to carry out any programs of distributing sterile needles   
for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for   
the purpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection...."</BLOCKQUOTE>   
   
This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (1992).<p>   
   
The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes funds and programs   
aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventing its transmission. Among   
other things, the act authorizes grants and contracts through the Director   
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to assist   
public and nonprofit private entities in conducting research and training   
in advanced diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. These   
grants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-term   
monitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The act   
also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally, the Director of the   
National Institutes of Health is to establish projects to promote   
cooperation among public health agencies and with private entities in   
research concerned with the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AIDS.   
The act provides further:<p>   
   
<BLOCKQUOTE>"None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment made   
by this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or   
syringes so that such individuals may use illegal drugs, unless the Surgeon   
General of the Public Health Service determines that a demonstration needle   
exchange program would be effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk   
that the public will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired   
immune deficiency syndrome."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>   
   
The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of l990 (42   
U.S.C. S 300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localities disproportionately   
affected by the HIV epidemic. The act prohibits use of   
   
<BLOCKQUOTE>"funds made available under this Act, or an amendment made by   
this Act...to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so   
that such individuals may use illegal drugs."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>   
   
The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and   
Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and 1991 contained identical   
prohibitions regarding needle exchange programs (section 520 of P.L.   
101-166 and section 512 of P.L. 101-517). The provision stated:   
   
<BLOCKQUOTE>"None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used   
to carry out any program of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic   
injection of any illegal drug unless the President of the United States   
certifies that such programs are effective in stopping the spread of HIV   
and do not encourage the use of illegal drugs."</BLOCKQUOTE>   
   
In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and   
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 1993, states in   
section 514 of the "General Provisions":   
   
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds   
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any program of   
distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic injection of any illegal   
drug unless the Surgeon General of the United States determines that such   
programs are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage   
the use of illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such   
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized in the   
ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321)."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<i>About The Sentencing Project</i> 
<p> 
The Sentencing Project was established in 1986 to improve sentencing practices and to develop sentencing 
programs that promote alternatives to incarceration, particularly for indigent defendants. Its staff 
and consultants introduce sentencing programs and other reforms into state and local criminal justice 
systems, train court officials, and analyze and assess court and corrections needs.

<P> 
From <A HREF="interest.html">The Case for Legalization</A><HR> 
 
<P> 
All vice-control efforts are particularly susceptible to corruption, 
but none so much as drug enforcement. When police accept bribes 
from drug dealers, no victim exists to complain to the authorities. 
Even when police extort money and drugs from traffickers and<B> 
</B>dealers, the latter are in no position to report the corrupt 
officers. What makes drug enforcement especially vulnerable to 
corruption are the tremendous amounts of money involved in the 
business. Today many law-enforcement officials believe that police 
corruption is more pervasive than at any time since Prohibition. 
In Miami, dozens of law-enforcement officials have been charged 
with accepting bribes, stealing from drug dealers, and even dealing 
drugs themselves. Throughout many small towns and rural communities 
in Georgia, where drug smugglers en route from Mexico, the Caribbean, 
and Latin America drop their loads of cocaine and marijuana, dozens 
of sheriffs have been implicated in drug-related corruption. In 
New York, drug-related corruption in one Brooklyn police precinct 
has generated the city s most far-reaching police corruption scandal 
since the l960s. More than a hundred cases of drug-related corruption 
are now prosecuted each year in state and federal courts. Every 
one of the federal law-enforcement agencies charged with drug-enforcement 
responsibilities has seen an agent implicated in drug-related 
corruption. 
<P> 
It is not difficult to explain the growing pervasiveness of drug-related 
curruption. The financial temptations are enormous relative required. 
Many police officers are demoralized by the scope of the drug 
traffic, their sense that maybe citizens are indifferent, and 
the fact that many sectors of society do not even appreciate their 
efforts - as well as the fact that many drug dealers who are arrested 
do not remain in prison. Some police also recognize that that 
enforcing the drug laws does not protect the victims from predators 
so much as it regulates an illicit market that cannot be suppressed, 
but can be kept underground. In every respect, the analogy to 
prohibition is apt. Repealing the drug-prohibition laws would 
dramatically reduce police corruption . By contrast the measures 
being proposed to deal with the growing problem, including better 
funding and more aggressive internal investigations, offer relatively 
little promise. 
<P> 
Among the most difficult costs to evaluate are those that relate 
to the widespread defiance of the drug-prohibition laws: the effects 
of labeling as criminals the tens of millions of people who use 
drugs illicitly, subjecting them to the risks of criminal sanction, 
and obliging many of these same people to enter into relationships 
with drug dealers (who may be criminals in many more senses of 
the word) in order to purchase their drugs; the cynicism that 
such laws generate toward other laws and the law in general; and 
the sense of hostility and suspicion that many otherwise law-abiding 
individuals feel toward law-enforcement officials. It was costs 
such as these that strongly influenced many of Prohibition's more 
conservative opponents.<HR>

<HR> 
 
<P> 
Since 1981, federal expenditures on drug enforcement have more 
than tripled-from less than one billion dollars a year to three 
billion. According to the National Drug Enforcement Board, the 
annual budgets of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and 
the Coast Guard have each risen during the past seven years from 
about $220 million to roughly $500 million. During the same period, 
FBI resources devoted to drug enforcement increased from $8 million 
a year to over $100 million; U.S. Marshals resources from $26 
million to about $80 million; U.S. Attorney resources from $20 
million to about $100 million; State Department resources from 
$35 million to $100 million; U.S. Customs resources from $180 
million to over $400 million; and Bureau of Prison resources from 
$77 million to about $300 million. Expenditures on drug control 
by the military and the intelligence agencies are more difficult 
to calculate, although by all accounts they have increased by 
at least the same magnitude, and now total hundreds of millions 
of dollars per year. Even greater are the expenditures at lower 
levels of government. In a 1987 study for the U.S. Customs Service 
by Wharton Econometrics, state and local police were estimated 
to have devoted 18 percent of their total investigative resources, 
or close to five billion dollars, to drug-enforcement activities 
in 1986. This represented a 19 percent increase over the previous 
year's expenditures. All told, 1987 expenditures on all aspects 
of drug enforcement, from drug eradication in foreign countries 
to imprisonment of drug users and dealers in the United States, 
totaled at least ten billion dollars. 
<P> 
Of course, even ten billion dollars a year pales in comparison 
with expenditures on military defense. Of greater concern than 
the actual expenditures, however, has been the diversion of limited 
resources-including the time and energy of judges, prosecutors, 
and law-enforcement agents, as well as scarce prison space-from 
the prosecution and punishment of criminal activities that harm 
far more innocent victims than do violations of the drug laws. 
Drug-law violators account for approximately 10 percent of the 
roughly 800,000 inmates in state prisons and local jails, and 
more than one-third of the 44,000 federal prison inmates. These 
proportions are expected to increase in coming years, even as 
total prison populations continue to rise dramatically. (The total 
number of state and federal prison inmates in 1975 was under 250,000; 
in 1980 it was 350,000; and in 1987 it was 575,000. The projected 
total for 2000 is one million.) Among the 40,000 inmates in New 
York State prisons, drug-law violations surpassed first-degree 
robbery in 1987 as the number one cause of incarceration, accounting 
for 20 percent of the total prison population. The U.S. Sentencing 
Commission has estimated that, largely as a consequence of the 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act passed by Congress in 1986, the proportion 
of federal inmates incarcerated for drug violations will rise 
from one-third of the 44,000 prisoners sentenced to federal-prison 
terms today to one-half of the 100,000 to 150,000 federal prisoners 
anticipated in fifteen years. The direct costs of building and 
maintaining enough prisons to house this growing population are 
rising at an astronomical rate. The opportunity costs, in terms 
of alternative social expenditures foregone and other types of 
criminals not imprisoned, are even greater. (It should be emphasized 
that the numbers cited do not include the many inmates sentenced 
for &quot;drug-related&quot; crimes such as acts of violence committed 
by drug dealers, typically against one another, and robberies 
committed to earn the money needed to pay for illegal drugs.) 
<P> 
During each of the last few years, police made about 750,000 for 
violations of the drug laws. Slightly more than three-quarters 
of these have not been for manufacturing or dealing drugs, but 
solely for possession of an illicit drug, typically marijuana. 
(Those arrested, it is worth noting, represent little more than 
2 percent of the thirty million Americans estimated to have used 
an illegal drug during the past year.) On the one hand, this has 
clogged urban criminal-justice systems: in New York City, drug-law 
violations last year accounted for more than 40 percent of all 
felony indictments-up from 25 percent in 1985; in Washington, 
D.C., the figure was more than 50 percent. On the other hand, 
it has distracted criminal-justice officials from concentrating 
greater resources on violent offenses and property crimes. In 
many cities, law enforcement has become virtually synonymous with 
drug enforcement. 
<P> 
Drug laws typically have two effects on the market in illicit 
drugs. The first is to restrict the general availability and accessibility 
of illicit drugs, especially in locales where underground drug 
markets are small and isolated from the community. The second 
is increase, often significantly, the price of illicit drugs to 
consumers. Since the costs of producing most illicit drugs are 
not much different from the costs of alcohol, tobacco, and coffee, 
most of the price paid for illicit substances is in effect a value-added 
tax created by their criminalization, which is enforced and supplemented 
by the law-enforcement establishment, but collected by the drug 
traffickers. A report by Wharton Econometrics for the President's 
Commission on Organized Crime identified the sale of illicit drugs 
as the source of more than half of all organized crime revenues 
in 1986, with the marijuana and heroin business each providing 
over seven billion, and the cocaine business over thirteen billion. 
By contrast, revenues from cigarette bootlegging, which persists 
principally because of differences among states in their cigarette-tax 
rates, were estimated at 290 million dollars. If the marijuana, 
cocaine, and heroin markets were legal, state and federal governments 
would collect billions of dollars annually in tax revenues. Instead, 
they expend billions on what amounts to a subsidy of organized 
crime and unorganized criminals. <HR>

<HR> 
 
<P> 
Most proposals for dealing with the drug problem today reflect 
a desire to point the finger at those most removed from one's 
home area of expertise. New York Mayor Ed Koch, Florida Congressman 
Larry Smith, and Harlem Congressman Charles Rangel, who recognize 
government's inability to deal with the drug problem in cities, 
are among the most vocal supporters of punishing foreign drug-producing 
countries and stepping up interdiction efforts. Foreign leaders 
and U. S. State Department and drug-enforcement offices stationed 
abroad, on the other hand, who understand all too well why it 
is impossible to crack down successfully on illicit drug production 
outside the United States, are the most vigorous advocates of 
domestic enforcement and demand-reduction efforts within United 
States. In between, those agencies charged with drug interdiction, 
from the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs Services to U.S. military, 
know that they will never succeed in capturing more than a small 
percentage of the illicit drugs being smuggled into the United 
States. Not surprisingly, they point their fingers in both directions. 
The solution, they promise, lies in greater source-control efforts 
abroad and greater demand-reduction efforts at home. 
<P> 
Trying to pass the buck is always understandable. But in each 
of these cases, the officials are half right and half wrong-half 
right in recognizing that they can do little to affect their end 
of the drug problem, given the suppositions and constraints of 
current drug-control strategies; half wrong (if we assume that 
their finger-pointing is sincere) in expecting that the solution 
lies elsewhere. It would be wrong, however, to assume that the 
public posturing of many officials reflects their real views. 
Many of them privately acknowledge the futility of all current 
drug-control strategies, and wonder whether radically different 
options, such as legalization, might not prove more successful 
in dealing with the drug problem. The political climate pervading 
this issue is such, however, that merely to ask that alternatives 
to current policies be considered is to incur a great political 
risk. 
<P> 
By most accounts, the dramatic increase in drug-enforcement efforts 
over the past few years has had little effect on the illicit drug 
market in the United States. The mere existence of drug-prohibition 
laws, combined with a minimal level of law-enforcement resources, 
is sufficient to maintain the price of illicit drugs at a level 
significantly higher than it would be if there were no such laws. 
Drug laws and enforcement also reduce the availability of illicit 
drugs, most notably in parts of the United States where demand 
is relatively limited to begin with. Theoretically, increases 
in drug-enforcement efforts should result in reduced availability, 
higher prices, and lower purity of illegal drugs. That is, in 
fact, what has happened to the domestic marijuana market (in at 
least the first two respects). But in general the illegal drug 
market has not responded as intended to the substantial increases 
in federal, state, and local drug-enforcement efforts. 
<P> 
Cocaine has sold for about a hundred dollars a gram at the retail 
level since the beginning of the 1980s. The average purity of 
that gram, however, has increased from 12 to 60 percent. Moreover, 
a growing number of users are turning to &quot;crack,&quot; a 
potent derivative of cocaine that can be smoked; it is widely 
sold in ghetto neighborhoods now for five to ten dollars per vial. 
Needless to say, both crack and the 60 percent pure cocaine pose 
much greater threats to users than did the relatively benign powder 
available eight years ago. Similarly, the retail price of heroin 
has remained relatively constant even as the average purity has 
risen from 3.9 percent in 1983 to 6.1 percent in 1986. Throughout 
the southwestern part of the United States, a particularly potent 
form of heroin known as &quot;black tar&quot; has become increasingly 
prevalent. And in many cities, a powerful synthetic opiate, Dilaudid, 
is beginning to compete with heroin as the preferred opiate. The 
growing number of heroin-related hospital emergencies and deaths 
is directly related to these developments. 
<P> 
All of these trends suggest that drug-enforcement efforts are 
not succeeding and may even be backfiring. There are numerous 
indications, for instance, that a growing number of marijuana 
dealers in both the producer countries and the United States are 
switching to cocaine dealing, motivated both by the promise of 
greater profits by government drug-enforcement efforts that place 
a premium minimizing the bulk of the illicit product (in order 
to avoid detection). It is possible, of course, that some of these 
trends would be even more severe in the absence of drug laws and 
enforcement. At the same time, it is worth observing that the 
increases in the potency of illegal drugs have coincided with 
decreases in the potency of legal substances. Motivated in good 
part by health concerns, cigarette smokers are turning increasingly 
to lower-tar and -nicotine tobacco products, alcohol drinkers 
from hard liquor to wine and beer, and even coffee drinkers from 
regular to decaffeinated coffee. This trend may well have less 
to do with the nature of substances than with their legal status. 
It is quite possible, for instance, that the subculture of illicit-drug 
use creates a bias or incentive in favor of riskier behavior and 
more powerful psychoactive effects. If this is the case, legalization 
might well succeed in reversing today's trend toward more potent 
drugs and more dangerous methods of consumption. 
<P> 
The most &quot;successful&quot; drug-enforcement operations are 
those that succeed in identifying and destroying an entire drug-trafficking 
organization. Such operations can send dozens of people to jail 
and earn the government millions of dollars in asset forfeitures. 
Yet these operations have virtually no effect on the availability 
or price of illegal drugs throughout much of the United States. 
During the past years, some urban police departments have devoted 
significant power and financial resources to intensive crackdowns 
on street drug dealing in particular neighborhoods. Code-named 
Open Pressure Point, Operation Clean Sweep, and so on, these massive 
police efforts have led to hundreds, even thousands, of arrests 
of low-level dealers and drug users, and have helped improve the 
quality of life in the targeted neighborhoods. In most cases, 
however, drug dealers have adapted relatively easily by moving 
their operations to nearby neighborhoods. In the final analysis, 
the principal accomplishment of most domestic drug-enforcement 
efforts is not to reduce the supply or availability of illegal 
drugs, or even to raise their price; it is to punish the drug 
dealers who are apprehended, and cause minor disruptions in established 
drug markets. <HR>

<P> 
Many drug-enforcement officials and urban leaders recognize the 
futility of domestic drug-enforcement efforts and place their 
hopes in international control efforts. Yet these too are doomed 
to fail-for numerous reasons. First, marijuana and opium can be 
grown almost anywhere, and the coca plant, from which cocaine 
is derived, is increasingly being cultivated successfully in areas 
that were once considered inhospitable environments. Wherever 
drug eradication efforts succeed, other regions and countries 
are quick to fill the void; for example, Colombian marijuana growers 
rapidly expanded production following successful eradication efforts 
in Mexico during the mid-1970s. Today, Mexican growers are rapidly 
taking advantage of recent Colombian government successes in eradicating 
marijuana in the Guajira peninsula. Meanwhile, Jamaicans and Central 
Americans from Panama to Belize, as well as a growing assortment 
of Asians and Africans, do what they can to sell their own marijuana 
in American markets. And within the United States, domestic marijuana 
production is believed to be a multi-billion-dollar industry, 
supplying between 15 and 50 percent of the American market. 
<P> 
This push-down/pop-up factor also characterizes the international 
heroin market. At various points during the past two decades, 
Turkey, Mexico, Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand, and Laos), and 
Southwest Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran) have each served 
as the principal source of heroin imported into the United States. 
During the early 1970s, Mexican producers rapidly filled the void 
created by the Turkish government's successful opium-control measures. 
Although a successful eradication program during the latter part 
of the 1970s reduced Mexico's share of the U.S. market from a 
peak of 87 percent in 1975, it has since retained at least a one-third 
share in each year. Southwest Asian producers, who had played 
no role in supplying the American market as late as 1976, were 
able to supply over half the American market four years later. 
Today, increasing evidence indicates that drug traffickers are 
bringing unprecedented quantities of Southeast Asian heroin into 
the United States. 
<P> 
So far, the push-down/pop-up factor has played little role in 
the international cocaine market, for the simple reason that no 
government has yet pushed down in a significant way. Unlike marijuana, 
opium-eradication efforts, in which aerial spraying of herbicides 
plays a prominent role, coca-eradication efforts are still conducted 
manually. The long anticipated development and approval of an 
environmentally safe herbicide to destroy coca plants may produce 
an unprecedented push-down factor into the market. But even in 
the absence of such government pressures, coca growing has expanded 
rapidly during the past decade within Bolivia and Peru, and has 
expanded outward into Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, and 
elsewhere. Moreover, once eradication efforts do begin, coca growers 
can be expected to adopt many of the same &quot;guerrilla farming&quot; 
methods adopted by marijuana and opium growers to camouflage and 
protect their crops from eradication efforts. 
<P> 
Beyond the push-down/pop-up factor, international source-control 
efforts face a variety of other obstacles. In many countries, 
governments with limited resources lack the ability to crack down 
drug production in the hinterlands and other poorly policed regions. 
In some countries, ranging from Colombia and Peru to Burma and 
Thailand, leftist insurgencies are involved in drug production 
for either financial or political profit, and may play an important 
role in hampering government drug-control efforts. With respect 
to all three of the illicit crops, poor peasants with no comparable 
opportunities to earn as much money growing legitimate produce 
are prominently involved in the illicit business. In some cases, 
the illicit crop is part of a traditional, indigenous culture. 
Even where it is not, peasants typically perceive little or nothing 
immoral about taking advantage of the opportunity to grow the 
illicit crops. Indeed, from their perspective their moral obligation 
is not to protect the foolish American consumer of their produce 
but to provide for their families' welfare. And even among those 
who do perceive participation in the illicit drug market as somewhat 
unethical, the temptations held out by the drug traffickers often 
prove overwhelming. 
<P> 
No illicit drug is as difficult to keep out of the United States 
as heroin. The absence of geographical limitations on where it 
can be cultivated is just one minor obstacle. American heroin 
users consume an estimated six tons of heroin each year. The sixty 
tons of opium required to produce that heroin represent just 2-3 
percent of the estimated 2-3,000 tons of illicit opium produced 
during each of the past few years. Even if eradication efforts 
combined with what often proves to be the opium growers' principal 
nemesis-bad weather-were to eliminate three-fourths of that production 
in one year, the U.S. market would still require just 10 percent 
of the remaining crop. Since U.S. consumers are able and willing 
to pay more than any others, the chances are good that they would 
still obtain their heroin. In any event, the prospects for such 
a radical reduction in illicit opium production are scanty indeed. 
<P> 
As Peter Reuter argues elsewhere in these pages, interdiction, 
like source control, is largely unable to keep illicit drugs out 
of the United States. Moreover, the past twenty years' experience 
has demonstrated that even dramatic increases in interdiction 
and source-control efforts have little or no effect on the price 
and purity of drugs. The few small successes, such as the destruction 
of the Turkish-opium &quot;French Connection&quot; in the early 
1970s, and the crackdown on Mexican marijuana and heroin in the 
late 1970s, were exceptions to the rule. The elusive goal of international 
drug control since then has been to replicate those unusual successes. 
It is a strategy that is destined to fail, however, as long as 
millions of Americans continue to demand the illicit substances 
that foreigners are willing and able to supply. <HR>

<P> 
From <A HREF="interest.html">The Case for Legalization</A><HR> 
 
<P> 
The fact that drug-prohibition laws and policies cannot eradicate 
or even significantly reduce drug abuse is not necessarily a reason 
to repeal them. They do, after all, succeed in deterring many 
people from trying drugs, and they clearly reduce the availability 
and significantly increase the price of illegal drugs. These accomplishments 
alone might warrant retaining the drug laws, were it not for the 
fact that these same laws are also responsible for much of what 
Americans identify as the &quot;drug problem.&quot; Here the analogies 
to alcohol and tobacco are worth noting. There is little question 
that we could reduce the health costs associated with use and 
abuse of alcohol and tobacco if we were to criminalize their production, 
sale, and possession. But no one believes that we could eliminate 
their use and abuse, that we could create an &quot;alcohol-free&quot; 
or &quot;tobacco-free&quot; country. Nor do most Americans believe 
that criminalizing the alcohol and tobacco markets would be a 
good idea. Their opposition stems largely from two beliefs: that 
adult Americans have the right to choose what substances they 
will consume and what risks they will take; and that the costs 
of trying to coerce so many Americans to abstain from those substances 
would be enormous. It was the strength of these two beliefs that 
ultimately led to the repeal of Prohibition, and it is partly 
due to memories of that experience that criminalizing either alcohol 
or tobacco has little support today. 
<P> 
Consider the potential consequences of criminalizing the production, 
sale, and possession of all tobacco products. On the positive 
side, the number of people smoking tobacco would almost certainly 
decline, as would the health costs associated with tobacco consumption. 
Although the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; syndrome would attract 
some people to cigarette smoking who would not otherwise have 
smoked, many more would likely be deterred by the criminal sanction, 
the moral standing of the law, the higher cost and unreliable 
quality of the illicit tobacco, and the difficulties involved 
in acquiring it. Non-smokers would rarely if ever be bothered 
by the irritating habits of their fellow citizens. The anti-tobacco 
laws would discourage some people from ever starting to smoke, 
and would induce others to quit. 
<P> 
On the negative side, however, millions of Americans, including 
both tobacco addicts and recreational users, would no doubt defy 
the law, generating a massive underground market and billions 
in profits for organized criminals. Although some tobacco farmers 
would find other work, thousands more would become outlaws and 
continue to produce their crops covertly. Throughout Latin America, 
farmers and gangsters would rejoice at the opportunity to earn 
untold sums of gringo greenbacks, even as U.S. diplomats pressured 
foreign governments to cooperate with U.S. laws. Within the United 
States, government helicopters would spray herbicides on illicit 
tobacco fields; people would be rewarded by the government for 
informing on their tobacco-growing, -selling, and -smoking neighbors; 
urine tests would be employed to identify violators of the anti-tobacco 
laws; and a Tobacco Enforcement Administration (the T.E.A.) would 
employ undercover agents, informants, and wiretaps to uncover 
tobacco-law violators. Municipal, state, and federal judicial 
systems would be clogged with tobacco traffickers and &quot;abusers.&quot; 
&quot;Tobacco-related murders&quot; would increase dramatically 
as criminal organizations competed with one another for turf and 
markets. Smoking would become an act of youthful rebellion, and 
no doubt some users would begin to experiment with more concentrated, 
potent, and dangerous forms of tobacco. Tobacco-related corruption 
would infect all levels of government, and respect for the law 
would decline noticeably. Government expenditures on tobacco-law 
enforcement would climb rapidly into the billions of dollars, 
even as budget balancers longingly recalled the almost ten billion 
dollars per year in tobacco taxes earned by the federal and state 
governments prior to prohibition. Finally, the State of North 
Carolina might even secede again from the Union. 
<P> 
This seemingly far-fetched tobacco-prohibition scenario is little 
more than an extrapolation based on the current situation with 
respect to marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. In many ways, our predicament 
resembles what actually happened during Prohibition. Prior to 
Prohibition, most Americans hoped that alcohol could be effectively 
banned by passing laws against its production and supply. During 
the early years of Prohibition, when drinking declined but millions 
of Americans nonetheless continued to drink, Prohibition's supporters 
placed their faith in tougher laws and more police and jails. 
After a few more years, however, increasing numbers of Americans 
began to realize that laws and policemen were unable to eliminate 
the smugglers, bootleggers, and illicit producers, as long as 
tens of millions of Americans continued to want to buy alcohol. 
At the same time, they saw that more laws and policemen seemed 
to generate more violence and corruption, more crowded courts 
and jails, wider disrespect for government and the law, and more 
power and profits for the gangsters. Repeal of Prohibition came 
to be seen not as a capitulation to A1 Capone and his ilk, but 
as a means of both putting the bootleggers out of business and 
eliminating most of the costs associated with the prohibition 
laws. 
<P> 
Today, Americans are faced with a dilemma similar to that confronted 
by our forebears sixty years ago. Demand for illicit drugs shows 
some signs of abating, but no signs of declining significantly. 
Moreover, there are substantial reasons to doubt that tougher 
laws and policing have played an important role in reducing consumption. 
Supply, meanwhile, has not abated at all. Availability of illicit 
drugs, except for marijuana in some locales, remains high. Prices 
are dropping, even as potency increases. And the number of drug 
producers, smugglers, and dealers remains sizable, even as jails 
and prisons fill to overflowing. As was the case during Prohibition, 
the principal beneficiaries of current drug policies are the new 
and old organized-crime gangs. The principal victims, on the other 
hand, are not the drug dealers, but the tens of millions of Americans 
who are worse off in one way or another as a consequence of the 
existence and failure of the drug-prohibition laws. 
<P> 
All public policies create beneficiaries and victims, both intended 
and unintended. When a public policy results in a disproportionate 
magnitude of unintended victims, there is good reason to reevaluate 
the assumptions and design of the policy. In the case of drug 
prohibition policies, the intended beneficiaries are those individuals 
who would become drug abusers but for the existence and enforcement 
of the drug laws. The intended victims are those who traffic in 
rugs and suffer the legal consequences. The unintended beneficiaries' 
conversely, are the drug producers and traffickers who profit 
handsomely from the illegality of the market, while avoiding arrest 
by the authorities and the violence perpetrated by criminals. 
The unintended victims of drug prohibition policies are rarely 
recognized as such, however. Viewed narrowly, they are the 30 
million Americans who use illegal drugs, thereby risking loss 
of their jobs, imprisonment, and the damage done to health by 
ingesting illegally produced drugs; viewed broadly, they are all 
Americans, who pay the substantial costs of our present ill-considered 
policies, both as taxpayers and as the potential victims of crime. 
These unintended victims are generally thought to be victimized 
by the unintended beneficiaries (i.e., the drug dealers), when 
in fact it is the drug-prohibition policies themselves that are 
primarily responsible for their plight. 
<P> 
If law-enforcement efforts could succeed in significantly reducing 
either the supply of illicit drugs or the demand for them, we 
would probably have little need to seek alternative drug-control 
policies. But since those efforts have repeatedly failed to make 
much of a difference and show little indication of working better 
in the future, at this point we must focus greater attention on 
their costs. Unlike the demand and supply of illicit drugs, which 
have remained relatively indifferent to legislative initiatives, 
the costs of drug-enforcement measures can be affected-quite dramatically-by 
legislative measures. What tougher criminal sanctions and more 
police have failed to accomplish, in terms of reducing drug-related 
violence, corruption, death, and social decay, may well be better 
accomplished by legislative repeal of the drug laws, and adoption 
of less punitive but more effective measures to prevent and treat 
substance abuse.<HR>

<P> 
Perhaps the most paradoxical consequence of the drug laws is tremendous 
harm they cause to the millions of drug users who not been deterred 
from using illicit drugs in the first place. Nothing resembling 
an underground Food and Drug Administration arisen to impose quality 
control on the illegal-drug market provide users with accurate 
information on the drugs they consume. Imagine that Americans 
could not tell whether a bottle of wine contained 6 percent, 30 
percent, or 90 percent alcohol, whether or an aspirin tablet contained 
5 or 500 grams of aspirin. Imagine, too, that no controls existed 
to prevent winemakers from selling their product with methanol 
and other dangerous impurities that vineyards and tobacco fields 
were fertilized with harmful substances by ignorant growers and 
sprayed with poisonous herbicides by government agents. Fewer 
people would use such substances, but more of those who did would 
get sick. Some would die. 
<P> 
The above scenario describes, of course, the current state of 
the illicit drug market. Many marijuana smokers are worse off 
for having smoked cannabis that was grown with dangerous fertilizers, 
sprayed with the herbicide paraquat, or mixed with more dangerous 
substances. Consumers of heroin and the various synthetic substances 
sold on the street face even severer consequences, including fatal 
overdoses and poisonings from unexpectedly potent or impure drug 
supplies. More often than not, the quality of a drug addict's 
life depends greatly upon his or her access to reliable supplies. 
Drug-enforcement operations that succeed in temporarily disrupting 
supply networks are thus a double-edged sword: they encourage 
some addicts to seek admission into drug-treatment programs, but 
they oblige others to seek out new and hence less reliable suppliers; 
the result is that more, not fewer, drug-related emergencies and 
deaths occur. 
<P> 
Today, over 50 percent of all people with AIDS in New York City, 
New Jersey, and many other parts of the country, as well as the 
vast majority of AIDS-infected heterosexuals throughout the country, 
have contracted the disease directly or indirectly through illegal 
intravenous drug use. Reports have emerged of drug dealers beginning 
to provide clean syringes together with their illegal drugs. But 
even as other governments around the world actively attempt to 
limit the spread of AIDS by and among drug users by instituting 
free syringe-exchange programs, state and municipal governments 
in the United States resist following suit, arguing that to do 
so would &quot;encourage&quot; or &quot;condone&quot; the use 
of illegal drugs. Only in January 1988 did New York City approve 
such a program on a very limited and experimental basis. At the 
same time, drug treatment programs remain notoriously underfunded, 
turning away tens of thousands of addicts seeking help, even as 
billions of dollars more are spent to arrest, prosecute, and imprison 
illegal drug sellers and users. In what may represent a sign of 
shifting priorities, the President's Commission on AIDS, in its 
March 1988 report, emphasized the importance of making drug-treatment 
programs available to all in need of them. In all likelihood, 
however, the criminaljustice agencies will continue to receive 
the greatest share of drug control funds. 
<P> 
Most Americans perceive the drug problem as a moral issue and 
draw a moral distinction between use of the illicit drugs and 
use of alcohol and tobacco. Yet when one subjects this distinction 
to reasonable analysis, it quickly disintegrates. The most consistent 
moral perspective of those who favor drug laws is that of the 
Mormons and Puritans, who regard as immoral any intake of substances 
to alter one's state of consciousness or otherwise cause pleasure: 
they not only the illicit drugs and alcohol, but also tobacco, 
caffeine, even chocolate. The vast majority of Americans are so 
consistent with respect to the propriety of their pleasures. Yet 
once one acknowledges that there is nothing immoral about drinking 
alcohol or smoking tobacco for non-medicinal purposes, it is difficult 
to condemn the consumption of marijuana, cocaine, and other substances 
on moral grounds. The &quot;moral&quot; condemnation of some substances 
and not others proves to be little more than a prejudice in favor 
of some drugs and against others. 
<P> 
The same false distinction is drawn with respect to those who 
propsychoactive substances to users and abusers alike. If degrees 
orality were measured by the levels of harm caused by one's products, 
the &quot;traffickers&quot; in tobacco and alcohol would be vilified 
as the evil of all substance purveyors. That they are perceived 
as respected members of our community, while providers of more 
dangerous illicit substances are punished with long prison sentences, 
says much about the prejudices of most Americans with respect 
to psychoactive substances, but little about the morality or immorality 
of their activities. 
<P> 
Much of the same is true of gun salesmen. Most of the consumers 
of products use them safely; a minority, however, end up shooting 
themselves or someone else. Can we hold the gun salesman morally 
culpable for the harm that probably would not have occurred but 
for his existence? Most people say no, except perhaps the salesman 
clearly knew that his product would be used to commit a crime. 
Yet in the case of those who sell illicit substances to willing 
customers, the providers are deemed not only legally guilty but 
also morally reprehensible. The law does not require any demonstration 
that the dealer knew of a specific harm to follow; indeed, it 
does not require any evidence at all of harm having resulted from 
the sale. Rather, the law is predicated on the assumption that 
harm will inevitably follow. Despite the patent falsity of that 
assumption, it persist as the underlying justification for the 
drug laws. 
<P> 
Although a valid moral distinction cannot be drawn between the 
licit and the illicit psychoactive substances, one can point to 
a different kind of moral justification for the drug laws: they 
arguably reflect paternalistic obligation to protect those in 
danger of succumbing to their own weaknesses. If drugs were legally 
available, most people would either abstain from using them or 
would use them responsibly and in moderation. A minority without 
self-restraint, however, would end up harming themselves if the 
substances were more readily available. Therefore, the majority 
has a moral obligation to deny itself legal access to certain 
substances because of the plight of the minority. This obligation 
is presumably greatest when children are included among the minority. 
<P> 
At least in principle, this argument seems to provide the strongest 
moral justification for the drug laws. But ultimately the moral 
quality of laws must be judged not by how those laws are intended 
to work in principle, but by how they function in practice. When 
laws intended to serve a moral end inflict great damage on innocent 
parties, we must rethink our moral position. 
<P> 
Because drug-law violations do not create victims with an interest 
in notifying the police, drug-enforcement agents rely heavily 
on undercover operations, electronic surveillance, and information 
provided by informants. These techniques are indispensable to 
effective law enforcement, but they are also among the least palatable 
investigative methods employed by the police. The same is true 
of drug testing: it may be useful and even necessary for determining 
liability in accidents, but it also threatens and undermines the 
right of privacy to which many Americans believe they are entitled. 
There are good reasons for requiring that such measures be used 
sparingly. 
<P> 
Equally disturbing are the increasingly vocal calls for people 
to inform not only on drug dealers but also on neighbors, friends, 
and even family members who use illicit drugs. Government calls 
on people not only to &quot;just say no,&quot; but also to report 
those who have not heeded the message. Intolerance of illicit-drug 
use and users is heralded not only as an indispensable ingredient 
in the war against drugs, but also as a mark of good citizenship. 
Certainly every society requires citizens to assist in the enforcement 
of criminal laws. But societies-particularly democratic and pluralistic 
ones-also rely strongly on an ethic of tolerance toward those 
who are different but do no harm to others. Overzealous enforcement 
of the drug laws risks undermining that ethic, and encouraging 
the creation of a society of informants. This results in an immorality 
that is far more dangerous in its own way than that associated 
with the use of illicit drugs.<HR>

<P>   
Repealing the drug-prohibition laws promises tremendous advantages.   
Between reduced government expenditures on enforcing drug laws   
and new tax revenue from legal drug production and sales, public   
treasuries would enjoy a net benefit of at least ten billion dollars   
year, and possibly much more. The quality of urban life would   
rise significantly. Homicide rates would decline. So would robbery   
and burglary rates. Organized criminal groups, particularly newer   
ones that have yet to diversify out of drugs, would be dealt a   
devastating setback. The police, prosecutors, and courts would   
focus their resources on combating the types of crimes that we   
cannot walk away from. More ghetto residents would turn their   
backs on criminal careers and seek out legitimate opportunities   
instead. And the health and quality of life of many drug users   
- and drug abusers - would improve significantly.   
<P>   
All the benefits of legalization would be for naught, however,   
if millions more Americans were to become drug abusers. Our experience   
with alcohol and tobacco provides ample warnings. Today, alcohol   
is consumed by 140 million Americans and tobacco by 50 million.   
All of the health costs associated with abuse of the illicit drugs   
pale in comparison with those resulting from tobacco and alcohol   
abuse. In 1986, for example, alcohol was identified as a contributing   
factor in 10 percent of work-related injuries, 40 percent of the   
suicide attempts, and about 40 percent of the approximately 46,000   
annual traffic deaths in 1983. An estimated eighteen million Americans   
are reported to be either alcoholics or alcohol abusers. The cost   
of alcohol abuse to American society is estimated at over 100   
billion dollars annually. Alcohol has been identified as the direct   
cause of 80,000 to 100,000 deaths annually, and as a contributing   
factor in an additional 100,000 deaths. The health costs of tobacco   
use are of similar magnitude. In the United States alone, an estimated   
320,000 people die prematurely each year as a consequence of their   
consumption of tobacco. By comparison, the National Council on   
Alcoholism reported that only 3,562 people were known have died   
in 1985 from use of all illegal drugs combined. Even if we assume   
that thousands more deaths were related in one way or another   
to illicit drug abuse but not reported as such, we are still left   
the conclusion that all of the health costs of marijuana, and,   
and heroin combined amount to only a small fraction of those caused   
by tobacco and alcohol.   
<P>   
Most Americans are just beginning to recognize the extensive costs   
of alcohol and tobacco abuse. At the same time, they seem to believe   
that there is something fundamentally different about alcohol   
and tobacco that supports the legal distinction between those   
two substances, on the one hand, and the illicit ones, on the   
other. The most common distinction is based on the assumption   
that the illicit drugs are more dangerous than the licit ones.   
Cocaine, heroin, the various hallucinogens, and (to a lesser extent)   
marijuana are widely perceived as, in the words of the President's   
Commission on Organized Crime, &quot;inherently destructive to   
mind and body.&quot; They are also believed to be more addictive   
and more likely to cause dangerous and violent behavior than alcohol   
and tobacco. All use of illicit drugs is therefore thought to   
be abusive; in other words, the distinction between use and abuse   
of psychoactive substances that most people recognize with respect   
to alcohol is not acknowledged with respect to the illicit substances.   
Most Americans make the fallacious assumption that the government   
would not criminalize certain psychoactive substances if they   
were not in fact dangerous. They then jump to the conclusion that   
any use of those substances is a form of abuse. The government,   
in its effort to discourage people from using illicit drugs, has   
encouraged and perpetuated these misconceptions-not only in its   
rhetoric but also in its purportedly educational materials. Only   
by reading between the lines can one discern the fact that the   
vast majority of Americans who have used illicit drugs have done   
so in moderation, that relatively few have suffered negative short-term   
consequences and that few are likely to suffer long-term harm.   
<P>   
The evidence is most persuasive with respect to marijuana. U.S.   
drug-enforcement and health agencies do not even report figures   
on marijuana-related deaths, apparently because so few occur.   
Although there are good health reasons for children, pregnant   
women, and some others not to smoke marijuana, there still appears   
to be little evidence that occasional marijuana consumption does   
much harm. Certainly, it is not healthy to inhale marijuana smoke   
into one's lungs; indeed, the National Institute on Drug Abuse   
(NIDA) has declared that &quot;marijuana smoke contains more cancer-causing   
agents than is found in tobacco smoke.&quot; On the other hand,   
the number of joints smoked by all but a very small percentage   
of marijuana smokers is a tiny fraction of the twenty cigarettes   
a day smoked by the average cigarette smoker; indeed, the average   
may be closer to one or two joints a week than one or two a day.   
Note that NIDA defines a &quot;heavy&quot; marijuana smoker as   
one who consumes at least two joints &quot;daily.&quot; A heavy   
tobacco smoker, by contrast, smokes about forty cigarettes a day.   
<P>   
Nor is marijuana strongly identified as a dependence-causing substance.   
A 1982 survey of marijuana use by young adults (eighteen to twenty-five   
years old) found that 64 percent had tried marijuana at least   
once, that 42 percent had used it at least ten times, that 27   
percent had smoked in the last month. It also found that 21 percent   
had passed through a period during which they smoked &quot;frequently''   
(defined as twenty or more days per month), but that only one-third   
of those currently smoked &quot;daily&quot; and only one-fifth   
(about 4 percent of all young adults) could be described as heavy   
daily users (averaging two or more joints per day). This suggests   
that daily marijuana use is typically a phase through which people   
pass, after which their use becomes more moderate.   
<P>   
Marijuana has also been attacked as the &quot;gateway drug&quot;   
that leads people to the use of even more dangerous illegal drugs.   
It is true that people who have smoked marijuana are more likely   
than people who have not to try, use, and abuse other illicit   
substances. is also true that people who have smoked tobacco or   
drunk alcohol more likely than those who have not to experiment   
with illicit drugs and to become substance abusers. The reasons   
are obvious enough. Familiarity with smoking cigarettes, for instance,   
removes one of the major barriers to smoking marijuana, which   
is the experience of inhaling smoke into one's lungs. Similarly,   
familiarity with ring one's state of consciousness by consuming   
psychoactive stances such as alcohol or marijuana decreases the   
fear and increases the curiosity regarding other substances and   
&quot;highs.&quot; But the evidence also indicates that there   
is nothing inevitable about the process. The great majority of   
people who have smoked marijuana do not become substance abusers   
of either legal or illegal substances. At the same time, it is   
certainly true that many of those who do become substance abusers   
after using marijuana would have become abusers even if they had   
never smoked a joint in their life.<HR>

<P> 
The dangers associated with cocaine, heroin, the hallucinogens, 
and other illicit substances are greater than those posed by marijuana, 
but not nearly so great as many people seem to think. Consider 
the case of cocaine. In 1986 NIDA reported that over 20 million 
Americans had tried cocaine, that 12.2 million had consumed it 
at least once during 1985, and that nearly 5.8 million had used 
it with the past month. Among those between the ages of eighteen 
and twenty-five, 8.2 million had tried cocaine, 5.3 million had 
used it within the past year, 2.5 million had used it within the 
past month, and 250,000 had used it weekly. Extrapolation might 
suggest that a quarter of a million young Americans are potential 
problem users. But one could also conclude that only 3 percent 
of those between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five who had 
ever tried the drug fell into that category, and that only 10 
percent of those who had used cocaine monthly were at risk. (The 
NIDA survey did not, it should be noted, include people residing 
in military or student dormitories, prison inmates, or the homeless.) 
<P> 
All of this is not to deny that cocaine is a potentially dangerous 
drug, especially when it is injected, smoked in the form of crack, 
or consumed in tandem with other powerful substances. Clearly, 
tens of thousands of Americans have suffered severely from their 
abuse of cocaine, and a tiny fraction have died. But there is 
also overwhelming evidence that most users of cocaine do not get 
into trouble with the drug. So much of the media attention has 
focused on the small percentage of cocaine users who become addicted 
that the popular perception of how most people use cocaine has 
become badly distorted. In one survey of high school seniors' 
drug use, the researchers questioned recent cocaine users, asking 
whether they had ever tried to stop using cocaine and found that 
they couldn't. Only 3.8 percent responded affirmatively, in contrast 
to the almost 7 percent of marijuana smokers who said they had 
tried to stop and found they couldn't, and the 18 percent of cigarette 
smokers who answered similarly. Although a similar survey of adult 
users would probably reveal a higher proportion of cocaine addicts, 
evidence such as this suggests that only a small percentage of 
people who use cocaine end up having a problem with it. In this 
respect, most people differ from monkeys, who have demonstrated 
in experiments that they will starve themselves to death if provided 
with unlimited cocaine. 
<P> 
With respect to the hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybic mushrooms, 
their potential for addiction is virtually nil. The dangers arise 
primarily from using them irresponsibly on individual occasions. 
Although many of those who have used one or another of the hallucinogens 
have experienced &quot;bad trips,&quot; others have reported positive 
experiences, and very few have suffered any long-term harm. 
<P> 
Perhaps no drugs are regarded with as much horror as the opiates, 
and in particular heroin, which is a concentrated form of morphine. 
As with most drugs, heroin can be eaten, snorted, smoked, or injected. 
Most Americans, unfortunately, prefer injection. There is no question 
that heroin is potentially highly addictive, perhaps as addictive 
as nicotine. But despite the popular association of heroin use 
with the most down-and-out inhabitants of urban ghettos, heroin 
does relatively little physical harm to the human body. Consumed 
occasional or regular basis under sanitary conditions, its side 
effect, apart from addiction itself, is constipation. That is 
son why many doctors in early twentieth-century America rte addiction 
as preferable to alcoholism, and prescribed the as treatment for 
the latter when abstinence did not seem a option. 
<P> 
It is important to think about the illicit drugs in the same way 
talk about alcohol and tobacco. Like tobacco, many of the illicit 
substances are highly addictive, but can be consumed on a regular 
or decades without any demonstrable harm. Like alcohol, the substances 
can be, and are, used by most consumers in moderation, with little 
in the way of harmful effects; but like alcohol also lend themselves 
to abuse by a minority of users who become addicted or otherwise 
harm themselves or others as a consequence. And as is the case 
with both the legal substances, the active effects of the various 
illegal drugs vary greatly from one person to another. To be sure, 
the pharmacology of the substance is important, as is its purity 
and the manner in which it is needed. But much also depends upon 
not only the physiology and psychology of the consumer, but also 
his expectations regarding the drug, his social milieu, and the 
broader cultural environment - what Harvard University psychiatrist 
Norman Zinberg has called the &quot;set and setting&quot; of the 
drug. It is factors such as these that change dramatically, albeit 
in indeterminate ways, were the drugs made legally available.

<P> 
It is thus impossible to predict whether legalization would lead 
to greater levels of drug abuse, and exact costs comparable to 
that of alcohol and tobacco abuse. The lessons that can be drawn 
from other societies are mixed. China's experience with the British 
pushers of the nineteenth century, when millions became led to 
the drug, offers one worst-case scenario. The devastation many 
native American tribes by alcohol presents another. On the other 
hand, the legal availability of opium and cannabis in Asian societies 
did not result in large addict populations until recently. Indeed, 
in many countries U.S.-inspired opium bans imposed during the 
past few decades have paradoxically contributed to dramatic increases 
in heroin consumption among Asian youth. In the United States, 
the decriminalization of marijuana by about a dozen states during 
the 1970s did not lead to increases in marijuana consumption. 
In the Netherlands, which went even further in decriminalizing 
cannabis during the 1970s, consumption has actually declined significantly. 
The policy has succeeded, as the government intended, in making 
drug use boring. Finally, late nineteenth-century America was 
a society in which there were almost no drug laws or even drug 
regulations-but levels of drug use then were about what they are 
today. Drug abuse was considered a serious problem, but the criminal-justice 
system was not regarded as part of the solution. 
<P> 
There are, however, reasons to believe that none of the currently 
illicit substances would become as popular as alcohol or tobacco, 
even if they were legalized. Alcohol has long been the principal 
intoxicant in most societies, including many in which other substances 
have been legally available. Presumably, its diverse properties 
account for its popularity-it quenches thirst, goes well with 
food, and promotes appetite as well as sociability. The popularity 
of tobacco probably stems not just from its powerful addictive 
qualities, but from the fact that its psychoactive effects are 
sufficiently subtle that cigarettes can be integrated with most 
other human activities. The illicit substances do not share these 
qualities to the same extent, nor is it likely that they would 
acquire them if they were legalized. Moreover, none of the illicit 
substances can compete with alcohol's special place in American 
culture and history. 
<P> 
An additional advantage of the illicit drugs is that none of them 
appears to be as insidious as either alcohol or tobacco. Consumed 
in their more benign forms, few of the illicit substances are 
as damaging to the human body over the long term as alcohol and 
tobacco, and none is as strongly linked with violent behavior 
as alcohol. On the other hand, much of the damage caused today 
by illegal drugs stems from their consumption in particularly 
dangerous ways. There is good reason to doubt that many Americans 
would inject cocaine or heroin into their veins even if given 
the chance to do so legally. And just as the dramatic growth in 
the heroin-consuming population during the 1960s leveled off for 
reasons apparently having little to do with law enforcement, so 
we can expect a leveling-off-which may already have begun-in the 
number of people smoking crack. The logic of legalization thus 
depends upon two assumptions: that most illegal drugs are not 
so dangerous as is commonly believed; and that the drugs and methods 
of consumption that are most risky are unlikely to prove appealing 
to many people, precisely because they are so obviously dangerous. 
<P> 
Perhaps the most reassuring reason for believing that repeal of 
the drug-prohibition laws will not lead to tremendous increases 
in drug-abuse levels is the fact that we have learned something 
from our past experiences with alcohol and tobacco abuse. We now 
, for instance, that consumption taxes are an effective method 
of limiting consumption rates. We also know that restrictions 
and bans on advertising, as well as a campaign of negative advertising, 
can make a difference. The same is true of other government measures 
including restrictions on time and place of sale, prohibition 
of consumption in public places, packaging requirements, mandated 
adjustments in insurance policies, crackdowns on driving while 
under the influence, and laws holding bartenders and hosts responsible 
for the drinking of customers and guests. There is even some evidence 
that government-sponsored education programs about the dangers 
of cigarette smoking have deterred many children from beginning 
to smoke. 
<P> 
Clearly it is possible to avoid repeating the mistakes of the 
past in designing an effective plan for legalization. We know 
more about .legal drugs now than we knew about alcohol when Prohibition 
repealed, or about tobacco when the anti-tobacco laws were red 
by many states in the early years of this century. Moreover, we 
can and must avoid having effective drug-control policies undermined 
by powerful lobbies like those that now protect the interests 
of alcohol and tobacco producers. We are also in a far better 
position than we were sixty years ago to prevent organized criminals 
from finding and creating new opportunities when their most lucrative 
source of income dries up. 
<P> 
It is important to stress what legalization is not. It is not 
a capitulation to the drug dealers-but rather a means to put them 
out of business. It is not an endorsement of drug use-but rather 
a recognition of the rights of adult Americans to make their own 
choices of the fear of criminal sanctions. It is not a repudiation 
of the &quot;just say no&quot; approach-but rather an appeal to 
government to provide assistance and positive inducements, not 
criminal penalties and a repressive measures, in support of that 
approach. It is not even a call for the elimination of the criminal-justice 
system from drug regulation-but rather a proposal for the redirection 
of its efforts and attention. 
<P> 
There is no question that legalization is a risky policy, since 
it may lead to an increase in the number of people who abuse drugs. 
But that is a risk-not a certainty. At the same time, current 
drug control policies are falling and new proposals promise only 
to be more costly and more repressive. We know that repealing 
the drug prohibition laws would eliminate or greatly reduce many 
of the ills that people commonly identify as part and parcel of 
the &quot;drug problem.&quot; Yet legalization is repeatedly and 
vociferously dismissed, without any attempt to evaluate it openly 
and objectively. The past twenty years have demonstrated that 
a drug policy shaped by exaggerated rhetoric designed to arouse 
fear has only led to our current disaster. Unless we are willing 
to honestly evaluate our options, including various legalization 
strategies, we will run a still greater risk: we may never find 
the best solution for our drug problems.<HR>

<p>
Dear Dr. Varmus:
<p>
We are writing to urge you to immediately cancel the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding 
of a research project in Anchorage, Alaska that would randomize people who are injection drug 
users (IDUs) to receive or not receive syringes from needle exchange programs (NEPs).  Half of 
the people in the study will be actively prevented from using the NEP, even though almost all 
scientists who have conducted research in this area believe that NEPs can reduce the 
transmission of HIV and do not lead to increases in drug use.  It is simply unconscionable for the 
NIH, the nation's leading health research institution, to fund a project that so clearly violates 
basic research ethics in a manner that the researchers themselves admit in their grant proposal 
"represents the withholding of a potentially life-saving service."
<p>
The research project, which is entitled "Interventions to Reduce HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV 
(hepatitis C virus) and HIV in IDUs," is led by Dr. Dennis Fisher of the Psychology Department 
of the University of Alaska Anchorage.  The study was recently funded by the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse, one of the NIH institutes, and is now in its early stages.  The protocol has been 
approved by both the Institutional Review Board of the University of Alaska Anchorage and 
NIH's Office for Protection from Research Risks.  The project was proposed to run for three 
years at a cost of $2.7 million to the NIH.
<p>
Dr. Fisher is proposing to establish a NEP in Anchorage for the purpose of conducting research 
on the effectiveness of the programs.  NEPS, while a standard component of HIV prevention 
efforts throughout the industrialized world, are severely limited in the U.S. because of a ban on 
the use of federal funding for providing syringes even though the government can fund studies 
such as this one as long as needles and syringes are not paid for.  There are now six reviews, 
(1,2,3,4,5,6) (covering hundreds of studies) that have been funded by the federal government and 
all, including one conducted by a group led by one of us (Peter Lurie) in 1992-93 (3), concluded 
that NEPs can reduce the rate of HIV infection without increasing drug use rates. (These are the 
criteria that, according to federal legislation, must be met for the ban to be lifted.) We are 
enclosing a letter from 32 leading NEP researchers from around the world to Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala protesting her comments on needle exchange which includes a 
table describing the six reviews. <a name="back1"></a><a href="#app1"><b>(See Appendix 1.)</b></a> As you can see, all the signatories assert that 
NEPs can reduce HIV transmission rates without increasing drug use rates.  In addition, many 
major medical organizations, including the government's own Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, have endorsed NEPs as components of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV 
among IDUs. <a name="back2"></a><a href="#app2"><b>(See Appendix 2.)</b></a> (4) No such group has come out against the programs.  Indeed, 
in an effort to justify the study, the Alaska researchers were forced to cite a widely discredited 
1992 report from former Drug Czar Bob Martinez, a non-scientist with transparently political 
motivations for opposing NEPS.
<p>
It is a fundamental tenet of research ethics that when the community of experts has concluded 
that an intervention is effective in improving health outcomes, randomized trials that exclude 
many people from the benefits of the intervention are no longer ethical.  Despite the consensus 
described above, the NIH-funded researchers propose to randomize 600 IDUs to NEPs or a 
comparison condition.  If one agrees to participate in the study, one stands a 50% chance of 
being permitted to attend the NEP.  The remaining 50% of study subjects (300 people) will be 
turned away from the NEP (subjects will be issued a bar-coded identification card which can 
generate an image on the research project's computer) and will instead be given information 
about purchasing syringes from pharmacies, information many or most will already have.
<p>
The study examines whether those assigned to attend the NEP develop hepatitis B at a rate 
greater or less than those assigned to the comparison condition. (Hepatitis B is used instead of 
HIV infection as a marker of program effectiveness because HIV infection levels among IDUs in 
Anchorage are too low to be able to demonstrate program effectiveness statistically.  Thus a 
decrease in new hepatitis B infections due to an intervention is thought to represent a decrease in 
risk for HIV infection as well.) In fact, there was already evidence that NEPs decrease the risk of 
acquiring hepatitis by the time Dr. Fisher submitted his grant proposal to the NIH in December 
1995.  An article in the American Journal of Public Health in November 1995 describes a case-
control study that demonstrated a six-fold reduction in the odds of acquiring hepatitis B and a 
seven-fold reduction in the odds of acquiring hepatitis C among IDUs who had ever attended an 
NEP in comparison to IDUs who had never attended a NEP (7).
<p>
The researchers somehow believe that referrals for the pharmacy purchase of syringes represent 
an ethical alternative to the NEP condition for those not randomized to the NEP.  Abundant data 
suggests otherwise.  First, all the non-randomized controlled studies on the effect of NEPs on 
IDUs' risk behaviors implicitly compare syringe availability through NEPs with syringe 
availability through pharmacies and diverted sources.  In all studies, the reduction in the rate of 
syringe sharing, the behavior that transmits HIV infection, was as great or greater in the NEP 
group. Thus, the control group proposed by the researchers has already been demonstrated to be 
inferior.  Second, the researchers argue that the study is ethical because Alaska has no 
requirement for a medical prescription in order to purchase a syringe.  Again the data, 
conveniently excluded from their research proposal, do not support them. For example, in St. 
Louis, Missouri (a state without a syringe prescription law), an African American and a white 
research assistant each requested ten syringes from 33 pharmacies.  Eighteen percent of the 
pharmacies stated that small quantities of syringes were not available (IDUs tend to purchase 
small numbers of syringes at a time), an additional 12% refused to sell to either research assistant 
and an additional 12% refused to sell to the African American only (8).  Thus, African 
Americans were prevented from purchasing syringes in 42% of pharmacies.  In New Orleans, 
Louisiana, also a state without a prescription law, only 14.5% of pharmacists said they sold 
syringes to anyone, and many required a prescription (9).  All of this assumes that the IDU has 
the money to purchase the syringe.
<p>
From a public health perspective, it would be ideal for IDUs to have access to both NEPs and 
pharmacies.  Individual IDUs prefer different sources of syringes and maximizing the IDUs' 
choices is likely to be the most effective HIV prevention strategy.  For the researchers, however, 
this creates the problem of "crossover": IDUs assigned to the NEP may want to attend the 
pharmacy or vice versa.  Thus, the researchers go out of their way to prevent "crossover," going 
so far as to have the NEP open only when the pharmacy that accounts for most sales of syringes 
to IDUs is also open.  This stands public health common sense on its head and places people who 
are IDUs at risk for fatal infections.  NEPs should complement alternative syringe sources, not 
compete with them.  In this sense, the study is not even a reasonable test of the public health 
question it should be investigating.
<p>
The research is, therefore, unethical for at least three reasons:
<ol>
<li>If an IDU does not enroll in the study, he or she cannot use the NEP at all, thus coercing 
subjects to enroll; (10)

<li>For IDUs who enroll in the study, only 50% will be permitted to attend the NEP; the others 
will be turned away; and

<li>It is highly inappropriate to stand by and watch IDUs in both research groups contracting 
potentially fatal hepatitis B infections when an extremely effective vaccine for hepatitis B exists.  
It is difficult for us to imagine an analogous study in which babies were monitored for the 
occurrence of tetanus, while not being provided with the existing vaccine.
</ol>
<p>
Remarkably, the researchers themselves acknowledge the ethical problems presented by the 
study when they admit on page 75 of their proposal to the National Institute on Drug Abuse "the 
fact that (the non-needle exchange) condition represents the withholding of a potentially life-
saving service."  In our view, this ethical concern applies equally to the withholding of hepatitis 
B vaccine.  The parallels here to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which African-American men 
were denied penicillin treatment for syphilis for about three decades, are clear.  Although in the 
Tuskegee study known effective treatment for a life-threatening disease was withheld, in this 
human experiment, two known effective means of prevention--hepatitis B vaccine and the 
provision at no cost of sterile needles and syringes--are being withheld.
<p>
In summary, this study should not be funded unless:
<ol>
<li>All IDUs in the study are provided with hepatitis B vaccine; and

<li>All IDUs are permitted to attend the NEP; and

<li>The research project design is overhauled so that no IDUs are denied access to needle 
exchange services. (11)
</ol>
<p>
In their successful grant application for NIH funding, the Alaskan researchers appealed for 
support on the grounds that such a randomized, controlled study of the benefits of needle 
exchange programs has never been done and, later in the application, admitted to "much 
agonizing over the ethics of this project." There are excellent reasons, discussed above, why such 
a study has never been done and why one should never be done.
<p>
The study represents a classic conflict between the alleged needs of researchers and the clear 
demands of public health.  By funding this project, the NIH has allowed research to take 
precedence over public health prerogatives, with potentially catastrophic results for some IDUs 
in the study who may contract HIV or hepatitis after being turned away from the NEP.  If the 
NIH wishes to maintain its credibility as the nation's "watchdog" for unethical scientific 
practices, you will ensure that this dangerous, unethical and exploitative study is halted 
immediately and will launch an investigation into how this study passed the NIH's ethical 
review.

the study then results in the forcible denial to some study subjects of services available to 
everyone else in the community.

<li>Such a study could, for example, involve opening an NEP and following a group of IDUs 
overtime to see if those who attend the program most often are more or less likely to change 
behavior or develop HIV infection.  While this would not have the benefits of the randomized 
design, it would be ethical as all IDUs would be able to attend the NEP.  Such a study would also 
vaccinate all IDUs who are still susceptible to hepatitis B with the Hepatitis B vaccine.

Secretary Donna Shalala<br>
Department of Health and Human Services<br>
200 Independence Ave., SW<br>
Washington, DC  20201<br>
Fax: (202) 690-7208
<p>
Dear Secretary Shalala:
<p>
As needle exchange program (NEP) researchers from four continents, we write to protest your 
recent public comments regarding the efficacy of NEPs in preventing HIV infection among 
injection drug users, their sex partners and their children.  To assert, as you did in the New York 
Times on December 7, 1995, that there is "controversy over research" or that "different experts 
disagree," as you told CNN on December 5, is to grossly mischaracterize the enormous body of 
research on NEPs, much of it generated by the signatories to this letter.  As you must know, 
multiple studies have shown that NEPs can decrease HIV transmission rates without increasing 
community levels of drug use.  We therefore call on you to immediately lift the federal ban on 
NEP services.  These programs have the ability to significantly reduce HIV infections related to 
injection drug use, now estimated by HHS to be occurring at a rate of over 20,000 per year in the 
United States.
<p>
What is most notable about research in needle exchange is the astonishing unanimity among 
researchers who have looked at this issue in detail.  The attached Table summarizes the results of 
six federally funded reviews of NEP efficacy conducted between 1991 and 1995.  All six reviews 
concluded that NEPs reduce HIV transmission rates and do not increase the amount of drug use.  
Four of the six reviews recommended lifting the ban on federal funding for NEPs and revoking 
or modifying the state prescription and paraphernalia laws that limit injection drug users' access 
to sterile syringes.  The only two institutions that did not make these recommendations, the 
General Accounting Office and the Office of Technology Assessment, simply reviewed the data 
and did not make any policy recommendation, although their conclusions clearly support a 
recommendation to lift the ban.
<p>
Ironically, your statements to the press were made almost two years to the day that scientists in 
your own department recommended that the federal ban on NEPs be lifted (the fourth study in 
the Table).  On December 10, 1993, after reviewing the data on NEP efficacy in detail and 
consulting with four HHS agencies with jurisdiction over substance abuse (National Institutes for 
Health, Food and Drug Administration, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services 
Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration), the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reached the following conclusions and made the following recommendations:
<blockquote>"...these observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV transmission..."
<p>
"No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in the number of 
discarded syringes."
<p>
"We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted..."
<p>
"...we also recommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a physician's prescription 
to buy needles and syringes and the removal of criminal penallties [sic] for the possession of 
needles and syringes..."
</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, the data demonstrating NEP efficacy have become even more convincing since your 
advisors recommended lifting the ban on federal NEP funding in December 1993.  The 
September 1995 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) review (the fifth study in the Table) 
examined three unpublished studies previously mentioned by HHS in justifying its inaction on 
NEP funding.  The NAS found the (still unpublished) studies either seriously wanting or 
inconclusive and went on to recommend that the federal government fund NEPs.
<p>
Injection drug use is now the number one cause of new HIV infections in this country, and NEPs 
are therefore a critical component of any comprehensive HIV prevention strategy.  Basing your 
opposition on purported scientific concerns can no longer be justified, particularly when there are 
six federally funded studies, including one by your own staff, that endorse federal NEP funding.  
Such a mischaracterization of scientific information is particularly regrettable when coming from 
the Secretary of HHS, who has responsibility for the vast majority of medical research funded by 
the federal government.  Even if the research had not reached the consensus that it has, your own 
thoughtful comments to Dateline NBC on December 13, 1995 regarding the potential of HHS 
Public Service Announcements to induce more sexual activity among teenagers provide a more 
appropriate guideline for federal action.  "But we can't wait for a scientific breakthrough," you 
said, "or we're going to lose another generation of Americana.  It's not worth it.  I'd rather take 
all the criticism and save lives."

NATIONAL REVIEW has attempted during its tenure as, so to speak, keeper of the conservative tablets to analyze public problems and to recommend intelligent thought. The magazine has acknowledged a variety of positions by right-minded thinkers and analysts who sometimes reach conflicting conclusions about public policy.  As recently as on the question of troops to Bosnia, there was dissent within the family from our corporate conclusion that we'd be best off staying home.
<p>
For many years we have published analyses of the drug problem.  An important and frequently cited essay by Professor Michael Gazzaniga (Feb. 5, 1990) brought a scientist's discipline into the picture, shedding light on matters vital to an understanding of the drug question.  He wrote, for instance, about different rates of addiction, and about ambient pressures that bear on addiction.  Elsewhere, Professor James Q. Wilson, now of UCLA, has written eloquently in defense of the drug war.  Milton Friedman from the beginning said it would not work, and would do damage.
<p>
We have found Dr. Gazzaniga and others who have written on the subject persuasive in arguing that the weight of the evidence is against the current attempt to prohibit drugs.  But NATIONAL REVIEW has not, until now, opined formally on the subject.  We do so at this point.  To put off a declarative judgment would be morally and intellectually weak-kneed.
<p>
Things being as they are, and people as they are, there is no way to prevent somebody, somewhere, from concluding that "NATIONAL REVIEW favors drugs." We don't; we deplore their use; we urge the stiffest feasible sentences against anyone convicted of selling a drug to a minor.  But that said, it is our judgment that the war on drugs has failed, that it is diverting intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and penal procedures associated with police states.  We all agree on movement toward legalization, even though we may differ on just how far.
<p>
We are joined in our judgment by Ethan A. Nadelmann, a scholar and researcher; Kurt Schmoke, a mayor and former prosecutor; Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Robert W. Sweet, a federal judge and former prosecutor; Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist; and Steven B. Duke, a law professor.  Each has his own emphases, as one might expect.  All agree that the celebrated war has failed, and that it is time to go home, and to mobilize fresh thought on the drug problem in the context of a free society.  This symposium is our contribution to such thought.

<b>William. F. Buckley Jr.</b>
<p>
<i>Last summer WFB was asked by the New York Bar Association to make a statement to the panel of lawyers considering the question.  He made the following statement:</i>
<p>
We are speaking of a plague that consumes an estimated $75 billion per year of public money, exacts an estimated $70 billion a year from consumers, is responsible for nearly 50 per cent of the million Americans who are today in jail, occupies an estimated 50 per cent of the trial time of our judiciary, and takes the time of 400,000 policemen - yet a plague for which no cure is at hand, nor in prospect.
<p>
Perhaps you, ladies and gentlemen of the Bar, will understand it if I chronicle my own itinerary on the subject of drugs and public policy.  When I ran for mayor of New York, the political race was jocular, but the thought given to municipal problems was entirely serious, and in my paper on drugs and in my post-election book I advocated their continued embargo, but on unusual grounds.  I had read - and I think the evidence continues to affirm it - that drug-taking is a gregarious activity.  What this means, I said, is that an addict is in pursuit of company and therefore attempts to entice others to share with him his habit.  Under the circumstances, I said, it can reasonably be held that drug-taking is a contagious disease and, accordingly, subject to the conventional restrictions employed to shield the innocent from Typhoid Mary.  Some sport was made of my position by libertarians, including Professor Milton Friedman, who asked whether the police might legitimately be summoned if it were established that keeping company with me was a contagious activity.
<p>
I recall all of this in search of philosophical perspective.  Back in 1965 I sought to pay conventional deference to libertarian presumptions against outlawing any activity potentially harmful only to the person who engages in that activity.  I cited John Stuart Mill and, while at it, opined that there was no warrant for requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet.  I was seeking, and I thought I had found, a reason to override the presumption against intercession by the state.
<p>
About ten years later, I deferred to a different allegiance, this one not the presumptive opposition to state intervention, but a different order of priorities.  A conservative should evaluate the practicality of a legal constriction, as for instance in those states whose statute books continue to outlaw sodomy, which interdiction is unenforceable, making the law nothing more than print-on-paper.  I came to the conclusion that the so-called war against drugs was not working, that it would not work absent a change in the structure of the civil rights to which we are accustomed and to which we cling as a valuable part of our patrimony.  And that therefore if that war against drugs is not working, we should look into what effects the war has, a canvass of the casualties consequent on its failure to work.  That consideration encouraged me to weigh utilitarian principles: the Benthamite calculus of pain and pleasure introduced by the illegalization of drugs.
<p>
A year or so ago I thought to calculate a ratio, however roughly arrived at, toward the elaboration of which I would need to place a dollar figure on deprivations that do not lend themselves to quantification.  Yet the law, lacking any other recourse, every day countenances such quantifications, as when asking a jury to put a dollar figure on the damage done by the loss of a plaintiff's right arm, amputated by defective machinery at the factory.  My enterprise became allegorical in character - I couldn't do the arithmetic - but the model, I think, proves useful in sharpening perspectives.
<p>
Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, <i>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs</i>, and scholarly essay, "Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster," reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs.  It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug.  But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week.  There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana.  From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.  About such users one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.
<p>
Curiosity naturally flows to ask, next, How many users of illegal drugs in fact die from the use of them?  The answer is complicated in part because marijuana finds itself lumped together with cocaine and heroin, and nobody has ever been found dead from marijuana.  The question of deaths from cocaine is complicated by the factor of impurity.  It would not be useful to draw any conclusions about alcohol consumption, for instance, by observing that, in 1931, one thousand Americans died from alcohol consumption if it happened that half of those deaths, or more than half, were the result of drinking alcohol with toxic ingredients extrinsic to the drug as conventionally used.  When alcohol was illegal, the consumer could never know whether he had been given relatively harmless alcohol to drink - such alcoholic beverages as we find today in the liquor store - or whether the bootlegger had come up with paralyzing rotgut.  By the same token, purchasers of illegal cocaine and heroin cannot know whether they are consuming a drug that would qualify for regulated consumption after clinical analysis.
<p>
But we do know this, and I approach the nexus of my inquiry, which is that more people die every year as a result of the war against drugs than die from what we call, generically, overdosing.  These fatalities include, perhaps most prominently, drug merchants who compete for commercial territory, but include also people who are robbed and killed by those desperate for money to buy the drug to which they have become addicted.
<p>
This is perhaps the moment to note that the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine and heroin is approximately 2 per cent of the street price of those drugs.  Since a cocaine addict can spend as much as $1,000 per week to sustain his habit, he would need to come up with that $1,000.  The approximate fencing cost of stolen goods is 80 per cent, so that to come up with $1,000 can require stealing $5,000 worth of jewels, cars, whatever.  We can see that at free-market rates, $20 per week would provide the addict with the cocaine which, in this wartime drug situation, requires of him $1,000.
<p>
My mind turned, then, to auxiliary expenses - auxiliary pains, if you wish.  The crime rate, whatever one made of its modest curtsy last year toward diminution, continues its secular rise.  Serious crime is 480 per cent higher than in 1965.  The correlation is not absolute, but it is suggestive: crime is reduced by the number of available enforcers of law and order, namely policemen.  The heralded new crime legislation, passed last year and acclaimed by President Clinton, provides for 100,000 extra policemen, even if only for a limited amount of time.  But 400,000 policemen would be freed to pursue criminals engaged in activity other than the sale and distribution of drugs if such sale and distribution, at a price at which there was no profit, were to be done by, say, a federal drugstore.
<p>
So then we attempt to put a value on the goods stolen by addicts.  The figure arrived at by Professor Duke is $10 billion.  But we need to add to this pain of stolen property, surely, the extra-material pain suffered by victims of robbers.  If someone breaks into your house at night, perhaps holding you at gunpoint while taking your money and your jewelry and whatever, it is reasonable to assign a higher "cost" to the episode than the commercial value of the stolen money and jewelry.  If we were modest, we might reasonably, however arbitrarily, put at $1,000 the "value" of the victim's pain.  But then the hurt, the psychological trauma, might be evaluated by a jury at ten times, or one hundred times, that sum.
<p>
But we must consider other factors, not readily quantifiable, but no less tangible.  Fifty years ago, to walk at night across Central Park was no more adventurous than to walk down Fifth Avenue.  But walking across the park is no longer done, save by the kind of people who climb the Matterhorn.  Is it fair to put a value on a lost amenity?  If the Metropolitan Museum were to close, mightn't we, without fear of distortion, judge that we had been deprived of something valuable?  What value might we assign to confidence that, at night, one can sleep without fear of intrusion by criminals seeking money or goods exchangeable for drugs?
<p>
Pursuing utilitarian analysis, we ask: What are the relative costs, on the one hand, of medical and psychological treatment for addicts and, on the other, incarceration for drugs?  It transpires that treatment is seven times more cost-effective.  By this is meant that one dollar spent on the treatment of an addict reduces the probability of continued addiction seven times more than one dollar spent on incarceration.  Looked at another way: Treatment for addicts is not now available for almost half of those who would benefit from treatment.  Yet we are willing to build more and more jails in which to isolate drug users even though at one-seventh the cost of building and maintaining jail space and pursuing, detaining, and prosecuting the drug user, we could subsidize commensurately effective medical care and psychological treatment.
<p>
I have spared you, even as I spare myself, an arithmetical consummation of my inquiry, but the data here cited instruct us that the cost of the drug war is many times more painful, in all its manifestations, than would be the licensing of drugs combined with intensive education of non-users and intensive education designed to warn those who experiment with drugs.  We have seen a substantial reduction in the use of tobacco over the last thirty years, and this is not because tobacco became illegal but because a sentient community began, in substantial numbers, to apprehend the high cost of tobacco to human health, even as, we can assume, a growing number of Americans desist from practicing unsafe sex and using polluted needles in this age of AIDS.  If 80 million Americans can experiment with drugs and resist addiction using information publicly available, we can reasonably hope that approximately the same number would resist the temptation to purchase such drugs even if they were available at a federal drugstore at the mere cost of production.
<p>
And added to the above is the point of civil justice.  Those who suffer from the abuse of drugs have themselves to blame for it.  This does not mean that society is absolved from active concern for their plight.  It does mean that their plight is subordinate to the plight of those citizens who do not experiment with drugs but whose life, liberty, and property are substantially affected by the illegalization of the drugs sought after by the minority.
<p>
I have not spoken of the cost to our society of the astonishing legal weapons available now to policemen and prosecutors; of the penalty of forfeiture of one's home and property for violation of laws which, though designed to advance the war against drugs, could legally be used - I am told by learned counsel - as penalties for the neglect of one's pets.  I leave it at this, that it is outrageous to live in a society whose laws tolerate sending young people to life in prison because they grew, or distributed, a dozen ounces of marijuana.  I would hope that the good offices of your vital profession would mobilize at least to protest such excesses of wartime zeal, the legal equivalent of a My Lai massacre.  And perhaps proceed to recommend the legalization of the sale of most drugs, except to minors.

<b>Ethan A. Nadelmann</b>
<p>
<i>We turned to Mr. Nadelmann to pursue the inquiry.  Formerly in the Political Science Department at Princeton, he is now the director of the Lindesmith Center, a drug-policy research institute in New York City.  He is the author of </i>Cops across Borders: The Internationalization of U.S. Criminal Law Enforcement.
<p>
The essayists assembled here do not agree exactly on which aspect of the war on drugs is most disgraceful, or on which alternative to our current policies is most desirable, but we do agree, as Mr. Buckley expected, on the following: The "war on drugs" has failed to accomplish its stated objectives, and it cannot succeed so long as we remain a free society, bound by our Constitution.  Our prohibitionist approach to drug control is responsible for most of the ills commonly associated with America's "drug problem." And some measure of legal availability and regulation is essential if we are to reduce significantly the negative consequences of both drug use and our drug-control policies.
<p>
Proponents of the war on drugs focus on one apparent success: The substantial decline during the 1980s in the number of Americans who consume marijuana and cocaine.  Yet that decline began well before the Federal Government intensified its "war on drugs" in 1986, and it succeeded principally in reducing illicit drug use among middle-class Americans, who were least likely to develop drug-related problems.
<p>
Far more significant were the dramatic increases in drug- and prohibition-related disease, death, and crime.  Crack cocaine - as much a creature of prohibition as 180-proof moonshine during alcohol prohibition - became the drug of choice in most inner cities.  AIDS spread rapidly among injecting drug addicts, their lovers, and their children, while government policies restricted the availability of clean syringes that might have stemmed the epidemic.  And prohibition-related violence reached unprecedented levels as a new generation of Al Capones competed for turf, killing not just one another but innocent bystanders, witnesses, and law-enforcement officials.
<p>
There are several basic truths about drugs and drug policy which a growing number of Americans have come to acknowledge.
<p>
Most people can use most drugs without doing much harm to themselves or anyone else, as Mr. Buckley reminds us, citing Professor Duke.  Only a tiny percentage of the 70 million Americans who have tried marijuana have gone on to have problems with that or any other drug.  The same is true of the tens of millions of Americans who have used cocaine or hallucinogens.  Most of those who did have a problem at one time or another don't any more.  That a few million Americans have serious problems with illicit drugs today is an issue meriting responsible national attention, but it is no reason to demonize those drugs and the people who use them.
<p>
We're unlikely to evolve toward a more effective and humane drug policy unless we begin to change the ways we think about drugs and drug control.
<p>
Perspective can be had from what is truly the most pervasive drug scandal in the United States: the epidemic of undertreatment of pain.  "Addiction" to (i.e., dependence on) opiates among the terminally ill is the appropriate course of medical treatment.  The only reason for the failure to prescribe adequate doses of pain-relieving opiates is the "opiaphobia" that causes doctors to ignore the medical evidence, nurses to turn away from their patients' cries of pain, and some patients themselves to elect to suffer debilitating and demoralizing pain rather than submit to a proper dose of drugs.
<p>
The tendency to put anti-drug ideology ahead of compassionate treatment of pain is apparent in another area.  Thousands of Americans now smoke marijuana for purely medical reasons: among others, to ease the nausea of chemotherapy; to reduce the pain of multiple sclerosis; to alleviate the symptoms of glaucoma; to improve appetite dangerously reduced from AIDS.  They use it as an effective medicine, yet they are technically regarded as criminals, and every year many are jailed.  Although more than 75 per cent of Americans believe that marijuana should be available legally for medical purposes, the Federal Government refuses to legalize access or even to sponsor research.
<p>
Drugs are here to stay.  The time has come to abandon the concept of a "drug-free society." We need to focus on learning to live with drugs in such a way that they do the least possible harm.  So far as I can ascertain, the societies that have proved most successful in minimizing drug-related harm aren't those that have sought to banish drugs, but those that have figured out how to control and manage drug use through community discipline, including the establishment of powerful social norms.  That is precisely the challenge now confronting American society regarding alcohol: How do we live with a very powerful and dangerous drug - more powerful and dangerous than many illicit drugs - that, we have learned, cannot be effectively prohibited?
<p>
Virtually all Americans have used some psychoactive substance, whether caffeine or nicotine or marijuana.  In many cases, the use of cocaine and heroin represents a form of self-medication against physical and emotional pain among people who do not have access to psychotherapy or Prozac.  The market in illicit drugs is as great as it is in the inner cities because palliatives for pain and depression are harder to come by and because there are fewer economic opportunities that can compete with the profits of violating prohibition.
<p>
Prohibition is no way to run a drug policy.  We learned that with alcohol during the first third of this century and we're probably wise enough as a society not to try to repeat the mistake with nicotine.  Prohibitions for kids make sense.  It's reasonable to prohibit drug-related misbehavior that endangers others, such as driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs, or smoking in enclosed spaces.  But whatever its benefits in deterring some Americans from becoming drug abusers, America's indiscriminate drug prohibition is responsible for too much crime, disease, and death to qualify as sensible policy.
<p>
There is a wide range of choice in drug-policy options between the free-market approach favored by Milton Friedman and Thomas Szasz, and the zero-tolerance approach of William Bennett.  These options fall under the concept of harm reduction.  That concept holds that drug policies need to focus on reducing crime, whether engendered by drugs or by the prohibition of drugs.  And it holds that disease and death can be diminished even among people who can't, or won't, stop taking drugs.  This pragmatic approach is followed in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, and parts of Germany, Austria, Britain, and a growing number of other countries.
<p>
American drug warriors like to denigrate the Dutch, but the fact remains that Dutch drug policy has been dramatically more successful than U.S. drug policy.  The average age of heroin addicts in the Netherlands has been increasing for almost a decade; HIV rates among addicts are dramatically lower than in the United States; police don't waste resources on non-disruptive drug use but, rather, focus on major dealers or petty dealers who create public nuisances.  The decriminalized cannabis markets are regulated in a quasi-legal fashion far more effective and inexpensive than the U.S. equivalent.
<p>
The Swiss have embarked on a national experiment of prescribing heroin to addicts.  The two-year-old plan, begun in Zurich, is designed to determine whether they can reduce drug- and prohibition-related crime, disease, and death by making pharmaceutical heroin legally available to addicts at regulated clinics.  The results of the experiment have been sufficiently encouraging that it is being extended to over a dozen Swiss cities.  Similar experiments are being initiated by the Dutch and Australians.  There are no good scientific or ethical reasons not to try a heroin-prescription experiment in the United States.
<p>
Our Federal Government puts politics over science by ignoring extensive scientific evidence that sterile syringes can reduce the spread of AIDS.  Connecticut permitted needle sales in drugstores in 1992, and the policy resulted in a 40 per cent decrease in needle sharing among injecting drug users, at no cost to taxpayers.
<p>
We see similar foolishness when it comes to methadone.  Methadone is to street heroin more or less what nicotine chewing-gum and skin patches are to cigarettes.  Hundreds of studies, as well as a National Academy of Sciences report last year, have concluded that methadone is more effective than any other treatment in reducing heroin-related crime, disease, and death.  In Australia and much of Europe, addicts who want to reduce or quit their heroin use can obtain a prescription for methadone from a GP and fill the prescription at a local pharmacy.  In the United States, by contrast, methadone is available only at highly regulated and expensive clinics.
<p>
A warning of the prohibitionists is that there's no going back once we reverse course and legalize drugs.  But what the reforms in Europe and Australia demonstrate is that our choices are not all or nothing.  Virtually all the steps described above represent modest and relatively low-risk initiatives to reduce drug and prohibition-related harms within our current prohibition regime.  At the same time, these steps are helpful in thinking through the consequences of more far-reaching drug policy reform.  You don't need to go for formal legalization to embark on numerous reforms that would yield great dividends.  But these run into opiaphobia.
<p>
The blame is widespread.  Cowardly Presidents, unwilling to assume leadership for reform.  A Congress so concerned with appearing tough on crime that it is unwilling to analyze alternative approaches.  A drug czar who debases public debate by equating legalization with genocide.  A drug enforcement/treatment complex so hooked on government dollars that the anti-drug crusade has become a vested interest.
<p>
But perhaps the worst offender is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration - not so much the agents who risk their lives trying to apprehend major drug traffickers as the ideologically driven bureaucrats who intimidate and persecute doctors for prescribing pain medication in medically appropriate (but legally suspicious) doses, who hobble methadone programs with their overregulation, who acknowledge that law enforcement alone cannot solve the drug problem but then proceed to undermine innovative public-health initiatives.
<p>
I am often baffled by the resistance of conservatives to drug-policy, reform, but encouraged by the willingness of many to reassess their views once they have heard the evidence.  Conservatives who oppose the expansion of federal power cannot look approvingly on the growth of the federal drug-enforcement bureaucracy and federal efforts to coerce states into adopting federally formulated drug policies.  Those who focus on the victimization of Americans by predatory criminals can hardly support our massive diversion of law-enforcement resources to apprehending and imprisoning nonviolent vice merchants and consumers.  Those concerned with overregulation can hardly countenance our current handling of methadone, our refusal to allow over-the-counter sale of sterile syringes, our prohibition of medical marijuana.  And conservatives who turn to the Bible for guidance on current affairs can find little justification there for our "war on drugs" and the people who use and sell them.

But even if he is lonely, he is not hopeless on the question of democratic political enlightenment.  Mr. Schmoke was first elected mayor in 1987.  He is a graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar.</i>
<p>
Serious problems require serious minds.  That may help explain why William F. Buckley Jr. was one of the first public figures to acknowledge that the war on drugs is a failure.  I don't know how Mr. Buckley's early apostasy about the war on drugs was greeted by his conservative colleagues - although it's not hard to guess - but I remember the reaction in 1988 to my own call for a national debate on that war.  A leading congressional liberal called me the most dangerous man in America.  A national magazine referred to me as "a nice young man who had a bright future." Many of my political supporters encouraged me to drop the subject and stick to potholes.
<p>
Potholes are important, but, as Mr. Buckley argued to the New York Bar Association, dropping the subject of the war on drugs means dropping any hope of solving some of America's most difficult social problems.  The war on drugs isn't a solution in search of a problem.  It's a problem in search of a solution.
<p>
How big a problem?  Very big.  As Mr. Buckley points out, "More people die every year as a result of the war on drugs than die from what we call, generically, overdosing." He is similarly correct in noting that blanket prohibition is a major source of crime: it inflates the price of drugs, inviting new criminals to enter the trade; reduces the number of police officers available to investigate violent crime; fosters adulterated, even poisonous, drugs; and contributes significantly to the transmission of HIV.  These are not problems that are merely tangential to the war on drugs.  These are problems caused, or made substantially worse, by the war on drugs.
<p>
That is why I have long advocated that the war on drugs be fought as a public-health war.  This is sometimes called medicalization, or regulated distribution.  Under this alternative to the war on drugs, the government would set up a regulatory regime to pull addicts into the public-health system.  The government, not criminal traffickers, would control the price, distribution, and purity of addictive substances - which it already does with prescription drugs.  This would take most of the profit out of drug trafficking, and it is profits that drive the crime.  Addicts would be treated - and if necessary maintained - under medical auspices.  Children would find it harder, not easier, to get their hands on drugs.  And law enforcement would be able to concentrate on the highest echelons of drug-trafficking enterprises.
<p>
I do not specifically endorse the idea of a federal drugstore, particularly if that means selling drugs to people who are not already physically or psychologically addicted. On the other hand, I do support a national commission to study all possible alternatives (including legalization) to our failed strategy of blanket prohibition.  This commission would be similar to the 1929 Wickersham Commission, which President Hoover set up to study how to enforce alcohol prohibition more strictly. Although Hoover tried to conceal the results, the commission concluded that alcohol prohibition was, in the words of Walter Lippmann, a "helpless failure." I believe that an objective and nonpartisan inquiry would come to the same conclusion about the war on drugs.
<p>
I also support Mr. Buckley's idea of approving a "utilitarian" calculus to the war on drugs.  Congress is quite enthusiastic about weighing the costs and benefits of health care, welfare, community development, and other domestic programs.  It should apply a similar analysis to the war on drugs, a war that is now costing the Federal Government $14 billion a year.
<p>
In weighing the costs and benefits, Congress would not have to start from scratch.  There have been many studies and experiments, including our needle-exchange program in Baltimore.  This program costs $160,000 a year.  The cost to the state of Maryland of taking care of just one adult AIDS patient infected through the sharing of a syringe is $102,000 to $120,000.  In other words, if just two addicts are protected from HIV through the city's needle exchange, the program will have paid for itself.
<p>
But a cost-benefit analysis for the war on drugs would do more than offer a guide to the sensible allocation of federal dollars.  It would also make advocating changes in the war on drugs less politically risky for elected officials.  Unfortunately, that risk has kept most political leaders in lockstep support of the war on drugs.
<p>
I understand their reluctance to call for an end to blanket prohibition, especially since individual mayors and governors cannot, by themselves, end the war on drugs or its devastating effects on their communities.  However, I also believe that the political risks of debating and criticizing the war on drugs have been overstated.  I have been reelected twice since 1988.  In my most recent election, last year, my opponent specifically attacked my call for a new strategy in the war on drugs.  She advocated "zero tolerance," which is more of a slogan than a policy, and said she would sign the Atlanta resolution, which supports the status quo.  In spite of her distortions of my record on drug policy, I won re-election by a 20-point margin, the widest margin in my political career.
<p>
Although I strongly believe that changes in national drug policy must be national in scope, I have nevertheless tried to demonstrate that some reforms can be made on local level.  For example, in 1993 I formed a Mayor's Working Group on Drug Policy Reform, and I have since implemented most of its major recommendations.  These recommendations included providing for more community policing; encouraging Baltimore's teaching hospitals to make addiction treatment a larger part of their curriculum; and, most important, developing the needle-exchange program mentioned above.
<p>
Needle exchange was my top legislative priority 1994.  We could not begin the program without a change in the state's drug-paraphernalia laws.  In the previous two years, lawmakers had been reluctant to go along, in part out of fear that they would be accused of condoning drug use. But in 1994, we were able to convince the legislature that needle exchange would not increase drug use but instead would save lives, and perhaps even reduce crime.
<p>
The most politically effective argument in selling needle exchange was that it would slow the spread of AIDS.  That is because  70 per cent of new AIDS cases in Baltimore are related to intravenous drug use, and AIDS is now the number-one killer of both young men and young women in Baltimore. (This crisis is not unique to Baltimore, and the problem is especially horrendous for African-Americans.  A recent report entitled <i>Health Emergency: The Spread of Drug-Related AIDS among African-Americans and Latinos</i>, shows that 73,000 African-Americans have drug-related AIDS or have died from it.  Among people who inject drugs, African-Americans are almost 5 times as likely as whites to be diagnosed with AIDS.  And for African-Americans, the risk of getting AIDS is 7 times greater than the risk of dying from overdose.)
<p>
I'm proud that Baltimore now has the largest government-run needle exchange program in the country.  That program is being thoroughly evaluated by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and Hygiene.  I expect that evaluation to show that needle exchange is saving lives, a claim that the war on drugs has not been able to make for instead more than eighty years.
<p>
Mario Cuomo once made an observation that both liberals and conservatives should feel comfortable endorsing.  He said that policymakers must distinguish between ideas that sound good and good ideas that are sound.  The current war on drugs is an idea that sounds good, but it is not a good idea that is sound.  After hundreds of billions of dollars spent trying to stop the supply and demand of drugs, after the break-up of thousands of families because of the arrest of a nonviolent drug offender, after eight decades of failure, how much longer will the war on drugs continue?
<p>
I once told a television reporter that the war on drugs was our domestic Vietnam.  Conservatives and liberals disagree about the justice of that war.  But we generally agree that the strategy for fighting it didn't work, and as a result the war lasted too long and cost too many lives.  The same is true of the war on drugs.  It's time to bring this enervating war to an end.  It's time for peace.

<p>
"It's the money, stupid." After 35 years as a police officer in three of the country's largest cities, that is my message to the righteous politicians who obstinately proclaim that a war on drugs will lead to a drug-free America.  About $500 worth of heroin or cocaine in a source country will bring in as much as $100,000 on the streets of an American city.  All the cops, armies, prisons, and executions in the world cannot impede a market with that kind of tax-free profit margin.  It is the illegality that permits the obscene markup, enriching drug traffickers, distributors, dealers, crooked cops, lawyers, judges, politicians, bankers, businessmen.
<p>
Naturally, these people are against reform of the drug laws.  Drug crooks align themselves with their avowed enemies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, in opposing drug reform.  They are joined by many others with vested economic interests.  President Eisenhower warned of a military-industrial complex that would elevate the defense budget unnecessarily.  That military-industrial complex pales in comparison to the host of industries catering to our national puritanical hypocrisy - researchers willing to tell the government what it wants to hear, prison builders, correction and parole officers' associations, drug-testing companies, and dubious purveyors of anti-drug education.  Mayor Schmoke is correct about the vested interests in the drug war.
<p>
Sadly, the police have been pushed into a war they did not start and cannot win.  It was not the police who lobbied in 1914 for passage of the Harrison Act, which first criminalized drugs.  It was the Protestant missionary societies in China, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and other such organizations that viewed the taking of psychoactive substances as sinful.  These groups gradually got their religious tenets enacted into penal statutes under which the "sinners' go to jail.  The religious origin is significant for two reasons.  If drugs had been outlawed because the police had complained that drug use caused crime and disorder, the policy would have been more acceptable to the public and won more compliance.  And the conviction that the use of certain drugs is immoral chills the ability to scrutinize rationally and to debate the effects of the drug war.  When Ethan Nadelmann pointed out once that it was illogical for the most hazardous drugs, alcohol and nicotine, to be legal while less dangerous drugs were illegal, he was roundly denounced.  A leading conservative supporter of the drug war contended that while alcohol and nicotine addiction was unhealthy and could even cost lives, addiction to illegal drugs could result in the loss of one's soul.  No empirical proof was given.
<p>
The demonizing of these drugs and their users encourages demagoguery.  William Bennett, the nation's first drug czar, would cut off the heads of drug sellers.  Bennett's anti-drug rhetoric is echoed by Joseph Califano, the liberal former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now chairman of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.  Last June, the center hysterically suggested (with great media coverage) that binge drinking and other substance abuse were taking over the nation's colleges, leading to an increase in rapes, assaults, and murders and to the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  The validity of the research in Califano's report was persuasively debunked by Kathy McNamara-Meis, writing in Forbes Media Critic.  She was equally critical of the media for accepting the Center's sensational statements.
<p>
Conservatives like Bennett normally advocate minimal government.  Liberals like Califano would ordinarily recoil from the draconian prison sentences and property seizures used in the drug war.  This illustrates why it is so difficult to get politicians to concede that alternative approaches to drug control need to be studied.  We are familiar with the perception that the first casualty in any war is truth.  Eighty years of drug-war propaganda has so influenced public opinion that most politicians believe they will lose their jobs if their opponents can claim they arc soft on drugs and crime.  Yet, public doubt is growing.  Gallup reports that in 1990 only 4 per cent of Americans believed that "arresting the people who use drugs" is the best way for the government to allocate resources.
<p>
It was my own experience as a policeman trying to enforce the laws against drugs that led me to change my attitude about drug-control policy.  The analogy to the Vietnam War is fitting.  I was a willing foot soldier at the start of the modern drug war, pounding a beat in Harlem.  During the early 1960s, as heroin use spread, we made many arrests, but it did not take long before cops realized that arrests did not lessen drug selling or drug use.
<p>
I came to realize just how ineffective we were in deterring drug use one day when my partner and I arrested an addict for possession of a hypodermic needle and heroin.  Our prisoner had already shot up, but the heroin charge we were prepared to level at him was based on the tiny residue in the bottle cap used to heat the fix.  It was petty, but then-and now-such arrests arc valued because they can be used to claim success, like the body counts during the Vietnam War.
<p>
In this case the addict offered to "give" us a pusher in exchange for letting him go.  He would lure the pusher into a hallway where we could then arrest him in the act of selling drugs.  We trailed the addict along Lenox Avenue.  To our surprise, he spoke to one man after another.
<p>
It suddenly struck me as humiliating, the whole scene.  Here it was, broad daylight.  We were brilliantly visible, in uniform, in a marked police car: and vet a few feet away, our quarry was attempting one drug transaction after another.  The first two dealers weren't deterred by our presence - they were simply sold out, and we could not arrest them without the goods.  We finally arrested the third pusher, letting the first addict escape, as we had covenanted.  The man we brought in was selling drugs only to support his own habit.
<p>
Another inherent difficulty in drug enforcement is that violators are engaging in consensual activity and seek privacy.  Every day, millions of drug crimes similar to what took place in front of our police car occur without police knowledge.  To enforce drug laws the police have to resort to undercover work, which is dangerous to them and also to innocent bystanders.  Drug enforcement often involves questionable ethical behavior by the police, such as what we did in letting a guilty person go free because he enticed someone else into violating the law.
<p>
Soldiers in a war need to dehumanize the enemy, and many cops took on drug users as less than human.  The former police chief of Los Angeles, Darvi Gates, testified before the United States Senate that casual users should be taken out and shot.  He defended the statement to the Los Angeles Times by saving, "We're in a war." New York police officers convicted of beating and robbing drug dealers (their boss at the time is now Director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy) rationalized their crimes by saving it was impossible to stop drug dealing and these guys were the enemy,.  Why should they get to keep all the money?
<p>
Police scandals are an untallied cost of the drug war.  The FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and even the Coast Guard have had to admit to corruption.  The gravity of the police crimes is as disturbing as the volume.  In New Orleans, a uniformed cop in league with a drug dealer has been convicted of murdering her partner and shop owners during a robbery committed while she was on patrol.  In Washington, DC, and in Atlanta, cops in drug stings were arrested for stealing and taking bribes.  New York State troopers falsified drug evidence that sent people to prison.
<p>
And it is not just the rank and file.  The former police chief of Detroit went to prison for stealing police drug-buy money.  In a small New England town, the chief stole drugs from the evidence locker for his own use.  And the DEA agent who arrested Panama's General Noriega is in jail for stealing laundered drug money.
<p>
The drug war is as lethal as it is corrupting.  And the police and drug criminals are not the only casualties. An innocent 75-year-old African-American minister died of a heart attack 'struggling with Boston cops who were mistakenly arresting him because an informant had given them the wrong address.  A rancher in Ventura County, California, was killed by a police SWAT team serving a search warrant in the mistaken belief that he was growing marijuana.  In Los Angeles, a three-year-old girl died of gunshot wounds after her mother took a wrong turn into a street controlled by a drug-dealing gang.  They fired on the car because it had invaded their marketplace.
<p>
The violence comes from the competition for illegal profits among dealers, not from crazed drug users.  Professor Milton Friedman has estimated that as many as 10,000 additional homicides a year are plausibly attributed to the drug war.
<p>
Worse still, the drug war has become a race war in which non-whites are arrested and imprisoned at four to five times the rate whites are, even though most drug crimes are committed by whites.  The Sentencing Research Project reports that one-third of black men are in ail or under penal supervision, largely because of drug arrests.  The drug war has established thriving criminal enterprises which recruit teenagers into criminal careers.
<p>
It was such issues that engaged law-enforcement leaders-most of them police chiefs-from fifty agencies during a two-day conference at the Hoover Institution in May 1995.  Among the speakers was our colleague in this symposium, Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who told the group that he had visited a high school and asked the students if the high dropout rate was due to kids' being hooked on drugs.  He was told that the kids were dropping out because they were hooked on drug money, not drugs.  He also told 'us that when he went to community meetings he would ask the audience three questions. 1) "Have we won the drug war?" People laughed. 2) "Are we winning the drug war?" People shook their heads. 3) "If we keep doing what we are doing will we have won the drug war in ten years?" The answer was a resounding No.
<p>
At the end of the conference, the police participants completed an evaluation form.  Ninety per cent voted no confidence in the war on drugs.  They were unanimous in favoring more treatment and education over more arrests and prisons.  They were unanimous in recommending a presidential blue-ribbon commission to evaluate the drug war and to explore alternative methods of drug control.  In sum, the tough-minded law-enforcement officials took positions directly contrary to those of Congress and the President.
<p>
One hopes that politicians will realize that no one can accuse them of being soft on drugs if they vote for changes suggested by many thoughtful people in law enforcement.  If the politicians tone down their rhetoric it will permit police leaders to expose the costs of our present drug-control policies.  Public opinion will then allow policy changes to decriminalize marijuana and stop the arrest of hundreds of thousands of people every year.  The enormous savings can be used for what the public really wants-the prevention of violent crime.

<b>Robert W. Sweet</b>
<p>
<i>To ponder the legal and judicial problems that arise from the drug war we turned to Robert Sweet, a District Judge in New York City.  He has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and as Deputy Mayor of New York City under John Lindsay.  He is a graduate of Yale and of Yale Law School.</i>
<p>
Why does a sitting judge, constitutionally charged with enforcing the laws of the United States, seek the abolition of the criminal penalties attached to drug use and distribution?  The answer in my case stems from personal experience, leading to the conviction that our present policy debases the rule of law and that its fundamental premise is flawed.
<p>
In college in the Forties, while experimenting with the drug of choice - alcohol - I cheerfully sang the lyrics of "Cocaine Bill and Morphine Sue," without any understanding of the reality behind the words.  As an Assistant United States Attorney in the Fifties, I accepted the enforcement of the drug laws without question.  In the Sixties, as Deputy Mayor of the City of New York, I supported methadone and various modalities of treatment and rehabilitation.  After becoming a federal trial judge in 1978, I presided over drug trials and sought to impose just sentences ranging from probation to twenty years.
<p>
Then Congress enacted mandatory minimum sentences, and judicial discretion was radically restricted.  The day in the fall of 1988 that I was mandated to sentence Luis Quinones, an 18-year-old with no prior record, to ten years of real time because he was a bouncer in an apartment where drugs were being sold, I faced our national drug policy and the need to reexamine it.  Assisted by the writings of Professor Ethan Nadelmann I concluded that our present policy of criminal prohibition was a monumental error.  A number of other judges have reached the same conclusion.  Judge Weinstein has characterized our present policy as "utter futility," and Judge Knapp has likened it to "taking minnows out of the pond."
<p>
As Chief McNamara writes, the realities of criminal prohibition arc becoming recognized.  The first and foremost effect is the creation of a pervasive and unbelievably powerful underground economy.
<p>
The Economist estimates that the markup on cocaine and heroin is not 5,000 per cent, as Messrs.  Buckley and Duke suggest, but 20,000 per cent.  The drug market in the United States is estimated at $150 billion a year.  At least one group of distributors in a case before me sold 37,500 kilos of cocaine a month for gross sales of almost $20 million a month, and this group was but one of a number operating here.
<p>
While this economic engine drives forward, so have our efforts to punish those who operate it.  Today we have the highest incarceration rate for any Western nation, almost 1 million [There are higher estimates. -ED.] in jails or prisons at a cost of $20 billion a year.  Federal drug cases have trebled in 10 years, up 25 per cent in 1993 alone, with marijuana cases up 17 per cent.  The total federal expenditure on the drug war this year under the proposed budget will exceed $17 billion.  Ten years ago the annual expenditure on the drug war was $5 billion for all governments, federal, state, and local.
<p>
While our expenditures have increased tenfold, the number of Americans using drugs has remained relatively constant at 40 million.  Steady users are estimated to be 6 million, with I to 2 million of those seriously disordered.  Our present prohibition policy has failed, flatly and without serious question.
<p>
Secondly, the rule of law has been debased by the use of criminal sanctions to alter personal conduct.  Of course, the same effort was made in the Twenties and Thirties with respect to alcohol, with the same results.  Al Capone and Nicky Barnes arc interchangeable.  Drive-by shootings, turf wars, mugging, and random violence are all the direct result of criminal prohibition.  Courts are clogged with drug cases to such an extent that in some jurisdictions (the Eastern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida, for example) it is difficult to find the resources to try civil cases; yet, the street-corner avail ability of drugs is known to every citizen.
<p>
The rights of the individual have been curtailed in the name of the War on Drugs.  We have seen the elimination of an accused's right to pretrial release for most charges under the drug laws; heightened restrictions on post-conviction bail; and invasions into the attorney-client relationship through criminal forfeiture.
<p>
The criteria for securing a search warrant have been relaxed.  In drug cases, the Supreme Court has permitted the issuance of search warrants based on anonymous tips and tips from informants known to be corrupt and unreliable; permitted warrantless searches of fields, barns, and private property near a residence; and upheld evidence obtained under defective search warrants if the officers executing the warrant acted in "good faith." Taken together, these holdings have been characterized as "the drug exception to the Fourth Amendment."
<p>
Police corruption and the unwholesome practice of using confidential informants (one of whom made over $100,000 in a case before me) have been noted by Chief McNamara.
<p>
Finally, the fundamental flaw, which will ultimately destroy this prohibition as it did the last one, is that criminal sanctions cannot, and should not attempt to, prohibit personal conduct which does no harm to others.  Personal liberty surely must extend to what, when, and how much a citizen can ingest.
<p>
The Framers of our Constitution explicitly acknowledged that the individual possesses certain rights not enumerated in the text of the Constitution and not contingent upon the relationship between the individual and the Federal Government.  When a right has been narrowly defined as, for example, the right to possess marijuana or cocaine, the courts have refused to recognize it as one that is fundamental in nature.  However, when the right to ingest substances is considered in more general terms as the right to self-determination, that right has a constitutional foundation as yet undeclared.
<p>
To overturn the present policy will not be easy, given the established bureaucracy, but President Kennedy at the Berlin Wall was correct: "Change is the law of life." We must recognize that drug use is first and foremost a health problem, and that, as Professor Nadelmann has established, mind-altering substances are a part of modern life to be understood and their effects ameliorated, rather than grounds for prosecution.
<p>
Alcohol and tobacco have a social cost when abused, and society has property concluded that abuse of these drugs is a health problem, not a criminal issue.  Indeed, our experience with the reduction of 50 per cent in the use of tobacco-the most addicting of drugs, which results in 400,000 deaths a year-confirms the wisdom of that policy.  To distinguish between these substances and heroin or cocaine is mere tautology.
<p>
While the medicalization of the issue is going forward, Congress should accept the recommendations of President Nixon's commission on the drug laws and of the National Academy of Sciences in 1982 and end the criminalization of marijuana, which is now widely acknowledged to be without deleterious effect.  That reform alone would take 450,000 arrests out of the system.
<p>
The latest crime bill proposed a study of violence and crime encompassing drug policy but failed to fund it.  The Surgeon General proposed such a study and got fired.  Such a study, if fairly conducted, would compel the abolition of criminal prohibition of drugs by the Federal Government, permitting all drugs to be treated much the same as alcohol: restricted by the individual states as to time and place of sale, barred from minors, subject to truth in advertising, and made the source of tax revenue.  As with alcohol, those who harm or pose a threat to others while under the influence of drugs would face criminal sanctions.
<p>
The effect of the underworld drug economy, the debasement of the rule of law, and the undermining of fundamental fairness and individual rights under the war on drugs all combine to require that the criminal prohibition against drug use and distribution be ended.

<b>Thomas Szasz</b>
<p>
<i>Dr.  Szasz, of the Department of psychiatry at Syracuse University, has for many years argued the medical case that proscribed drugs, while catastrophic in their effect on some people, are, when used by most, taken without permanent damage.  He has also, in his numerous books, pleaded the libertarian point, namely that drug-taking is the individual's business and responsibility.</i>
<p>
The war on drugs is a mass movement characterized by the demonizing, as Chief McNamara suggests of certain objects and persons ("drugs," "addicts," "traffickers") as the incarnations of evil.  Hence, it is foolish to dwell on the drug prohibitionist's failure to attain his avowed aims.  Since he wages war on evil, his very effort is synonymous with success.  It is a fatal weakness of prudential critiques of drug policy that they ignore the "religious" character of the war on drugs.
<p>
The Crusaders' war on the Infidel dramatized their unwavering devotion to the True Faith.  The Communists' war on private property dramatized their unwavering devotion to the ideal of a society free of economic exploitation.  America's war on drugs dramatizes our unwavering devotion to the ideal of a "drug-free" society.  The right analogy for America's war on drugs is not the Vietnam War, but Communism.
<p>
The Soviet Union was the embodiment of the principle that private property is evil.  To protect people from dangerous capitalists, the USSR criminalized leaving the country without permission.  The Russians are now paying the price of their anti-capitalist mentality.
<p>
Today, the United States is the embodiment of the principle that self-medication is evil.  To protect people from rejecting protection from dangerous drugs, the U.S. criminalizes self-medication without a prescription.  We arc now paving the price of our anti-drug mentality.
<p>
William Bennett is right: Drug use and drug controls arc primarily moral issues.  But whereas Bennett sees self medication as wicked and drug criminalization as virtuous, I see self-medication as a basic human right (with unqualified responsibility for its consequences) and drug criminalization as sinful (hypocritical and unenforceable).
<p>
Among the sins of the drug warriors, I view the following as especially important: 1) destroying Americans' attachment to, indeed their very understanding of, limited government; 2) converting tort law into an instrument of economic redistribution and the principle of caveat emptor into that of caveat vendor; 3) turning doctors into drug monopolists (by making the purchase of most drugs, especially "pleasure-producing" drugs, illegal without a physician's prescription), and perverting the medical criteria of disease and treatment (by defining certain "bad" choices as diseases, and certain "good" coercions as treatments); 4) obscuring the obvious fact that all biologically active substances are potentially dangerous (in certain doses, to some persons, under certain circumstances); 5) converting the relationship between doctor and patient from a contract between two responsible adults into a domination-dependence relationship; and 6) redefining the relationship between drug seller and drug buyer from a contract between two responsible adults into a victimization relationship.
<p>
In his great work Ancient Law, Sir Henry Maine articulated his famous general proposition: "The movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract." The war on drugs is but one manifestation, albeit a very important one, of a radical reversal of this movement.  Gradually, the American polity has become transformed from a limited government (the Rule of Law) into an unlimited Therapeutic State (relations based on status).
<p>
I reject my fellow panelists' sympathetic stance toward medical drug controls.  To treat people in great pain effectively, we do not need more "compassion"; we simply need a social setting where individuals have legal access to narcotics and where doctors can administer such drugs in conformity with their patients' wants, without fear of criminal penalties for overprescribing, or civil penalties for malpractice, or both.  Prescribing heroin and methadone for addicts is not the solution, but the very epitome of the problem.  Enough said.
<p>
In a secular society committed to individual liberty and personal responsibility, the legislator's task is to enact laws to govern the behavior of adults, not children (whose management is primarily the responsibility of their parents).  Once a person loses sight of this fact, it is easy to convince him that protecting children from drugs justifies making drugs difficult to obtain for adults.
<p>
Drugs are, of course, not the only dangerous artifacts in our environment.  Electricity, household appliances and cleansers, and countless other products of human inventiveness endanger, injure, and kill children.  We accept these inventions that, in the long run, make our lives healthier and safer, and adapt to them by teaching children to cope realistically with the risks they pose.  Harassing adults and depriving them of rights will not work as a substitute for disciplining children.
<p>
Our obsession with the necessity of drug controls is closely intertwined with our attitudes toward self-harm and health care on the one hand, and, on the other hand, with our attitudes toward the manufacturer's and provider's tort liability for substances and interventions classified as "medical." In contemporary medical-political discourse, the issue of free will is raised only to assert its absence, and hence the unsuitability of market relations in connection with drugs and health care.  To be sure, it makes no sense to let people make important choices if we believe that they are unable to choose, because they arc the victims of addiction or mental illness.
<p>
We try to prevent our children from putting foreign bodies into their nostrils or other body cavities.  Why?  Partly because we love them and partly because their self injury causes us a lot of trouble.  In proportion as we treat adults like children-lifting the economic burden of medical care from their shoulders and placing it on everyone else's shoulders-we create a set of monstrous incentives whose reality we refuse to acknowledge.  Protecting everyone from having to pay for his own health care and at the same time making everyone pay for everyone else's health care not only infantilizes everyone, but encourages everyone to meddle in everyone else's life (in order to reduce the medical services others require).
<p>
If Jones manufactures cigarettes which Smith buys and which give him lung cancer, the government forces Jones to defend himself in court against the accusation of having harmed Smith, and forces Taylor (as taxpayer) to pay Smith's medical treatment.  So long as we use this formula for managing risks everyone in Taylor's position has an incentive to limit Jones's right to sell cigarettes and Smith's right to smoke them.
<p>
Suppose, then, that selling and buying cocaine were as legal in January 1996 as in January 1896.  Jones sells cocaine, accurately labeled as to composition, side effects, lethal close, and so forth.  Smith buys some and dies as a result of using it.  Mrs. Smith sues Jones for causing her husband's "wrongful death." Given our mindset, the judge refuses to dismiss the complaint and orders the matter to go to trial; the plaintiff's lawyers retain the most prestigious experts to testify that the "victim" was not responsible for his behavior; the jury imposes a judgment for ruinous compensatory and punitive damages on Jones.  In such a legal atmosphere, only the black marketer enjoys the caveat emptor protections of traditional contract.
<p>
Not surprisingly, bringing a free market in goods and services into being in Russia has turned out to require more than abolishing the Gulag.  Respect for private property and private profit, supported by a well-functioning commercial/legal system, is needed as Well.
<p>
Mutatis mutandis, bringing a free market in drugs into being in America would require more than repealing criminal sanctions against selling and buying drugs.  Respect for autonomy and responsibility, supported by a rational tort system, would be needed as well.
<p>
I fear that we shall not be able or willing to re-embrace a free market in drugs (whose benefits we enjoyed from 1776 until 1914) until the drug war has caused us a great deal more suffering and until we become willing to attribute that suffering to drug laws (and their consequences) rather than to drugs (and their abuse).

<p>
"The drug war is not working," says Bill Buckley.  That is certainly true if we assume, as he does that the purpose of the drug war is to induce Americans to consume only approved drugs.  But as the war wears on, we have to wonder what its purposes really are.
<p>
If its purpose is to make criminals out of one in three African-American males, it has succeeded.  If its purpose is to create one of the highest crime rates in the world-and thus to provide permanent fodder for demagogues who decry crime and promise to do something about it-it is achieving that end.  If its purpose is de facto repeal of the Bill of Rights, victory is well in sight.  If its purpose is to transfer individual freedom to the central government, it is carrying that off as well as any of our real wars did.  If its purpose is to destroy our inner cities by making them war zones, triumph is near.
<p>
Most of the results of the drug war, of which the essayists here complain, were widely observed during alcohol prohibition.  Everyone should have known that the same fate would follow if the Prohibition approach were merely transferred to different drugs.
<p>
It has been clear for over a decade that Milton Friedman's warnings about Prohibition redux have been borne out (see his "Prohibition and Drugs," Newsweek, May 1, 1972).  At some point, the consequences of a social policy become so palpable that deliberate continuation of the policy incorporates those consequences into the policy.  We are near if not past that point with drug prohibition.
<p>
For forty years following the repeal of alcohol prohibition, we treated drug prohibition as we did other laws against vice: we didn't take it very seriously.  As we were extricating ourselves from the Vietnam War, however, Richard Nixon declared "all-out global war on the drug menace," and the militarization of the problem began.  After Ronald Reagan redeclared that war, and George Bush did the same, we had a drug-war budget that was 1,000 times what it was when Nixon first discovered the new enemy.
<p>
The objectives of the drug war are obscured in order to prevent evaluation.  A common claim, for example, is that prohibition is part of the nation's effort to prevent serious crime.  Bill Clinton's drug czar, Dr. Lee Brown, testified before Congress:
<p>
<blockquote>Drugs - especially addictive, hard-core drug use - are behind much of the crime we see on our streets today, both those crimes committed by users to finance their lifestyles and those committed by traffickers and dealers fighting . for territory and turf.... Moreover, there is a level of fear in our communities that is, I believe, unprecedented in our history ...</blockquote>
<p>
If these remarks had been preceded by two words, "Prohibition of," the statement would have been correct, and the political reverberations would have been deafening.  Instead, Dr. Brown implied that drug consumption is by itself responsible for "turf wars" and the other enumerated evils, an implication which he and every other drug warrior know is false.  The only possibility more daunting than that our leaders are dissembling is that they might actually believe the nonsense they purvey.
<p>
I have little to add to the catalog of drug-war casualties in the other essays assembled here.  I do, however, see another angle of entry for Mr. Buckley's efforts at "quantification." I have argued elsewhere that the drug war is responsible for at least half of our serious crime.  A panel of experts consulted by U.S. News & World Report put the annual dollar cost of America's crime at $674 billion.  Half of that, $337 billion, was the total federal budget as recently as 1975.  The crime costs of drug prohibition alone may equal 150 per cent of the entire federal welfare budget for 1995.
<p>
I also think Mr. Buckley understates the nonquantifiable loss of what he quaintly refers to as "amenities." Not only is it nearly suicidal to walk alone in Central Park at night, it is impossible in sections of some cities safely to leave one's home, or to remain there.  Some Americans sleep in their bathtubs hoping they are bullet-proof.  Prohibition-generated violence is destroying large sections of American cities.  We can have our drug war or we can have healthy cities; we cannot have both.
<p>
In this collection of essays, we critics have focused on the costs of the drug war.  The warriors could justly complain if we failed to mention the benefits.  So let's take a took at the "benefit" side of the equation.  Were it not for the drug war, the prohibitionists say, we might be a nation of zombies.  The DEA pulled the figure of 60 million from the sky: that's how many cocaine users they say we would have if it weren't for prohibition.  Joseph Califano's colleague at the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Dr. Herbert Kleber, a former assistant to William Bennett, puts the number of cocaine users after repeal at a more modest 20 to 25 million.  In contrast, government surveys suggest that only about 3 million Americans currently use cocaine even occasionally and fewer than 500,000 use it weekly.
<p>
The prohibitionists' scenarios have no basis either in our history or in other cultures.  In many countries, heroin and cocaine are cheap and at least de facto legal.  Mexico is awash in cheap drugs, yet our own State Department says that Mexico does "not have a serious drug problem." Neither cocaine nor heroin is habitually consumed by more than a small fraction of the residents of any country in the world.  There is no reason to suppose that Americans would be the single exception.
<p>
Lee Brown used to rely on alcohol prohibition as proof that legalization would addict the nation, asserting that alcohol consumption "shot straight up" when Prohibition was repeated.  He no longer claims that, it having been pointed out to him that alcohol consumption increased only about 25 per cent in the years following repeal.  Yet even assuming, contrary to that experience, that ingestion of currently illegal drugs would double or triple following repeal, preventing such increased consumption still cannot be counted a true benefit of drug prohibition.  After repeal, the drugs would be regulated; their purity and potency would be disclosed on the package, as Mr. Buckley points out, together with appropriate warnings.  Deaths from overdoses and toxic reactions would be reduced, not increased.  Moreover, as Richard Cowan has explained (NR, "How the Narcs Created Crack," Dec. 5, 1986), the drugs consumed after repeal would be less potent than those ingested under prohibition.  Before alcohol prohibition, we were a nation of beer drinkers.  Prohibition pushed us toward hard liquor, a habit from which we are still recovering.  Before the Harrison Act, many Americans took their cocaine in highly diluted forms, such as Coca-Cola.
<p>
We would also end the cruel practices described by Ethan Nadelmann wherein we deny pain medication to those who need it, preclude the medical use of marijuana, and compel drug users to share needles and thus to spread deadly diseases.  The proportion of users who would consume the drugs without substantial health or other problems would be greatly increased.  In comparison to any plausible post-repeal scenario, therefore, there simply are no health benefits achieved by prohibition.
<p>
Given the forum, I should perhaps confess that I am not now, nor have I ever been, a conservative.  GAs an outsider, therefore, perhaps I can be pardoned for my inability to see consistency in the positions conservatives commonly take on drugs and related issues.  I can understand how one who believes that government should force us to lead proper lives can, albeit mistakenly, support drug prohibition.  But I cannot comprehend how any conservative can support the drug war.  That is my major mystery.  I am also perplexed by some subordinate, mini-mysteries, of which here are a few:
<p>
- Why do so many conservatives preach "individual responsibility" vet ardently punish people for the chemicals they consume and thus deny the right that gives meaning to the responsibility) Many of these same conservatives would think it outrageous for the government to decree the number of calories we ingest or the kind of exercise we get, even though such decrees would be aimed at preserving our lives, keeping us productive, and reducing the drain on scarce medical resources.  The incongruity of these positions is mystifying, and so is the willingness of conservatives, in order to protect people from their own folly, to impose huge costs in death, disease, crime, corruption, and destruction of civil liberties upon others who arc entirely innocent: people who do not partake of for hidden drugs.
<p>
Newt Gingrich, Charles Murray, and other conservatives are rightly concerned about the absence of fathers in the homes of so many of America's youngsters.  Where are those fathers?  At least half a million arc in prison, often for nothing worse than possessing drugs.
<p>
- Countless conservatives revere the right to one's property.  Yet many conservatives support drug forfeiture as gladly as liberals.  Congress has made a criminal prosecution unnecessary for persons with property who are associated (even if indirectly) with illicit drugs.  An apartment house may be forfeited if a tenant grows a marijuana plant in his bathroom.  A grandmother's home may be forfeited if a grandson hides drugs in the basement which he sells to his friends.  The Supreme Court has said that there are constitutional Emits on forfeitures, but it has vet to find any.  With the notable exception of Congressman Henry Hyde (see his book, Forfeiting Our Property Rights), most legislators are unconcerned about drawing a line.
<p>
- Many conservatives strongly support schemes to "devolve" matters from the Federal Government to state and local governments.  Yet there does not appear to be a single conservative politician in America who applies this principle to drug prohibition.  The mystery deepens when we remember that this is precisely the way we handled alcohol prohibition.  When we repeated the Eighteenth Amendment, we didn't declare that all forms of alcohol distribution were beyond the reach of prohibition; in the Twenty-First Amendment, we simply let each state decide how it wanted to handle alcohol.  Some remained dry.  Many devolved the issue to cities and counties, some of which have elected to maintain prohibition to this very day.  Judge Sweet and others make a powerful case for applying this approach to other drugs in addition to alcohol.  Why hasn't any conservative in elective office at least suggested that it be considered?
<p>
The only benefit to America in maintaining prohibition is the psychic comfort we derive from having a permanent scapegoat.  But why did we have to pick an enemy the warring against which is so self-destructive? We would be better off blaming our ills on celestial invaders flying about in saucers?

<hr>  
 
<p> 
The issue of <i>National Review</i> dated February 12, 1996, gave the conclusion of the  
magazine that the time had come to revise our laws on drug trafficking.  Seven writers  
contributed to the symposium.  There were no differences among them on the primary findings.   
They were 1) that the famous drug war is not working; 2) that crime and suffering have greatly  
increased as a result of prohibition; 3) that we have seen, and are countenancing, a creeping  
attrition of authentic civil liberties; and 4) that the direction in which to head is legalization,  
whatever modifications in kind, speed, and variety commend themselves in study and practice. 
<p> 
The response from the magazine's readers is, in volume, second only to the response to the issue  
in 1991 given over to the exploration of anti-Semitism.  We have had over four hundred  
communications, and the only civil way to introduce fragments from these letters, as we now do,  
is to apologize to their authors for our failure to acknowledge them individually. (One letter is  
approximately eight thousand words long and is marked, "Not for publication in whole or in  
part.") Four hundred letters addressed to the President of the United States, or even to a senator  
or congressman, would almost certainly be acknowledged, by using form letters A, B, and C. But  
even a letter so spare as to have been usable to all our correspondents would have broken our  
clerical bank.  Add to this an indisposition to craft letters so diffuse as to fall to qualify as serious  
answers. (H. L. Mencken's formula was always to say, "You may be right.  Sincerely, HLM.") 
<p> 
Readers are about evenly divided on the recommendations of <i>NR</i>.  A heavy majority  
were grateful that National Review had ventilated the subject extensively; all agree that the drug  
problem is acute, and no one disputes that the drug war is being lost.  Those who oppose  
legalization are divided on what then to do, one half asking for harsher penalties, the other  
proposing different strategies.  Inasmuch as the heavy majority of those who lean toward, or  
forthrightly advocate, legalization endorsed the findings and analyses of our own panel, they are  
given, to avoid repetition, less space in this summary.  The analyses by Messrs.  Buckley, Duke,  
McNamara, Nadelmann, Schmoke, Sweet, and Szasz arc requoted here only when their  
recollection helps to achieve perspective in answering our critics. 
<p> 
<b>1. The Classic Prohibitionist View</b> 
<p> 
Prominence should be given to a long letter from our old friend and fellow warrior John A.  
Howard, founder of the Rockford Institute, now counselor to Rockford (which also publishes  
<i>Chronicles</i>). Commentary, on his and subsequent letters is done by me - WFB.  What I  
say does not presume to be exactly what my colleagues would have said, but I have endeavored  
to avoid any disharmony with their views. 
<p> 
Mr. Howard says that he is surprised by the "ignorance" of the writers in respect of "the large  
body of scientific research which contradicts their presuppositions and assertions.  Bill Buckley  
denies any serious concern about the impact of cocaine and marijuana upon the millions of  
regular users because most of them continue their use 'without any observable distraction in their  
lives or careers.' Ethan Nadelmann asserts, 'Most people can use drugs without doing much harm  
to themselves or anyone else.' The other authors seem to assume the same benign character of  
drug use." 
<p> 
Mr. Howard goes on, "An international colloquium on the human effects of cannabis  
consumption was held in Paris in 1992 under the auspices of the French Academy of Medicine.   
Professor Henri Baylon, the President of the Academy, summarized the conclusions of the  
meeting as follows: 
<blockquote> 
"'1.  The toxicity of cannabis is well established, experimentally and clinically.  The drug  
adversely affects the central nervous system, the lungs, and the immunity and reproductive  
functions. 
<p> 
"'2.  Epidemiological studies have reported that the use of "hard drugs" rarely occurs among  
subjects who have never used cannabis. 
<p> 
"'3.  Consequently, the participants in this colloquium rebut the distinction between "soft" and  
"hard " drugs. 
<p> 
"'4.  The trivialization ("decriminalization") of cannabis use, where it has occurred, has resulted  
in a considerable increase of its consumption and of its subsequent damaging effects.'" 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
What I wrote (page 36): "Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book,  
<i>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs</i>, and scholarly  
essay, 'Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs  
that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs.  It is acknowledged  
that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another  
consumed or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug.  But the estimate authorized by the federal  
agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine  
users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week.  There are  
(again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an  
estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana.  From  
the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans  
who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have  
experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in  
their lives or careers." 
<p> 
One wonders why Mr. Howard wastes his time (and ours) by his misreadings and irrelevancies.   
When the French National Academy of Medicine reports that cannabis is "toxic" in that it  
"affects the central nervous system," it is telling us nothing that is not obvious.  There is no other  
reason to use marijuana than that it affects the nervous system.  And any inhalation of tar affects  
the lungs.  If marijuana seriously affects the reproductive functions, one can only wonder at the  
success of the Woodstock generation in reproducing itself.  To say that everyone who uses  
cocaine probably once used marijuana is correct and meaningless.  Everyone who rapes probably  
once masturbated.  Most excesses are progressive.  To conclude that there is no distinction  
between soft and hard drugs is simply to ignore the discriminating capacity of our senses, to  
distinguish between the man who has taken a glass of beer and the man who has taken a half- 
dozen martinis. 
<p> 
And this, of course, is the key insight.  Nothing the Academy says about cannabis or cocaine  
can't be said about alcohol, which the United States finally decriminalized after 13 ugly (and  
cheerless) years.  It is especially curious that Mr. Howard failed to grapple with the point, given  
that the sentence in the <i>NR</i> issue immediately after the one he quoted above read: "About  
such users [i.e., occasional marijuana and indeed cocaine users] one might say that they are the  
equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those  
Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result." 
<p> 
And a factual point.  Mr. Howard: "Robert Sweet does urge the acceptance of 'the  
recommendations of President Nixon's commission on drug law to end the criminalization of  
marijuana.' That would seem to support his view, except it is flatly untrue.  That commission  
recommended that marijuana remain contraband, subject to confiscation by law-enforcement  
officials." 
<p> 
The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse (The "Nixon Marijuana Commission")  
found in 1972 that "there is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the  
experimental or intermittent use" of marijuana.  On the question of law enforcement, the panel  
recommended a "decriminalization" of possession of marijuana for personal use on both the state  
and the federal levels.  Specifically, it recommended that: 
<blockquote> 
"-Federal and state laws be changed to no longer make it a crime to possess marijuana for private  
use. 
<p> 
"-The distribution in private of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or for  
insignificant amounts should no longer be an offense. 
<p> 
"-State laws should make the public use of marijuana a criminal offense punishable by a $100  
fine.  Under federal law, marijuana smoked in public would merely be subject to seizure." 
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Most of the letters received fall into one or another of the categories enumerated below. 
<p> 
<b>2. The Demands of the Natural Law</b> 
<p> 
<i>" in most arenas (the suicide business, abortion, others) you make reference to natural law,  
but in the isolated area of drug legalization you seem to discount the possibility of any higher  
guidance and use expediency as the rationale." 
<p=align right>-Dr. T. P. Collins, Portsmouth, Virginia</i> 
<p> 
No such thing was intended.  But laws do not for the most part instruct us whether to engage in  
particular activities.  Of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, avarice, sloth, pride, lust, envy, wrath) 
only two are also proscribed by statute law, and even they, only marginally.  Jimmy Carter  
confessed to lust in his heart, but the policeman materializes only when lust activates aggression.  
Wrath is okay (in fact it is even encouraged, in times of war) except when it causes you to maim  
or kill innocents. 
<p> 
<b>3. Personal Responsibility</b> 
<p> 
Much indignation is expressed over the tacit position of the many anti-prohibitionists that the  
addicted class is free to become a public burden. 
<p> 
<i>"Several years ago, our Congress chose to follow the leadership of American liberals by  
deciding that taking illegal drugs was a 'disease.' In reality, the use of drugs describes a  
behavior.... The result?  The illegal drug-takers are 'rehabilitated' to the point where they no  
longer need to work to make their way in life; they simply hand the tab to the taxpayer."<br> 
<p=align right>-Jack W. Pace, Lincoln, Rhode Island</i> 
<p> 
But surely it is not plausible that anyone well and persuasively instructed in the tortures of  
addiction would think to take up drugs merely as a means of effecting a personal welfare  
program?  What several symposium contributors stressed was different, namely that the dollar  
spent on instruction and therapy effects a higher return than the dollar spent on detection, trial,  
and imprisonment. 
<p> 
<b>4. Can Anyone Function With Drugs?</b> 
<p> 
Some viewers of the <i>Firing Line</i> programs aired in February featuring contributors to the  
<i>NR</i> drug symposium were astonished to hear (from Mr. Nadelmann and Dr. Szasz) that  
indeed some drug users can and do lead apparently normal lives. 
<p> 
<i>"On Saturday morning, you sat there and countenanced the proposition that heroin was less  
dangerous than alcohol. Especially appalling was the suggestion that the addict could  
'function' if he or she were freed from the problem of obtaining enough money to fund an illegal  
habit.  The idea that an addict can function is almost as insane as the addict's substance abuse is  
insane.  How do you define 'function'?  Does it mean to lead a responsible, productive life?  Does  
it mean simply to be able to feed and dress oneself?  Does it mean to live and not be a threat to  
other people? How much self-reliance and safety do you include in your definition?" 
<p=align right>-Louise H. Perret, Rye, New York</i> 
<p> 
It is established that some people can "function" even after ingesting cocaine.  Dr. Szasz has  
written on the matter in several of his books.  He is arguing two positions.  The first is that the  
"abuse" of drugs is a variable.  Even as we know those who can tolerate five drinks, and those  
who can't tolerate one, it is evidently so with cocaine.  This is hardly to recommend the use of it,  
since for the overwhelming majority it is immobilizing.  Dr. Szasz makes the point that it is  
clinically incorrect to assume that everyone is equally affected.  His other point is that to impose  
legal sanctions against someone merely because it is established that he has used the drug is an  
encroachment on human rights. 
<p> 
<b>5. Is Drug Legalization Analogous to Choice in Abortion?</b> 
<p> 
<i>"I'm surprised no one has thought of the parallel between the legalization of drugs and the  
legalization of abortion.  The same arguments  could easily be used to legalize drugs.  Right to  
privacy, freedom to do what one wishes with one's body, even the threat that if abortion were  
illegal women would have to resort to the back-alley butcher.  Just change this last one to read  
back-alley pusher and the two are identical." 
<p=align right>-Frank F. Bellotti, Seattle, Washington</i> 
<p> 
The parallel is of limited use, surely, inasmuch as opposition to abortion springs from the belief  
that there is an aggrieved party, with human rights. 
<p> 
<b>6. Would Legalization Bring More Government?</b> 
<p> 
<i>"Another almost certain consequence [of decriminalization] would be the creation of a  
Federal Drug Control bureaucracy that would make the current Drug War machine seem trivial.  
 Another worry concerning the legalization of drugs is its probable effect on the workplace.  
Today, we employers can fire drugged-up employees. But, with legalization, I can imagine that  
employers will be forced to continue the employment of worthless workers under the Americans  
with Disabilities Act." 
<p=align right>-John F. Brinson, Allentown, Pennsylvania</i> 
<p> 
Surely implausible? There was less government, in respect to alcohol, affecting individual lives  
after Prohibition than during it. Besides, it must by no means taken for granted that all of the  
contributors to <i>NR</i>'s symposium favor diminished social and economic sanctions, were  
legalization to come.  It is not inconsistent to favor legalization alongside an intensification of  
these other sanctions. 
<p> 
The columnist Nicholas von Hoffman lists what society is in a position to do to make its point.  
The taking of drugs ought to be legislated as a civil offense. What then might a drug consumer  
expect? To begin with, everyone would have to submit to periodic blood testing. 
<p> 
"Anyone testing positive for drug use would be subject to the revocation of a huge army of  
privileges, ranging from temporary to permanent loss of driver's license, the revocation of one's  
license to practice law, operate a barber shop, work as an electrician, practice medicine or be a  
plumber, rent property, buy and sell securities.  Civil penalties for drug use could also include  
cancellation of eligibility for every kind of government loan insurance, loss of eligibility for  
welfare, student grants in aid, subsidies, and government payments of any kind, large or small.   
Persons found selling drugs would be subject to cancellation of medical insurance, and Social  
Security, up to and including refused admission to hospitals or hospices.  No criminal penalties,  
no long trials, no F. Lee Blundermouths, or Whirling Dershowitzes.  Civil society, through  
quick, essentially unappealable administrative tribunals, would turn its back on such people for a  
greater or lesser period of time." 
<p> 
The promulgation of the Hoffman Protocols would require some fiddling with the Constitution.   
But can it be said that Mr. Hoffman is soft on drugs, though he advocates legalization? 
<p> 
<b>7. The Federalist Implications</b> 
<p> 
<i>"We tend to speak of the 'legalization' of drugs, when we really are referring to the repeal of  
national drug legislation.  Why should the conservative coalition split itself apart in arguments  
over whether 'government' ought [to] act aggressively against drug production and consumption,  
or adopt a libertarian unconcern and let the market proceed to do its work?  The issue cuts too  
deeply.  Where are we likely to find a better opportunity to educate the American people about  
federalism?  The remanding of drug policy to the states would dramatically illustrate the futility  
and destructiveness of much meddlesome federal administration." 
<p=align right>-Scott Rutledge, Richardson, Texas</i> 
<p> 
State-bounded experiments lifting criminal sanctions against marijuana use have been attempted  
in a dozen states.  But of course, drugs being light and unbulky, it would require an extraordinary  
mobilization of state constabulary to prevent border crossings.  But yes, it would be prudent to  
repeal the federal law against marijuana use, leaving it to the states to define laws of their own.   
The distinguished neuroscientist Professor Michael Gazzaniga, writing in <i>NR</i> (February  
5, 1990), advocated a federal drugstore in which drugs were clearly - even dramatically - labeled,  
detailing toxicity and possible/probable side effects.  Such drugs would be available at a cost low  
enough to eliminate a black market. 
<p> 
<b>8. How to Measure Social Unacceptability?</b> 
<p> 
Several correspondents see a difficulty in any proposition to the effect that general disobedience  
of a law, as with drug consumption in America, should lead to the law's abrogation.  
<p> 
<i>" The Buckley corollary seems to be that if the enforcement of a criminal law measured by  
an unspecified ratio of persons convicted of the crime to those engaged in the conduct  
criminalized is too low, then the conduct should be legalized.  I would like to have your views on  
whether, for example, you believe laws making homicide criminal should be repealed if it  
became apparent that most homicides were unsolved." 
<p=align right>-Walter S. Lewis, Princeville, Hawaii</i> 
<p> 
The point is argumentatively interesting, but collapses under scrutiny.  Many sometime laws  
withered away with the separation of church and state, and sluggish observance.  Attendance at  
Sunday services was theoretically compulsory in some localities even after the Constitution was  
ratified.  Such laws gradually disappeared, as also, almost two centuries later, laws against  
commerce on the Lord's Day.  What looms is greater emphasis on the distinction between  
victimless crimes and other crimes.  Laws against sodomy are de facto relics of another age,  
although they are still on the books in some states.  Laws against suicide are formalistic,  
inasmuch as prosecution is, in the nature of the case, impossible. 
<p> 
To be sure, the term "victimless" is used glibly.  Isn't a prostitute, even if she engages in her  
profession voluntarily, in some real sense a victim?  The drug consumer can, by his habit,  
victimize his family, but then so can the wage carrier who dissipates his salary at the race track.   
It is preposterous to argue that the drug consumer does no damage, but my colleagues in the  
symposium are agreed that the sum of human damage done by the drug laws is greater than  
would be done without them, and that the primary - and sometimes only - victim in the latter case  
would be the drug user.  The murderer's victim is someone whose rights are theoretically  
guaranteed by the Constitution; and the promiscuity of homicide is, up to a point, evidence of the  
delinquency of law enforcers.  There is no evidence, the contributors to the drug symposium are  
agreed, that increasing the severity of prison sentences, or the density of patrolmen on our  
frontiers, would so successfully interdict drug traffic as to make the war on drugs victorious. 
<p> 
<b>9. Isn't It a Matter of Law Enforcement?</b> 
<p> 
On this point - law enforcement - many correspondents dwelled.  Blame for the ineffectiveness  
of the drug laws is laid on the shoulders of politicians, judges, police officers, lawyers, jurors,  
educators, parents, and doctors. 
<p> 
<i>"I do not believe that the drug war has been lost; it has not yet been fought.  What we have  
had up to this point have been ploys designed by politicians to appease as many of the various  
segments of the voting public as possible.  A law that is not vigorously enforced is no deterrent.   
It is not the existence of a law that is the deterrent, it is the enforcement of the law." 
<p=align right>-Howard R. Jeter, North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania</i> 
<p> 
Arriving at a different conclusion, in our symposium, were Joseph McNamara, who has served as  
police chief in two major U.S. cities; Judge Robert Sweet of New York, who, called upon to  
implement the Rockefeller drug laws, has seen the tumbrils pass by, en route to twenty years'  
imprisonment; and Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, who has presided for nine years over the  
government of a drug-torn city.  Federal money appropriated to prosecute drug traffic and drug  
use rose by 1,000 per cent between Nixon and Clinton.  We have seen oscillations in drug use,  
especially a sharp diminution in cocaine consumption, but these have little hearing on the  
intensity of the drug war.  It is for that reason that the panelists join in concluding that, this side  
of draconian punishment (flogging?) (hanging?) (public?), the drug war cannot claim victory. 
<p> 
<b>10. Where Do You Draw the Line?</b> 
<p> 
<i>" How, do you make the decision which is which?  You did not distinguish among drugs.  
Are there no drugs that should be banned, and if some should be how is the line drawn?" 
<p=align right>-Francis S. Webster III, Austin, Texas</i> 
<p> 
The text on the cover of the drug issue read, 
<p> 
THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST 
<p> 
<i>-Kill it<br> 
-Go for Legalization<br> 
-Free up Police, Courts<br> 
-Reduce Crime</i><br> 
<p> 
The panelists were not asked to draw the line.  But in order to accomplish the stated objectives  
(free up police, courts; reduce crime), the profit from the merchandising of drugs would need to  
be all but abolished.  This means, clearly, legal access to the most popular drug (Marijuana) and  
the runner-up (cocaine).  For most users, soft drugs are preferred over the most toxic, even as  
beer and wine are preferred over 200-proof alcohol.  Crack cocaine is of course readily deduced  
as a (now) cheap byproduct of cocaine. 
<p> 
There is some evidence that crack cocaine can induce violent conduct.  How, then, to handle the  
hypothetical buyer who enters a federal drugstore and asks for crack cocaine? Perhaps as was for  
so many years required in New Zealand of customers for beer - that they consume it on the  
premises. But on such specifics, the panelists were not questioned. Dr. Szasz is, on the subject,  
a libertarian absolute. My sense of it is that most of the others would move step by step provided  
the profit in drugs were hugely reduced.  A beginning might be the legalization of marijuana. 
<p> 
<b>11. Alcohol and Drugs</b> 
<p> 
<i>"... you make the ludicrous mistake of comparing alcohol with drugs. With alcohol, you may  
have a hangover, but you will never experience a 'snapback' to full and complete intoxication.  
Take a visit to a drug hospital. You will see people wandering around like mind-numbed robots,  
oblivious to the world around them." 
<p=align right>-Oliver A. Rockwog, La Puente, California</i> 
<p> 
To compare drugs and alcohol is not to equate them.  An analogy, by definition, marks  
similarities on the understanding that there are also dissimilarities.  Marijuana, cocaine, and  
whisky are all psychotropic drugs.  Of the three, only marijuana can't kill - there is no record of  
death from overdose.  Alcohol is responsible for an estimated 100,000 premature deaths every  
year.  And alcohol is the most common wrecker of personal and professional lives, and by far the  
most common inducement to crime and mayhem.  The damage done by drugs to the human body  
similarly varies.  There are the cocaine-induced zombies, some of whom will never recover, and  
the alcoholics who suffer from more than a hangover because when they wake they turn again to  
the bottle. 
<p> 
The primary distinction is that alcohol is a happy part of Western culture, and there is the  
presumptive case against introducing another species of psychotropic drug into that culture.  But  
the panelists, in the issue under discussion, weren't arguing in favor of a supplementary drug.   
We were addressing the question: What do we do under the present circumstances? - having  
failed to stop drug traffic, and become progressively accustomed to privations caused by the  
endless war against drugs? 
<p> 
<b>12. Hard-Drug Users are Criminals to Begin With</b> 
<p> 
<i>"As a 22-year prosecutor in a small rural town, I believe I have a better view of the everyday  
criminal than does a big-city prosecutor. Marijuana is a fairly harmless substance that could be  
legalized without any real effect on the crime problem in general.  Marijuana is a substance  
whose effects on the lives of those who take it are similar to alcohol, and people who use it have  
the ability to be normally functioning members of society. 
<p> 
"On the level of everyday street crime, however, the drug laws are a major advantage to law  
enforcement.  Most of the '50 percent' of criminals in prison for drug offences are not there  
because they are major dealers or dealers at all.  They are there because they have a long history  
of criminality prior to being caught with drugs.  Possession of drugs is both easy to prove and  
very inexpensive to prosecute.  But when you send these people to prison, you prevent  
innumerable thefts and acts of violence.  Only very rarely is violence by drug addicts directly  
related to drugs themselves." 
<p=-align right>-Fred Schroeder, Marysville, California</i> 
<p> 
The point pays on a theme widely distracting.  Some students of the drug question believe that  
drug traffic is, as here suggested, merely a convenient vehicle for criminal energies that will find  
another outlet should the profit in drugs come to an end.  What percentage of the drug-related  
prison population falls into this category (Category #1) is of course unknown.  But it is known  
that many non-criminally-inclined Americans have experimented with drugs (we have used the  
figure 70 million).  Some of these, caught in the act, are in jail (Category #2).  And then there are  
those who become addicted and, in order to satisfy their craving, engage in criminal activity  
they'd never have engaged in but for their addiction and the high price of drugs.  They are in jail  
either because they were detected in theft, or because they were caught consuming or trafficking  
in drugs (Category #3).  The argument that in order to expedite the imprisonment of Category # 1  
we should not object to the imprisonment of Categories #2 and #3 is not persuasive.

<b>13. 'I Saw What Happened ...'</b> 
<p> 
<i>"I saw what happened to promising young men and women in the late Sixties and Seventies  
when drugs were popularized.  I had to raise four children under peer pressure.... I saw the  
'burnouts' and the dropouts.  It would rear you to pieces.  I saw friends of my sons go off to the  
University of Michigan clean and come back hopelessly on drugs.  I saw families spending  
themselves into bankruptcy trying to dry them out."

<p> 
Who "popularized" drugs?  An indulgent lifestyle.  You write of the burnouts you have seen.   
How do you propose to diminish their number?  They are there notwithstanding our war on  
drugs. What do you propose?  Longer prison terms? 
<p> 
<b>14. It's Simple: It's Wrong</b> 
<p> 
<i>"I started using marijuana at age 14, speed at 15, mescaline and LSD at 16, THC at 17,  
cocaine at 18, and freebasing cocaine at 22. I know from first-hand experience what the use of  
illegal drugs can do.... I started doing drugs at age 14 and continued until I reached the age of 27,  
when I overdosed on cocaine.  I believe that I am better expert than any pundit who has ever read  
a paper, done a test, or contributed to any article.  I know why drugs should never be legalized: to  
use drugs is wrong. Simple, isn't it?  But that is where we must all begin to answer the question  
involved here. 
<p> 
"Drug use is wrong; to consciously ingest any substance for the purpose of changing or altering  
your mood is wrong.  The effects of long-term drug use are clearly proven; to be involved in  
drug use while young affects the mind while growing up; it shapes the emotions of the pubescent  
who is going through the normal growing pains that all must go through, yet doesn't allow the  
teenager to view life through a normal viewpoint.  I know.  I have had to learn how to deal with  
people all over again since coming clean. It cannot be repeated enough: the use of drugs for the  
purpose of enjoyment is wrong. 
<p> 
"I know.  I have done drugs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,  
Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South  
Carolina, California, Washington, Vancouver, B. C., Hawaii, Guam, Philippines, Thailand, Sri  
Lanka, Mombasa Kenya, and Singapore.  I have done drugs at Parris Island during boot camp;  
Cherry Point, North Carolina; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; 29 Palms, California; on board the USS  
LaMoore County, USS Okinawa, and USS Belleau Wood.  It's wrong."

We agree, it's wrong.  And your experiences certainly document that the war against drugs has  
failed.... You were wise to leave Singapore.  If caught, you would not have completed your

<b>15. The View from Abroad</b> 
<p> 
<i>"As a career Foreign Service Officer, I have served in drug-producing countries and seen the  
disastrous effects our policy has on those nations and how it benefits our enemies.  We have  
created new sources of funds for politicos and cops already disposed to corruption.  We risk the  
lives of brave American agents in a fight in which our 'allies' have no interest and see, rightly, as  
our problem, not theirs.  We have huge bureaucracies in the State Department, Pentagon, CIA,  
DEA, FBI, AID, and Justice and legions of Beltway bandits thriving on the 'war' and its  
programs, conferences, etc.  But the drugs still come; prices still drop; availability still rises - and  
the body count in our streets doesn't stop.  The war is a massive fraud with incalculable negative  
effects at home and abroad."

<b>16. Devolution</b> 
<p> 
<i>"The most embarrassing aspect of the articles was that Steven 'I-am-not-a-conservative' Duke  
was the only person to recognize what we should do: devolve the matter to the states.  Let Utah  
maintain its prohibition, let the People's Republic of New York legalize ... and let NR stop  
searching for a national solution."

it is illegal, how are you going to do so after it is legalized?  I have two sons who are alcoholics.  
One of my uncles and my older brother both drank themselves to death.  I shudder to think of the  
additional tragedies we would have had to deal with if drugs were legal.  Our laws against drug  
use are important, Mr. Buckley. May God help you to see that and to engage the enemies of right  
behavior.

<blockquote><b>Abstract</b> - Legitimate human research with hallucinogenic drugs, although 
of great theoretical and practical interest, involves daunting regulatory hurdles that have 
discouraged investigators from attempting such work.  Using the example of the author's own 
application for and receipt of federal permission to administer N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) 
to humans, this article reviews the application process, obstacles and their solutions, and the local 
and federal issues involved.  Further human research with hallucinogens is possible if a persistent 
and collaborative effort is made with the relevant institutions that oversee the performance of this 
type of research.
<p>
<b>Keywords</b> - dimethyltryptamine, hallucinogens, human research, public policy
</blockquote>
<p>
When I first considered initiating a human research project with N,N-dimethyltryptamine 
(DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen that has also been a drug of abuse, I was reminded by many 
professional associates of the pitfalls involving research with drugs in Schedule I of the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).  One leading authority on hallucinogen structure-
activity relationships remarked to me in half jest that the sole paper he saw coming out of this 
attempt would be one describing the impossibility of such work in the present climate of war 
against drug abuse.  The psychedelic research community, especially those whose orientation 
focuses on the use of these drugs as catalysts of the psychotherapeutic and/or creative process, is 
uniformly pessimistic with regard to human studies ever proceeding with Schedule I compounds, 
such as LSD, mescaline, psilocybin or DMT.
<p>
The CSA placed all medications and drugs of abuse into five categories or schedules, depending 
on their "medical utility," "abuse potential," and "safety of use under medical supervision." 
Schedule I is the most restrictive category into which drugs with no known medical use, high 
abuse potential, and a lack of demonstrated safety under medical supervision are placed.  The 
CSA also provided a mechanism for the movement of drugs into and out of various categories.  
For example, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was rescheduled in the 1980s from Schedule I to 
Schedule II, after evidence of its efficacy in treating nausea and vomiting following cancer 
chemotherapy was convincingly demonstrated.  However, methaqualone's rescheduling from 
Schedule III to Schedule I occurred as a consequence of its widespread abuse.
<p>
The placement of hallucinogens into Schedule I was controversial because studies had clearly 
demonstrated their safety under medical supervision (Strassman 1984).  Although their medical 
therapeutic utility in several pathological conditions had not been irrefutably demonstrated, their 
use in research elucidating brain-consciousness issues was very promising.  Nevertheless, further 
study of their potential utility for a variety of conditions could not be conducted after the CSA 
was passed; consequently, investigators were required to return their supplies of these drugs.
<p>
The abuse potential of these drugs was clearly high; it was this characteristic that seems to have 
been the major factor in their placement in Schedule I. Fortunately, animal research continued 
unabated, providing the focal point for the recent explosion of information about the 
neurotransmitter, serotonin, and its receptor subtypes in the brain.  These receptors play a role in 
sleep, aggression, mood, sexuality, and psychosis, as well as the mechanism of action of the 
hallucinogens.  Schedule I drug research with animals is significantly easier, and high-purity 
hallucinogens are available to qualified investigators from the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA).  The primary hurdles in the case of animal research are those involving Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA) requirements for security of the storage and/or disposal facilities, 
and making certain that those who will be handling these drugs do not have a criminal record.
<p>

<center><b>The Research Proposal</b></center>
<p>
For clinical studies with humans, one needs to begin with a research protocol in which the 
rationale for hallucinogenic drug administration is described in detail.  The protocol requires a 
clear statement of why one is interested in giving hallucinogens to people and what one hopes to 
measure or observe.  One must be careful not to put the cart before the horse in this type of work.  
Psychiatric research workers sometimes spend excessive effort in applying drugs or other 
treatments of unknown mechanism of action to psychiatric disorders of tremendous 
heterogeneity, even within single diagnostic categories.  Furthermore, basic psychophysiological 
mechanisms are inferred from research in psychiatrically ill patients before a clear understanding 
of the normal physiology of the variable under investigation is known.  It is important to 
systematically investigate in normal subjects how hormones, drugs or other factors work before 
explaining pathophysiological states and treating or studying psychiatric patients.
<p>
Similarly, before suggesting that psychedelic drugs can cure everything from neurosis to 
hangnails, one is better served by first applying current tools of psychopharmacologic research to 
shed light on the basic effects of these drugs, both psychological and biological.  Subsequently, 
these drugs could be prudently applied to disorders whose etiology or symptomatology interface 
with the known effects of hallucinogens.  This approach seems more likely to provide useful data 
than a more seat-of-the-pants approach.
<p>
In my case, I approached the task of beginning a new human psychedelic drug research study 
from two angles.  The first was from the vantage point of schizophrenia.  In the 1960s and 1970s, 
DMT had been considered a prime candidate for the so-called endogenous schizotoxin.  One 
theory suggested that overproduction of DMT might be related to the psychotic process seen in 
schizophrenic disorders (Gillin et al. 1976).  Failure to demonstrate differences in DMT levels in 
several body fluids between normals and schizophrenics prompted the discontinuation of studies 
either giving DMT or measuring DMT levels.  However, newer data concerning the role of 
serotonin in both endogenous and drug-induced hallucinations has provided a new approach to 
understanding the etiology of hallucinogenesis (Fischman 1983).  At the most basic level, one 
might suggest that drugs that could block the hallucinations of DMT might also be 
antihallucinogenic in patients with schizophrenia.  Thus, understanding how DMT worked in 
normals had relevance to a major public health problem.
<p>
I also approached a clinical study of hallucinogens from the drug abuse perspective.  
Hallucinogens continue to be used and abused by people in the United States, particularly in 
college-age populations (18-25 years), at about the same rate now as 20 years ago (Pope et al. 
1990).  In spite of the tremendous advances in understanding hallucinogens' effects and 
pharmacology in lower animals, the necessary interface of human psychopharmacology and 
animal neuropharmacology requires human studies.  The human biology of these compounds has 
relevance to more specific treatments for acute adverse effects (e.g., the bad trip), understanding 
the effects of chronic use, and evaluating the effects of newly synthesized designer compounds as 
they appear on the street.
<p>
An important element of both of these approaches involved the development of a new rating 
scale for the effects of DMT, one that has less pathology-oriented ratings than previous scales.  
The Addiction Research Center Inventory (Haertzen, Hill & Belleville 1963), more or less the 
benchmark for assessing subjective effects of drugs in humans, contains what is known as the 
LSD Scale, which is commonly known as the dysphoria scale.  Certainly hallucinogens can 
produce unpleasant effects, but they can be distinguished from other drugs by more than that 
quality.  It seemed important to describe in more neutral phenomenological terms what actually 
is observed in the psychedelic state, particularly for subjects who seek out these drugs.
<p>
Both of these research directions also required basic dose-response investigations.  Is there a 
relationship between dose and the effect of DMT, subjectively and biologically?  Building on 
older clinical literature, interviews with experienced DMT users, and newer animal data, one 
might anticipate which experiences and biological effects would be seen.  Dose-response studies 
could then be initiated.  The biological factors I decided to examine involved hormonal 
(neuroendocrine) effects of DMT as downstream markers of effects on central serotonergic 
neurotransmission.  I also speculated that serotonin receptor activation would be reflected in 
effects on basic vegetative variables, such as core body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, 
and pupillary diameter.  Subjective effects would be measured by the newly designed rating 
scale.  This basic human research could provide the foundation for more detailed experimental 
interventions.  Follow-up studies might include differential effects of DMT in selected patient 
populations with presumed abnormalities of serotonergic neurotransmission (e.g., schizophrenia, 
affective disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder), selective blockade of subtypes of serotonin 
receptors to begin assessing receptor subtypes responsible for specific neuroendocrine and 
subjective effects, and experiments in which repeated doses of DMT are administered in an 
attempt to develop acute tolerance to the drug.
<p>
A research protocol needs to provide an adequate discussion of background information (i.e., 
what is and is not known about the area to be investigated), hypotheses (findings that one hopes 
will be derived from the study and how these data will answer specific questions), a plan of 
investigation (what one will do and why), a consideration of risks and benefits to the subjects 
involved and how the risks will be managed (with plans to deal with adverse reactions), sample 
size determination, data management, references/bibliography, and an informed-consent 
document.  Sample size determination and data management are relatively simple issues, if one 
has read the literature, has some idea of the direction and size of expected changes, and can 
consult with a qualified biostatistician.
<p>
University research offices have copies of US Public Health Service Form 396, which is used in 
federal grant applications.  This form contains an outline covering all the aspects of a research 
protocol, with clear explanations of what each area should include.  It is the model research 
proposal format used by most nonfederal agencies as well.  Most institutional review boards 
(IRBs), local committees that review the relevant human-risk issues, like to have proposals 
written in a similar format (although generally in less scientific detail).
<p>
In order to decrease the risks involved in this project my protocol involved using only 
experienced hallucinogenic drug users.  Administering a drug like DMT to naive subjects seemed 
to be a high-risk venture.  Level of experience was determined by an informal interview focusing 
on extent of psychedelic drug use as well as negative and positive effects experienced by 
prospective subjects.  Special attention was paid to assessing the presence of defenses 
characteristically known to be associated with negative reactions to hallucinogens, specifically 
denial and projection (Barr et al. 1972).  Furthermore, experienced subjects are better able to 
report on subjective effects and to compare and contrast their past experiences with DMT and/or 
other psychedelics.  Finally, from a purely legal point of view, litigation claiming long-term 
brain or personality damage or subsequent problems with drug abuse would be less sustainable in 
subjects with extensive past use of psychedelics.

<center><b>Local Issues</b></center>
<p>
<b>The Institutional Review Board</b>
<p>
Once the research protocol has been written (and hopefully reviewed and critiqued by 
knowledgeable colleagues), it must be reviewed and approved by the local IRB.  This is a 
requirement for any research involving human subjects.  The function of IRBs is to assure the 
safety of participating human subjects and, depending on the particular IRB, the scientific merit 
of the study.  The latter element almost always is given greater attention by the scientific review 
committee of the research site in which the study will actually take place.  The IRB may also 
recommend changes in and approves the informed-consent document that accompanies the 
protocol.  Once approval by the local IRB and performance site is obtained, the process of 
obtaining federal approval can begin.
<p>
Issues with the IRB can be complex if one does not work within a university/medical school 
setting.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published guidelines for university- 
and nonuniversity-affiliated IRBs.  This information is available through the FDA's Office of 
Health Affairs.  Nonuniversity IRBs may be local or may not be if local ones do not have the 
requisite expertise and/or it is a multisite study and the relevant IRB is at a different site.  One 
can even hire an IRB that may work with nonuniversity-affiliated investigators, but they may 
charge exorbitant fees.  If one is interested in creating an IRB, the requisite composition of an 
IRB is clearly defined in FDA guidelines.  However, this is not recommended because it would 
create an unnecessary bureaucratic nightmare, independent of the major goal of receiving IRB 
approval.  It is preferable to use an IRB that already exists.
<p>
From the outset, I had to explain to the IRB that even if I received their approval, I could not 
initiate any studies until the FDA and the DEA review processes were completed and their 
approvals obtained.  Local approval was the necessary first step before I could submit my request 
to the federal review process.
<p>
The IRB at the University of New Mexico was most interested in the nature of the informed-
consent document They requested two things that were somewhat difficult to address.  The first 
issue was that of Schedule I drug use in humans.  If a drug has no medical use and cannot be 
used safely under medical supervision (the criteria for placement into Schedule I), how could I 
justify human research with it?  They requested that I add the phrase "this drug has no known 
medical use" to the informed-consent document. I responded by referring to the hundreds of 
articles on the human use of LSD and nearly a dozen on DMT before the drugs were scheduled, 
demonstrating that they could be used safely under medical supervision, and that in many ways 
the Schedule I placement was not a medical but a legal definition.  I asked to be able to state only 
that it "had no <i>current</i> medical use," which they agreed to.  Ultimately, I was able to 
remove even that phrase by arguing that if FDA approval was obtained, "no current medical use" 
was no longer true, as I would have demonstrated its utility as a tool for medical research.
<p>
The IRB's second concern was that I describe in the informed-consent document what the 
subjects might experience on the drug.  Clearly, one can choose from the most hellish to the most 
beatific descriptions of the psychedelic drug-induced state, with a strong biasing effect on the 
subjects.  I opted for a balanced description of effects of the range of symptoms, with a slight 
emphasis on pleasurable and interesting effects.  I justified this more sanguine view by 
summarizing the results of my interviews with over 20 essentially normal DMT users, all but one 
of whom described their DMT experiences in an extremely positive light.  There also were no 
published reports of serious psychiatric sequelae (e.g., psychosis lasting more than 24 hours) in 
normals given the drug.  I did suggest the possibility of serious emotional reactions to the 
experience induced by DMT, and that in the most extreme case, psychiatric hospitalization was 
available.  However, I was able to assuage the IRB's concerns slightly by emphasizing that these 
were quite experienced hallucinogen users, many of whom had had bad trips that had been 
informative and developmentally useful in their ability to manage subsequent experiences with 
psychedelics.
<p>
<b>The Performance Site Scientific Review Committee</b>
<p>
More or less parallel to the IRB process is that of scientific review by the committee that 
oversees studies in the research center.  My project was to take place in the General Clinical 
Research Center (CRC) of the University of New Mexico Hospital, funded by the National 
Institutes of Health to provide beds and nursing as well as laboratory and statistical support for 
CRC-approved human research proposals.  Projects are submitted to the CRC Advisory 
Committee and need to follow the same general guidelines as do submissions to the IRB, with a 
naturally greater emphasis on the scientific rationale for the proposed project.  There was less 
difficulty in obtaining CRC approval than IRB approval, as the CRC assumed that the IRB 
would address the overriding issues of risk and informed consent. The CRC requested an 
additional literature review to support my requests for measurements of the hormones I was 
interested in evaluating.  They also wanted urine drug screens taken on the morning of every 
study day.  This was not to disqualify people from participating in the study, but to be able to 
assess the effects of a positive urine on the parameters under scrutiny.  Would a less robust 
prolactin response, for example, be associated with a positive urine screen for marijuana?  The 
Advisory Committee also wanted me to impress on subjects the importance of not taking any 
other drugs of abuse during the project to keep the data as clean as possible.
<p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>
<p>
One of the thorniest issues of the project was that of anonymity and confidentiality.  Admitting to 
the use of Schedule I compounds is admitting the commission of a federal offense and being 
liable for prosecution.  All of the subjects in this project are professionals, with spouses, families, 
reputations, and careers.  Therefore, strict anonymity and confidentiality were required.  Several 
meetings were held with the Medical Records Department, Legal Counsel for the University 
Hospital, Admitting Office, and Head Nurse of the CRC to discuss how to assure strict 
confidentiality and anonymity.  Furthermore, it is usually required that the signed informed-
consent document be attached to the subject's medical records, a situation impossible in this case.  
The final solution was complex but appears to be working well.  A subject coming in for an 
admission medical history, physical examination, and laboratory work (i.e., blood count and 
chemistries, electrocardiogram, thyroid functions, urinalysis) has a chart made up with his or her 
real name.  This is needed if at any time in the future the subject happens to visit the emergency 
room or clinics, then baseline medical data will be available for comparison.  However, subjects' 
charts are not associated with my DMT protocol number.  As I have run several projects through 
the CRC over the years, my being their physician of record is not in itself particularly 
incriminating. (I just as easily could have had another physician sign these forms; if this were the 
only project I had ever performed at the CRC, having me sign their papers might be seen as their 
admitting to the use of illegal drugs).  The subjects' screening psychiatric examination as well as 
every admission for the project occurs under a code name and hospital chart number.  Ultimately, 
the Medical Records Department allowed me to be the only person with the code.  The more 
people who have confidential information, the more likely it will be compromised.  I was also 
the sole possessor of the signed informed-consent documents and had to state that clearly on 
every admitting form.
<p>
The informed-consent clauses regarding confidentiality went through some evolution as the 
process unfolded.  I had previously run a study giving melatonin, a pineal hormone and an 
experimental nonscheduled drug, in a clinical research setting that required FDA approval.  In 
that case, I had stated that the FDA and the manufacturer of melatonin could have access to 
participants' medical records.  In my first informed-consent document for the DMT experiment, I 
originally indicated that the FDA, DEA (as also involved in the regulatory process), and the 
manufacturer of DMT (at that time undetermined) might, under extraordinary circumstances, 
have access to the medical records.  This met with universal alarm.  The following was the final 
solution to the issue of informed consent: if the FDA or the manufacturer was interested in 
interviewing subjects and/or having access to their medical records for scientific purposes, they 
would need to go through me, who then would determine whether or not individuals were indeed 
willing to do this.  Records theoretically could be subpoenaed, but that would be vigorously 
fought.  And, as I am the only one with the key to the code, I would refuse to divulge the key if 
this should occur.
<p>
<b>State Pharmacy Board Schedule I Permission</b>
<p>
The last local issue was getting my state of New Mexico Schedule I permit, which is necessary 
before the DEA will process a Schedule I request.  This varies from state to state, and the state 
board of pharmacy and/or the local DEA office knows if a state permit is necessary before 
applying for DEA approval.  This was relatively easy.  I submitted the appropriate form, 
including an abbreviated version of the protocol and approval letters from the CRC and IRB.  
This permission was granted at the board's next meeting.
<p>

<p>
<a name="fed"></a>
<center><b>Federal Issues</b></center>
<p>
One should never send anything important to any federal agency by regular mail; always send it 
by express mail or with a return receipt requested.  Also, always take detailed notes whenever 
speaking with anyone at any federal agency.  Get names and phone numbers because one rarely 
gets the needed person the first time; he or she is often at the end of a long chain of in-house 
transfers from extension to extension.  Write down as much as possible from every conversation.  
Refer to these phone calls in your mail correspondence to let the relevant agency know you are 
taking notes and to ensure accurate communication.
<p>
One will need to deal with at least two federal agencies in the application process: the DEA and 
the FDA.  At times, their responsibilities overlap in vague and poorly defined ways.  By going 
through the application process in a methodical and persistent manner, defects in this two-tier 
system became clearer and gradually worked themselves out.  My overall impression of the 
process is that the difficulties I encountered were not due to intentional malicious roadblocking 
but uncertainty regarding who had final authority in a particular matter and what were the proper 
channels through which my request should be funneled.  This, combined with generic 
bureaucratic inefficiency, resulted in a 21-month process from the date of application to final 
approval to begin the study.  Even so, with my initial expectations, I was pleased that the process 
even went that quickly.
<p>
<b>Funding: An Aid to Obtaining Federal Approval</b>
<p>
I submitted a research grant proposal to a nonfederal granting agency, the Scottish Rite 
Foundation for Schizophrenia Research, at approximately the same time I began the FDA-DEA 
approval process, which was in the spring of 1989. I would encourage all potential investigators 
in this field to consider a similar course.  First of all, one's scientific reasoning is sharpened by 
the grant review process, and if the FDA and/or DEA review turns out to be inordinately long, 
the feedback obtained from the granting agencies' review boards may anticipate objections likely 
to originate at the federal regulatory level.  If such a grant is approved, this enhances the 
likelihood of FDA/DEA taking note of the scientific credibility of the proposed work.  I received 
a one-year award from the Scottish Rite Foundation to recruit subjects, develop a way to measure 
DMT in blood (the DMT assay), interview subjects who had smoked DMT in the past in order to 
draft a DMT rating scale, and pursue FDA-DEA approval.  A second year was approved pending 
FDA approval.  An application for a NIDA grant was made in June 1989.  This was approved 
and funding started in May 1990, essentially at the end of the first year of the Scottish Rite grant.  
The NIDA grant then took over where the Scottish Rite grant left off, a fortunate case of good 
timing.  Both these awards were extremely helpful in prompting the FDA and the DEA to pay 
more attention to my request to get started with the experiments.
<p>
<b>The Drug Enforcement Administration:<br>
The Schedule I Permit</b>
<p>
DEA approval, although slow, was not particularly complicated.  There is an application form 
specifically for Schedule I drugs (DEA Form 225: Application for Registration Under Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970) that is available from Washington or the local DEA branch.  This is 
different from the routine Schedules II-V form that all medical practitioners use to obtain 
approval to routinely prescribe controlled substances (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).  There is a 
four-digit code number for all scheduled drugs that needs to be placed in its respective box on the 
form.  Not everyone at the DEA knows these numbers.  I did not realize it at the time but the 
back of the front page of form DEA 225 has a list of many scheduled compounds (including 
DMT) with their respective drug codes.  Should there be any difficulty in determining the correct 
drug code number, one can call the Registration Branch of the DEA in Washington.  I was 
inadvertently given the National Drug Code number for DMT by the DEA in Washington over 
the telephone.  My entire application packet was returned to me a month after I submitted it with 
a request for the right number, accompanied by a piece of paper with all the appropriate numbers 
for my information.  Along with this properly completed form an abbreviated version of the 
protocol needs to be included, along with IRB and scientific review committee letters of 
approval.  One also needs to describe the security arrangements for storing and handling a 
Schedule I compound, which the pharmacy can provide on their official stationery.
<p>
After several months of phone calls, inquiring as to the status of my application, I learned it had 
been sent to the regional DEA office in Denver.  From there, it was sent to the local DEA office 
in Albuquerque.  The local DEA agent assigned to my case then came out to the University of 
New Mexico a couple of times.  She inspected the security system in the pharmacy (and found 
some weaknesses in the system that required correction), instructed that a special freezer with its 
own lock be purchased that was to be placed in the controlled-substances vault in the pharmacy 
(which was already kept locked and guarded 24 hours a day), interviewed me and the manager of 
the pharmacy, and requested the names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers 
of all the people who would have access to the DMT and/or have keys to the freezer (several 
laboratory personnel and pharmacists, primarily; I do not have a key to the freezer).  She then ran 
security checks on me and all those whose names were provided to check for any criminal 
records.  After being satisfied with the security checks, locked freezer, and improvements in the 
security system, she described to me the consequences of poor record keeping and unexpected 
losses of drug supplies.  She wrote an approval letter to the DEA office in Washington.  After a 
month or two of keeping track of this letter, I encountered another unexpected difficulty.
<p>
My project required laboratory-grade DMT for the assay, which I could purchase from Sigma 
Chemical without difficulty once I received my Schedule I order forms.  This form of DMT did 
not need to meet the many requirements necessary for human administration.  It could be taken 
off the shelf of a chemical supply house and used directly for laboratory or animal work.  The 
project also required getting permission to obtain and possess clinical-grade DMT for human 
administration.  This form of DMT needs to be certified by the FDA as safe for human use.  
However, the DEA had no recent experience processing a request for administering a Schedule I 
drug to humans and had difficulty in differentiating the two requests.  They were reluctant to let 
me order laboratory-grade DMT until I had received FDA permission to go ahead with the 
human study.  However, FDA approval for this could not occur until I found a source for, and 
established the safety of, a clinical-grade DMT.  I asked the FDA for their help in interfacing 
with the DEA's pharmacist, and finally succeeded in getting the DEA to distinguish between the 
two requests.  Soon thereafter, I was issued my Schedule I permit, with order blanks, and could 
order DMT from Sigma Chemical for the laboratory.  Once I received FDA approval to begin 
human administration of DMT (from, at that point, an unknown source) I was to notify the DEA 
of this but no additional paperwork was required.
<p>
<b>The Food and Drug Administration:<br>
The Investigational New Drug Application<br>
and the Drug Master File</b>
<p>
The application process with the FDA involved two steps.  Usually, if a drug is used for a purely 
experimental study, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application needs to be submitted.  This 
was quite simple in the case of my previous melatonin study in 1985.  At that time, I worked 
with Sigma F & D, a division of Sigma Chemical, who had a Drug Master File (DMF) for 
melatonin on file at the FDA.  After I spoke with and wrote to Sigma they authorized the FDA to 
access their DMF on melatonin on my behalf.  The FDA looked at the manufacturing data, 
chemical purity tests, and other information on melatonin in the DMF and then gave me 
permission to order the melatonin.  After the pharmacy prepared it in a solution appropriate for 
injection, I tested the sterility and pyrogenicity (ability to cause fever), sent in this information, 
and shortly thereafter received permission to proceed with the study.
<p>
Since 1985, and particularly since the early 1970s, when a group at the National Institute of 
Mental Health (NIMH) received permission to give DMT to humans, regulations have become 
much stricter at the FDA, particularly regarding injectable drugs.  DMF requirements are more 
elaborate and require a full pedigree of the compound (i.e., statements regarding the source and 
purity of all precursors, assessment of purity and identification of contaminants in all 
intermediary synthetic compounds, and more documentation regarding the composition and 
characteristics of the final product that would ultimately be given to subjects).  Therefore, when I 
submitted my IND application for DMT, I again believed that Sigma F & D would be able to 
provide the drug and that the process would be analogously simple.  I spoke with and wrote to 
Sigma F & D, who agreed to set up a DMF for their DMT.  I sent in my IND application forms, 
along with copies of the IRB and scientific committee approvals, a copy of the informed-consent 
document and a brief description of the study, hoping that the FDA would accept Sigma F & D's 
information.
<p>
The forms used to apply for an IND are FDA 1571 and 1572, each of which is two pages long.  
Form 1571 contains an interesting clause that might be of use when trying to study drugs that 
have been previously investigated.  This clause, which can be checked as part of an application 
procedure, is a "request for reinstatement of an IND that is withdrawn, inactivated, terminated or 
discontinued." DMT had been studied by a group of investigators at NIMH in the 1970s (Gillin 
et al. 1976) and another group in Chicago had used the NIMH IND for a series of their own 
studies somewhat later (Meltzer et al. 1980). I thought that I might be able to use information 
from the old IND to speed the approval process for my own application.
<p>
Documents sent to the FDA enter via the Documents Room, and from there letters are routed to 
the appropriate division.  In the four years since my melatonin IND was issued, a new division 
has been formed for Pilot Drug Evaluation, to which my DMT IND application was referred a 
week or two after its arrival in Washington.  The FDA then sent me a standard form letter 
acknowledging receipt of the application, the name of the drug for which the application was 
made, and the IND number.  It was signed by the responsible Consumer Safety Officer (CSO) 
with a phone number and routing address. (Never fail to write the IND number on the top of any 
future correspondence with the FDA.  Without it, letters will languish forever in the Documents 
Room awaiting someone who has the time to figure out what the IND number is and, by default, 
where it needs to go.) This letter stated that unless I heard from the FDA within 30 days of the 
date stamped on the top of the form letter (generally 10-15 days after sending the application) I 
could proceed with the study.  This is standard procedure for the FDA on receipt of any IND 
application.
<p>
At this point, it is necessary to begin intensive telephone contact with the review section staff.  I 
began calling as soon as I received the name of my project manager (PM).  Of course, the main 
problem with the IND application was that I had no source of drug, and the FDA could not grant 
me permission to begin a study without the DMT.  It was therefore on "Hold" (an official FDA 
term) from the outset.  However, I needed to begin finding out who could make the drug, and 
what information I would need to send to the FDA concerning the compound.  Within a couple 
of months, I received a detailed letter from the FDA requesting the necessary information 
regarding preparation of the bulk drug, and the characteristics of the clinical form of the drug that 
I actually planned to administer.
<p>
The two primary contacts one first works with on the section staff are the CSO (or PM) and the 
chemist.  The FDA has two charges in a case like this: the first is to assure the safety of human 
subjects, and the second is to give some scientific guidance to optimize the chances that the 
experiments with humans will provide valid and valuable data.  A chemist is involved because 
no drug company makes Schedule I drugs for human use anymore.  My request was linked to the 
finding of a source for the actual drug; the chemist needed to help me with this process.  Even if 
a drug company was making the drug, the FDA chemist would still be involved in assessing and 
examining the DMF to assure that the drug was safe for human use.  Safety in this context means 
assuring that the drug is in a high state of purity (99+%) and contains no toxic impurities.  The 
chemist must evaluate the manufacturing process and analytical data (the chemical pedigree) for 
the drug in order to certify these requirements.  The PM, on the other hand, interfaces with the 
scientific staff at the FDA regarding scientific matters.
<p>
I was aided in the area of scientific concern by virtue of having received IRB and CRC input and 
approval.  I also was fortunate to have received the Scottish Rite and then NIDA funding for the 
project.  The review processes involved in these grants sharpened the science of the project, and 
funding from outside agencies greatly enhanced my credibility.
<p>
<b>The Search for Clinical-Grade Dimethyltryptamine</b>
<p>
Acquiring the DMT for the study was a complex process, and at one point in time I began to fear 
that the whole project would come to a dead end because satisfactory DMT could not be 
obtained.  When a drug has been made for human use, be it by a pharmaceutical company or a 
private concern, the FDA has a DMF on it, containing detailed information regarding synthesis 
of the drug and its pedigree.  Drug companies have large chemistry laboratories that provide this 
information to the FDA, and they are familiar with the process of setting up a DMF for any 
particular compound.  The DMF also contains information regarding animal and human toxicity 
data, when relevant.  Fortunately, in the past, DMT had been given in numerous animal studies 
and nearly a dozen human studies.  Therefore, the toxicity issue did not concern this particular 
drug.
<p>
My IND application was complicated by the fact that it was necessary to establish a DMF for the 
DMT, in addition to acquiring permission to give the drug for an experimental purpose.  If a 
study was designed to use a drug currently in use (e.g., morphine) for research on a nonindicated 
use (e.g., to control high blood pressure in an emergency setting), a drug company could simply 
authorize the FDA to access their DMF on the researcher's behalf.  However, no DMF existed for 
DMT.  One hope I held out was that I might acquire DMT from some source, and if it were not 
pure enough, I could purify it to the required level.  However, at a very early stage in the 
negotiations it was clear that this was not satisfactory to the FDA.  The pedigree and detailed 
synthetic information had to be provided.
<p>
With the aid of the FDA chemist, I was able to track down (in the Federal Archives Building) the 
old IND for DMT that was used at NIMH in the 1970s.  Recall that I was hoping to reactivate an 
expired IND, using data acquired by NIMH researchers.  However, the information in that IND 
was wholly inadequate for current FDA requirements: there was no DMF in their IND. The IND 
file said that Aldrich Chemical in Chicago had made the DMT for the NIMH study.  I contacted 
Aldrich, but they had never compiled a DMF for the drug nor did they distribute the compound 
anymore.  The NIMH group, whom I subsequently contacted, no longer had either their IND 
records or any information regarding the drug.
<p>
Sigma F & D, as described previously, was willing to supply the FDA with as much information 
as it had available regarding their DMT in order to set up a DMF on the compound.  However, 
they did not actually manufacture the drug; a source in Europe supplied it to them.  The 
European source was unwilling to provide detailed information regarding their synthesis of the 
drug.  Therefore, Sigma F & D was ruled out as a source of DMT that could set up a valid DMF.
<p>
NIDA has made scheduled drugs available for animal studies, and has in fact supplied 
investigators with a nonhallucinogenic LSD analogue for human positron-emission tomography 
studies (Wong et al. 1987).  However, NIDA's DMT that was on the shelf was relatively old and 
did not have the pedigree and required synthetic information that the FDA required.
<p>
However, NIDA has a contract with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in Research Triangle 
Park, North Carolina.  RTI provided the THC for the marijuana/THC protocols in the 1970s that 
investigated the effects of these drugs on nausea and vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy.  
However, when I contacted RTI on NIDA's referral, they initially claimed they could not make 
drugs for human use because of liability concerns, but I was told by NIDA that not one suit has 
ever been brought against NIDA for the marijuana/THC study.  Although NIDA expressed their 
general concern about the lack of any reliable source of high-quality drugs of abuse for human 
studies, they stated that research with DMT was not of sufficient priority for them to pay RTI to 
make the drug to the specifications required by the FDA, even if RTI did agree to make it.  
Therefore, I would have to pay for the preparation.  These discussions with RTI and NIDA took 
place before my grant from NIDA was approved and funded.  After some negotiating, RTI 
agreed to prepare high-quality DMT and send me the information necessary to set up my own 
DMF for the drug.  They estimated the cost of such a synthesis, including the record keeping, to 
be "in the thousands," which was quite out of the range of my ability to pay.  Thus, RTI and 
NIDA were also effectively ruled out as sources for clinical-grade DMT.
<p>
Next, I tried NIMH, which has a Chemical Synthesis Program to make obscure research drugs 
for investigators.  Again, their contract stipulated that their drugs, even if prepared to the most 
exacting specifications, could not be used in humans.  However, the director of this program 
stated that he was considering changing the wording of their contract when it was up for renewal 
to be able to provide drugs for human studies.  This might be a source of such drugs for future 
investigators and should be pursued, but NIHM also had to be ruled out as a source of DMT for 
my own study.
<p>
I then asked a colleague with experience in synthesis of hallucinogens within a university setting 
if he would consider making the DMT for my project.  He declined, referring to the difficulties 
involved in acquiring a manufacturer's license through the DEA to distribute scheduled drugs.  I 
approached another colleague with similar experience within a university setting.  He had been 
keeping abreast of my futile search and was aware that I had about exhausted all possible 
avenues.  He finally agreed to consider making DMT to FDA specifications at cost, and thereby 
considerably less than the RTI quote.  However, manufacturer's licensing procedures are much 
stricter than regulations concerning individual laboratories' research use and he wanted assurance 
that making the drug for me would not break any DEA regulations.  After some effort, I found a 
division within the DEA, the office of Drug Research Registration, that regulates registration 
issues for researchers. They informed me of the "coincidental activities" clause within their 
regulations that allows registered researchers to prepare small batches of scheduled substances 
for collaborative research efforts rather than the sale-for-profit context of a manufacturer-
purchaser relationship.
<p>
At this point, when asked whether or not this would be a satisfactory arrangement from the 
FDA's point of view, the FDA chemist referred me to a physician on the drug abuse staff in the 
FDA's Pilot Drug Division.  He believed such an arrangement would be satisfactory.  He also 
quickly became my most important, responsive, and reliable liaison within the FDA.
<p>
My colleague who agreed to manufacture the DMT and I then submitted brief amendments to 
each of our DEA applications that would justify the preparation and possession of adequate 
amounts of DMT for a collaborative research effort.  We needed to provide the DEA with the 
reason for requesting this amendment, the amount of DMT involved, and a statement to the 
effect that this was a research, not a fiduciary, relationship.  A tremendous number of phone calls 
was required to keep this amendment moving through the maze of sections at the DEA.  One 
major delay was the DEA's request that the FDA approve this amendment.  The FDA did not 
believe this was necessary, although the DEA would not proceed past a certain point, until they 
received, in writing, FDA approval of this amendment.  I do not know where the truth actually 
lies in this case, although the FDA complied with the DEA's request.
<p>
DEA approval was thus obtained for my colleague to produce DMT.  Several months later, I 
received eight grams of DMT-fumarate (a form of DMT that FDA has approved for human use) 
and all the supporting documentation of the synthesis and analysis of this material necessary to 
set up a DMF in support of my IND.  The University of New Mexico Hospital Inpatient 
Pharmacy then prepared a dosage form of the DMT suitable for injection into humans.  This was 
a sterile nonirritating solution that was distributed into 50 sterile vials.
<p>
Finding out how many samples to subject to quality control was difficult. Guidelines at the FDA 
generally refer to pharmaceutical companies' massive lots of a drug.  After some discussion with 
the Pilot Drug Division and several other divisions within the FDA, it was agreed that I would 
use two vials each for the four tests necessary on the clinical form of the drug.  The following 
were the four tests: (1) Content Uniformity - Is the measured concentration in the vials actually 
that calculated? (2) Purity - Is the drug pure and/or free of potentially toxic chemical 
contaminants? (3) Sterility - Are there bacteria, yeast or other pathogens in the solution of DMT? 
(4) Pyrogenicity - Are there fever-producing bacterial fragments in the solution?  A fifth and 
related test is that of Stability - Are purity and content uniformity maintained over time?  The 
rigorousness of these criteria was in part determined by the fact that the drug was going to be 
injected, not given orally.  If the drug were to be given orally, some of these requirements would 
have been relaxed.
<p>
Purity and content uniformity can be performed on the same vials.  The University of New 
Mexico Hospital Toxicology Laboratory agreed to perform these tests using equipment already 
available for measuring levels of abused drugs in clinical samples (e.g., blood, urine).  Most 
toxicology laboratories have the requisite gas chromatography, mass spectrometry or high-
performance liquid chromatography equipment necessary for such work.  Any clinical 
microbiology laboratory can perform the necessary sterility testing for aerobic and anaerobic 
bacteria, yeasts/fungi, and actinomyces (similar to tuberculosis).  The fact that DMT is a 
Schedule I drug and the results were to be used to determine safety for human administration 
dissuaded the University of New Mexico Hospital Microbiology Laboratory from conducting 
these tests.  However, the New Mexico State Laboratory's Environmental Microbiology Section 
agreed to provide this service.  Pyrogenicity is usually determined by injecting a rabbit with a 
predetermined amount of drug and then measuring its temperature.  However, DMT raises body 
temperature in rabbits (as do all hallucinogens) by a pharmacological mechanism, independent of 
pyrogen presence.  Another test, the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, can be performed in a 
test tube and is also FDA approved.  Two laboratories with LAL expertise refused to handle a 
Schedule I drug; a third agreed (Scientific Associates of ST. Louis).  It is important to make 
certain that a quantitative result and raw data for the LAL test are obtained.  A simple presence or 
absence result is not adequate.
<p>
Stability testing can occur concurrently with the study and samples will be submitted for purity 
and concentration checks one and two months after preparation of the drug solution, and at three-
month intervals as long as the study is proceeding.  The pharmacy, as well, needed to prepare 
a report describing their preparation of the clinical form of the DMT.  Finally, my colleague had 
to prepare a large file on the drug's preparation, its pedigree, the qualifications of those who 
made it, and several tests as to its purity and identity.
<p>
I organized all of these reports, wrote a cover letter to the FDA addressing each issue brought up 
in their letter notifying me that the IND was on hold, and mailed it.  As the study was on hold, 
the FDA was required to respond within 30 days of receiving my letter.  A letter with the 
accompanying data is called, in these cases, an amendment to the IND.  I received written 
approval to proceed within two weeks of submitting this amendment.  I began the study 
accordingly.
<p>
At the time of this writing, the study is nearly half completed.  This particular phase of my work 
with DMT will end in early 1992.  Hopefully, the remaining DMT can be used in future studies 
of its effects in humans.  These future studies will require CRC, IRB, and FDA approvals.  
Because there is an existing supply of DMT, which I am able to administer safely, I do not 
anticipate major problems in beginning other studies.

<center><b>Conclusions and Future Directions</b></center>
<p>
A question that comes to mind while reviewing this process is, What if the drug <i>has</i> been 
made by a pharmaceutical company (e.g., LSD by Sandoz)?  Does Sandoz have the information 
to set up a DMF?  Would they test whatever remaining available drug exists for the FDA?  
Would the expiration date on their lots of LSD have passed, thus voiding their use?  I do not 
know, but using a drug company's compound would certainly bypass the difficulties I 
encountered in finding an approved manufacturer of the drug, not to mention all the chemistry, 
toxicology, bacteriology, pyrogen testing, and clinical formulation work.
<p>
What can one learn from this, at times, Kafkaesque process?  First, with perseverance, it is 
possible to acquire permission to conduct human research with a hallucinogen; in this case, 
DMT.  Second, personal contact, primarily by phone and carefully followed-up mailings are the 
best ways to help the process keep moving forward.  Such contact is required, especially to 
convince the FDA, DEA, and at times NIDA, to speak with one another on the researcher's 
behalf.  Third, a simple, scientifically well-reasoned approach with in-house approval is 
essential, and outside funding is very important.  Fourth, a close collaborative relationship with 
someone who can manufacture hallucinogens may be necessary.  Drug companies, if they do 
make the drug, might be inclined; however, it is better to have a first-class medicinal chemist 
with a university affiliation.  Again, outside funding and the possibility that the project might 
dead-end without my colleague's assistance were very important factors in persuading him to 
take on this daunting task.
<p>
For researchers interested in studying the use of hallucinogens to enhance the psychotherapeutic 
or creative process, I believe that using the same approach, tedious and plodding as it is, might be 
similarly applied.  There have been well-validated advances in psychotherapy and cognitive 
science research in the past 20 years.  Standardized treatment protocols and testing procedures 
are effective in teasing apart salient issues in psychopathological states.  Carefully blending the 
relationship between the effects of hallucinogens on cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal 
variables with the processes involved in standardized psychotherapy techniques (or creative 
problem solving) could be combined in attempting to use these compounds for such purposes.

 Reefer Madness: Introduction

<center> <h3> (Introduction) </center> </h3> 
 
 
 
<b> In the state of Indiana a person convicted of armed robbery will serve about 
 five years in prison; someone convicted of rape will serve about twelve; 
 and a convicted murderer can expect to spend twenty years behind bars. 
 These figures are actually higher than the figures nationwide: eight years 
 and eight months in prison is the average punishment for an American found 
 guilty of murder. The prison terms given by Indiana judges tend to be long, 
 but with good behavior an inmate will serve no more than half the nominal 
 sentence.</b> Those facts are worth keeping in mind when considering the case 
 of Mark Young. At the age of thirty-eight Young was arrested at his 
 Indianapolis home for brokering the sale of 700 pounds of marijuana grown 
 on a farm in nearby Morgan County. Young was tried and convicted under 
 federal law. He had never before been charged with drug trafficking. He had 
 no history of violent crime. Young's role in the illegal transaction had 
 been that of a middleman -- he never distributed the drugs; he simply 
 introduced two people hoping to sell a large amount of marijuana to three 
 people wishing to buy it. The offense occurred a year and a half prior to 
 his arrest. No confiscated marijuana money, or physical evidence of any 
 kind linked Young to the crime. He was convicted solely on the testimony of 
 co-conspirators who were now cooperating with the government. On February 
 8, 1992, Mark Young was sentenced by Judge Sarah Evans Barker to life 
 imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
 
<p> 
There was so much talk in the 1970s about the decriminalization of 
 marijuana, and the smoking of marijuana is so casually taken for granted in 
 much of our culture. that many people assume that a marijuana offense these 
 days will rarely lead to a prison term. But in fact there may be more 
 people in prison today for violating marijuana laws than at any other time in the nation's history. 
Calculations based on data provided by the 
 Bureau of Prisons and the United States Sentencing Commission suggest that 
 one of every six inmates in the federal prison system -- roughly 15,000 
 people -- has been incarcerated primarily for a marijuana offense. The number 
 currently being held in state prisons and local jails is more difficult to 
 estimate: a conservative guess would be an additional 20,000 to 30,000, And 
 Mark Young's sentence, though unusual, is by no means unique. A dozen or 
 more marijuana offenders may now be serving life sentences in federal 
 penitentiaries without hope of parole; if one includes middle-aged inmates 
 with sentences of twenty or thirty or forty years, the number condemned to 
 die in prison may reach into the hundreds. Other inmates -- no one knows how 
 many -- are serving life sentences in state correctional facilities across the 
 country for growing, selling, or even possessing marijuana. 
 
 
<p> 
The phrase "war on drugs" evokes images of Colombian cartels and inner-city 
 crack addicts. In many ways that is a misperception. Marijuana is and has 
 long been the most widely used illegal drug in the United States. It is 
 used here more frequently than all other illegal drugs combined. According 
 to conservative estimates, one third of the American population over the 
 age of eleven has smoked marijuana at least once. More than 17 million 
 Americans smoked it in 1992. At least three million smoke it on a daily 
 basis. Unlike heroin or cocaine, which must be imported, anywhere from a 
 quarter to half of the marijuana used in this country is grown here as 
 well. Although popular stereotypes depict marijuana growers as aging 
 hippies in northern California or Hawaii, the majority of the marijuana now 
 cultivated in the United States is being grown in the nation's midsection -- a 
 swath running roughly from the Appalachians west to the Great Plains. 
 Throughout this Marijuana Belt drug fortunes are being made by farmers who 
 often seem to have stepped from a page of the old <i> Saturday Evening Post</i>. The value of America's 
annual marijuana crop is staggering: plausible 
 estimates start at $4 billion and range up to $24 billion. In 1993 the 
 value of the nation's largest legal cash crop, corn, was roughly $16 
 billion. 
 
<p> 
Marijuana has well-organized supporters who campaign for its legalization 
 and promote its use through books, magazines. and popular music. They 
 regard marijuana as not only a benign recreational drug but also a form of 
 herbal medicine and a product with industrial applications. Marijuana's 
 opponents are equally passionate and far better organized. They consider 
 marijuana a dangerous drug -- one that harms the user's mental, physical, and 
 spiritual well-being, promotes irresponsible sexual behavior, and 
 encourages disrespect for traditional values. At the heart of the ongoing 
 bitter debate is a hardy weed that can grow wild in all fifty states. The 
 two sides agree that countless lives have been destroyed by marijuana, but 
 disagree about what should be blamed: the plant itself, or the laws 
 forbidding its use. 
 
<p> 
The war on drugs embraced by President Ronald Reagan began largely as a 
 campaign against marijuana organized by conservative parents' groups in the 
 late 1970s. After more than a decade in which penalties for marijuana 
 offenses had been reduced at both the state and federal levels, the laws 
 regarding marijuana were made much tougher in the 1980s. More resources 
 were devoted to their enforcement. and punishments more severe than those 
 administered during the "reefer madness" of the 1930s became routine. All 
 the legal tools commonly associated with the fight against heroin and 
 cocaine trafficking -- civil forfeitures, enhanced police search powers, the 
 broad application of conspiracy laws, a growing reliance on the testimony 
 of informers, and mechanistic sentencing formulas, such as mandatory 
 minimums and "three strikes, you're out" -- have been employed against 
 marijuana offenders. The story of how Mark Young got a life sentence 
 reveals a great deal about the emergence of the American heartland as the 
 region where a vast amount of the nation's marijuana is now grown; about 
 the changing composition of the federal prison population; and about the 
 effects of the war on drugs, a dozen years after its declaration, throughout America's criminal justice 
system. Underlying Young's tale is a 
 simple question: How does a society come to punish a person more harshly 
 for selling marijuana than for killing someone with a gun?

 Reefer Madness: The Plant in Question

<center> <h3> 
 The Plant in Question 
</center> </h3> 
 
<br> 
<p> 
"MARIJUANA" is the Mexican colloquial name for a plant known to botanists as 
 <i> Cannabis sativa</i>. In various forms it has long been familiar throughout the 
 world: in Africa as "dagga," in China as "ma," in Northern Europe as 
 "hemp." Although cannabis most likely originated in the steppes of central 
 Asia, it now thrives in almost any climate, spreading like milkweed or 
 thistle, crowding out neighboring grasses and reaching heights of three to 
 twenty feet at maturity. Marijuana has been cultivated for at least 5,000 
 years; it is one of the oldest agricultural commodities not grown for food. 
 The stalks of the plant contain fibers that have been woven for millennia 
 to make rope, canvas, and paper. Cannabis is dioecious, spawning male and 
 female plants in equal proportion. The flowering buds of the female -- and to 
 a lesser extent those of the male -- secrete a sticky yellow resin rich with 
 cannabinoids. the more than sixty compounds unique to marijuana. Several of 
 them are psychoactive, most prominently delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
 
<p> 
Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical 
 School, believes that marijuana will someday be hailed as a "miracle drug," 
 one that is safe, inexpensive, and versatile. In his book <i> Marihuana, the 
 Forbidden Medicine </i> (1993) Grinspoon provides anecdotal evidence that 
 smoking marijuana can relieve the nausea associated with chemotherapy, 
 prevent blindness induced by glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant for 
AIDS patients, act as an anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine 
headaches, alleviate chronic pain, and reduce the muscle spasticity that 
accompanies multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia. Other doctors 
think that Grinspoon is wildly optimistic, and that no "crude drug" like 
marijuana -- composed of more than 400 chemicals -- should be included 
in the modern pharmacopoeia. They point out that effective synthetic drugs, 
of precise dosage and purity, have been developed for every one of marijuana's 
potential uses. Dronabinol, a synthetic form of delta-9-THC, has been available for years, though some 
clinical oncologists find it inferior to 
marijuana as an anti-nausea agent. There have been remarkably few large-scale 
studies that might verify or disprove Grinspoon's claims. Nevertheless, 
thirty-six states allow the medicinal use of marijuana. And eight patients are 
currently receiving it from the Public Health Service. According to Grinspoon, 
the federal government has always been far more interested in establishing 
marijuana's harmful effects than in discovering any of its benefits, while major 
drug companies have little incentive to fund expensive research on marijuana. As Grinspoon explains. 
"You cannot patent this plant." 
 
<p> 
The long-term health effects of chronic marijuana use, and marijuana's role 
 as a "gateway" to the use of other illegal drugs, are issues surrounded by 
 great controversy. Marijuana does not create a physical dependence in its 
 users, but it does create a psychological dependence in some. People who 
 smoke marijuana are far more likely to experiment later with other 
 psychoactive drugs, but no direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever 
 been established. Delta-9-THC is highly lipid-soluble and has a half-life 
 of five days, which means that it diffuses widely throughout the human body 
 and remains there for quite some time: an occasional user can fail a urine 
 test three days after smoking a single joint, and a heavy user may test 
 positive after abstaining from marijuana for more than a month. 
 Delta-9-THC's persistence within various cells and vital organs (also a 
 characteristic of Valium, Thorazine, and quinine) suggests that it could 
 have the ability to exert subtly harmful effects; few have yet been proved. 
 Studies of lifelong heavy marijuana users in Jamaica, Greece, and Costa 
 Rica reveal little psychological or physiological damage. Much more 
 research however, needs to be done in the areas of cognition, reproduction, 
 and immunology. Adolescent users in particular would be at risk if 
 marijuana were found to have pernicious systemic effects. Some studies have 
 shown that short-term memory deficiencies in heavy smokers, though 
 reversible, may endure long after the cessation of marijuana use. Other 
 studies have demonstrated <i> in vitro </i> and in laboratory animals that marijuana 
 may have a mild immunosuppressive effect, but no study has conclusively 
 linked delta-9-THC to immune-system changes in human beings. 
 Well-publicized horror stories from the 1970s -- that marijuana kills brain 
 cells, damages chromosomes and prompts men to grow breasts -- were based on 
 faulty research. 
 
<p> 
Smoking marijuana does seem to damage the pulmonary 
 system, in some of the ways that inhaling tobacco smoke does. In a study of 
 people who have smoked four or five joints a day for more than ten years, 
 the physician Donald P. Tashkin, of the University of California at Los 
 Angeles Medical Center, has found substantial evidence that marijuana smoke 
 can cause chronic bronchitis, changes in cells of the central airway which 
 are potentially pre-cancerous, and an impairment in scavenger-cell function 
 which could lead to a greater risk of respiratory infection. A joint seems 
 to deliver four times as much carcinogenic tar as a tobacco cigarette of 
 the same size. Tashkin expects that some heavy marijuana users will 
 eventually suffer cancers of the mouth, throat, and lungs, although none of 
 his research subjects has yet developed a malignancy. Oddly enough, the 
 more potent strains of marijuana may prove less dangerous, since less of 
 them needs to be smoked. 
 
<p>There is much less disagreement about short term health effects of 
 marijuana. According to the physician Leo Hollister, a former president of 
 the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, who now teaches at the 
 University of Texas, the occasional use of marijuana by a healthy adult 
 poses no greater risks than the moderate consumption of alcohol. For a 
 variety of reasons, however, marijuana should not be smoked by 
 schizophrenics, pregnant women, and people with heart conditions. Although 
 the misuse of over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen, 
 and antihistamines each year kills hundreds of Americans, not a single 
 death has ever been credibly attributed directly to smoking or consuming 
 marijuana in the 5,000 years of the plant's recorded use. Marijuana is one 
 of the few therapeutically active substances known for which there is no 
 well defined fatal dose. It has been estimated that a person would have to 
 smoke a hundred pounds of marijuana a minute for fifteen minutes in order 
 to induce a lethal response.

<p> 
THE first American law pertaining to marijuana, 
passed by the Virginia 
 Assembly in 1619, required every farmer to grow it. Hemp was deemed not 
 only a valuable commodity but also a strategic necessity; its fibers were 
 used to make sails and riggings. and its by-products were transformed into 
 oakum for the caulking of wooden ships. Virginia, Pennsylvania, and 
 Maryland eventually allowed hemp to be exchanged as legal tender, in order 
 to stimulate its production and relieve Colonial money shortages. Although 
 a number of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington and Thomas 
 Jefferson, later grew hemp on their estates, there is no evidence that they 
 were aware of the plant's psychoactive properties. The domestic production 
 of hemp flourished especially in Kentucky, until after the Civil War, when 
 it was replaced by imports from Russia and by other domestic materials. In 
 the latter half of the nineteenth century marijuana became a popular 
 ingredient in patent medicines and was sold openly at pharmacies in one 
 ounce herbal packages and in alcohol-based tinctures as a cure for 
 migraines, rheumatism, and insomnia. 
 
<p> 
The political upheaval in Mexico that culminated in the Revolution of 
1910 
 led to a wave of Mexican immigration to states throughout the American 
 Southwest. The prejudices and fears that greeted these peasant immigrants 
 also extended to their traditional means of intoxication: smoking 
 marijuana. Police officers in Texas claimed that marijuana incited violent 
 crimes, aroused a "lust for blood," and gave its users "superhuman 
 strength." Rumors spread that Mexicans were distributing this "killer weed" 
 to unsuspecting American schoolchildren. Sailors and West Indian immigrants 
 brought the practice of smoking marijuana to port cities along the Gulf of 
 Mexico. In New Orleans newspaper articles associated the drug with 
 African-Americans, jazz musicians, prostitutes, and underworld whites. "The 
 Marijuana Menace," as sketched by anti-drug campaigners, was personified by 
 inferior races and social deviants. In 1914 El Paso, Texas, enacted perhaps 
 the first U.S. ordinance banning the sale or possession of marijuana; by 
 1931 twenty-nine states had outlawed marijuana, usually with little fanfare or debate. 
 Amid the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by the Great Depression. 
 public officials from the Southwest and from Louisiana petitioned the 
 Treasury Department to outlaw marijuana. Their efforts were aided by a lurid 
propaganda campaign. "MURDER WEED FOUND UP AND DOWN COAST," one 
 headline warned; "DEADLY MARIJUANA DOPE PLANT READY FOR HARVEST THAT MEANS 
 ENSLAVEMENT OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN." Harry J. Anslinger, the commissioner of 
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, at first doubted the seriousness of the 
problem and the need for 
 federal legislation, but soon he pursued the goal 
of a nationwide marijuana 
 prohibition with enormous gusto. In public appearances and radio broadcasts 
 Anslinger asserted that the use of this "evil weed" led to killings, sex 
 crimes. and insanity. He wrote sensational magazine articles with titles 
 like "Marijuana: Assassin of Youth." In 1937 Congress passed the marijuana 
 Tax Act, effectively criminalizing the possession of marijuana throughout 
 the United States. A week after it went into effect, a fifty-eight-year old 
 marijuana dealer named Samuel R. Caldwell became the first person 
 convicted under the new statute. Although marijuana offenders had been 
 treated leniently under state and local laws, Judge J. Foster Symes, of 
 Denver, lectured Caldwell on the viciousness of marijuana and sentenced him 
 to four hard years at Leavenworth Penitentiary. 
 
<p> 
Harry J. Anslinger is a central figure in the history of American 
drug 
 policy. He headed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from its inception 
 through five presidential Administrations spanning more than three decades. 
 Anslinger had much in common with his rival, J. Edgar Hoover. Both were 
 conservatives, staunchly anti-Communists proponents of law and order who 
 imbued nascent federal bureaus with their own idiosyncrasies. Anslinger 
 did not believe in a public health approach to drug addiction; he dismissed 
 treatment clinics as "morphine feeding stations" and "barrooms for 
 addicts." In his view strict enforcement of the law was the only proper 
 response to illegal drug use; he urged judges to "jail offenders, then throw 
 away the key." Anslinger's outlook was consistent with that of most 
 Americans, though his opinions proved more resistant to new scientific 
 evidence. When the New York Academy of Medicine -- after years of 
 research -- issued a report in 1944 concluding that marijuana use did not 
 cause violent behavior, provoke insanity, lead to addiction, or promote 
 opiate use, Anslinger angrily dismissed its authors as "dangerous" and 
 "strange." 
 
<p> 
America's drug problem often seemed the work of foreign powers; during the 
 Second World War, Anslinger accused the Japanese of using narcotics to sap 
 America's will to fight; a few years later he asserted that Communists were 
 attempting the same ploy. The Boggs Act, passed by Congress at the height of 
 the McCarthy era, specified the same penalties for marijuana and heroin 
 offenses -- two to five years in prison for first-time possession. As 
 justification for the long sentences contained in that act and in the 
 Narcotic Control Act which followed in 1956, Anslinger stressed 
 marijuana's crucial role as a "stepping-stone" to narcotics addiction. Like 
 Hoover, he maintained dossiers on well-known entertainers whose behavior 
 seemed un-American. Anslinger disliked jazz and kept a special file, 
"Marijuana and Musicians," filled with reports on band members who played with 
Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Les Brown, Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke 
Ellington, among others. For months Anslinger planned a nationwide roundup of 
popular musicians -- a scheme that was foiled by the inability of FBI agents to 
infiltrate the jazz milieu. Although Anslinger's opposition to drug use was both passionate and sincere, he 
made one notable exception. In his memoir, <i>The Murderers</i>, Anslinger confessed to having 
arranged a regular supply of morphine for "one of the most influential members of Congress," who had 
become an addict. Anslinger's biographer believes that addict was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. 
 
<p> 
By 1962, when Harry J. Anslinger retired, many states had passed "little 
 Boggs Acts" with penalties for marijuana possession or sale tougher than 
 those demanded by federal law. In Louisiana sentences for simple possession 
 ranged from five to ninety-nine years; in Missouri a second offense could 
 result in a life sentence; and in Georgia a second conviction for selling 
 marijuana to minors could bring the death penalty. As the political climate 
 changed during the 1960s, so did attitudes toward drug abuse. A series of 
 commissions appointed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson 
 repudiated some of the basic assumptions that had guided marijuana policy 
 for more than fifty years, denying a direct link between the drug and 
 violent crime or heroin use. As marijuana use became widespread among white 
 middle-class college students, there was a reappraisal of marijuana laws 
 that for decades had imprisoned poor Mexicans and African-Americans without 
 much public dissent. Drug abuse policy shifted from a purely criminal 
 justice approach to one also motivated by interests of public health with 
 more emphasis on treatment than on punishment. In 1970 the Comprehensive 
 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act finally differentiated marijuana from 
 other narcotics and reduced federal penalties for possession of small 
 amounts. As directed by Congress, President Richard Nixon appointed a 
 bipartisan commission to study marijuana. In 1972 the Shafer Commission 
 issued its report, advocating the decriminalization of marijuana for 
 personal use -- a recommendation that Nixon flatly rejected. Nevertheless, 
 eleven states, containing a third of the country's population, 
 decriminalized marijuana in the 1970s, and most other states weakened their 
 laws against it. President Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization, and it 
 seemed that long prison sentences for marijuana offenders had been 
 consigned to the nation's past. 
 
<p> 
But they had not. One of the seminal events 
 in the creation of the modern American anti-drug movement was a backyard 
 barbecue held in Atlanta, Georgia, during August of 1976. In the aftermath of 
their daughter's birthday party, Ron and Marsha 
 Manatt combed through the wet grass in their pajamas, at one in the 
 morning, with flashlights, finding dozens of marijuana roaches, rolling 
 paper packets, and empty bottles of Mad Dog 20/20 fortified wine discarded 
 by their twelve- and thirteen-year-old guests. Alarmed by these discoveries, 
 the Manatts gathered local parents in their living room and formed what 
 would soon be known as the Nosy Parents Association, a group dedicated to 
 preventing teenage drug use. Marsha Manatt wrote to Robert Dupont, the 
 head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; he helped arrange her 
 introduction to Thomas Gleaton, a professor of health education at Georgia 
 State University. There soon arose the Parents' Resource Institute for 
 Drug Education and the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth, 
 two organizations backed by the top officials at NIDA and the Drug 
 Enforcement Administration (DEA) which would exert tremendous influence 
 on the nation's drug policies. Thousands of other parents' groups soon 
formed nationwide, and Ross Perot helped launch the 
 Texans' War on Drugs. 
 
<p> 
Marijuana use seemed epidemic; a survey in 1976 found 
 that one out of twelve high school seniors smoked pot on a daily basis. In 
 the 1960s the youth counterculture had celebrated marijuana's reputation as 
 a drug for outcasts and freaks. One Yippie leader had confidently predicted 
 that the slogan of the coming revolution would be "pot, freedom, license." 
 The conservative parents' groups took such words to heart and similarly 
 invested marijuana with great meaning. Robert DuPont, who at NIDA had once 
 supported de-criminalization, later decried the "tumultuous change in 
 values" among the young -- their pursuit of pleasure, their lack of 
 responsibility to society -- and argued that "the leading edge of this cultural 
 change was marijuana use." 
 
<p> 
 The election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency brought the war on 
drugs to 
 the White House. In June of l982 President Reagan signed an executive order 
 creating a new post in his Administration -- head of the White House Drug 
 Abuse Policy Office -- and appointed a chemist, Carlton Turner, to the job. 
 Turner had for many years directed the Marijuana Research Project at the 
 University of Mississippi, running the government's only marijuana team. 
 Turner believed that marijuana was an extremely dangerous drug -- one that, 
 among other things, might have the power to induce homosexuality. In 1977 
 the DEA had acknowledged that decriminalization was a policy worth 
 considering; three years later it called marijuana the most urgent drug 
 problem facing the United States. Richard Bonnie, a professor at the 
 University of Virginia Law School who was an influential member of the 
 Shafer Commission staff, believes that advocates of marijuana-law reform 
 were pushed out of the mainstream by the growing stridency and power of the 
 parents' groups. Political moderates soon abandoned the issue. Amid their 
 silence, philosophies of "zero tolerance" and "user accountability" 
 revived the notion that what drug offenders deserved most was punishment. 
 The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 
 1986, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendment Act of 1988 raised federal 
 penalties for marijuana possession, cultivation, and trafficking. Sentences 
 were to be determined by the quantity of the drug involved; "conspiracies" 
 and "attempts" were to be punished as severely as completed acts; and 
 possession of a hundred marijuana plants now carried the same sentence as 
 possession of a hundred grams of heroin.

<p>  
MARIJUANA is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance,  
 implying that it has a high potential for abuse, no officially accepted  
 medicinal uses, and no safe level of use under medical supervision.  
 Heroin, LSD, and peyote are other Schedule I drugs; cocaine and phencyclidine  
(PCP) are listed in Schedule II, allowing doctors to  
 prescribe them. Under federal law it is illegal to buy, sell, grow, or  
 possess any amount of marijuana anywhere here in the United States,  
 Penalties for a first offense range from probation to life imprisonment,  
 with fines of up to $4 million, depending on the quantity of marijuana  
 involved. Moreover, it is illegal to use the U.S. Postal Service or other  
 interstate shippers for the advertisement, import, or export of such  
 marijuana paraphernalia as roach clips, water pipes, and in some instances,  
 cigarette papers -- a crime that can lead to imprisonment and fines of up to $100,000. Under civil-  
forfeiture statutes real estate, vehicles, cash, securities, jewelry, and any other property connected with a  
marijuana  
 offense are subject to immediate seizure. The federal government need not  
 prove that the property was bought with the proceeds of illegal drug sales,  
 only that it was involved in the commission of a crime -- that marijuana was  
 grown on certain land or transported in a particular vehicle. Property may  
 be forfeited even after a defendant has been found innocent of the offense,  
 since the burden of proof that applies to people -- "beyond a reasonable  
 doubt" -- does not apply in accusations against inanimate objects. Property  
 can be forfeited without its owner's ever being charged with a crime. On  
 top of fines, incarceration, and forfeiture, a convicted marijuana offender  
 may face the revocation or denial of more than 460 federal benefits,  
 including student loans, small-business loans, professional licenses, and  
 farm subsidies. In international smuggling cases the offender's passport  
 can be revoked.  
  
<p>  
State marijuana laws were also toughened during the 1980s and now vary  
 enormously. Some states classify marijuana with drugs like mescaline and  
 heroin, while others give it a separate level category. In New York state  
 possessing slightly less than an ounce of marijuana brings a $100 fine,  
 rarely collected. In Nevada possessing any amount of marijuana is a  
 felony. In Montana selling a pound of marijuana, first offense, could lead  
 to a life sentence, whereas in New Mexico selling 10,000 pounds of  
 marijuana, first offense, could be punished with a prison term of no more  
 than three years. In some states it is against the law to be in a room  
 where marijuana is being smoked, even if you don't smoke any. In some  
 states you may be subject to criminal charges if someone else uses,  
 distributes, or cultivates marijuana on your property. In Idaho selling  
 water pipes could lead to a prison sentence of nine years. In Kentucky  
 products made of hemp fibers, such as paper and clothing, not only are  
 illegal but carry the same penalties associated with an equivalent weight  
 of marijuana. In Arizona, where marijuana use is forbidden, the crime can  
 be established by the failure of a urine test: a person could theoretically  
 be prosecuted in Phoenix or a joint smoked in Philadelphia more than a week  
before.  
  
  
  
<p>  
Crossing an  
 invisible state line with marijuana in your car can result in vastly  
 different punishments. If you are caught with three ounces of marijuana in  
 Union City, Ohio, you will probably be fined $100. But it you are caught in  
 the town of the same name literally across the road in Indiana, you could  
 face nine months to two years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000, a felony  
 record, suspension of your driver's license, forfeiture of your car, and  
 charges of marijuana possession, of possession with intent to distribute,  
 and of "maintaining a common nuisance" (for the criminal use of an  
 automobile). That one arrest in Indiana might cost you the $10,000 fine and  
 at least $5,000 in legal fees, plus the value of your forfeited car. Wide  
 discrepancies in punishment occur not just between states but also from  
 county to county within a given state. In La Salle County, Illinois, a  
 first-time offender arrested with 300 pounds of marijuana might be  
 sentenced to four months in boot camp. Sixty-five miles to the south, in  
 McLean County, the same person convicted of the same crime would more  
 likely receive a prison sentence of four to eight years.  
  
<p>  
 In 1992 more than 340,000 people were arrested nationwide for  
violating  
 marijuana laws. Almost three quarters of those arrests were for simple  
 possession, a crime that generally does not lead to incarceration. But  
 possession of more than an ounce -- roughly equal to the amount of tobacco in  
 a pack of cigarettes -- is in many states a felony. Conviction may lead to a  
 few months or a few years behind bars and the loss of a house or a job.  
 People who use marijuana as medicine must either buy it from drug dealers  
 or grow it themselves, often in violation of the law. James Cox, a cancer  
 patient in St. Louis, was found guilty of growing marijuana and sentenced to  
 fifteen years in prison; after the verdict both he and his wife attempted  
 suicide. Orland Foster, an AIDS patient in North Carolina, served fifteen  
 months for growing marijuana; one of his cell mates served less time for  
 killing a woman. Now on probation, Foster must either give up marijuana  
 and risk losing weight, or violate the terms of his release and risk going  
 back to prison.  
  
<p>  
 In perhaps the most extraordinary case of this kind, Jim Montgomery,  
a  
 paraplegic immobilized from the waist down, who smoked marijuana to relieve  
 muscle spasms, was arrested in Sayre, Oklahoma, when sheriffs found two  
 ounces of pot in the pouch on the back of his wheelchair. Montgomery was  
 tried and convicted in 1992, by a jury, for possession of marijuana with  
 intent to distribute, for possession of paraphernalia, for unlawful  
 possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime (two handguns  
 inherited from his father, a police officer), and for maintaining a place  
 resorted to by users of controlled substances. His sentence was life in  
 prison, plus sixteen years. Both the judge and the local prosecutor were  
 disturbed by the sentence chosen by the jury; the judge subsequently  
 reduced it to ten years.  
Montgomery spent ten months in a prison medical unit, where he developed a  
 life-threatening infection, before being released on bond. His appeal is  
 now pending. "I'll never go back to that prison." he says. "I'd rather put  
 a bullet in my head." His case has already cost him more than $30,000 in  
 legal fees. The government's effort to seize Montgomery's home, shared with  
 his widowed mother, proved unsuccessful.  
  
<p>  
Oklahoma today has a well-deserved reputation for being the worst place in the  
United States to be caught with marijuana. On June 11, 1992, Larry  
 Jackson, a small-time crook with a lengthy record of nonviolent offenses,  
 was arrested at a friend' s Tulsa apartment. On the floor near Jackson's  
 right foot a police officer noticed a minuscule amount of marijuana -- 0.16 of  
 a gram, which is 0.005644 of an ounce. Jackson was charged with felony  
 possession of marijuana, convicted, and given a life sentence. In Oklahoma  
 City, Leland James Dodd was given two life sentences, plus ten years, for  
 buying fifty pounds of marijuana from undercover officers in a "reverse  
 sting." Oklahoma is not alone in handing out life sentences for buying  
 marijuana from the government. In Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, William  
 Stephen Bonner, a truck driver, was sent away for life without possibility  
 of parole after state narcotics agents delivered forty pounds of marijuana  
 to his bedroom. Raymond Pope, a resident of Georgia, was lured to Baldwin  
 County, Alabama, in 1990 with promises of cheap marijuana; he bought  
 twenty-seven pounds from local sheriffs in a reverse sting, was convicted,  
 and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Pope's criminal  
 record consisted of prior convictions for stealing televisions and  
 bedspreads from Georgia motels. He is now imprisoned 400 miles from his  
 family. He has three young children.  
  
<p>  
  
 Although the penalties for buying, selling, or possessing marijuana  
are  
 often severe, the penalties for growing it can be even more severe. In lowa  
 cultivating any amount can lead to a five-year prison sentence, in Colorado  
 to an eight year sentence, in Missouri to a fifteen-year sentence. In  
 the state of Virginia the recommended punishment for growing a single  
 marijuana plant is a prison term of five to thirty years.

 A Farm in Morgan County 
</center> </h3> 
 
 
<p> 
In November of 1988 Claude Atkinson and Ernest Montgomery met at a Denny's 
 near the airport in Indianapolis to discuss setting up a large-scale 
 marijuana growing operation. Atkinson, a fifty-nine-year-old Indiana 
 native, was by all accounts charismatic and highly skilled at cultivating 
 marijuana. Ostensibly a used-farm-implements dealer, Atkinson had organized 
 huge marijuana farms in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky. His knowledge of 
 growing techniques was much more impressive than his skill at eluding 
 capture. In 1984 law-enforcement authorities had linked him to a pot farm 
 in Paragon, Indiana; the following year he was caught growing marijuana with 
artificial light in an immense 
 Indianapolis warehouse; and in 1987 a deer hunter stumbled upon thousands 
 of his marijuana plants in an Indiana field. Claude Atkinson had cut a 
 series of deals with the government, informing on others after each arrest 
 and serving brief terms in prison, where he recruited employees for future 
 ventures. Now fresh out of custody and broke, he was ready to get back into 
 the growing business. Ernest Montgomery was an unemployed truck driver in 
 his early forties who wanted to make big money. They agreed to form a 
 partnership, with Montgomery supplying the capital and Atkinson the 
 expertise. Soon after their meeting Claude Atkinson went to the Indiana 
 statehouse and formed a dummy corporation, R.P.Z. Investments, using one of 
 his many pseudonyms, Arno Zepp. 
 
<p> 
That fall Atkinson supervised the 
 construction of a large "grow room" in the basement of a secluded cabin 
 that Montgomery owned in Gosport. Montgomery enlisted his younger brother, 
 Jerry, a gravedigger with a slight drinking problem, to help with the task. 
 Together the three men drilled holes in the concrete floor for drainage, 
built a cooling system, 
 assembled ballasts and reflectors, suspended row lights with thousand-watt 
 halide bulbs from the ceiling, and planted marijuana seeds in small pots. 
 They installed a generator so that the operation would not be detected 
 through an incongruously high electric bill. Montgomery invited David Lee 
 Haynes, a young lumberyard ripsaw operator from Louisville, Kentucky, and 
 the son of an old friend, to come live at the cabin and tend the plants. 
 After digging graves all day, Jerry Montgomery would visit the dark 
 basement in the evenings. By spring the group had approximately 12,500 
 seedlings of marijuana, contained in sixteen plywood flats. What they 
 needed next was a farm. 
 
<p> 
In May of 1989 Martha Brummett, an elderly woman hard of hearing, 
agreed to 
 lease her farmhouse halfway between Eminence and Cloverdale, in Morgan 
 County, to R.P.Z. Investments. It came with about forty acres, a barn, and 
 an option to buy. Martha Brummett was surprised that when a "Charlie 
 Peters" arrived to sign the lease, the woman with him remained in the car 
 and never entered the house. Nevertheless, Brummett innocently signed over 
 her farm for $10,000 in cash, which she then took 
 straight to her bank. 
 
 
<p> 
After Ernest Montgomery and his wife, Cindy, obtained the house, David 
 Haynes moved into it, to baby-sit the operation, having obtained a sham 
 rental agreement from R.P.Z. Investments as a legal buffer against what was 
 about to happen on the land. The group plowed and tilled the field, 
 fertilized it, and planted corn. Once the corn had reached a good height, 
 they planted marijuana, hiding it amid the stalks. Over the summer they 
 walked the fields, "sexing" the marijuana -- eliminating all the males. The 
 females, left unpollinated, would produce a much higher level of 
 delta-9-THC in their buds, and would thus become a much more valuable crop: 
 sensimilla. In late September, before the corn leaves turned golden, the 
 group harvested the marijuana and then cured it in the barn for two weeks 
 and cut it into "books" about a foot wide and three feet long. The books 
 were hauled into the farmhouse or driven to the cabin in Gosport for 
 manicuring: the stems, orphan leaves, and fan leaves were separated from 
 the precious buds. So far the operation had gone smoothly. Soon there would be 
about 900 pounds of high quality marijuana to 
 sell. Now the group needed buyers. Ernest Montgomery thought that Mark 
 Young, a man whom he had met a few times with Cindy, might know the right 
 people to call. 
 
 
<p> 
 
Mark Young was thirty-six and had been smoking marijuana on a daily basis 
 since his late teens. He grew up in Christian Park Heights, a middle-class 
 neighborhood on the east side of Indianapolis. His father left the family 
 when Mark was two; he and his sister, Andrea, were raised by their mother, 
 Mary, who worked as a waitress or a hostess to pay the bills. Young was a 
 willful, stubborn, charming boy, always getting into trouble. He seemed to 
 have, throughout his pranks and petty thefts, the sort of bad luck that is 
 almost uncanny -- often he would get caught while his friends got away. Young 
 dropped out of high school after a year, became a father at the age of 
 sixteen, married to give the child his name, divorced, worked as a 
 carpet-layer, washed dishes, laid concrete, tended bar, sold used cars, and 
 rebuilt Harley Davidson motorcycles. He kept an album filled with pictures 
 of his favorite Harleys. He knew all the local biker gangs, but remained 
apart; Young seemed to get into enough trouble on his own. He 
 dated many attractive women, lived a fast life, and slowly acquired a 
 criminal record -- nothing violent, just misdemeanors for driving without a 
 license, for possession of marijuana, for taking a girlfriend's stereo. He 
 also earned two felony convictions: one at the age of twenty-one, for 
 attempting to pass a fraudulent prescription, and the other at the age of 
 twenty-five, for possession of a few amphetamines and Quaaludes. Each 
 felony brought a suspended 
sentence, probation. and a one-dollar fine. When Ernest Montgomery called, 
 Mark Young was rebuilding motorcycles, selling used cars wholesale, and 
 looking for new income. He had held a financial interest in a number of 
 massage parlors. which were now closed. His dream was to get some money, 
 move to Florida, build custom Harleys, and work part-time as a fishing 
 guide on Lake Okeechobee. 
 
 
<p> 
 
Claude Atkinson, Ernest Montgomery and Mark Young met in the family 
room at 
Young's house in early October. The price of the marijuana was set at $1,200 a 
pound. If Young found buyers. he would receive a commission of $100 for every 
pound sold. Not long after, Atkinson and Montgomery returned to Young's house, 
where they were introduced to two men from Florida who were acting on behalf of 
someone seeking to buy all the marijuana the group could supply. Atkinson 
offered a hundred pounds a week; the marijuana was still being manicured and 
could not be delivered all at once. Within days a man from New York arrived at 
Young's house with $120,000 in a cardboard box. While the New York buyer 
inspected the marijuana at Montgomery's Indianapolis house, Atkinson remained 
behind. counting the money. The deal was completed, and Young was handed $10,000 
in cash. The New York buyer eventually paid for 600 more pounds, in transactions 
that took place at Montgomery's house. By Christmas all the high-quality 
marijuana was gone, the last 200 pounds either distributed to workers who had 
helped with various tasks or sold to an acquaintance of Montgomery's in 
Illinois. 
 
<p> 
The town of Eminence, Indiana, is about twenty-five miles west of 
 Indianapolis. Near its only intersection is a Citizens Bank, a small 
 church, a convenience store, and a post office built of concrete blocks and 
 painted royal blue. The town boasts 180 inhabitants and looks as though it 
 has not seen much new construction since the interval between the world 
 wars. There are countless small towns like Eminence across the Midwest, 
 slightly faded but still eulogized as the heartland of this country. To 
 reach the farm used by R.P.Z. Investments, one must leave Eminence on a 
 narrow country road and then turn onto a dirt road and drive for a long 
 stretch, past fields of fifty to a hundred acres where corn, hay, soybeans, 
 and wheat are grown, past modest farms with collapsing outbuildings, an 
 occasional trailer home, and rusted cars on cinder blocks. Farther west the 
 land is flat, the acreage of each plot enormous, but here the countryside 
 feels long settled, with hedges and trees marking boundary lines. After 
 cleaning out the barn, Atkinson and Montgomery allowed the lease on Martha 
 Brummett's property to expire. The one-story farmhouse has been painted 
 beige by its latest occupants; the barn remains bright red. There is a 
 porch on the front of the house, an enclosed patio on one side, and a swing 
 set on the lawn. Looking at this humble farm, one would hardly believe that 
 more than a million dollars' worth of marijuana had been grown there in the 
 space of about three months.

 Someone at the Door 
</center> </h3> 
 
 
<br> 
<p> 
ON March 18, 1990, a pair of deputy sheriffs in Johnson County, Indiana. spotted 
a red Jeep being driven erratically and signaled for its driver to pull off the 
road. Behind the wheel they found Jerry Montgomery, obviously intoxicated; 
littering the truck were three empty vodka bottles, a five-gallon bucket full 
of marijuana, and a gray box containing more than $13,000 in cash. After 
obtaining a warrant, sheriffs searched Montgomery's house, finding more 
marijuana and a locked briefcase hidden under his bed. Deputy John Myers pried 
it open with a screwdriver. In the briefcase were receipts for farm equipment; 
documents mentioning R.P.Z. investments, Claude Atkinson, and Ernest Montgomery; 
 an option to buy a property owned by Martha Brummett; and a number of books 
suggesting that this arrest was the beginning, not the end of a trail: <i> 
Indoor Marijuana Horticulture</i>, <i> The Primo Plant</i>, and <i> How to 
Grow Marijuana Indoors Under Lights</i>. 
 
<p> 
The investigation eventually led authorities to a 500-acre farm close 
to Solsberry, in Greene County, owned by Arno Zepp, of Investment Holdings. 
 Inc. On August 22 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agents arrested 
 Claude Atkinson, raided the farm, and, with the help of volunteers from the 
 Indiana National Guard, destroyed 10,000 marijuana plants. Atkinson soon 
 began to talk. In May of 1991 Ernest Montgomery was arrested at his Gosport 
 cabin, where 7,000 marijuana seedlings sat in little pots, ready for 
 planting. Early that same morning Mark Young was awakened by someone at the 
 front door. Unlike his former business associates, Young was not growing 
 anything. He and his girlfriend, Patricia, were in the process of moving to 
 Florida. When he saw a man with a badge and a gun, Young had no idea what 
 was happening, but assumed that it must have something to do with unpaid 
 taxes. 
 
<p> 
More than a dozen law-enforcement officers surrounded the house. Their 
 commander, a DEA agent, treated Young politely, allowing him to get dressed 
 and agreeing not to handcuff him in front of the neighbors. At the station 
 Young read his indictment. He was being charged, under federal law, not 
 only for his role in distributing 700 pounds of marijuana but also for 
 conspiring to manufacture all 12,500 marijuana plants grown on Martha 
 Brummett's farm. Young was unaware of the punishment he might face until 
 later that day. John Hollywood, a bail bondsman in Indianapolis, arrived in 
 the afternoon to secure his release. But the government refused to set 
 bail. Under Indiana's strict state law, the same charges would bring a 
 maximum sentence of twenty eight years -- at most, fourteen years served in 
 prison, and probably much less. But under federal law Young's two prior 
 state felony convictions, one of them more than seventeen years old, classified him as a career drug 
offender. This arrest could prove his third 
 strike. At the U. S. attorney's discretion, he faced a possible 
 mandatory-minimum sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of 
 parole. 
 
 
<br><br> 
 
<i> This is the first part of a two-part article. Part Two, next month, will 
 describe the disposition of the Young case and the perverse consequences of 
 a legal regime that decrees mandatory-minimum sentences.</i>

<blockquote> 
<i>This bibliography was compiled by Ethan Nadelmann, Director of the Lindesmith Center, and Leigh 
Hallingby, Librarian. It has been subdivided into four main headings, each of which is then subdivided. 
Some of the books are listed under more than one heading, and this is noted in brackets at the end of the 
relevant citations. 
<p> 
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) which can be helpful in ordering books, have been 
included whenever available. Their inclusion, does not, however, guarantee that the book is still in print. 
Information about a book being out of print (OOP), when known for U.S. publications, is given in brackets 
after the relevant citations. All citations were checked against the listings in Books in Print at the time that 
the bibliography was compiled (May 1996). Library of Congress call numbers (LC call #s) are also 
included where known to facilitate finding these books in libraries.

Mission Statement</font>
</h3>

The mission of the Project on Death in America is to understand and transform the 
culture and experience of dying through initiatives in research, scholarship, the 
humanities, and the arts; to foster innovations in the provision of care, public education, 
professional education, and public policy.  The Project on Death in America is funded by 
the Open Society Institute, a non-profit foundation that supports the development of open 
societies worldwide.
<p>
The experience of dying has changed over the past several decades, with many more 
people enduring prolonged deaths as a consequence of chronic and progressive disease.  
Needless suffering  physical, emotional, existential, and spiritual  too often 
accompanies these deaths, for both dying persons and survivors.  We are hindered in our 
efforts to improve the experience of dying patients and their families by a number of 
factors:  major inadequacies in our knowledge about the course, treatment, and outcomes 
of care of dying patients and their families; deficiencies in many of our current models of 
caring for dying patients and their families; and serious weaknesses in our education of 
health professional students about care near the end of life.  Addressing these problems 
will require the development and sustenance of a cohort of clinicians, educators, and 
researchers who are committed to work in this area.
<p>

<h3><font color="b87333">

Scholars Program Objective</font>
</h3>

The Project on Death in America's Scholars Program hopes to identify outstanding 
faculty and clinicians who are making such a commitment, and to support them in 
disseminating existing models of good care, developing new models for improving the 
care of the dying, and developing new approaches to the education of health professionals 
about the care of dying patients and their families.  This program aims to promote the 
visibility and prestige of clinicians committed to this area and to enhance their 
effectiveness as academic leaders, role models, and mentors for future generations of 
health professionals.  The program seeks to provide participants with knowledge and 
skills necessary to develop innovative programs in clinical care, research, education and 
advocacy and to take leadership roles at their institutions and nationally.  It aims to 
develop an intellectually vibrant, mutually supportive, and cross-fertilizing network of 
colleagues involved in multiple facets of work with the dying and survivors of loss.  
Interaction among the fellows will foster new interdisciplinary approaches to key issues 
related to death in America.
<p>
<h3><font color="b87333">

Project Funding</font>
</h3>

The program will appoint approximately ten scholars a year.  Two-year fellowships 
(renewable for a third year) of up to $70,000 per year (depending on academic rank and 
seniority) will be made to institutions on behalf of Scholars.  A joint fellowship award 
may be made to two individuals applying as a team from within one institution.  
Fellowship funds may be used to support 60% of the Scholar's salary and benefits, up to a 
maximum of $65,000 and to provide up to $5,000 in travel funds for national meetings, 
research assistance, summer stipends, and other costs.  At least 60% of the Scholar's time 
must be devoted to activities related to this grant.  In addition to the Scholar's support and 
travel funds, up to $6,500 (10% of the Scholar's salary and benefits under this program) 
will be granted to the Scholar's institution for overhead costs.  The Project on Death in 
America will not fund additional grants from Faculty Scholars while they are Scholars.  
Applicants are asked not to submit simultaneous applications to both the Scholars 
Program and the Grants Program.
<p>
<h3><font color="b87333">

Project Description</font>
</h3>

The Scholar's Program has three components:

<ul>
<li>A clinical, research, educational, or advocacy project carried out at the individual's institution<br>

<li>An individualized professional development plan to enhance the Scholar's 
effectiveness as a leader in caring for the dying and their families<br>

<li>A faculty development program in which all of the scholars will work together on professional development activities<br>
</ul>
<h3><font color="b87333">

The Project</font>
</h3>

Each scholar will propose and implement a significant project that addresses a critical 
issue in the care of the dying in his or her own institution or community.  The project 
must have institutional support and the potential for integration into existing structures.  
In addition, the project should have potential generalizability to other settings, 
populations, and institutions, and should represent an innovative approach to care, 
education, research, and/or advocacy.  Especially encouraged are projects that address 
access to care issues; development of culturally-sensitive services for patients at the end 
of life and their families; comprehensive educational programs for health professionals, 
especially those in primary care; outcomes of different care delivery models for patients 
near the end of life and for family members during bereavement; public education and 
advocacy; and development of models that help patients and their families achieve 
physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being and "gentle closure" in the face of 
impending death.
<p>
<h3><font color="b87333">

The Professional 
Development Plan</font>
</h3>

Each scholar will design an individual professional development plan that will allow 
him/her to develop new competencies and enhanced effectiveness in clinical care, 
teaching, research, advocacy, and or leadership.  Scholars will have access to mentors 
from the Advisory Board to modify and shape the plan as they progress through the 
program.
<p>
<h3><font color="b87333">

The Faculty 
Development Program</font>
</h3>

The scholars will participate in two five-day learner-centered educational programs each 
year.  The sites of these programs will be rotated and the scholars will actively participate 
in shaping the programs.  Scholars will meet together for small group sessions, interactive 
exercises, shared projects, presentations, collaborative grant-writing and review, expert 
consultations, and planning sessions with the Advisory Board.  The content of the 
programs will be developed collaboratively between the Scholars and the Advisory 
Board, and will include the following:
<ul>
<li>Communicating with dying patients and their families
<li>Medical, psychological, and spiritual care of dying patients and their families (including 	bereavement issues)
<li>Ethical, legal, and economic issues in caring for the dying
<li>Enhancing teaching effectiveness
<li>Designing care delivery system
<li>Leadership, negotiation and conflict resolution strategies
<li>Improving public advocacy and media relations skills
<li>Program evaluation and research methods (including methods of continuous quality improvement)
<li>An agenda for changing the experience of dying and bereavement
</ul>
<p>
Members of the Advisory Board will serve as advisors, mentors, and resources to the 
Scholars to support their professional development throughout the program.  The 
Advisory Board will attend at least one meeting a year with the Scholars.  In addition, the 
Project staff will develop mechanisms for fostering networking and collaboration among 
scholars and between scholars and relevant organizations.  All Scholars will be expected 
to have E-mail capability through the Internet (some of their grant funds may be used to 
establish and maintain such a connection).
<p>
<h3><font color="b87333">

<p>The Project on Death in America of the Open 
Society Institute is  
pleased to announce the recipients of the PDIA Grants  
Program aimed at understanding and transforming the culture and  
experience of dying in America.  Funding was given to organizations  
ranging from the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC to the  
Ellen Stephen Hospice in Pine Ridge, SD.   </p>
<p>
<img align=left src="/death/okla2.jpg" hspace="40">
In the four cycles of the PDIA Grants Program, we received over fifteen hundred
 Letters of Intent from all 50 states and Canada.  Grants were  
awarded to:   two museum exhibits; a national teleconference on sudden and  
traumatic death;  a  comprehensive training and 
support program for health care
professionalsas, "The Project on Being With Dying,;" school-based bereavement services with the 
"Children's Bereavement Project;" a study examining the nature and course of traumatic 
bereavement in children who lost a family member in the bombing in Oklahoma City; well as 
studies aimed at investigating the quality of  
care received by the dying poor in a public hospital system and improving  
end-of-life care for nursing home residents.  Among the populations to be  
addressed by projects funded are dying individuals with AIDS,  
Alzheimer's, and cancer.  Other initiatives will seek to improve the care of  
the dying in hospitals, hospices, managed care organizations, and prisons. 
</p>
<p>
The Project on Death in America is funded by the Open Society Institute,  
a private operating foundation that promotes the development of open  
societies around the world and encourages public debate on policy  
alternatives in controversial fields. </p>

By the end of 1994, over 73,400 African Americans had injection-related   
AIDS or had died from it. Many thousands more were infected with   
the HIV virus. Given our current state of medical knowledge, almost   
all of the people infected with the HIV virus will eventually   
get AIDS and die. <A HREF="#note1">(1)</A><A NAME="ref1"></A>   
AIDS is now the single largest cause of death among African American   
men between the ages of 25-44 and over half of those AIDS deaths   
are injection-related.   
<P>   
In 1994 there were over 14,400 <EM>new</EM> injection-related   
AIDS cases among African Americans. That figure was <EM>twice</EM>   
the 7,200 <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases diagnosed   
among whites. (See <A NAME="fig1ref"><A HREF="fig1.html">Figure 1</A>,   
or view <A NAME="allfigsback"><A HREF="allfigs.html">all figures   
simultaneously</A>.)   
<P>   
Although many more African Americans than whites have injection-related   
AIDS, many more whites than African Americans inject drugs. In   
1993, the latest year for which US Government survey data are   
available, there were 320,000 whites who injected drugs and 133,000   
African Americans who injected drugs. <A HREF="#note2">(2)</A><A NAME="ref2"></A>   
In other words, there were <EM>almost two and a half</EM> times   
as many white injecting drug users as there were black injecting   
drug users.  (See <A NAME="fig2ref"><A HREF="fig2.html">Figure 2</A>.)   
<P>   
When we put these figures together, we find that for the most   
recent years for which data were available, <STRONG>among persons   
who injected drugs</STRONG>, African Americans were almost <EM>five</EM>   
times as likely as whites to be diagnosed as having AIDS. <A HREF="#note3">(3)</A><A

<H3><A NAME="title1"></A>Health risks for injecting drug users   
</H3>   
   
<P>   
Before the onset of the AIDS epidemic, a person who injected illicit   
drugs was at risk of dying from overdose, from a reaction to the   
substance used to cut the drug, or from hepatitis B or C. Those   
risks continue, but today the greatest risk of death resulting   
from illicit drug injection is the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.   
We know this because the US Government publishes figures on deaths   
caused by the pharmacological properties of drugs. The figures   
are upper limits on deaths caused by illicit drugs, because the   
numbers include not only deaths from illicit drugs but also accidental   
deaths, suicides and deliberate poisonings involving prescription   
drugs, medicaments, and biologicals. Using this overstated measure,   
we have an upper limit of deaths related to the pharmacological   
properties of illicit drugs. In 1992, the latest year for which   
information was available, the upper limit for deaths related   
to the pharmacological properties of illicit drugs was 11,700;   
in 1994, there were almost 27,000 <EM>new</EM><I> </I>injection-related   
AIDS cases.   
<P>   
For African Americans in 1992, there were slightly over 2000 deaths   
related to the pharmacological properties of drugs. In 1994, among   
African Americans, there were over 14,400 <I>new</I> injection-related   
AIDS cases (future deaths). In other words, even using a very   
inflated measure of the risk of dying from a drug overdose, for   
African Americans, the risk of getting AIDS was <EM>seven times</EM>   
greater than the risk of dying from an overdose. (See <A NAME="fig4ref"><A    
HREF="fig4.html">Figure 4</A>.)   
   
<P>   
In 1992, there were 256 deaths among African Americans from viral   
hepatitis, a category that includes hepatitis B and hepatitis   
C, diseases sometimes spread through sharing dirty needles. But   
the number, 256, of course, is only a tiny fraction of the 14,400   
<EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases among African Americans.   
<H3><A NAME="title2"></A>The role of arrests for possession in   
spreading HIV/AIDS</H3>   
   
<P>   
Access to sterile needles would reduce substantially the spread   
of HIV/AIDS among injecting drug users. The policy of denying   
sterile needles to persons who inject illicit drugs arose a number   
of years ago, in the pre-HIV/AIDS era. To my knowledge, no research   
has ever shown that making needle possession illegal was effective   
in reducing drug consumption. But it was effective in making sterile   
needles scarce and in encouraging persons who injected drugs to   
share their needles and their blood-related diseases.   
<P>   
With the arrival of HIV/AIDS, we had an ineffective policy of   
harassment (the denial of access to sterile needles) turn into   
a major factor in the spread of a deadly epidemic. Some states   
prevent injecting drug users from buying needles at pharmacies.   
Many states make it illegal for injecting drug users to possess   
needles. In states where mere possession of a syringe is a crime,   
the person who carries his or her own, safe needles risks arrest.   
A person can avoid being arrested for possession of an illicit   
drug by buying the drug immediately before he/she plans to use   
it. Carrying one's own clean needle, when needle possession is   
illegal, means that a person is vulnerable to arrest all the time.   
<P>   
Race is also a factor in the problem of inadequate access to clean   
needles because black communities have been particularly targeted   
for drug law enforcement efforts. In 1993, there were about 40   
whites arrested for <EM>possession</EM> of cocaine (including   
crack) or heroin for every 1,000 whites who used those drugs.   
There were about 170 blacks arrested for <EM>possession</EM> of   
cocaine (including crack) and heroin for every 1,000 blacks who   
used those drugs. In other words, cocaine and heroin-using blacks   
were over <EM>four times</EM> as likely to be arrested as their   
cocaine and heroin-using white counterparts. (See <A NAME="fig5ref"><A    
HREF="fig5.html">Figure 5</A>.)   
   
<P>   
We can now begin to see why the proportion of <EM>new</EM> injection-related   
AIDS cases is so high in the black community. Arrests for possession   
are higher. This means the legal system via the police is more   
likely to confiscate the personal needles of blacks. And because   
the black users know (correctly) that they are more vulnerable   
to arrest than white drug users, the black drug users are more   
likely to &quot;voluntarily&quot; get rid of their own clean needles   
to avoid arrest. <A HREF="#note4">(4)</A><A NAME="ref4"></A>    
<P>   
Spreading HIV/AIDS among black injecting drug users is not the   
deliberate policy of any police department. But by targeting black   
drug users for arrest, this has been the result.   
<P>   
Discrimination by pharmacies also plays a role. There is evidence   
from St. Louis that drug stores will not always sell syringes   
to African Americans even when selling syringes is legal. <A HREF="#note5">(5)</A><A

Injection-Related AIDS<br>

<P>    
By the end of 1994, almost 28,000 Latinos living in the United    
States had injection-related AIDS or had died from it. Many thousands    
more were infected with the HIV virus and will, in due course,    
also get AIDS.    
<P>    
The situation of Latinos with regard to drug use and AIDS is intermediate    
between whites and blacks. There were 71 <EM>new</EM> injection-related    
AIDS cases among Latinos in 1994 for every thousand Latinos who    
injected drugs in 1993, the latest year for which data are available.    
(See <A NAME="fig6ref"> <A HREF="fig6.html">Figure 6</A>.) Among whites,    
there were only 22 <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases for every    
thousand whites who injected drugs. In other words, the incidence of    
<EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases among Latinos who injected drugs    
was over three times higher than that for whites who injected drugs.    
<P>    
For Latinos, there were an estimated 1,100 deaths caused by the    
pharmacological properties of drugs, the rough measure we have    
of the number of deaths from drug overdoses for 1992. On the other    
hand, there were over 5100 <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS    
cases (future deaths) among Latinos in 1994. In other words, for    
Latinos, the risk of getting AIDS is almost five times greater    
than the risk of dying from an overdose. (See <A NAME="fig7ref"><A     
HREF="fig7.html">Figure 7</A>.) <P>    
In 1994, <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases among Latinos    
represented about 52 percent of all <EM>new</EM><I> </I>AIDS cases    
for which the means of transmission was known. As with all groups,    
<EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases among Latinos are a    
growing proportion of all AIDS cases. (See <A NAME="fig8ref">    
<A HREF="fig8.html"> Figure 8.</A>)    
<P>    
<I>New </I>injection-related<I> </I>AIDS cases among Latinos are    
increasing every year. AIDS has been with us in a measurable way    
since around 1981. But over three-quarters of all    
injection-related AIDS cases among Latinos have been reported    
in the last five years. The epidemic is spreading. Unless American    
policies toward access to sterile needles change, there is every    
reason to expect that <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases    
among Latinos in the next five years with be substantially greater    
than the 21,400 cases we have seen in the last five years.<HR>

<br>    
To slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic among persons who inject drugs,    
we need to make it possible for them to have access to sterile    
needles. We need to    
<UL>    
<LI>change state laws to permit possession of sterile needles    
(drug paraphernalia laws),    
<LI>change state laws to permit pharmacies to sell syringes to    
persons who do not have prescriptions, and    
<LI>change in the situation at the federal level so that communities    
can use federal funds to finance needle exchanges.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
A recently published study found a 40 percent drop in needle sharing    
by persons who inject drugs in Connecticut, after the state passed    
a law permitting pharmacies to sell sterile needles without prescriptions.    
Connecticut is only one of five states - the others are North    
Dakota, Alaska, Iowa and South Carolina - that both allow nonprescription    
sale of syringes and have no drug paraphernalia laws against their    
possession. Nine states and the District of Columbia require prescriptions    
both to buy syringes and to possess them, and they include the    
states, except for Connecticut, with the most drug users and highest    
incidence of AIDS among them: California, New York, New Jersey,    
Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. <A HREF="#note1">(1)</A><A NAME="ref1"></A>    
    
<H3><A NAME="title1"></A>Stumbling blocks to saving lives</H3>    
    
<P>    
So why haven't more state laws been changed to permit injecting    
drug users access to sterile needles? Why doesn't the federal    
government fund needle exchanges? There are several answers.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The fear that by giving clean needles to persons who inject    
drugs we are somehow encouraging the spread of drug use.</EM>    
Careful research shows that this fear has no support in the scientific    
evidence. The most recent report on this topic, the September    
1995 study by a joint panel of the National Research Council and    
the Institute of Medicine, found that needle exchange programs    
reduce the spread of HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- without    
increasing either the injecting of illegal drugs among program    
participants or the number of new initiates to injection drug    
use.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
The American Medical Association and the American Public Health    
Association endorse the use of needle exchanges.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The false hope that the threat of AIDS will cause people    
to stop using drugs and save them from the danger of a drug overdose.</EM>    
Many more people are dying of AIDS now than are dying of drug    
overdoses. It makes no sense to try to save people from one dangerous    
situation (drug overdoses) by exposing them to an even more dangerous    
situation (HIV/AIDS infection).    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The confusion which sees drug treatment as an alternative    
to needle exchanges.</EM> Drug treatment is vital and necessary.    
But not all people are ready for treatment. Having a needle exchange    
program is like having lifeguards at the beach. We need to get    
clean needles to persons who inject drugs so that they will not    
become infected with HIV/AIDS. Then, when they are ready to stop    
using drugs, as many will, they will have their whole lives before    
them, not just a series of painful, expensive illnesses ending    
in death.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
Needle exchanges can in fact become a vehicle in helping people    
seek drug treatment. For hard core drug users who have few contacts    
outside the drug-using world, needle exchange workers are an important    
source of information about where to go to get drug treatment.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The anger and frustration that sees death from HIV/AIDS    
as people getting what they deserve, that people using drugs are    
throwing their lives away and deserve whatever happens to them</EM><I>.</I>    
In many ways our society protects people from their own bad judgment.    
For example, when we require people to use seat belts and buy    
cars with air bags, we are trying to protect reckless drivers    
as well as innocent victims.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
Unequal retribution is a hard concept to defend. And right now    
that is what we have. African Americans who inject drugs are almost    
five times as likely as whites who inject drugs to be diagnosed    
with AIDS. Latinos who inject drugs are over three times as likely    
as whites who inject drugs to be diagnosed with AIDS.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The problem of the unappreciated messengers.</EM> Aside    
from public health professionals, the first and most vociferous    
groups to point out the importance of needle exchanges were gay    
activists and former (and current) injecting drug users. Both    
groups were experiencing firsthand the horrors of HIV/AIDS and    
knew they had to speak out and try change things. Negative stereotypes    
have gotten in the way of hearing their important message.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The low priority given this issue by the public</EM><I>.</I>    
In polls, the majority of both whites and blacks favor needle    
exchanges as a way of saving lives. But people do not see the    
issue as a high priority, in the sense of actively raising it    
with the government through lobbying or publicity efforts.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
Most people do not yet realize the large numbers of AIDS deaths    
that are being caused because of a lack of sterile needles. This    
is because the large numbers of injection-related AIDS cases have    
occurred only in the last few years and because the media typically    
do not highlight the injection-related aspect of the AIDS epidemic.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>Confusion about how to deal with the racial/ethnic aspect    
of injection-related AIDS</EM><I>.</I> Perhaps thinking they would    
be perpetuating a stereotype, people of good will of all racial    
and ethnic groups have been reluctant to point out the high incidence    
of injection-related AIDS among African Americans and Latinos.    
But once people realize that the cause is not differentials in    
drug use but rather lack of access to sterile needles, we should    
be able to mobilize to get sterile needles to persons who inject    
drugs.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The lack of attention given to this issue by civil rights    
organizations.</EM> Given the current political climate, there    
are a many issues that cry out for the attention and resources    
of civil rights organizations. And for all of the reasons discussed    
in this section, the vision of many, but not all civil rights    
leaders has been clouded on this issue. The result has been that    
there is very little active support for needle exchanges from    
traditional civil rights organizations and leaders.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The failure of whites concerned about social justice to    
think clearly on the issue of needle exchanges</EM><I>.</I> Although    
many whites have been victims of injection-related AIDS (41,800    
thousand through 1994), whites who are concerned about issues    
of social justice often mistakenly think of drug use and injection-related    
AIDS as a problem that only affects African Americans and Latinos.    
And seeing the problem in this way, have waited for leadership    
from civil rights organizations.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The refusal of the Clinton Administration to support federal    
funding for needle exchanges</EM><I>.</I> With little active citizen    
support for needle exchanges (and silence or actual opposition    
from most traditional civil rights organizations), the Clinton    
Administration has opposed the use of federal funding for needle    
exchanges.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
But while the Administration hesitates, it is influencing the    
expenditure of private funds as well as federal funds. Many foundations    
and corporations are simply reluctant to fund an activity which    
the federal government does not endorse. And some of the foundations    
that do provide funding for needle exchanges require research    
into the effectiveness of needle exchanges as well as the actual    
provision of needles. The problem with this is that research is    
very expensive, and it is using up scarce funds -- funds that    
could be used to save lives -- to show what has already been established    
- that needle exchanges work.    
<P>    
A further problem is that the federal government is a primary    
source of AIDS education funds, which, consistent with federal    
government policy, rarely mention needle exchanges as an important    
aspect of the fight against injection-related AIDS. By shaping    
the public debate in this way, the federal government perpetuates    
ignorance on the part of the public and holds back the build up    
of public opinion that could finally lead to federal support for    
needle exchanges.    
<UL>    
<LI><EM>The lack of coverage by the media.</EM><I> </I>For whatever    
reasons, media coverage of the needle exchange issue has been    
so minimal that people who are well informed on other social justice    
issues do not even know that there is a social justice aspect    
to the needle exchange situation.

<LI><EM>The lack of sophistication on the part of public health    
professionals in how to organize advocacy on this controversial    
subject.</EM> Many public health professionals understood several    
years ago that needle exchanges were vital to stemming the spread    
of HIV/AIDS among injecting drug users. However, public health    
professionals are accustomed to dealing with health matters as    
issues that can be handled by simply getting the correct scientific    
answer. They have not often had to mount a public relations campaign    
to change a controversial policy. Also, a number of public health    
professionals are employees of government bureaucracies and so,    
in the public arena, feel they must follow the line of the organization    
that hires them.    
</UL>    
    
<H3><A NAME="title2"></A>Saving money as well as lives</H3>    
    
<P>    
Making it possible for people to avoid getting HIV/AIDS obviously    
saves lives. It also saves money. Permitting pharmacies to sell    
syringes without prescriptions costs nothing at all.    
<P>    
Even needle exchanges save money. Using sophisticated mathematical    
models, the September 1995 National Research Council/ Institute    
of Medicine study estimates that it costs between $4,000 and $12,000    
in needle exchange expenses for each HIV infection averted for    
a five year period. This is, of course, far lower than the estimated    
$119,000 lifetime cost of treating an HIV-infected person.    
<H3><A NAME="title3"></A>Current efforts to get sterile needles    
to injecting drug users</H3>    
    
<P>    
Connecticut changed its law in 1992 to permit the purchase of    
sterile needles without a prescription. Maine did the same in    
1993. But in many states, the laws limiting access to sterile    
needles continue.    
<P>    
An April 1995 survey of 60 needle exchanges gives a fairly good    
picture on where things stand today. The 60 needle exchanges were    
operating in 46 cities and 21 states. Seventy percent of the needle    
exchanges were located in five states (California, New York, Washington,    
Connecticut and Hawaii). The seven most active needle exchanges    
accounted for 68 percent of all the syringes exchanged in 1994.    
<P>    
In addition to syringe exchange, services provided by the organizations    
include provision of latex condoms (45 organizations); HIV counseling    
and testing (23 organizations); tuberculin skin testing (12 organizations);    
primary health care (10 organizations) and directly observed tuberculosis    
therapy (6 organizations). The other organizations would have    
been interested in providing additional health and counseling    
services, if their limited budgets had permitted it.    
<P>    
The legal situations of needle exchange organizations varied.    
<UL>    
<LI>Fifty-five percent (33 organizations) reported that they were    
legal. (The program operated in a state that had no law requiring    
a prescription to purchase a hypodermic syringe (i.e. a prescription    
law) or had an exemption to the state prescription law allowing    
needle exchanges to operate.)    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>Thirty-two percent (19 organizations) reported they were illegal    
but tolerated (The program operated in a state with a prescription    
law and had received a formal vote of support or approval from    
a local elected body (e.g. a city council);    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>Thirteen percent (8 organizations) reported they were illegal.    
(The program operated in a state with a prescription law and had    
<EM>no</EM> formal support from local elected officials.) <A HREF="#note2">(2)</A><A    
NAME="ref2"></A>    
    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
The exchanges are sometimes small operations run by volunteers.    
They are financed by local donations, foundations, or in some    
cases, state or city funds. These programs are very important    
to the people they reach, but with limited resources, they are    
far from reaching all the persons who inject drugs and needed    
help. Persons working for needle exchanges often see themselves    
as part of a social movement, working for harm reduction among    
drug users.    
<P>    
In California we can see examples of the kinds of political fighting    
that goes on when serious efforts are made to establish needle    
exchanges. In 1994, California had the fourth highest number of    
<EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases in the country. The    
Governor of California has vetoed bills passed by the California    
legislature that would have legalized needle exchanges three times,    
most recently within the past year at a time when he had aspirations    
of running for President. Some local governments in California    
have handled this situation by declaring health emergencies. In    
cities using this approach, a declaration is passed by the city    
council and signed by the mayor every two weeks, stating that    
the spread of HIV/AIDS is a public health emergency and that therefore    
syringe distribution, which is prohibited by state law, is legal    
as a strategy to stem the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Some needle    
exchanges in California continue as underground activities, without    
the support of local declarations of emergency.    
<P>    
In June 1995 the Attorney General of California issued an opinion    
declaring that needle exchanges are illegal in California, even    
when an emergency has been declared. Fortunately, the California    
Attorney General's opinion carries no legal weight; it is merely    
his analysis of the situation. But there is concern that his opinion    
will have a chilling effect both on the continuation of existing    
needle exchanges and the establishment of new ones. <A HREF="#note3">(3)</A><A

<P>    
This is the current situation:    
<UL>    
<LI>For African Americans and Latinos, injection-related AIDS    
accounts for <EM>over half </EM>of all <EM>new</EM><I> </I>AIDS    
cases.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>Injection-related AIDS is a growing percentage of all <EM>new</EM>    
AIDS cases. From 1990 to 1994, injection-related AIDS cases grew    
from 59 to 63 percent of all <EM>new</EM><I> </I>AIDS cases among    
African Americans. In that same period, injection-related AIDS    
cases grew from 50 to 52 percent of all <I>new </I>AIDS cases    
among Latinos.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>African Americans who inject drugs are almost five times as    
likely as whites who inject drugs to be diagnosed with AIDS. Latinos    
who inject drugs are over three times as likely as whites who    
inject drugs to be diagnosed with AIDS.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>African Americans who use cocaine and heroin are more than    
four times as likely to be arrested for possession as whites who    
use cocaine and heroin. These differential arrest rates have been    
an important factor in the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS among African    
Americans who inject drugs. Arrest data on Latinos are not available,    
so the possibility of a relationship between arrests for drug    
possession and the rapid spread of AIDS among Latinos must be    
explored in future studies.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>The federal government, in the millions it is spending on    
AIDS prevention, is not funding a single needle exchange.    
</UL>    
    
<UL>    
<LI>Many state laws limit access to sterile needles and thus <EM>cause</EM>    
the spread of HIV/AIDS.    
</UL>    
    
<P>    
The AIDS epidemic has been with us in a measurable way since 1981.    
However, only in the last few years have large numbers of people    
been diagnosed with injection-related AIDS. <B> </B>Between 75    
and 80 percent of all the injection-related    
AIDS cases ever diagnosed in the United States among African Americans    
and Latinos have been diagnosed <EM>in the last five years</EM><I>.</I>    
    
<P>    
In the five years ending in 1994, 57,800 African Americans and    
21,400 Latinos were diagnosed with AIDS that was injection-related.    
Unless American policies toward access to sterile needles change,    
there is every reason to expect that the numbers for the next    
five years will be substantially higher.    
<P>    
The growing number of <EM>new</EM> injection-related<I> </I>AIDS    
cases diagnosed each year is a massive indication that we are    
not following appropriate policies. There are alternatives to    
what we are doing in this country. Since 1991, the federal government    
of Canada <EM>has required</EM> that the provinces start needle    
exchanges in large cities. For those who wish to buy them, syringes    
can be purchased at pharmacies. The government of Australia <EM>pays</EM>    
pharmacists to give out sterile needles to injecting drug users.    
Needle exchanges have national government support in the Netherlands    
and the United Kingdom.    
<P>    
Given the growing number of AIDS deaths that are injection-related    
and the solid scientific and medical support for getting sterile    
needles to persons who inject drugs, change in US policy is inevitable.    
The US Government will eventually <EM>have to fund </EM>needle    
exchanges. State laws limiting access to sterile needles will    
<EM>have to change</EM><I>.</I> But the question is, when will    
those changes occur? In one year? Five years? Ten years? How many    
tens of thousands of African American, Latino and other lives    
will be lost before these policies change?    
<P>    
We can all play a role in making that change happen as rapidly    
as possible. We need to educate others about the current disastrous    
situation. We need to shout that there is a fire. There is a way    
to extinguish the blaze, but first, as a society, we have to notice    
that there is a fire - and that it's burning out of control.

<P>   
This report is based on data from four national data sets prepared   
for and published by the US Government:   
<UL>   
<LI>Records of AIDS cases as reported by National Center for Infectious   
Diseases of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC);   
<LI>Illicit drug use as reported in the National Household Survey   
on Drug Abuse by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services   
Administration;   
<LI>Detailed death statistics as reported by the National Center

<LI>Drug arrests as reported by the FBI in its Uniform Crime Reports.   
</UL> <p>  
   
<b><A NAME="title1"></A>Injection-related AIDS cases</b><br>  
   
The concept of injection-related AIDS cases is based on   
the Centers for Disease Control HIV/AIDS exposure categories relevant   
to the spread of HIV/AIDS among adults through dirty needles:   
<P>   
<EM>Men:</EM> men who inject drugs and have sex with women;   
men who inject drugs and have sex with men; and heterosexual sex   
with an injecting drug user.   
<P>   
<EM>Women: </EM>injection drug use and heterosexual sex with an   
injecting drug user.   
<P>   
The data on <EM>new</EM> AIDS cases have been adjusted   
to remove HIV/AIDS cases involving persons living in Puerto Rico,   
the US Virgin Islands and other US territories. The data have   
<EM>not</EM> been increased to compensate for lateness   
of reporting. Nor has any estimate been made of the number of   
cases of <EM>unknown exposure</EM> that could reasonably be attributed   
to the use of infected needles.   
<P>   
HIV/AIDS is shorthand for a complicated disease process. The HIV-infected   
person can lead a normal life and may not even find out he or   
she is infected for some years. Once the HIV-infected person becomes   
ill and meets the current CDC criteria, we then say the person   
has AIDS. Unfortunately, it is only at this belated point that   
we begin to have a good count of infected adults. (The CDC reports   
that the count of <EM>new</EM> AIDS cases in most areas of the   
United States is more than 85 percent complete.) <br><p>  
<b><A NAME="title2"></A>Pharmacologically-related (overdose)   
deaths</b><br>  
   
The National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease   
Control publishes death and death rate information on something   
they call drug-induced causes. The casual reader might assume   
that &quot;drug-induced causes&quot; is another way of saying   
deaths caused by the use of illicit drugs. <A HREF="#note1">(1)</A>   
<A NAME="ref1"></A>To be sure, the category does include overdoses   
and other deaths from illicit drugs. But it includes much more   
than that. <p> 
The introductory notes to the statistics on drug-induced deaths   
explain:   
<blockquote>   
The category drug-induced causes includes not only deaths from   
dependent and <EM>nondependent</EM> use of drugs (<EM>legal</EM>   
and illegal use), but also poisonings from medically prescribed   
and other drugs. It excludes accidents, homicides, and other causes   
indirectly related to drug use (for drug-induced causes, see &quot;Technical   
notes&quot;). <A HREF="#note2">(2)</A> <A NAME="ref2"></A>(<EM>Italics   
added</EM>.) </blockquote>  
<p> 
The &quot;Technical notes&quot; continue:   
<blockquote>Causes of death attributable to drug-induced mortality include   
ICD-9 No. 292, Drug psychoses; No. 304, Drug dependence; Nos.   
305.2-305.9, Nondependent use of drugs, not including alcohol   
and tobacco; Nos. E850-E858, Accidental poisonings by drugs, medicaments,   
and biologicals; Nos. E950.0-E950.5, Suicide by drugs, medicaments,   
and biologicals; No. E962.0, Assault from poisoning by drugs and   
medicaments; and Nos. E980.0-E980.5, Poisonings by drugs, medicaments,   
and biologicals, undetermined whether accidentally or purposely   
inflicted. Drug-induced causes exclude accidents, homicides, and   
other causes indirectly related to drug use. <A HREF="#note3">(3)</A><A NAME="ref3"></A>  
</blockquote>  
   
<P>   
Technical subjects are, well, technical. But we can safely conclude   
that &quot;drug-induced causes&quot; does include many kinds of   
deaths in addition to deaths from overdoses and the other kinds   
of deaths people usually mean when they think of deaths caused   
by illicit drugs.   
<P>   
In this report, I have called &quot;pharmacologically-related&quot;   
the group of deaths that the National Center for Health Statistics   
calls &quot;drug-induced.&quot; But whatever the name, any comparison   
of deaths from (&quot;drug-induced&quot;/ &quot;pharmacologically-related&quot;)   
causes with <EM>new </EM>AIDS cases is a conservative comparison,   
an overstatement of the number of illicit-injection-related deaths.   
<P>   
The number of Latino pharmacologically-related deaths were estimated   
by assuming that deaths to Latinos due to the pharmacological   
properties of drugs were proportional to the number of Latinos   
in each of the racial groups in 1992. Since Latinos were 10 percent   
of the white population in 1992, it was estimated that 10 percent   
of the pharmacologically-related deaths among whites involved   
Latinos. Similarly, since Latinos were 4 percent of the black   
population and 7 percent of the combined Asian and American Indian   
populations, it was estimated that Latino deaths were 4 and 7   
percent of the pharmacologically-related deaths in each of those   
groups respectively.   
<P>   
Using this procedure, there were an estimated 1,073 pharmacologically-related   
deaths among Latinos in 1992. This 1,073 contrasts dramatically   
with the 5,765 <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases   
(future deaths) among Latinos in 1992. So even if the estimate   
of pharmacologically-related deaths were 100 percent too low (a   
very unlikely circumstance), the number of pharmacologically-related   
deaths among Latinos would still be substantially lower than the   
number of <EM>new</EM> injection-related AIDS cases among   
Latinos.   
<P>   
The figures for pharmacologically-related deaths by race are fairly   
stable, growing only slowly each year, so the comparison of 1992   
pharmacologically-related deaths and 1994 <EM>new</EM> AIDS cases   
is not unreasonable.   
<P>   
It would be of great interest to know how many deaths actually   
are caused by illicit drugs each year. One hopes that the resources   
for producing such figures will soon be given to the Centers for   
Disease Control. <br><p>  
<b><A NAME="title3"></A>Arrest data</b> <br>  
   
The FBI publishes data on arrests by state and local law enforcement   
agencies. The 1993 arrest data, as used in this report, cover   
law enforcement agencies serving over 80 percent of the US population.   
<P>   
The arrest data are a count of all arrests made, so that if a   
person is arrested twice in a given year, that person is counted   
twice. There is no way to avoid this problem when using this data   
set; the reader just needs to be aware of what the data mean. <br><p>  
<b><A NAME="title4"></A>Data on persons who inject drugs</b> <br>  
   
The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse is the thirteenth   
in a series initiated in 1971. The survey, using procedures designed   
to protect respondent confidentiality, asks very detailed questions   
about illicit drug use. These are the data the US Government uses   
to examine trends in illicit drug use.   
<P>   
This survey, based on a representative sample of households, does   
not include persons who inject drugs who are homeless, institutionalized,   
or transient. There are large standard errors associated with   
the estimated number of injection drug users reported in this   
survey. It is however, the best information available on injection   
drug use by race/ethnicity. And although the survey estimates   
of injection drug users vary substantially from year to year,   
the number of white injecting drug users in each year is substantially   
higher than the number of black injecting drug users.   
<P>   
In 1993 the total number of persons who injected drugs according   
to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse was 561,000. Other   
estimates of the total number of persons who inject drugs have   
varied substantially, some going as high as 1.5 million or 2 million.   
<A HREF="#note4">(4)</A><A NAME="ref4"></A><A NAME="ref4"></A><br><p>  
   
<b><A NAME="title5"></A>Arrest data and data on persons who inject   
drugs</b>   
   
<br>   
In the analysis, we look at arrests for drug possession relative   
to the number of persons reporting cocaine and heroin use. The   
information on arrests for drug possession was   
available for whites <EM>including</EM> Latinos and blacks <EM>including</EM>   
Latinos. The information on heroin and cocaine use in   
the past year was available for whites <EM>excluding</EM> Latinos and blacks <EM>excluding</EM>   
Latinos. To make the   
data more comparable, the choice was either to (a) allocate drug   
use among Latinos to whites and blacks or (b) allocate arrests   
for drug possession of whites and blacks to Latinos. Alternative   
(a) was chosen because Latinos are a relatively small group and   
their addition would not change the drug use figures among either   
whites or blacks by very much. The information on Latino drug   
use was allocated to the white and black groups according to their   
portion in each population group in 1993. Since 91 percent of   
Latinos consider themselves white, 91 percent of the Latino persons   
who reported drug use were included with white drug users. Similarly,   
since 5 percent of Latinos consider themselves black, 5 percent   
of Latino drug users were included among blacks. The remaining   
3 percent of Latinos, those who consider themselves American Indian   
or Asian, were not included in the analysis. <hr><br>

<a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@klMKTgcArA3aZ**c/twep/artslink/exhibitions/hospice/"><b>Hospice: A Photographic Inquiry</b></a> is a collaborative effort between the 
National Hospice Foundation and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.  Five 
internationally recognized American photographers -- Jim Goldberg, Nan Goldin, 
Sally Mann, Jack Radcliffe and Kathy Vargas -- were commissioned to produce 
works that explore the art of hospice care and the experience of living and 
dying in hospice.  The Project on Death in America believes that 
<b>Hospice: A Photographic Inquiry</b> is a unique opportunity to bring 
together those who will be most active in transforming the culture of dying 
in the United States: artists, health care professionals and the public.  
The film, <b>Letting Go: A Hospice Journey</b> a documentary film produced 
for HBO by Susan Froemke and Deborah Dickson with Albert Maysles accompanies 
the exhibit.

<p><b>Decisions Near the End of Life:  Focus on Cancer Care</b> is a national training initiative 
designed to assist cancer specialists in meeting the challenges of caring for their patients near the end of 
life. The <b>Decisions Near End of Life</b> program is a multidisciplinary, institution-based program 
designed to improve terminal and palliative care in U.S. hospitals and nursing homes by promoting more 
humane and rational decision making about the use of life-sustaining medical technologies.  Institutions 
participating in the first <b>Decisions Near the End of Life: Focus on Cancer Care</b> program will be 
encouraged to develop strategies for better integrating palliative care with other cancer treatment 
modalities.  The action steps they put in place as a result of participation in this process will be shared with 
many cancer care institutions across the country in later phases of this project.  Thus, the institutions 
participating in the pilot program will serve as models for improving the quality of care for patients near 
the end of life throughout the United States.  </p>

Managed health care has swiftly replaced traditional health care institutions.  These new large health care

<p>There is now a clear yearning in American society to talk about death in new and franker ways.  This conference offers an in-depth opportunity for open, heartfelt exploration of this critical and essential subject; and for the sharing of practical tech
niques and inspiring examples of new approaches to the art of dying.  It brings together many of the most outstanding innovators in palliative care--doctors, nurses, hospice workers, therapists--with members of the general public and with those who have e
xplored the nature of death from a spiritual or philosophical perspective.  The goal is to expand and deepen the conversation on the many vital issues we all must face when we confront this most inescapable of human experiences.</p>

policy and the international aspects of crime and law enforcement. Over the past seven years, Nadelmann's 
critiques of United States drug control policy and his recommendations for alternatives to drug prohibition 
have attracted international attention and played a significant role in stimulating the growing debate over 
drug policy in the U.S. and abroad. 
 
<p>Nadelmann's writings on drug policy have appeared in a wide range of general- and special-interest 
publications including <i>Science</i>, <i>Foreign Policy</i>, <i>National Review</i>, <i>The Public 
Interest</i>, <i>Daedalus</i>, <i>American Heritage</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Los Angeles 
Times</i> and International <i>Herald Tribune</i>. A May 1994 special issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i> 
entitled "Drugs in America" featured an introductory piece co-authored by Nadelmann and <i>Rolling 
Stone</i> Editor and Publisher Jann Wenner.</p> 
 
<p>Nadelmann has appeared on dozens of television and radio programs including <i>Nightline</i>, 
<i>MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour</i>, <i>Donohue</i>, <i>The Today Show</i>, <i>Sunday Today</i>, 
<i>48 Hours</i>, <i>CBS Morning News</i>, <i>NBC Nightly News</i>, Ted Koppel Special Reports, 
MTV Special Reports and <i>Larry King Live</i>. He lectures frequently, and has spoken before 
audiences throughout North and South America and in Europe and Australia.</p> 
 
<p>Formerly on the faculty of Princeton University, Nadelmann is the founding chair of the Princeton 
Working Group on the Future of Drug Use and Alternatives to Drug Prohibition. The group is preparing 
two reports, one on harm reduction approaches to drug policy, the other on non-prohibitionist models of 
drug control. Nadelmann is also co-editor of <i>Psychoactive Drugs and Harm Reduction: From Faith to 
Science (1993)</i>.</p> 
 
<p>Nadelmann's scholarly work in international crime and law enforcement includes <a 
href="tlccops.html"><i>Cops Across Borders: The Internationalization of U.S. Criminal Law 
Enforcement</i></a> (1993) and a manuscript in progress, <i>Criminalization and Crime Control in 
International Society</i>, as well as numerous articles for law journals and other publications. Research 
for these books included some 300 interviews with law enforcement agents in the United States and 
nineteen other countries. Nadelmann also authored a classified report for the U.S. State Department on 
drug trafficking and money laundering.</p> 
 
<p>From 1987 to 1994, Nadelmann was assistant professor of politics and public affairs in the Politics 
Department and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. 
Born in New York City and raised in suburban Westchester County, he attended McGill University and 
received his B.A. from Harvard University (1979). He also received his J.D. (1984) and Ph.D. in Political 
Science (1987) from Harvard, and received a Masters Degree in International Relations from the London 
School of Economics (1980). </p>

<B>Introduction</B>       
<P>          
The exchange of infected blood from user to user during the injection process is currently           
believed to be the primary means of transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency           
Virus (HIV) among injecting drug users (IDUs).(1, 2, 3, 4)  Such blood-blood contact can           
be established through various routes, of which needle sharing has received the bulk of           
attention in both the mass media and the scientific literature. As is established in the           
previous two chapters, this has blurred the view on other, distinct, potentially hazardous           
parts of the process of preparing and self-administering an injection of drugs. Sharing           
water, used for cooking and rinsing, sharing of other drug injection paraphernalia, and,           
most notably, sharing of collectively prepared drug solutions can all include risks of viral           
transmission. But, needle sharing is a limited concept for more reasons. While lending,           
borrowing, passing on and renting a syringe may be covered by the term, from a semantic           
point of view, picking up a needle that another user left behind (as Dirk did in chapter           
12.2) can hardly be called an act of sharing. After all, sharing requires at least two           
participants.          
 <P>          
This subtle, but important semantic distinction is also of main interest to           
the question dealt with in this chapter: Is needle sharing a ritual? In the context of this           
dissertation this question cannot be omitted. But besides theoretical, there are also           
pragmatic public health considerations. For one thing, if needle sharing is a ritualized           
behavior, this should have consequences for education and prevention campaigns aimed           
at IDUs. And in fact, the argument that needle sharing is a ritual is often put forward in           
objections to harm reduction oriented approaches towards the HIV epidemic among           
IDUs, such as needle exchange. This chapter will explore the question whether or not the           
sharing of needles is a self-perpetuating ritualized part of injecting drug use. First, it will           
review the existing literature on ritualized needle sharing. In this review special attention           
will be directed at the terminology and definitions used. It will critically examine           
statements and conclusions made and extensively screen data presented and the           
references these are supported with. Secondly, needle sharing will be discussed in light of           
the definitions and theories of ritual and the findings reported in this thesis. From the           
preceding linguistic discussion it can already be derived that not all events that are           
generally included in the term needle sharing are expressions of ritual. Picking up and           
using a left behind fit can impossibly be considered a ritual. The coincidental nature of           
such an event excludes the development of a stereotypical sequence--a basic requirement           
of ritual. Furthermore, a symbolic goal cannot be distinguished in this incident, as sharing           
requires more than one person. It takes two to tango. The primary focus of this discussion           
will be if, and under what conditions needle sharing can be regarded a ritual behavior.           
Finally, the chapter will investigate who herald the notion of ritual needle sharing--on           
what do they base their statements; what are their motives.          
<P>          
<B>Ritual Aspects of Needle Sharing: A Review of the Literature</B>        
<P>          
In preparing this review it was surprising to learn that little is written about actual needle sharing events in           
their socio-cultural context. Even less studies discuss or mention ritual in relation to needle sharing.           
An extensive review produced 13 papers which discussed ritual or symbolic aspects of           
needle sharing. Eight of these were published by (US) American, one by Canadian and           
four by European authors.          
<P>          
The first two highly derivative articles, by Tempesta and Di Giannantonio, discuss the relations between           
needle sharing and the high prevalence of HIV among Italian IDUs. Despite the alleged absence of           
restrictions for over the counter sale of syringes and needles, the HIV-seroprevalence in Italy is among the           
highest in Europe, which is, as Moss writes, indeed alarming.(5) This so-called Italy argument has           
also been put forward against needle exchange and other efforts to liberalize the availability of injection           
equipment, e.g. in the USA. Tempesta and Di Giannantonio explain the high Italian HIV seroprevalence           
rates in terms of "insufficient knowledge" and "ritual and special patterns of behavior." (6) The authors           
claim that in their study, HIV-seropositive IDUs tended to share needles for ritual and habitual reasons,           
while the HIV-seronegative IDUs shared because of temporary difficulties in finding a syringe. In           
both groups promiscuity was common, but, according to the authors, in the former group this behavior had           
ritualistic characteristics, while in the latter group promiscuity seemed due to circumstantial reasons. It is           
unclear what the authors mean with this statement. A study into the sexual practices of 1214 Italian           
heterosexual IDUs did not mention such peculiarities.(7) They describe the former group as "heavily           
conditioned to the ritualistic and social use of drugs in which needle sharing has a high symbolic           
meaning."8 "[T]heir peculiar psychopathology prevents them from being sensitive to prevention-promoting           
campaigns. Moreover, for this group, every injection is a symbolic challenge to death. Thus, these subjects           
feel a drive for drugs which is stronger than any other consideration."(6)          
<P>          
In neither article do the authors define the terms they use and their bold statements are not supported by the           
presented data or by references. The impression of IDUs they present bears more resemblance to a tabloid           
caricature than a scientific representation of research results.           
<P>          
The paradoxical Italian situation--absence of official restrictions on needle availability and a high infection           
rate--may well be explained by a combination of alternative, more down-to-earth, factors. For example,           
Rezza et al. found that almost half of their IDU subjects affirmed to have shared needles because of           
unavailability.(9) Furthermore, apparently citing the Rezza et al. study (without reference), Tempesta and           
Di Giannantonio add that nine percent shared "because syringe purchase presented problems." (8) This           
suggests a discrepancy between the official availability in pharmacies and drug stores, and the actual           
availability, as experienced and perceived by IDUs. Tempesta's and Di Giannantonio's allusion that           
pharmacists might refuse to sell syringes to IDUs may be an important factor underlying the discrepancy           
between official syringe policies and IDUs' perceived availability of injection equipment. Several Italian           
heroin users at the Rotterdam Central Railway Station denied that syringes can be purchased without           
prescription in pharmacies and drug stores.(10) This situation is not specific for Italy, as in both the           
Netherlands and in most parts of the United Kingdom syringes and needles have never been scheduled, but           
significant numbers of pharmacists are, both before and after the consequences of needle sharing for the           
AIDS epidemic became apparent, reluctant to sell syringes to IDUs.(11, 12, 13) The Italian situation is           
presumably exacerbated by a disastrous combination of a lack of knowledge about HIV and AIDS and an           
insufficient or too late educational intervention. Feldman and Biernacki compared the Italian situation with           
the San Francisco gay scene in the first stage of the epidemic:           
<BLOCKQUOTE>          
[C]ondoms were available to gay men in San Francisco during the period when the virus was spreading           
through the homosexual population. The fact that they were not used seems more the result of gay           
men not knowing that unprotected sex, particularly anal intercourse, allowed the virus to enter their bodies.           
The missing ingredient, we are suggesting is the concerted education campaign ...(14)         
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
 <P>         
In the Rezza et al. study nearly 20% of the people, who reported that they never shared needles, were          
seropositive.(9) Therefore, other risk behaviors conceivably have played a role in the rapid spread of HIV          
among Italian IDUs. These may be sexual practices, such as high levels of unprotected sex, or drug use          
related, such as frontloading or similar drug sharing practices.          
<P>          
In Britain, the ethnographer Power noted that "there is no ritualism associated with the sharing of needles           
and syringes. ...Sharing in Britain results from the shortage of freely available needles and syringes."(13)           
The needle exchange evaluation studies by Stimson et al. confirmed this view. They showed that in Britain           
needle sharing is largely determined by availability problems, situational and social factors (e.g.,           
homelessness).(15, 16, 17) However, Ghodse et. al. doubt the positive effect of an increased availability of           
syringes on needle sharing, "[b]ecause sharing of syringes is associated with a feeling of community           
among drug users and not only with a shortage of needles."(18) This statement is, however, not based           
on their findings, but references a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine by the           
American researchers Black et al.          
<P>          
In their report on a study at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital Black et al. also question the           
effectivity of increased syringe availability without educational interventions, "since needle sharing has           
been found to be associated with socialization, communal feelings, and protection in the drug subculture,           
not merely with shortages of needles." (19)  Again, this is not an empirical finding of the research reported,           
but a reference to a 1970 study by Howard and Borges(20) (in the letter the two references are mixed up).           
<P>          
Likewise, Newmeyer et al. refer to "the ritual of needle sharing"(21) and Newmeyer writes "[E]ven if rigs           
are abundant, there remain social and psychological reasons for sharing (for example, the expression of           
interpersonal trust or bonding)."(22)  The authors, however, fail to explain what they mean by ritual and do           
not support their statements with empirical evidence or references.          
<P>         
Smith claims that "needle sharing is an integral part of the drug taking ritual" and that sterile needles will          
not eliminate that ritual, but it will reduce some of theassociated medical risk."(23) However, just as the          
preceding publications, this article does not present empirical data to support this statement. Smith also          
doubts the effectivity of needle distribution:          
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
The assumption that distribution of free needles will change the ritual and that each individual will use          
their own outfit except when they are really high or junk sick is questionable at best, because addiction is          
characterized by a compulsion to use, the loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse          
consequences.         
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
This articleis confusing and inaccurate in several aspects. The supposed awareness of street addicts           
"of the risk of AIDS associated with needle sharing" is supported with a reference to the Howard and          
Borges article (20), published in 1970, well before the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the USA. A clear          
mistake. The above mentioned Black et al. study is extensively cited. Smith uses the same quote on          
symbolic meanings of needle sharing as Ghodse (which as already demonstrated, is based on the Howard          
and Borges article). Some percentages of the Black et al. study are presented, but two of the cited          
percentages on needle sharing do not match the original report in the New England Journal of  Medicine.          
Furthermore the impression is created as if two distinctive studies are cited, because not only the original          
study is mentioned, but also a review of this study, without connecting the two.(24)  For a large part these          
mistakes and inaccuracies may be the result of the author's casual reading.          
<P>         
But after reviewing both sources carefully one cannot but conclude that Smith's writing displays          
carelessness of plagiaristic proportions. Many sentences have the (almost) exact wording of the review          
without quotation marks, one time referencing the original paper, the other the review. This also explains          
the mistakes to a great degree. The sentences that give the (wrong) percentages on needle sharing are exact          
copies of the review, but reference the original report. One of these percentages is a copy of a mistake of          
the reviewer, in the other the integers are transposed. The inaccurate AIDS awareness reference to the          
Howard and Borges article is also a copy of a mistake of the reviewer. Likewise, the quote on the symbolic          
meanings of needle sharing also leans heavily on the wording of the review. Surely in these last two           
instances the author should have known better, as in 1972 he himself edited a book in which the Howard          
and Borges article was reprinted.(25)         
<P>         
Three of the discussed articles refer to the Howard and Borges article.(20)  This article is one of the very          
few empirical studies into the ritual aspects of needle sharing. It discusses the results of fifty interviews          
held in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in 1968. The article is frequently cited in          
contemporary publications on the relationship between needle sharing and HIV transmission. Therefore it          
was reviewed with extra attention. According to the methods section, the study subjects were non-         
randomly selected based on appearance and interviewed by a student interviewer.          
<P>         
People that denied injecting drug use and, with a few exceptions, IDUs who denied needle sharing were          
excluded from the sample. Females were deliberately oversampled. Of a subsample of 36 (18m, 18f), 11          
subjects (8 f, 3m) had injected drugs less than ten times altogether. The median ages were 20.5 for males          
and one and a half years younger for females. The overwhelming majority of subjects had life time          
experience with narcotics, sedative hypnotics, amphetamines, LSD and other synthetic or botanical          
hallucinogens, cannabis and other psychoactive preparations, either orally (swallowing or smoking) or          
parenterally.          
<P>         
The study showed that almost all subjects were aware of the negative consequences of needle sharing and          
they tried to counter these by a variety of measures and techniques. Pragmatic considerations were found to          
be the dominant incentives for sharing needles: The shortage of needles and syringes was most often          
mentioned as reason for needle sharing, followed by fear of arrest and economic incentives --"it saves the           
cost of outfits and because sharing can be tantamount to sharing drugs" (one has the dope, the other the          
works).(20) Sharing was found to be part a more general pattern, as food, lodging and drugs were          
frequently shared. Subjects said they generally shared needles at home or at a friends residence, with          
friends or intimates, rarely with strangers.          
<P>         
Females shared needles more often than males. 65% of the women had never shot alone compared to 25%          
of the men. 56% of women compared to 17% of the men always shared needles. 68% of the males          
compared to 29% of the females had at one time or another injected themselves. These differences           
are explained in terms of socialization into injecting drug use and traditional sex role differentiation.          
Traditional sex roles can thus be seen to restrict women's availability of both drugs and works, as one of          
the female subjects expressed, "My husband would not get me a new point. The only way I can get the          
dope is by sharing with him."          
<P>         
Only after being prompted, 20% of the sample mentioned "a feeling of closeness" in sharing. However,          
when discussing group shooting in general 20% spontaneously mentioned the importance of relating to          
others and feeling a sense of community, while 32% emphasized communicational aspects and the sharing          
of experiences. When discussing "means of protection" the distinction between needle sharing and group          
shooting was blurred by the respondents, but 18% of the sample mentioned feelings of security and          
protection provided by the group. The authors argue that "sharing needles leads to a greater protection than          
shooting in a group with one's own fit, because sharing conveys a greater sense of identification, bondage,          
and responsibility." This argument is, however, not really supported by their data or by preferences.          
Moreover, the argument that needle sharing leads to shooting the same amount of the drug, which is          
perceived safer by the authors, is inaccurate for two reasons. First, shooting the same amount is not very          
likely as the injected dose highly depends on individual tolerance levels. In particular in mixed groups of          
experienced and unexperienced users or in initiations such a practice may even be dangerous. And second,          
titration of individual doses does not require needle sharing.         
<P>         
The article also discusses status achievement and the findings indicate that status is allocated with drug          
tolerance, needle tracks and injecting skills, and the willingness to share drugs. Ensuing, the sexual          
connotation of sharing needles is addressed and the authors suggest sexual overtones to needle usage.          
Finally, the authors discuss self-destructive and masochistic aspects of injecting drug use. They speculate          
that such tendencies may help explain endured needle sharing in spite of knowledge of the negative          
consequences. However, the results presented on the last three items (status achievement, sexual          
connotations and self-destructive/masochistic refer to needle usage and not to needle sharing and can           
therefore hardly be used in explaining the latter.         
<P>         
This article provides a unique view of the social setting of injecting drug use in a group of San Franciscan          
hippies. But its results are not definitive, as it has some important limitations. In particular the findings on          
the often cited "community feelings," security/protection" and "socialization" must be considered with          
considerable caution. It is rather ambiguous if the presented data on these items exclusively refers to needle          
sharing or to group injecting in general. Not only the subjects seemed to mix them up, but data on group          
drug use are used to support statements on needle sharing. Therefore, the presented results do not          
convincingly show that needle sharing is a self-perpetuating ritual in the study sample. As the article          
indicates,  needle sharing often appeared in the context of drug sharing, which, as chapter nine          
demonstrated, is an important part of group drug taking and often does have symbolic functions. The quote          
of one female subject, "In some circles there's a social stigma if you don't share," may well address the          
wider practice of drug sharing.           
<P>         
A second, and more important, shortcoming is the generalizability of the results. As the authors suggest, it          
is indeed important to know how (a)typical their sample is for other IDU populations. In the present          
decade, the second in the AIDS-era, this question is more opportune than ever. The second half of the          
1960s was an atypical and turbulent time. The hippie subculture, the Vietnam war and the anti-war          
movement, the sexual revolution and upcoming drug use among  white (middle class) youth all fused in a          
juncture of which the main, and lasting,  characteristics were the emancipation of youth and the diffusion          
of drug use into large segments of most Western nations. Since then, things have changed rather          
drastically. For the AIDS generation the day-to-day worries of the love generation have lost most of their          
validity. Make love not war has been replaced by a more sabre-rattling slogan: War on Drugs. In the          
western hemisphere drug use has become a stable phenomenon, while in many drug producing countries          
and the former socialist countries drug use is booming as new consumer markets develop. (26, 27, 28)          
More than half of the sample in the Howard and Borges study never self-injected drugs.(i) Combined with          
their drug use characteristics, this strongly suggests that many of this study's subjects were in a beginning,          
experimental phase of their drug use careers. Moreover, their sociodemographic characteristics only          
minimally match those found among current IDU populations.(7, 15, 29, 30, 31)  Finally, the specific           
ideology and spirit of the times of the <P>late 1960s may have influenced the self-images and assessment          
of drug use variables by the research subjects. As the authors write in their conclusion, "the relative          
importance of the various possibilities involved in sharing is yet to be determined.         
<P>         
Des Jarlais and his colleagues reported on needle sharing in the social setting of the pre-AIDS drug          
subculture in New York City. Their well documented descriptions of the social context of needle sharing          
emphasize the subcultural context of injecting drug use. They describe a highly repressed social structure          
around the procurement and use of drugs in which "interpersonal trust is in precarious balance with a          
generalized mistrust."(32)  This deviant subculture shares values, rules and language, and functions as a           
communication network spreading oral information about drug availability, police actions and other          
valuable information.(33)  In general, their findings match the results presented in chapter nine, although          
the level of repression, due to the ongoing drugs war, seems to result in more extreme situations and          
behaviors. They found that in the pre-AIDS period, needle sharing was usually associated with initiation          
into use--the person to be inducted normally did not carry a syringe--, the use of shooting galleries, and          
practical utility and social bonding between running partners.(32)  In particular "the sharing of needles          
within such running partner relations symbolizes a social bonding that makes it very difficult for one or          
more group members to use only his or her own set of works ..."(34)  Regarding pre-AIDS needle sharing

Prior to concern about AIDS, the sharing of drug injection equipment was normal behavior among IV drug          
users. There were multiple reasons for sharing, from the social norms within the small friendship groups to          
greater availability of used equipment when a person had drugs to inject. While there was some concern          
about hepatitis, there were no overriding reasons not to share drug injection equipment.(33)         
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
Finally one recent report from Canada claimed that needle exchange and similar strategies "would be          
generally ineffective, because [among other reasons] sharing needles communally [w]as part of           
the sexual ritual of fixing."(35)  Data to substantiate this bold statement was, however, not presented.         
<P>         
Based on this literature review it is clear that scientific support for the thesis that ritual is a self-         
perpetuating ritual is scanty. None of the discussed studies utilized explicit definitions of ritual. All but two          
studies fail to support statements regarding the alleged symbolic properties of needle sharing with          
empirical data. Some authors just present the argument without reference. In other papers references are          
mixed up or inappropriate. A questionable practice of chain-referencing has been found, leading back to          
the in 1970 published study of  Howard and Borges. Reading the original study makes it clear that many of          
those referencing it failed to do so. The findings of this study must, however, be interpreted with reticence.          
Moreover, both this study and those of Des Jarlais and colleagues on the ritual and symbolic aspects of          
needle sharing reflect drug use situations (long) before the onset of AIDS. It can thus be concluded that the          
studied literature does not give a decisive answer to the question whether contemporary needle sharing is a           
ritualized part of drug using behavior and if so, under what conditions such rituals develop.          
<P>         
<B>Needle Sharing and Conditions for Ritualization</B>         
<P>         
The reviewed literature offers thus little empirical evidence to support the idea of a needle sharing ritual,          
independent of other social, psychological, cultural and economic influences. But, as the extensive          
literature review on the concept of ritual (chapter two) suggested, in essence all behavior may  be subject to          
ritualization processes. From that perspective needle sharing is not an exception. In order to determine the          
ritual dimensions of needle sharing, it must be examined in light of the relevant definitions of ritual and          
ritual objects. In particular, the conditions regarding injecting equipment and those regarding illegal drug          
use in general must be considered. In short, these definitions state the following requirements: For an event          
to be a ritual event it must follow a prescribed sequence of psychomotor acts which has special meaning          
for the performer.(36)  The condition of special meaning has a double meaning, referring to instrumental          
and symbolic goals. The ritual value of an object--its capacity for ritualization--is determined by the          
subjective importance it has gained due to its scarcity.(37, 38, 39)  Through a low availability, objectively          
important objects are transformed into subjectively important objects. This may lead to the appendage of          
symbolic elaboration (social importance) to the object, increasing the ritual value. (For a detailed          
discussion see chapter two).         
<P>         
<B>Needle sharing Compared with Drug Sharing--Different Objects, Different Statuses</B>         
<P>         
As has been demonstrated in chapters nine and eleven, drugs were often shared among the research          
subjects and, in general, these sharing events fulfilled the definitional requirements of ritual interaction.          
Not only standardized interaction sequences were observed in these drug sharing events, but these          
interactions served both instrumental and symbolic purposes. In contrast, needle sharing as a planned or          
stereotypical sequence in which two or more people share a syringe was not ever observed. A typical          
pattern of needle sharing was non-existent. The recorded cases of needle sharing could not be interpreted in          
terms of ritual interaction and were mainly determined by situational variables (see chapter twelve). This          
difference is explained  by the disparate statuses of the two objects in regards to the definitional          
requirements of ritual and ritual objects. Drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, not only have a recognized          
objective importance among their users, but due to prohibition and the resulting exorbitant black market          
prices they have become scarce objects. Therefore,  they gained substantial subjective importance and have          
become the instrumental imperative for the formation of a drug-centered community.(40)  Not surprisingly,           
drugs are the most important incentive for, and subject of, interaction in this community. Sharing drugs has          
both short term and long term instrumental advantages. It prevents instances of intensive withdrawal          
experiences, as there is normally a fellow user willing to help with a betermakertje. This has created a           
network of mutual obligations which surpass debts between individual users. Drug sharing is also          
inundated with symbolic meaning. Sharing drugs facilitates contact and communication, smothers conflict          
and reinforces enduring relationships among individuals of equal (deviant) status. Strict norms have          
developed around the sharing of drugs. Drug sharing sanctions the integration into normatively regulated          
social behavior of the activities which the users' desire for drugs urge them to perform.(41)  Ultimately,          
drug sharing is aimed at maintaining the subculture. In contrast, needles have never been restricted in the          
Netherlands and due to the exchange programs, sterile injection equipment can normally be easily          
obtained. Although needles hold a recognized objective value in the IDU subculture, the easy availability          
of new needles precludes the regular sharing of used ones. Because needle sharing is not a regular event,          
there is no room for the development of stylized, stereotypical behavioral sequences. The absence of          
scarcity likewise prevents the development of subjective importance and the addition of community values.          
<P>         
<B>The Netherlands v.s. the USA--Different Drug Policy Contexts, Different Outcomes</B>         
<P>         
In the United States drug sharing has also been documented, representing similar community values.(14, 33          
36, 42, 43)  The legal status of heroin and cocaine is not essentially different in the USA and the          
Netherlands--in both countries these drugs are illicit. However, the enforcement policies can be seen to          
diverge substantially. While the Dutch approach has resulted in rather stable and less violent drug          
subcultures, the work of Des Jarlais et al. and other research groups indicate that in America the           
subcultures surrounding these drugs are volatile and violent.(32)  Generalized feelings of mistrust, though          
not completely absent among Dutch users, seem more normative among American users. The, compared to          
the Dutch situation, lower and less stable drug availability has not only induced a more elaborated          
monetarization of mutual services (for example commercially exploited shooting galleries, needle rental          
and paid house doctors) (32, 44, 45), but sharing behaviors, symbolized by the sharing of  drugs, seem less          
consistent and limited to smaller groups or networks around the individuals, exemplified by the dyadic          
relationship of running partners.(14, 46)  When sharing is limited to only the most significant other(s), the          
event increasingly becomes distinguishing and revered, thereby increasing the binding force of the           
ritual.          
<P>         
In contrast with that of drugs, the legal status of injection equipment in the USA and the Netherlands is          
significantly different. In the Netherlands injection equipment has never been scheduled, while in most          
states of  the USA they are. After the development of the Model Drug Paraphernalia Act by the Drug          
Enforcement Administration in 1979, thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws          
based on the model act, while an additional nine states have passed similar laws. With a broad range of          
other drug paraphernalia, these laws prohibit the distribution and possession of drug injection equipment.          
The Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act, enacted in 1986, criminalized the interstate          
transport of these objects.(47)  These laws did not criminalize up to then unscheduled objects, but merely          
streamlined the existing legislation. It is therefore not surprising that the little empirical evidence for          
ritualization or symbolic elaboration around needle sharing comes from the USA comes, to be concise,          
from New York City and San Francisco. Both cities are located in states with legal restrictions on the          
availability and possession of hypodermic syringes and needles.         
<P>         
These legal restrictions have limited the overall availability of injection equipment significantly, while fear           
of arrest on possession charges often discourages IDUs to carry their personal set which further reduces          
their on-the-spot availability. The low availability has turned needles into scarce commodities in the          
American drug subculture. This structural scarcity increased their (subcultural) economic value and          
inspired several expressions of monetarization around the provision of needles. Hopkins documented a          
structural black market in needles.(48)(ii)  In addition to new needles, needle sellers not infrequently sold          
resealed used needles as new. Such profiteering may put IDUs unknowingly at risk for HIV infection. Used          
needles are often anonymously used at commercial shooting galleries, which are documented sources of          
HIV spread.(3, 49)  In a shooting gallery individuals pay an entrance fee and rent a (mostly used) needle.           
Both needle selling and running a shooting gallery are motivated by economic incentives. For a          
considerable number of users these activities are an important source of income.(iii)          
<P>         
Nevertheless, the low needle availability has created a situation in which ritualization processes around          
needle sharing could develop. But renting a needle at a commercial shooting gallery cannot be interpreted           
in terms of ritual. Galleries mostly serve transient populations and proprietor and visitor have a foremostly          
(short lasting) monetary relationship. Use of shooting galleries is primarily determined by pragmatic          
factors and the use of these venues has been associated with homelessness, lack of financial resources and          
the absence of (friends that could supply) a place to get off.(16, 45)  In general, interactions in such places          
do not meet the definitional requirements for ritual interaction.          
<P>         
As Turner pointed out, the closer the bond outside the potential, ritualized situation, the more meaning the          
ritual act will have.(50) Thus, ritualized needle sharing is more expected among IDUs with multiplex          
relationships--(sexual) partners, friends and other close relationships. Although, the preceding literature           
review produced little empirical evidence to substantiate this expectation, the finding that the majority of          
IDUs generally only shares with people they know well (19), is perhaps an indication of social ritualization          
processes. On the other hand, this selectivity is probably better explained as a rational attempt to asses HIV          
infection risks, given the available information. Sharing in tight friendship groups is generally perceived as          
a lower risk than sharing with strangers, by both users(51) and researchers (19), and there is some evidence          
to support this idea.(9) But this protection is of course limited. It only gives protection as long as the virus          
has not been introduced in the group among which injection paraphernalia are shared. When introduced, it           
may, by the same token, spread very rapidly. That may well have been the case in the group of early          
seroconverters in Scotland, reported on by Robertson et al., who, "due to a failure of the supply of clean          
equipment, formed an intimate equipment sharing community".(52)         
 <P>         
Murphy suggested that in couples, needle sharing may substitute feelings of sexual intimacy and represent          
an intimate part of their relationship. Just as in the Howard and Borges study, some of her female subjects          
were dependent on their male partners to inject the drug for them.(53)  In such cases needle sharing is part          
of the couples shared use of drugs, whereby the male exercises authority over the female by controlling her          
access to drugs, works, and her veins. Needle sharing has frequently been related to initiation into injecting          
drug use.(20, 32)  First injection of an illicit drug is seldom a planned event and the novice does not carry a          
syringe around. If this event is subject to ritualization, it is not so much the sharing of injection equipment          
(on such occasions drugs are mostly also shared) which is the object of the ritual process, but the event          
itself. The event signifies the transition of non-user or, more specific, non-IDU, to the newly acquired          
status of IDU. In such cases needle sharing is merely part of this rite of passage.(54)  The most pronounced          
indications of ritualization processes around needle sharing were found among dyads.(32)  But, here again          
it is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a larger sharing pattern, which is the cement of a highly          
entrained relationship.(55)         
<P>         
<B>Primary vs. Secondary Ritual Value</B>          
<P>         
A factor that may limit ritualization of  needle sharing is the indirect relationship between the goal (the          
drug high) and the means (the needle). Drug use facilitates interaction and when drugs are shared they           
induce feelings of solidarity and produce a common mood. These are intrinsic features of ritual and a main          
reason for drug use.(55)  Use of drugs (irrespective of their legal status and resulting availability) is thus          
directly associated with positively valued altered states of consciousness. Chapters two and nine contended          
that the intensity of ritualization is subject to factors that influence availability. For example, draughts and          
the absence of reliable water distribution systems limit the availability of water and thereby have an impact          
on the ritualization of this necessity of life among certain tribal peoples. Likewise, prohibition and the          
uncertainties of the resulting underground or subcultural drug distribution system limit the availability of           
drugs, contributing to the level of ritualization of drug use. However, with or without these deterrents,          
drugs are, and throughout history have been, used for ritual purposes. Their use is inherent to human (and          
animal) nature.(56)  Therefore, it was argued in chapter nine that drugs have intrinsic or primary ritual          
value. In contrast, the ritual value of syringes and other drug paraphernalia is merely derived from their           
association with the drugs. Hence, needles and syringes can only obtain secondary ritual value. To make a          
bold comparison, in the Sahara people ritualize water, not the bucket (but they might if these should          
become scarce).           
<P>         
<B>Ritualization is a Dynamic Process </B>       
<P>         
It must be understood that ritual is not a static condition, but a dynamic process. The significance or          
coercive power of ritual--the power performers ascribe to, and feel forced upon themselves by the          
performance of ritual--can be seen to vary with the intensity of ritualization. This intensity may vary with           
several factors. Social factors define the situation in which the ritual interaction is performed. As Goffman          
explained, different faces, statuses and relationships delimit what is appropriate behavior in a situation.(57)          
Ritual is furthermore embedded in, and an expression of a wider set of cultural values, which also          
determine the pertinence of behavior. Personal factors (perceived availability, religion, etc.) may account          
for variations in perception, interpretation and evaluation of what is and is not (part of the) ritual or what          
the meaning (ranging from purely instrumental to highly symbolic) is of certain acts.(36) The symbolism          
of blood brothers, reported by some subjects in the Howard and Borges study, can therefore best be          
interpreted as personal expressions of symbolism of experimental drug users. As Cleckner writes, "The           
symbolic content of shared customs is not regarded as terribly significant. What is significant is the          
concrete results of effects of any action, not its reality status. The actual texture of street activity is dealing          
with reality as it is. Street customs are predominantly pragmatic and rational with little room for symbolic          
elaboration. A dope fiend can almost always give a practical explanation for anything he does."(58)  Most          
committed IDUs are thus too busy taking care of business for such conscious symbolic elaboration of their          
daily activities.(46)  On a conscious level, their activities are generally driven by pragmatic, especially          
economic considerations--related to the object that largely determines their daily life.           
<P>         
<B>Adaptation to the Changing Functionality of Needle Sharing</B>          
<P>         
Pragmatism is an essential feature of the lives of IDUs. Maintaining regular injecting drug use requires          
considerable coping skills and the flexibility to adapt to obstacles that (potentially) interfere with drug use           
management. From this functionalistic perspective needle sharing is simply a rational adaptation to the          
legal restrictions on injection equipment. Under these conditions, needle sharing has become the rule.          
Although sharing has always been associated with diseases as hepatitis, abscesses and endocarditis, these          
were only part of the many hazards IDUs had to cope with, and, not unjustly, many others were          
experienced as far more threatening. From the perspective of the IDU, the cost benefit analysis of needle          
sharing has thus always been in favor of this behavior. Until the advent of the HIV epidemic. HIV has          
tipped the balance towards the negative. IDUs are increasingly aware of the threats HIV poses on them and          
they are looking for ways to protect themselves, partners, family and friends. Being denied access to          
services which may support such changes in many countries, in particular in the USA, this is not an easy          
task. However, a large number of recent studies established that under the influence of the AIDS threat all          
over the world IDUs are adopting less risky injecting practices(59, 60), even in the American epicenters of           
AIDS.(61, 62)  New needles are in great demand(48) and when shared, used ones are often cleaned with          
bleach.(21) This underlines the instrumental imperative of needle sharing. In the AIDS era, the          
functionality of needle sharing is challenged by the information on the threats it poses on the user and          
her/is relationships--it has gradually become dysfunctional. But due to HIV's long incubation period, the           
consequences of needle sharing have been underplayed, obscured and denied for a long time. For many          
IDUs HIV was only an intangible remote threat, which could simply not compete with more immediate          
needs and threats. As Stern made painfully clear, "AIDS is just not the biggest problem on the block."(63)          
Reduction of personal risk behaviors can only be maintained if these are supported by cultural change, and           
this is a slow process, hampered by prohibition of drugs and injection paraphernalia.  As it is much harder          
to break the rule of sharing with close relationships than with  strangers and loose acquaintances(32, 64,          
65), one may expect that the process of change started with the latter and will end with intimates,          
presumably before the sharing of other body fluids is terminated.         
<P>         
<B>Who propagates the needle sharing ritual?</B>         
<P>         
Conducting the literature review it became apparent that several authors put ritual or symbolic aspects of          
needle sharing forward to support their doubts about the effectivity of needle exchange. In particular Smith          
went far beyond what is scientifically acceptable. Elsewhere he made an even more unrealistic claim. In his          
opinion, needle exchange programs would not have an effect on the spread of HIV through needle sharing,          
because such practices are simply part of the drug culture. He furthermore alleged that if ten addicts in a          
room had their own needles, they would all use the same one and simply pass it around.(66) Apparently,          
this quixotic depiction appeals to the public's imagination as some years later it was recorded in an          
interview with a top rank law enforcement officer in New York City:         
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
You are dealing with an addict who is at best very, very unreliable. He does not bathe, he does not wash, he          
wakes up every morning with the purpose of kicking the drug habit and at the same time he is going to get          
some drugs. ... By nature drug addicts, street people, they share things. They share their beds, their bottles,          
they share their women: they share their needles. ... Drug users lie, steal, cheat. That is the make-up of a          
drug addict. ... They have always shared needles, that is their nature, that is their make-up, they share          
things. What is the reason for it? I don't know, but that is their nature. ... We have seen cases where addicts          
were in a room and had needles, that were stolen from a hospital or a pharmacy, in its package, sterile, all          
on the floor and they were sitting around sharing one, probably contaminated, needle among each          
other.(67)         
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
These portrayals are false for at least two reasons. As was explained above, needles are solely instrumental          
in the act of getting high and sharp new ones fulfill this function of getting the drugs into ones system best.          
For what reason would an IDU--who is eager to get off--wait for nine others to finish using the same dull          
needle (which can take a while), while sharp new ones are available? With all respect, such simplistic          
analyses may be expected from an ill-informed and frightened lay audience, but not from professionals. As          
Fiddle pointed out, those working in the area of drug law enforcement ordinarily see drug users at their          
worst.(68)  Likewise, Smith is a clinician and his view may be biased by overexposure to poorly coping          
clinical populations, but as he also is involved in research, some reservations in his statements would be           
appropriate.         
<P>         
However, such narrow and ungrounded analyses are not limited to clinicians and law enforcement officials.          
On the contrary, the mythical needle sharing ritual is frequently used to block harm reduction approaches           
against the spread of HIV in this population. In particular, the American administration has consistently          
been using this bogus argument in opposing needle exchange programs and defending restrictive needle          
legislation. For example, Herbert Kleber, former deputy director for demand reduction of the Office of          
National Drug Control Policy (the pentagon of the war on drugs), recently published an editorial in           
which he reflected on the issue of needle exchange. Among several other ungrounded statements, and          
without any references, he claimed that "many addicts would continue to share even if clean needles were          
available; it has become part of the ritual of taking drugs that accompanies an illicit and socially          
condemned activity."(69) Likewise, Charles Schuster, former director of NIDA, affirmed that "[a]lmost all           
intravenous drug users sometimes share their works, for reasons that include convenience, friendship and          
ritual." He wrote this in the foreword of the recent NIDA Research Monograph on needle sharing, which          
determined that the reality of needle sharing situations is far more intricate than suggested.(70)         
<P>         
<B>Conclusions</B>        
<P>         
The literature review raised no conclusive empirical evidence to support the notion that needle sharing          
among IDUs is a stable ritual, independent of other factors. The two empirical studies that suggest          
symbolic functions of this behavior were conducted before awareness of the HIV-epidemic came about and          
therefore generalization from pre-AIDS to current populations of IDUs may be invalid. The other articles          
add little relevant information, and some of these even spread misinformation about the discussed          
phenomenon. Perhaps the only definite evidence of ritual the review brought up, reflects on the scientific          
culture itself, as a questionable example of ritual referencing was established.          
<P>         
By comparing the conditions of drug and needle use with the relevant definitions of ritual event and ritual          
objects it was demonstrated that the attachment of symbolic elaboration to the use of such objects is          
principally subject to their perceived availability. This explained the ritualization of drug use found in this          
Dutch research and in American studies. In both countries, decreased drug availability has created a          
situation in which the attachment of symbolic meaning to primarily instrumental acts became possible. The           
different levels of ritualization and monetarization around drug use activities between the two countries can          
be attributed to gradual differences in drug availability due to different enforcement policies. The same          
factors explained the absence of a pattern of ritualized needle sharing in the Netherlands and the assumed          
presence of needle sharing rituals in the USA, prior to AIDS awareness. While the easy availability in the          
Netherlands prevented this process, the restrictions on sale and possession in the USA made the addition of          
symbolism to the primarily instrumental act of sharing needles possible. As Carballo and Rezza write in          
their discussion of factors that may restrain the perceived availability of needles and syringes:         
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
Placed in th[e] broader social framework in which drug injecting has been stigmatized, actively prosecuted          
and associated with a range of other social problems, the sharing of needles and syringes may have gone on          
to represent, for some individuals, a symbol of group cohesiveness and solidarity and may have enhanced           
the process as well as the experience of drug injecting.(71)         
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
However, even in the USA there is no substantial evidence in support of ritual needle sharing practices,          
despite these favorable conditions. The assumption that IDUs will not change or reduce their needle          
sharing practices in response to an increased availability, because it is a ritualized behavior pattern cannot          
be supported by scientific data.         
<P>         
This myth is further falsified by a growing number of scientific publications that show significant           
behavior modification towards safer injecting practices, in particular in places where needles and syringes          
are sufficiently available. These studies show furthermore that needle sharing is essentially adaptive          
behavior, induced by unavailability and unfavorable socio-economic conditions. The same conclusions are          
reached on the basis of the current analysis of determinants of ritualization. That is, through input of  AIDS          
information and experience, the instrumental imperative of needle sharing is becoming increasingly          
overruled by the potential negative consequences for the individual, his network and the subculture as a          
whole. Knowledge of the current risks of needle sharing is, nevertheless, not a guarantee for (the          
maintenance of) safe injection behavior. Sufficient availability of syringes and needles does prevent the           
development of stereotypical needle sharing patterns. Moreover, it limits the number of situations in which          
needle sharing may, besides abstaining from or postponing a drug injection, become the only choice. But,          
just as the availability of condoms will not entirely stop unprotected sex, it cannot reasonably be expected          
that easy access to needles will eliminate all unsafe injecting. After all, injecting drug use remains a highly          
criminalized, but (for the performers) imperative activity.           
<P>         
The idea of ritualized needle sharing and other stereotypical portrayals of drug users are actively          
propagated by the highest rank executives in the hierarchy of the War on Drugs. Presented as scientific          
facts, they essentially are deceptive political soundbites--the argot of the war on drugs rhetoric. These          
political opportunistic myths fuel addictophobia and obstruct a rational assessment of the drug problem,          
blocking alternative (and more efficient) approaches to stop the spread of AIDS among injecting drug users          
and their relationships. Ultimately, they obstruct peace in the civil war on drug users.

(i)	This percentage is equated from those given for lifetime prevalence of self-injecting at the bottom          
of page 226 (men 68%, women 29%). An attempt was made to calculate these percentages back to           
discrete individuals, using the whole sample (N=50) and the subsample (N=36).  Using both sample sizes,         
only fractions were found. The fractions for males and females were then totaled and divided by the sample         
size. Based on which sample size was used, 52% or 53% of the study sample had never self-injected.         
(However, when the original percentages were recalculated using the nearest whole number  below and         
above the found value and compared with the in the paper presented percentages, a discrepancy of two to         
five percent was found.)

<P> 
Last month the University of Michigan and the federal government 
released the results of its annual survey of high school drug 
use. To the surprise of no one, more seniors say they've smoked 
marijuana during the last year -- 30.7 percent in 1994, compared 
with 26 percent in 1993. There has also been an increase in the 
number of students who've tried LSD and other hallucinogens. Overall, 
45.6 percent of seniors say they've tried illegal drugs. 
<P> 
What these young outlaws should keep in mind, however, is that 
the war on drugs, though less visible of late and less effective 
than ever, continues to claim plenty of causalities. Almost 30 
percent of the 1 million inmates in federal and state prisons 
in the United States (two-thirds of the 93,708 in federal prisons) 
are serving time for drug-law violations. In some states mandatory 
sentencing means a lengthy prison term for simple possession. 
There are many powerful reactionaries like Texas Sen. Phil Gramm 
who continue to think the answer to our nation's drug problem 
lies in doubling a prison population that has tripled in the last 
15 years. 
<P> 
Remarkably, there are a few reasons to be hopeful in 1995. Republican 
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has declared himself to be 
in favor of shifting funds for law enforcement to drug treatment 
and prevention. The new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, 
Henry Hyde, about as conservative as they come, says mandatory 
minimum sentences and drug-related asset forfeitures have gone 
too far, and the latter may be unconstitutional. And around the 
country, an eclectic assortment of mayors, from Baltimore's Kurt 
Schmoke, a Democrat, to Los Angeles' Republican mayor Richard 
Riordan, are looking for alternatives to the filed policies of 
the past. 
<P> 
They are looking to Europe and to some extent Australia, where 
governments are also struggling with tough drug problems. But 
many of these countries have come to rely on common-sense policies 
and the spirit of experimentation that's absent in the U.S. The 
approach used abroad, generally described as harm reduction, is 
based on the simple notion that a drug-fee society is impossible. 
Harm reduction means leaving casual drug users alone and treating 
addicts like they're still human beings. It means providing a 
variety of treatment options -- without requiring prison time 
to benefit from one -- and for those not ready for treatment, 
it seeks to find a way to minimize harm to themselves and to society. 
<P> 
Almost 20 years ago the Dutch government adopted a policy of separating 
soft-drug and hard-drug markets. Criminal penalties and police 
efforts against heroin traffickers were increased, while those 
against cannabis consumers were relaxed. Marijuana and hashish 
can be bought in hundreds of &quot;coffee shops&quot; throughout 
the country. No advertising or open displays are allowed and sales 
to minors are prohibited. Coffee shops caught selling hard drugs 
are quickly closed down. 
<P> 
What has been the result? Cannabis consumption among Dutch teenagers 
has increased -- but no levels slightly below those in the U.S. 
Dutch parents care at least as much about their kids as American 
parents do, but almost no one sees marijuana as a huge problem. 
As Eddy Engelsman, the former Dutch drug czar, explained, &quot;We 
succeeded in making pot boring.&quot; 
<P> 
The biggest problems with the pot policy in the Nether lands have 
been due complaints of its neighbors. In October 1994, members 
of the French Communist Party demonstrated in The Hague to protest 
Dutch cannabis policy -- although two of the protesters were later 
found having a smoke in a nearby coffee shop. German-Dutch relations 
have also become strained over this issue. Some Germans don't 
like a legal cannabis source so close, and Dutch citizens living 
in border cities like Arnhem are tired of unruly German youth 
flocking over the border to party. The mayor of Arnhem suggested 
setting up a coffee shop outside town right next to the border 
so Germans could buy their product without disturbing the good 
people of Arnhem. 
<P> 
In May 1994 the German Supreme Court removed criminal penalties 
for possession of small amounts of cannabis. Local officials have 
reacted in different ways: In Frankfurt and Hamburg, cannabis 
smokers are left alone, and in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, 
it's legal to possess up to an ounce of marijuana or hash. But 
in Bavaria, that much weed can lead to a prison term. 
<P> 
More important in many respects have been changes in policies 
regarding hard drugs. In the 1970s most countries in Europe were 
slow to follow in the States' footsteps in providing the synthetic 
drug methadone to heroin addicts trying to quit their habits. 
(Methadone is to heroin what nicotine chewing gum is to cigarettes: 
It doesn't produce the rush of the real thing, but it keeps the 
user from feeling sick or getting agitated -- with almost no bad 
side effects.) There have been hundreds of studies on the effectiveness 
of methadone since its introduction in 1965, and all but a few 
show that it reduces disease and death, cuts addict involvement 
in crime, stems the spread of AIDS and helps addicts get their 
lives together. 
<P> 
While the number of methadone programs grew quickly in the United 
States during the 1970s -- to more than 100,000 treatment slots 
-- they've stayed at that level, hamstrung by state and federal 
regulations. Strict rules about dose levels, pickup times and 
other medical matters are set by bureaucrats, so few good doctors 
want to work in such programs, and many addicts seeking treatment 
don't see the benefit of exchanging the hassles of the street 
for the hassles of the clinic. 
<P> 
The Europeans -- and the Australians as well -- are taking a different 
tack. If addicts want methadone, it's available in clinics as 
well as from general practitioners that provide medical assistance 
and counseling. In many European cities, more than a quarter of 
all GPs count methadone users among their clients. People pick 
up the drug from pharmacies just like anyone else picking up their 
medicine. Amsterdam, Netherlands, Frankfurt and Barcelona, Spain, 
among other cities, send out methadone buses -- mobile clinics. 
<P> 
In late November 1994 researchers at Beth Israel Medical Center, 
in New York, released the results of a two-year study: They found 
that drug users in needle-exchange programs showed a new HIV infection 
rate of 2 percent per year, as compared with 4 to 8 percent among 
those who don't frequent the programs. &quot;This proves,&quot; 
said study co-author (and the world's leading expert on needle 
exchange) Dr. Don Des Jarlais, &quot;that critics who claim that 
the availability of clean needles can only exacerbate the drug 
problem are clearly wrong.&quot; Yet Congress continues to refuse 
to fund needle exchange, drug czar Lee Brown won't take a position, 
cities and states keep talking about trial programs, and the few 
dozen programs that do exist are harassed by cops and budget cutters. 
<P> 
In Europe public-health officials and political leaders didn't 
wait for all the evidence to come in on needle exchange. The Dutch 
didn't even wait for AIDS. They started needle exchange in the 
early 198s in response to an outbreak of hepatitis B among addicts 
in Amsterdam. In Britain it took an HIV epidemic among junkies 
in Edinburgh, Scotland, to get needle exchange going -- but the 
government responded rapidly by setting up hundreds of exchanges 
around the country. Now one finds needle-exchange vending machines 
in about two dozen European cities. And in Amsterdam it's possible 
for an addict to exchange a dirty needle for a clean one at the 
local police station -- with no questions asked. 
<P> 
Like other European nations, Switzerland confronted a growing 
heroin problem during the late 1980s. Efforts in Zurich to concentrate 
the open heroin scene in one place -- what became known as Needle 
Park -- Briefly attracted international attention until the park 
was shut down in February 1992. Today, the junkies gather on the 
site of an abandoned railway station no more than half a mile 
from Needle park, and the Swiss can't agree on what to do about 
it. 
<P> 
No one in Switzerland likes the open drug scene. It's unsightly, 
embarrassing and a constant reminder of the nation's inability 
to solve its drug-abuse problem. Zurich officials plan to shut 
the site down again -- in February -- but there is little confidence 
this will fix the problem. There's support for building new prisons 
but not much reason to believe that more jails will make a difference. 
Other cities sweep their hard-core drug problems under the rug 
by pushing their drug scenes into ghettos where good citizens 
and foreign tourists dare not venture. Zurich, however, like other 
Swiss cities, has a problem: There are not ghettos and no stretches 
of abandoned buildings like those that host most of America's 
drug addicts. &quot;every square meter is settled, developed, 
controlled,&quot; Dr. Andre Seidenberg, a leading addiction doctor, 
points out. &quot;In a way, Zurich is a big village.&quot; 
<P> 
What the Swiss decided to do is experiment. Methadone and needle 
exchange were easy. The first Swiss innovation was to set up legal 
<EM>fixerraume</EM> (&quot;injection rooms&quot;) so that junkies 
could inject their drugs in relatively safe and hygienic environments. 
Few Swiss were keen on making life easier for junkies, but even 
fewer wanted to deal with the sight of junkies shooting up in 
public parks and alleyways. The first <EM>fixerraume</EM> ran 
into the expected problems from neighbors, but they've now been 
accepted in the main cities --Bern, Basel and Zurich -- and one 
small city, Schaffhausen, recently voted to set up its own. 
<P> 
Initial studies show that <EM>fixerraume</EM> have proven effective 
in reducing drug overdoses and the spread of AIDS. Now the Germans 
have followed suit, with Frankfurt opening a <EM>fixerraum</EM> 
in December -- although they call it a <EM>Gesundheitsraum</EM> 
(&quot;health room&quot;). &quot;If you sit in a garden or behind 
a truck, you have neither light nor clean water, and you can't 
find your veins because they contract in the cold,&quot; says 
Horst Burghardt, who supervises the Frankfurt <EM>Gesundheitsraum</EM>. 
&quot;That's when overdoses happen.&quot; 
<P> 
The big news, however, is Switzerland's national experiment with 
prescribing heroin to addicts. The rationale for the experiment 
was simple. Needle exchange helped reduce e the spread of AIDS, 
but the heroin that was injected with legal needles, sometimes 
in legal injection rooms, was illegally purchased, often financed 
by criminal activity, and typically it was impure and of unknown 
potency. Could a program of prescribing heroin legally to junkies 
reduce both addicts' criminal activity and their risk of contracting 
and spreading AIDS and other diseases? The Swiss sought advice 
from the few British doctors experienced in prescribing heroin 
to addicts and then set out to create the largest, most scientific 
study of heroin maintenance ever attempted. 
<P> 
The first Swiss heroin-prescription program started in January 
1994. There are now two in Zurich, one of which is specifically 
designed for women. Others, with up to 50 addicts in each, are 
in Bern; the little town of Thun; and the one most recently set 
up is in Basel. Some programs started off by giving some addicts 
heroin and others morphine or injectable methadone. Researchers 
soon found, however, that almost everyone opted for the &quot;sugar&quot; 
(as junkies refer to heroin), which is provided up to three times 
a day -- for a daily fee of 10 Swiss francs (about $7.50). Two 
programs allow clients to take a few heroin reefers -- known as 
sugarettes -- home each night, and one program briefly experimented 
with giving clients cocaine reefers -- since most of the addicts 
also use cocaine. 
<P> 
In late September, Swiss officials released their preliminary 
report: Heroin maintenance seems to work (although the evidence 
on cocaine maintenance was too scanty to draw any conclusions). 
When addicts can control their dose and take it in a safe, clean 
place, the drug causes few health problems. The programs have 
not resulted in a black market of diverted heroin, and the health 
of addicts in the program has clearly improved. But the officials 
also noted that heroin maintenance cannot solve the problems that 
led to heroin addiction in the first place. Based on these findings, 
the Swiss federal government decided in October to expand the 
experiment to include up to 1,000 addicts in 1995. Now it appears 
that the Dutch will also initiate heroin-maintenance experiments 
this year. And in Germany city officials in Frankfurt, Hamburg 
and elsewhere want to do likewise but are blocked by the federal 
government. 
<P> 
Not every country in Europe supports harm reduction. Sweden has 
its own version of Singapore's drug laws; Belgium and France tilt 
in the direction of U.S. policies and rhetoric. Even in Zurich 
some police officials such as Peter Wepfer, head of the drug squad, 
complain that &quot;it's too easy for the junkies here. They can 
get everything too easily.&quot; But Wepfer's solution is to legalize 
drugs completely. That would solve most of the problems, her observes, 
but only if everyone -- not just the Swiss -- did it. 
<P> 
During the last decade, the U.S. Congress convened hundreds of 
hearings on almost every aspect of the drug problem -- but not 
a single one focused on the harm-reduction approaches used abroad. 
The Swiss set up their heroin-prescription programs because they 
wanted answers to questions that many Americans also ask -- but 
have never been able to answer. There's not a single valid, legal, 
scientific, financial or ethical reason why heroin-maintenance 
programs or fixer rooms can't be tried the U.S. -- only bad political 
reasons. 
<P> 
So far these reasons have prevented all but the arrest-and-imprisonment 
approach to the nation's drug problem. This is a tragedy. The 
failure to set up needle-exchange programs in the United States 
during the mid-1980s is probably responsible for the deaths of 
tens of thousands of men, women and children. Even today, public 
officials bicker over the &quot;moral messages&quot; of such programs 
and talk of pilot projects. Hundreds of thousands of young lives 
have been ruined by imprisonment for what are essentially victimless 
crimes. 
<P> 
Former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders dared to call for the study 
of alternative drug policies, and she ultimately paid the price. 
Politicians now have a choice to make: escalate the drug war tactics 
of the past decade despite overwhelming evidence that they've 
failed or open their eyes and see what can be done.

Sane National Drug Policy."

<hr> 
<P> 
The war on drugs is over. After eight decades of interdiction, 
prohibition and punishment, the results are in: There are now 
more than 330,000 Americans behind bars for violating the drug 
laws. We are spending over $20 billion per year on criminal-justice 
approaches, but illegal drugs are available in greater supply 
and purity than ever before. Cynical phrases such as <EM>zero 
tolerance</EM> and <EM>drug-free society</EM> substitute for thoughtful 
policies and realistic objectives. It's time for a change. 
<P> 
We have ignored the clear lessons of history. Prohibition, the 
18th Amendment to the Constitution, financed the rise of organized 
crime and failed miserably as social policy. Likewise, the war 
on drugs has created new, well-financed and violent criminal conspiracies 
and failed to achieve any of its goals. 
<P> 
It's time for Americans to look seriously at other options. No 
one has found <EM>the answer</EM> to the drug problem, but there 
are alternatives to spending tens of billions each year on a policy 
that is better at filling prisons and spreading AIDS than curing 
addictions. When Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders spoke out in 
December 1993 in favor of studying alternatives, it came as no 
surprise that drug-policy reactionaries screamed. But more interesting 
were the voices of support from around the country. Mayor Sharon 
Pratt Kelly of Washington and Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco 
have joined former secretary of state Gorge Shultz, Mayor Kurt 
Schmoke of Baltimore and a number of prominent Americans from 
across the political spectrum in speaking out for an alternative. 
<P> 
Despite the fact that there is no evidence that pot has ever caused 
a single death and that there is clear evidence that cannabis 
is actually useful in treating certain medical conditions, the 
federal government continues to spend millions of dollars each 
year to eradicate plants and harass users. In 1992, according 
to the FBI, 535,000 people were arrested for possession, sale 
or manufacture of marijuana. In six cases, life sentences were 
imposed. 
<P> 
This is the drug war at its most absurd. Paramilitary raids composed 
of state police, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operatives 
and National Guardsmen fly over public and private lands, their 
helicopters skimming the tops of private homes. Citizens are detained 
at gunpoint, and houses and property worth hundreds of thousands 
of dollars are forfeited to local police department for no other 
reason than the existence of small numbers of marijuana plants. 
<P> 
The DEA's global presence stands at an all-time high. U.S. military 
units and border-patrol forces scramble around Bolivia and Peru, 
destroying easily replaced makeshift laboratories. The U.S. Navy, 
Air Force, Coast Guard and Customs Service patrol the seas in 
search of illicit shipments. U.S. diplomats lean on European governments 
to throw their money into the kitty for perennial crop-substitution 
programs. 
<P> 
To what effect? Certainly not any reduction in the flow of drugs 
into the United States. Law enforcement authorities readily admit 
that cocaine imports appear to be as high as ever. Heroin exports 
to the United States, meanwhile, are rising to unprecedented levels 
as Asian gangsters and Afghan terrorists consolidate their networks 
and the ever resourceful Colombians enter the business. 
<P> 
In late 1991, the General Accounting Office reported that the 
Pentagon's interdiction efforts, which cost U.S. taxpayers close 
to $1 billion during the previous two years, had had no impact 
on the flow of drugs. For at least a generation, law-enforcement 
officials have recited the claim that they seize &quot;only 10 
percent&quot; of drug shipments into the United States. The fact 
is, despite this dismal rate, they haven't the slightest idea 
what percentage they're seizing. 
<P> 
The drug war has been most efficient at filling up the country's 
prison sand jails: In all, there are 440,000 prisoners in local 
jails, 840,000 in state prisons and another 87,000 in federal 
prisons. (Add to that 2.7 million people on probation and more 
than 500,000 on parole.) This represents by far the highest proportion 
of the American population incarcerated in our history, as well 
as the highest proportion incarcerated of any country in the world. 
<P> 
Much of the increase in prison population can be explained entirely 
in terms of the war on drugs. More than 60 percent of federal 
prison inmates are incarcerated for violations of federal drug 
laws. One in five are first-time petty offenders, in many cases 
naive young people who ran into sophisticated entrapment procedures. 
According to a Justice Department study ordered by Janet Reno, 
16,316 federal prisoners who have no previous incarcerations, 
crimes or high-level drug activity on their records are serving 
an average of six year sentences for drugs. Two out of three are 
in prison because of mandatory sentencing laws. More than half 
of new incarcerations in New Jersey state prisons in 1990 were 
for drug-law violations, 46.7 percent in New York, 32 percent 
in Pennsylvania, and 53 percent in Washington, D.C. Although no 
one has actually added up the numbers, it is safe to estimate 
that one-third of a million people are now behind bars for violating 
drug laws and two to three times that many are on probation or 
parole for the same reason. 
<P> 
These grim statistics don't reveal the entire cost of the government's 
war against its own citizens. A complete total would have to included 
the drug dealers incarcerated for crimes of violence as well as 
the one-third of robbers and burglars who reported in a survey 
sponsored by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics 
that they has committed their crimes to obtain money for drugs. 
<P> 
The drug war takes most of its collateral casualties from the 
inner cities. here, drugs are a fact of life, even if many customers 
live far away in protected communities. Though illegal-drug use 
has fallen in some inner cities, there are still intolerable levels 
of violence associated with competitive drug dealing. 
<P> 
If our prohibition policies really made a difference in terms 
of reducing illicit-drug use in the country, there might be some 
grounds for the claim that this tremendous expenditure of dollars 
and lives is worth it. But all the evidence suggest that the simple 
deterrence model of tough enforcement and incarceration has not 
had the desired impact on drug availability in the inner city 
or the small town. The ambitious street sweeps of drug dealers 
and ever more pervasive undercover operations have simply made 
it that much easier for urban young people to step into the shoes 
of those whose jobs they cover. 
<P> 
The costs incurred by America's orgy of incarceration are impressive. 
But they pale, at least in human terms, next to the costs exacted 
by the spread of AIDS by and among illicit-drug users, their sexual 
partners and their babies. Most U.S. states, as well as the vast 
majority of foreign countries, allow people to buy syringes over 
the counter. Nine states, however, don't. Those nine are nearly 
the same as those with the worst illicit-drug use problems and 
the highest number of drug-related AIDS cases. 
<P> 
Both common sense and a host of scientific studies suggest that 
making syringes available over the counter, creating needle-exchange 
programs and sponsoring outreach programs to maintain contact 
with hard-core drug users are cheap and relatively effective ways 
of reducing the spread of AIDS among drug users. National an state 
commissions on AIDS, as well as international health organizations, 
routinely advocate these programs. Virtually all European countries, 
including some that punish drug dealing as severely as rape and 
murder, have instituted such measures. But in the United States, 
cowardly politicians who know better have combined with inner-city 
leaders obsessed with the rhetoric and images of genocidal plots 
to oppose such programs. 
<P> 
What it all adds up to is a contemporary variant of the Crusades 
-- a war to purge America of illicit drugs and any one who makes, 
sells or uses them. Forger compromise. Forget tolerance. And for 
that matter, forget any attempt at cost-benefit analysis. Forget 
as well the fact that virtually all societies in the history of 
human civilization have used psychoactive substances -- whether 
it's marijuana or wine. 
<P> 
It's time for a new drug policy. The choices are far more complex 
than prohibition vs. legalization. What we need to do now is start 
learning what works in other countries and start relying a little 
more on common sense and decency. We need to stop demonizing illicit-drug 
users and remind ourselves that they are citizens and human beings. 
We need to stop filling our prisons with petty dealers and unlucky 
users and focus our criminal justice resources on those who commit 
violent and predatory crimes. And we need to stop believing that 
abstinence is the sole solution to drug use. 
<P> 
The easy way to begin is with small steps - ones that reduce the 
harmful effects of drug use and drug policies without completely 
eliminating our current system of prohibition. 
<P> 
First, we should immediately decriminalize the sale and possession 
of small amounts of marijuana and make it easily available by 
prescription to those suffering from cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis 
and other diseases. Eleven states decriminalized marijuana during 
the 1970s, with no noticeable effects on consumption rates. California 
has saved more than $1 billion in criminal-justice costs by decriminalizing 
pot. 
<P> 
No drug, including marijuana, is completely safe -- but as the 
DEA's own administrative law judge Francis Young declared in 1988, 
marijuana is possibly &quot;one of the safest therapeutically 
active substances known to man.&quot; Though 36 states have called 
for the legalization of marijuana for medical treatment, the federal 
government refuses to remove pot from a Schedule 1 listing as 
a dangerous narcotic. 
<P> 
What about hard drugs like heroin? The first steps of a harm-reduction-based 
policy are easy and virtually risk-free. Hundreds of studies and 
25 years of experience have proved that getting heroin addicts 
to switch to methadone can reduce heroin consumption, crime and 
AIDS and help former users to get and keep their lives together. 
But methadone is now the most rightly regulated drug in the pharmacopeia, 
according to Ernest Drucker, professor of epidemiology and social 
medicine at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College 
of Medicine, in the Bronx, N.Y. It continues to get a bad rap 
from powerful politicians and drug treatment bigwigs who insist 
that abstinence is the only cure.. They're wrong, just like those 
who insist that the only way to deal with teen-age pregnancy is 
by telling kids to remain &quot;sex-free.&quot; 
<P> 
What we need is a wide range of methadone programs and outlets: 
from full-service programs that help recovering drug users get 
their lives together and find jobs to &quot;low threshold&quot; 
programs that reach out to the most down-and out addicts on the 
streets. We should allow private physicians and public-health 
clinics to write prescriptions for methadone and allow their clients 
to pick the drug up at a local pharmacy. Methadone could be dispensed 
from mobile vans -- as Baltimore and Boston have begun to do. 
And most important, we should not kick people out of methadone 
programs if they relapse and continue taking illegal drugs. All 
the evidence shows that they, and we, are better off if they maintain 
some link with health services. Simply stated, we should treat 
drug addicts who want methadone like we treat diabetics who need 
insulin and depressed Americans who want Prozac. 
<P> 
Virtually every public-health commission and organization -- from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National 
Academy of Sciences to the World Health Organization -- has suggested 
that needle exchanges can play an important role in reducing the 
transmission of HIV by and among drug injectors. In some European 
cities, addicts can exchange dirty needles in local pharmacies, 
health clinics, vending machines and even police stations. We 
should do the same. The policy is risk-free. 
<P> 
What about cocaine? It's helpful to remember that the crack epidemic, 
a devastating plague, but one that is passing, was not prevented 
by strict prohibition. Indeed, the drug laws may well have created 
crack, just as Prohibition produced 190-proof bathtub gin. And 
just as the repeal of Prohibition didn't legalize moonshine, so 
the repeal of drug laws doesn't have to mean legalizing crack. 
The world is full of drugs that are less dangerous and more attractive 
than crack. We can begin by testing low-potency cocaine products 
-- coca-based chewing gum or lozenges, for example, or products 
like Mariani's wine and the Coca-Cola of the late 19th century 
-- which by all accounts were as safe as beer and probably not 
much worse than coffee. If some people want to distill those products 
down to something more potent, let them. But most people won't 
want to buy it, just as few Americans wanted to keep buying 190-proof 
alcohol once beer, wine and liquor became legally available. 
<P> 
There's much more we can do to reduce the negative consequences 
of both drug use and our drug policies without junking the whole 
prohibition system. But we can't do it successfully unless we 
put our punitive predisposition and abstentions goals on the back 
burner. Drug-treatment programs should be user-friendly, as other 
medical services are supposed to be, rather than like adolescent 
hazing rituals. A good harm-reduction program teaches sex workers 
how to get uncooperative clients to use condoms and saves the 
moralizing for later. It teaches illegal drug injectors how to 
inject safely, so that they don't end up in emergency rooms or 
dead, and then lets them know there's a drug-treatment slot available 
when they're ready. 
<P> 
From all accounts, policies like these work. Free needles, readily 
available methadone and other harm-reduction programs hold no 
attractions for kids trying to decide whether to use drugs or 
not. And these policies are more effective in undermining illegal 
drug markets, cutting crime and improving public health than anything 
yet devised in the United States. 
<P> 
Repeal immediately all mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws for drug-law 
offenders. It's hard to find a respected jurist, from Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist on down, who supports either current mandatory 
minimum requirements or the Draconian penalties he or she is required 
to impose on petty drug offenders. &quot;Three strikes, you're 
out&quot; is catchy sloganeering, and it may even make sense for 
murderers and hired assassins, but it's a ludicrous approach for 
drug offenders. 
<P> 
Virtually everything we're suggesting here is already happening 
in many European cities. None of it's revolutionary. In fact, 
quite the opposite, virtually everything we're suggesting can 
be described as evolutionary, relatively risk-free and less expensive 
than our current policies. All the available evidence indicates 
that a switch from a war-on-drugs approach to a harm-reduction 
strategy will save lives, reduce disease, cut crime and contribute 
to safer, healthier, more livable cities. 
<P> 
When all is said and cone, however, the best drug policies are 
those that rely not on prohibition but on regulatory approaches 
wisely conceived and implemented. We harbor no illusions regarding 
the political prospects of repeal in the short term. But once 
Americans realize that most of our drug problems are a result 
of current policies, drug prohibition will crumble just as alcohol 
prohibition did 61 years ago. 
<P> 
One often forgotten lesson of Prohibition is that it was followed 
not by a uniform national policy but by &quot;local option.&quot; 
When, in 1933, the 21st Amendment to the Constitution repealed 
Prohibition, the states went their own ways: Some opted for state 
monopolies, others for licensing schemes, and some chose to remain 
dry. Some legalized all alcoholic beverages, others just beer 
and wine. Some imposed high taxes, others low taxes. 
<P> 
We need local solutions to local problems. What the federal government 
needs to do is repeal many of the laws an regulations that stifle 
local initiatives and block any movement away from the war on 
drugs. Let towns, cities, counties and states experiment with 
new approaches. It's the only way to find out what really works. 
<P> 
Any good nonprohibitionist drug policy has to contain three central 
ingredients. First, possession of small amounts of any drug for 
personal use has to be legal. Second, there have to be legal means 
by which adults can obtain drugs of certified quality, purity 
and quantity. These can vary from state to state and town to town, 
with the Food and Drug Administration playing a supervisory role 
in controlling quality, providing information and assuring truth 
in advertising. And third, citizens have to be empowered in their 
decisions about drugs. Doctors have a role in all this, but let's 
not give them all the power. 
<P> 
A drug policy with these ingredients would decimate the black 
marker for drugs and take out of the hands of drug lords the $50 
billion to $60 billion in profits they earn each year. The nation 
would gain billions of dollars in law-enforcement savings and 
tax revenues, which could then be used to treat America's most 
serious problems the miserable life prospects of millions of poor, 
under-educated Americans growing up in decaying, crime-ridden 
inner cities. 
<P> 
The only respectable argument against such a policy is that it 
would result in a substantial increase in drug use. We don't see 
why. All the evidence, as well as common sense, indicates that 
the vast majority of Americans don't need drug-prohibition laws 
to keep from becoming junkies. Some African American leaders, 
like Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, cry genocide, but they forget 
that drug prohibition has already proved a failure and a disaster 
in urban ghettos. Other Americans ask, &quot;What about our children?&quot; 
but they forget that virtually any kid -- in any city, town or 
suburb -- who wants to try drugs can find them easily enough right 
now. And still others say, &quot;What about the message it would 
send?&quot;&quot; but forget that our current response -- inane 
anti-drug efforts like &quot;Just Say No&quot; and &quot;This 
Is Your Brain on Drugs,&quot; along with out incredibly cruel 
laws, send far worse messages: that kids are stupid, that drug 
users are less than human and that people who do no harm to others 
deserve to lose their freedom. 
<P> 
As society cannot long afford to have its laws widely and openly 
broken. The urge to sue some form of mind-altering substance is 
deeply ingrained in human nature. Attempting to legislate it out 
of existence can only lead us to grant government the kind of 
power it should not have in a fee society. The drug laws in this 
country are outdated. The arguments against decriminalization 
are tired and invalid. Our fear that it would result in a massive 
wave of new addicts is unfounded. The institution of common-sense 
harm-reduction proposals would eliminate much of the inner-city 
violence associated with competitive drug dealing and allow billions 
of dollars to be rechanneled for economic assistance for job training, 
day care and better schools. 
<P> 
In the inner cities, where the frontline battles of the drug war 
are waged daily, the situation is desperate. The disintegration 
of the family structure, the dire job outlook, inadequate education 
and government abandonment have created communities where the 
drug trade is guaranteed to flourish. Drug prohibition has created 
a permanent underclass of unemployable inner-city youths whose 
lives have become hopelessly interwoven with drug crime and who 
in turn are becoming parents to another generation of dysfunctional 
children. Can we let this damage continue? Isn't it time to stop 
moralizing about drugs and put an end to policies that are destroying 
the nation? <p>

<p> 
FOUR YEARS AFTER THE NOTION of drug legalization reemerged 
into public view, the time has come to step back and evaluate 
what it is all about and where it should be headed.(l)I 
cannot help but write as one who has become closely 
identified with the notion, but I also write as one who has 
tried to step back from the debate over drug legalization and 
analyze critically its contributions, missteps, and potential 
to beneficially redirect drug control policies. My principal 
interest lies not in the debate itself but in the future of 
psychoactive drug use and drug control policies in the United 
States and abroad. This article is thus not a response to the 
many critics of drug legalization, nor even a dispute with 
those who have favored the notion with somewhat different 
arguments and suppositions. It generally refrains from 
repeating the well documented costs of drug prohibition or 
the reasons why we need to consider alternative 
approaches.(2)And it pays scant attention to the political 
context of the debate or the political future of drug control 
policy. Its objective, rather, is to create and advance a 
more informed and sophisticated public discourse about 
alternatives to drug prohibition--one that breaks free from 
the intellectual and moralistic confines of contemporary 
prohibitionist norms.(3) 
<p>My specific objectives are 
fourfold. The first is to identify and examine the essential 
differences that separate those in the reasonable middle 
ground of the debate. The second is to offer new ways of 
thinking about radical alternatives to current drug 
prohibition policies, to identify the sorts of questions that 
must be asked, and to suggest how they might be addressed. 
The third is to provide evidence in support of the 
proposition that even a radical decriminalization of drug 
prohibition will not result in the sorts of dramatic 
increases in substance abuse that self-identified critics of 
drug legalization fear. And the fourth is to propose a drug 
regulatory model that eliminates many of the worst 
consequences of drug prohibition without reproducing the 
unfortunate consequences of our alcohol and tobacco control 
policies. 
<p>Many of the ideas and arguments presented in this paper 
were proposed and developed in meetings of the Princeton 
Working Group on the Future of Drug Use and Alternatives to 
Drug Prohibition. This group, composed of eighteen scholars 
representing more than a dozen disciplines, is currently 
pursuing each of these four objectives. This article should 
thus be read as a synopsis of a collaborative work-in- 
progress, the final version of which will be completed in 
late 1993. I anticipate that many of the ideas advanced below 
will be revised and refined as the working group proceeds.<br> 
<p> 
 
<b>THE "LEGALIZATION" LABEL</b><p> 
 
To legalize or not to legalize? That, as two pairs of drug 
policy skeptics have recently written, is not really the 
right question.(4) The appropriate question is much broader, 
and it is one that incorporates the "legalize or not" 
question with respect to particular psychoactive drug 
products: What, simply stated, are the best means to regulate 
the production, distribution, and consumption of the great 
variety of psychoactive substances available today and in the 
foreseeable fu-true?For a variety of reasons, the efforts of 
myself and others to answer that highly complex question have 
been captured by the label of "legalization."The term 
itself proved immensely successful in drawing the attention 
of tens of millions in the United States and elsewhere to 
what was at once a radical sounding but quite sensible 
critique of American drug control policies. But it exacted a 
stiff price with its implication that the only alternative to 
current policies was something resembling current US policies 
with respect to alcohol and tobacco. Few of those publicly 
associated with legalization in fact advocated such an 
alternative, but the misimpression has stuck in the public 
mind. 
<p>Legalization has always meant different things to 
different people. From my perspective, it has been first and 
foremost a critique of American drug prohibitionist policies 
which stresses the extent to which most of what Americans 
commonly identify as part and parcel of "the drug problem" 
are in fact the results of those policies. The failure of 
most Americans to perceive the extent and content of this 
causal relationship, and to distinguish between the problems 
that stem from the misuse of drugs per se and those that stem 
from drug prohibitionist policies, remains the single 
greatest obstacle to any significant change in American drug 
control policies. The recognition of this causal relationship 
does not, it should be stressed, lead automatically to a 
public policy recommendation that all of drug prohibition be 
abandoned. But it does suggest that alternative policies less 
dependent upon prohibitionist methods are likely to prove 
more effective. 
<p>Legalization also implies a set of policy objectives at 
odds with the government's proclaimed objectives of fighting 
a war against drugs and creating a drug-free society. Any 
drug control strategy, I and others have argued, should seek 
to minimize both the negative consequences of drug use and 
the negative consequences of the policies themselves. This is 
as true of public policies with respect to alcohol, tobacco, 
and caffeine as it is of policies directed at limiting the 
misuse of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, opiates, hallucinogens, and all other drugs. It is imperative, for 
instance, 
that any drug control policy distinguish among casual drug 
use that results in little or no harm to anyone, drug misuse 
that causes harm primarily to the consumer, and drug misuse 
that results in palpable harm to others, and then focus 
primarily on the last of these, secondarily on preventing the 
misuse of drugs, and little if at all on casual drug use. It 
is also imperative that any drug control policy be assessed 
not only in terms of its success in reducing drug abuse but 
also in terms of its direct and indirect costs. 
<p>Implicit in the legalization critique of American drug 
control policies are in fact two different types of 
arguments. At one level, it points out the ways in which drug 
prohibition per se is responsible for many drug-related 
problems. By criminalizing the production, distribution, and 
use of particular drugs, drug prohibition fundamentally 
transforms the nature of the drug markets, the ways in which 
people consume drugs, the lenses through which much of 
society views the drug problem, and the range of policies 
deemed appropriate for dealing with drug abuse. On another 
level, however, the critique advances a far more modest 
claim, which is that there are better and worse types of drug 
prohibition, with the Dutch "harm reduction" approach 
epitomizing the former and the American "war on drugs" the 
latter. Indeed, for many of those characterized as advocates 
of drug legalization, the Dutch model offers an alternative 
that is preferable not only to current US policies but also 
to the extreme libertarian model. The ideal set of drug 
control policies, from this perspective, can be found 
somewhere between the Dutch example and the libertarian 
model. 
<p>The harm reduction (or harm minimization) approach 
emerged in the Netherlands and Great Britain during the 1970s 
and early 1980s. It has since become increasingly influential 
both in those countries and in other parts of Europe and 
Australia as public health and other officials have 
recognized the need for more innovative and less punitive 
policies to stem the transmission of the HIV virus by illicit 
drug users.(5) Harm reduction policies seek to minimize the 
harms that result from illicit drug use. Rather than attempt 
to wean all illicit drug addicts of drugs by punitive means, 
harm reduction policies begin with the acknowledgment that 
some users cannot be persuaded to quit. These policies then 
seek to reduce the likelihood that they will contract or 
spread diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS, overdose on drugs 
of unknown purity and potency, or otherwise harm themselves 
or others. Proponents of harm reduction policies typically 
favor an assortment of drug treatment programs including the 
use of methadone and other maintenance programs. They insist 
on the need for needle exchange programs. They recommend 
public health and community outreach efforts to maintain 
contact between health service providers and illicit drug 
users. And they demand that drug policies acknowledge, both 
in law and policy, the human rights of drug users. Also 
implicit in most harm reduction approaches is the notion of 
"normalization," which posits that the harms associated with 
illicit drug use are best minimized by integrating drug users 
into normal society rather than isolating them in separate 
clinics, pro-grams, markets, and neighborhoods.(6) 
<p>The relationship between the harm reduction approach and 
the notion of drug legalization remains ambiguous. Some 
proponents of the harm reduction approach vigorously oppose 
any broader trend toward disassembling the drug prohibition 
system. They are quick to point out that much of the 
opposition they have encountered stems from fears and 
perceptions that the harm reduction approach represents no 
more than a stepping stone to legalization. Others insist 
that a harm reduction approach taken to its logical and 
sensible conclusion would more closely resemble a legal 
regulatory regime than the current prohibition system. Any 
harm reduction approach, they argue, must reduce not just the 
harms to users but also the many other negative consequences 
of drug prohibition: the violence that accompanies illicit 
drug markets; the corruption of public officials; the de 
facto subsidy of organized crime; the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of people; the deprivation of 
individual 
liberties; and so on. All agree, however, that modest efforts 
to reduce the negative consequences of status quo policies 
are better than no efforts whatsoever.<br><p> 
 
<b>LEGALIZERS, PROHIBITIONISTS, AND THE COMMON GROUND</b><p> 
 
The basic analysis advanced by most "legalizers" is 
remarkably similar to that advanced by those who have 
appeared as the most sensible, progressive, and 
nonideological among the prohibitionists. Both generally 
agree on the basic diagnosis of American drug prohibition, on 
the need to assess drug policy options in terms of their 
costs and benefits, and on the set of objectives noted above. 
The "progressive prohibitionists" largely acknowledge that 
casual drug use is not a problem in and of itself, and the 
legalizers grant that some policies designed to reduce 
overall levels of drug use may be effective in reducing the 
overall negative consequences of use. There is a shared 
recognition that many dimensions of the American war on drugs 
represent a form of overkill, that more modest criminal 
justice measures can accomplish the same objectives as 
successfully as the harsher measures, and that a more 
vigorous adherence to public health precepts and objectives 
will result in a superior mix of drug control policies. Both 
further agree that a dramatic expansion in the availability 
of drugs in society will likely increase the cumulative 
consumption of drugs. And both agree that it is important to 
draw distinctions among different drugs, and among different 
formulations of the same drugs, in designing drug control 
policies. Stated other-wise, few in either camp believe that 
marijuana, or coca tea, should be treated the same as crack 
cocaine. 
<p>This common ground is fundamentally at odds with the 
views expressed by the more conservative and reactionary 
prohibitionists. Articulated most vigorously by President 
Bush's first Drug Czar, William Bennett, this perspective has 
demonstrated no interest whatsoever in analyses of costs and 
benefits or in the need to minimize the negative consequences 
of drug control policies. Casual use of illicit drugs has 
been depicted as an immoral form of activity as well as a 
dangerous source of contagion requiring the treatment of 
users.(7) Social science research and public health precepts 
are of value only insofar as they conform with their 
ideologically based assumptions and policies. There is, in 
short, no room for dispassionate dialogue concerning any 
policy alternatives that do not appear tougher than what has 
been tried before.(8) Combining a penchant for punitive 
sanctions with a view of drug use best described as 
"pharmacological Calvinism,"(9) the reactionary 
prohibitionists have insisted that the only legitimate 
objective of drug control policy must be the elimination of 
illicit drug use. 
<p>The common ground is also at odds, albeit not quite so 
fundamentally-tally, with the conservative libertarian perspective 
on drug control.(10)For those libertarians who believe as 
an absolute matter of principle in the sanctity of individual 
sovereignty over property and the freedom of contract, no 
governmental controls on the commerce in drugs are acceptable 
no matter what the consequences. Other libertarians are more 
utilitarian in their thinking, placing their faith in the 
free market and assuming that the dual policy objectives 
would best be accomplished in the absence of governmental 
interventions. Less committed libertarians start from the 
same assumptions about the magic of the free market but 
acknowledge that modest governmental controls, particularly 
truth-in-advertising and labeling requirements, may be 
necessary to correct for the excesses and abuses that the 
free market invites. All of these libertarians tend to 
support the more civil libertarian commitments to individual 
privacy and freedom in the choice of one's lifestyle-- 
although they insist that freedom of con-tract includes the 
freedom of employers to insist upon drug testing as a 
condition of employment. Civil libertarians, by contrast, 
tend to regard the freedom of contract with less deference 
than the right to privacy. They are more apt to speak of a 
right to consume drugs,(11) and are more likely to integrate 
considerations of social justice and public health into their 
principles and policy calculations. 
<p>Putting aside the perspectives of the reactionary 
prohibitionists and the hard-core libertarians, there are two 
principal differences among the progressive legalizers and 
the progressive prohibitionists. The first reflects 
disagreements as to the weight that should be accorded to 
such values as individual liberty, privacy, and tolerance in 
calculating the costs and benefits of different drug control 
policies.(12) Most legalizers weigh these values heavily, 
with the more committed civil libertarians regarding them as 
absolutes that cannot be compromised and other progressive 
legalizers perceiving them as highly important but not 
inherently immune to some restraints. At the very least, most 
legalizers insist, the possession of modest amounts of drugs 
for personal consumption should not be the subject of 
criminal laws. The progressive prohibitionists are 
sympathetic to such values but accord them much less weight, 
both because they perceive them as under-mining efforts to 
reduce drug abuse and because they are more willing to defer 
to majoritarian opinion in defining and weighting them. 
Confronted with potential trade-offs between levels of drug 
abuse and levels of coercion directed at drug users and 
sellers, most legalizers are willing to concede modest 
increases in drug abuse levels in return for reductions in 
the numbers of those punished for using and selling drugs. 
Progressive prohibitionists, by contrast, are far more 
willing to limit individual liberty to the extent they 
perceive a potential gain in public health. 
<p>The second major difference of opinion involves the 
assessment of the vulnerability of the American population to 
the substantial increases in drug availability that would 
follow from any of the more far reaching drug legalization 
schemes. Where most prohibitionists can envision the 
possibility of a fiftyfold increase in the number of people 
dependent upon cocaine, and conclude that the future of the 
nation might well be at stake if cocaine were made as 
available as alcohol, most legalizers regard such estimates 
and predictions as the unsubstantiated folly of 
doomsayers.(13) Both agree that substantial research is 
required to better estimate this vulnerability, but the wide 
disparities are primarily a reflection of visceral fears, 
beliefs, and instincts regarding individual and collective 
human nature in the context of American society. Whereas most 
legalizers perceive, both instinctually and intellectually, 
ample evidence of a fundamental societal resilience, most 
progressive prohibitionists share with their more reactionary 
allies a fundamental pessimism regarding the susceptibility 
of American society to a dramatic liberalization of drug 
availability. 
<p>The roots of this viscerally based debate can be found 
in a related difference of opinions regarding the balance of 
power between psychoactive drugs and the human will. 
Prohibitionists typically see the balance favoring the 
former, with its potential to disrupt and destroy the lives 
of consumers. Legalizers, by contrast, emphasize the latter, 
with its assumption that the balance of basic human desires 
in most people effectively limits the destructive potential 
of drugs. For most prohibitionists, the relevant evidence 
includes the worst case examples of drug addiction and other 
abuse, the experiments on captive rats, monkeys, and other 
nonhuman animals to determine the addictive liability of 
different drugs, and the biological evidence of withdrawal 
symptoms in human beings following sustained consumption of 
particular drugs. Most legalizers, by contrast, focus on the 
less dramatic but more abundant evidence of casual and con- 
trolled drug use, insist that the "set and setting" of drug 
use are at least as important as the drug itself in 
determining whether a person becomes a drug abuser, and see 
the animal studies and biological evidence as less 
significant than the abundant historical, cross-cultural, and 
contemporaneous evidence of individual and societal 
resilience vis-a-vis all psychoactive drugs. ("Set is a 
person's expectations of what a drug will do to him, 
considered in the context of his whole personality. Setting 
is the environment, both physical and social, in which a drug 
is taken.")(14) Many prohibitionists seem to see some 
psychoactive drugs as possessed of powers akin to those of 
the Sirens whose alluring voices no man could resist. Most 
legalizers, by contrast, perceive such a notion as absurd. 
They find more persuasive the substantial evidence that most 
people (including children), given sufficient information, 
are unlikely to use a drug in the first place, that most of 
those who do try a particular drug tend either to stop 
shortly thereafter or to use it in moderation, and that even 
most of those who become addicted to a drug or otherwise 
misuse it, ultimately moderate or stop their use. 
<p>These differences, however, still leave abundant room 
for common ground on how drug control policies can be 
reformed in the short term. For even though the progressive 
prohibitionists share with their more reactionary allies a 
deep seated fear of greater drug availability, they lack the 
reactionaries' political and moral commitments to repressive 
policies. And even though most legalizers feel substantial 
revulsion for the more punitive prohibitionist measures, they 
recognize both the inevitability of, and the need for, some 
criminal justice accompaniments to any regulatory regime. The 
public health model, with its emphasis on reducing morbidity 
and mortality, appears to provide something of an 
ideologically neutral set of guidelines and parameters for 
working out a preferable set of drug policies-- although 
legalizers are wary of the totalitarian potential of a public 
health model taken to its logical extreme. Both legalizers 
and most progressive prohibitionists also perceive merit in 
the harm reduction policies developed by the Dutch as well as 
local authorities in England and Australia--even if they 
differ as to the extent to which those policies could be 
adapted to the American environment. 
<p>There is also a shared assumption, from which only the 
most libertarian of the legalizers dissent, that government 
does have an important role to play in shaping and improving 
the lives of its citizens. Where all sides differ is in their 
view of the appropriate means by which government should 
pursue this, with the progressive prohibitionists viewing 
criminal justice and other coercive mechanisms as perfectly 
acceptable and often efficient means and the progressive 
legalizers favoring less coercive measures ranging from 
education and voluntary treatment programs to broader 
provision of social services. There also is something of a 
consensus that the top priority of drug control programs 
should be to minimize the harm that drug users do to others, 
with the secondary priority involving the more traditional 
public health objectives of minimizing the harm that drug 
users, and especially children, do to themselves. But 
underlying even this consensus are differing assumptions 
regarding the appropriate reach of social control measures 
designed to detect and curtail the illicit use of drugs. Thus 
even among those who identify themselves as proponents of a 
"public health" approach to the drug problem, there are some 
who sympathize deeply with the legalizers but prefer to keep 
their more ideological, liberty-based, values out of their 
analyses, and others who see criminal justice sanctions and 
civil commitment laws as useful means with which to coerce 
drug users into treatment programs.(15) 
<p>The fact that legalizers and progressive prohibitionists 
have so much in common is significant for a number of 
reasons. First, it suggests that there is a basic framework 
of analysis, predicated upon systematic assessment of costs 
and benefits, that is regarded as intellectually legitimate 
by all serious analysts of drug control policy. The fact that 
the evaluation of the costs and benefits varies greatly 
depending upon one's ethical values and ideological 
assumptions does not negate this. Second, it suggests that 
the current framework and direction of drug prohibition 
policies in the United States are fundamentally at odds with 
any conceivable policy predicated upon either public health 
precepts or notions of harm reduction. Indeed, the only way 
to explain and justify many current policies is by reference 
to the fears, prejudices, and primitive moralisms of those 
who have transformed drug control policy into a modern 
version of an authoritarian crusade. Third, it suggests that 
the debates among the legalizers over the design and 
evaluation of alternative drug control policies may well be 
of interest to many who share neither all of the legalizers' 
values nor their visceral confidences.<br> 
 
<b>THE DRUG POLICY SPECTRUM</b><p> 
 
It should be clear by this point that drug legalization and 
drug prohibition do not represent simply radical alternatives 
to one another and that there is no single version of either 
one. Virtually all drug control policies incorporate elements 
of both prohibition and legal availability. Alcohol, for 
instance, is regarded as a legal drug but it is illegal to 
sell it to anyone under the age of twenty-one, illegal to 
drive while under its influence, and illegal, in many states 
and localities, to consume in public or to sell or buy except 
from government-controlled or government-licensed outlets. 
Many of the same prohibitions increasingly apply to 
cigarettes and other tobacco products. Nicotine gum, which is 
substantially less harmful than smokeable tobacco, cannot 
even be purchased over-the-counter. Cocaine and most opiates 
are typically regarded as illegal drugs, but both are 
prescribed by doctors, the former for nasal and dental 
surgery as well as (in a few cases) treatment of pain, the 
latter as a prescribed treatment for pain or, in the case of 
methadone, as an authorized alternative to illicit heroin. 
The distinction between legal regulatory policies and 
prohibitionist policies becomes even more obscure when one 
surveys the broad spectrum of alcohol control policies that 
have been employed around the world during the past century; 
the same is true of opiate control policies and, to a lesser 
extent, public policies directed at the control of most other 
psycho-active drugs.Nonetheless, one can distinguish between 
prohibition and legalization in at least two significant 
respects. The sharper distinction concerns whether or not a 
drug can be purchased over-the-counter, which is to say that 
it can be purchased legally by adults without first obtaining 
permission from a government agency or government- licensed 
agent such as a doctor. The more ambiguous, but equally 
important, distinction is between those policies that rely 
primarily on criminal sanctions to control the misuse of 
drugs and those that rely primarily on the informed choices 
of citizens as shaped by public health policies, regulatory 
structures, and honest drug education. 
<p>It can be useful to think about alternative drug control 
policies as arrayed along a spectrum, with the strictly 
prohibitionist and highly punitive at one end, the 
unregulated free market at the other end, and a wide array of 
regulatory policies in the middle. It requires minimal 
insight, moreover, to recognize that any drug control policy 
driven principally by public health considerations and 
stripped of the moralistic and authoritarian impulses that 
motivate contemporary policy would have little use for many 
of the more punitive measures in evidence today. The hard 
questions begin when values such as privacy, tolerance, and a 
presumption against imprisonment for most nonviolent drug- 
related activities are factored into the analysis of costs 
and benefits. They become even tougher to answer the further 
we venture along the policy spectrum into the relatively 
unknown territory of untested regulatory mechanisms and over- 
the-counter availability of drugs that currently can be 
purchased, if at all, only with a doctor's prescription. 
<p>Why venture into the unknown terrain of a truly 
nonprohibitionist drug policy given both the difficulties of 
evaluating the consequences of such a policy and the 
unlikelihood of it being favored by a majority of Americans 
within the foreseeable future? There are four reasons, each of 
which are developed below. First, only such a policy can 
dramatically reduce the many negative consequences of drug 
prohibition. Second, it helps us to address fundamental 
questions about the basic need for a drug prohibition system-- 
in particular long unexamined assumptions about the differences 
between psychoactive substances and other consumer items as 
well as the vulnerability of the population to a broader 
availability of psychoactive drugs. Third, drug policy is one 
area in which libertarian assumptions regarding the magic of 
the free market may be more right than wrong. And fourth, the 
future may bring both new drugs as well as new ways of altering 
our states of consciousness that are not readily susceptible to 
governmental controls and that transform the ways in which 
Americans think about drugs and consciousness alteration.(16) 
<p>Thinklng seriously and systematically about radical 
alternatives to current drug prohibition policies requires a 
degree of intellectual "stretching" that is relatively 
unusual in policy analysis generally and virtually unknown in 
the specific case of drug control policy analysis. This 
stretch is best accomplished by asking two complementary 
questions: How do we best maximize the benefits of the free 
market model and minimize its risks? And how do we best 
retain the advantages of drug prohibition while minimizing its 
direct and indirect costs? This stretch can be visualized by 
focusing on the enemies of the drug policy spectrum, with the 
free market at one end and contemporary American drug 
prohibition near the other end, and then trying to stretch 
each toward the other by applying notions of harm 
minimalization to each. 
<p>The stretch from contemporary prohibition is, of course, 
the easier and more familiar one. It begins with a known 
quantity, the status quo, which is far easier to evaluate 
than theoretical alternatives--even if many causal 
relationships resist precise identification. The tendency of 
policy analysts and policymakers to focus on options that 
fall within or close to the realm of politically acceptable 
opinions means that far more thought and discussion have been 
devoted to the more modest revisions of current prohibition 
policies. Many of the initial steps that one can envision 
already have been taken in the Netherlands, England, 
Australia, and elsewhere. And even many of the steps that 
might be taken beyond what is currently happening abroad 
still require no radical changes in either the structure or 
the mechanisms of prohibition. 
<p>The further one stretches from the contemporary 
prohibition model, however, in terms of reducing criminal 
justice and other coercive controls on the distribution of 
drugs, the more difficult it becomes to evaluate the 
consequences. It is, for instance, not that difficult to 
estimate the consequences of making marijuana, heroin, and 
other strictly prohibited drugs available by prescription, or 
of legalizing the sale and possession of syringes and other 
drug paraphernalia, or of extending the limited 
decriminalization of marijuana possession enacted by eleven 
states during the 1970s to the entire country. There are 
powerful reasons to believe that each of these policy changes 
would substantially reduce the undesirable consequences of 
drug prohibition and present only modest risks in terms of 
public health. But it is quite another thing to estimate the 
consequences of making cocaine, amphetamine, morphine or 
heroin more readily available to registered addicts, and 
surely an even greater intellectual challenge to evaluate the 
consequences of making these drugs legally available over- 
the-counter. That challenge cannot be met, I suspect, by 
taking contemporary prohibition, and the patterns of drug use 
that have emerged under it, as the starting reference points.<br><p> 
 
<b>EVALUATING THE SUPERMARKET MODEL</b> 
 
<p>Staring from the alternative extreme of the policy 
spectrum, the free market, obliges us to focus on the 
question that lies at the heart of the debate between 
legalizers and prohibitionists of all stripes: What would be 
the consequences for American society of having virtually no 
drug control policy whatsoever? Imagine, for instance, that 
Congress passed a law granting the freedom of drug 
consumption and even production and distribution the same 
legal protections as the rights of freedom of speech, press, 
religion, and assembly. And imagine that "supermarkets" 
existed all around the country in which drugs of every 
variety could be purchased at prices reflecting nothing more 
than retailers' costs plus reasonable profit margins and 
sales taxes. This is, of course, the nightmare scenario 
portrayed by the opponents of legalization--even if it is not 
the policy favored by virtually any of those identified as 
proponents of legalization apart from the most hard-core 
libertarians.(17) But it also bears a close resemblance to 
the relatively free market in drugs found in late nineteenth- 
century America--a period characterized by a fairly high rate 
of opiate and other drug consumption but dramatically fewer 
drug-related problems than we see today.(18) 
<p>The great advantage of this model is that it eliminates 
virtually all of the direct and indirect costs of drug 
prohibition: the many billions of dollars spent each year on 
arresting, prosecuting, and incarcerating hundreds of 
thousands of Americans, the diversion of scarce govern-mental 
resources from dealing with other, more immediately harmful, 
criminal activities, the tens of billions of dollars earned 
each year by organized and unorganized criminals, much of the 
violence, corruption and other criminal activity associated 
with the illicit drug markets, the distortion of economic 
incentives for inner-city residents, the severe problems 
posed by adulterated and otherwise unregulated drugs, the 
inadequate prescription of drugs for the treatment of pain, 
the abundant infringements on Americans' civil liberties, and 
all the other costs detailed in the extant literature on drug 
prohibition and legalization. 
<p>The great disadvantage of the supermarket model is its 
invitation to substantial increases in both the amount and 
the diversity of psychoactive drug consumption. What needs to 
be determined as best as possible are the magnitude and 
nature of that increase and its consequences. Among the more 
explicit assumptions of the legalization analysis is that the 
vast majority of Americans do not need drug prohibition laws 
to prevent them from becoming drug abusers. By contrast, 
prohibitionists typically assume that most Americans, and at 
the very least a substantial minority, do in fact need such 
laws--that but for drug prohibition, tens of millions more 
Americans would surely become drug abusers. The supermarket 
model provides no immediate insights into which perspective 
is closer to the truth, but it does suggest two important 
approaches on analyzing the implications of a free market. 
<p>First, it is imperative that analysts broaden their 
horizons to examine not just potential changes in the 
consumption of drugs that are currently illicit but changes 
in the cumulative consumption of all psychoactive substances. 
Virtually all human beings consume psychoactive substances. 
Alcohol and caffeine are certainly the two most common in the 
United States today, followed by nicotine, marijuana, and a 
variety of the more popular prescription drugs used to 
alleviate feelings of depression and anxiety. With the 
notable exception of alcohol, which has retained its 
preeminent position throughout the history of American 
psychoactive drug consumption, all other drugs have witnessed 
substantial changes in their levels of consumption. 
<p>Some of these changes have been a result of changes in 
drug laws. Others have reflected the emergence of new drugs, 
or new formulations of familiar drugs, as well as changes in 
medical prescription practices, new marketing techniques, 
changing fads and fashions in recreational drug usage, and 
broader changes in popular culture as well as particular 
subcultures. The notion of a truly free market in drugs 
obliges us to consider what would happen if alcohol, 
nicotine, and caffeine no longer were artificially favored 
over other drugs by virtue of their legal status. One strong 
possibility is that other drugs--including some that are 
common in other societies, some that were once more popular 
in America than they are today, and some that have yet to be 
designed or discovered--would compete with and substitute for 
those drugs that are most familiar to Americans today. 
<p>Indeed, one of the silver linings on the black cloud of 
greater drug use under different legalization regimes is the 
prospect that less dangerous drugs would drive out the more 
dangerous ones. By most accounts, alcohol and tobacco 
represent two of the most dangerous drugs that have ever 
entered into common usage in human society. Between them, 
they present a high proportion of all of the harms associated 
with other drugs that have experienced widespread usage at 
one time or another. Tobacco, especially when consumed in the 
form of cigarettes, is both highly addictive and readily 
identified as a cause of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, 
and other ills. Alcohol can be highly addictive for some 
users; consumed in abundance, it can cause death by overdose 
in the short-term and cirrhosis of the liver and other 
diseases in the long-term. It also is strongly associated 
with violent behavior and accidental injuries in a great 
variety of societies. There is no reason to assume that their 
predominant position in the hierarchy of favored psychoactive 
substances will persist forever, and good reason to believe 
that the desirable functions they serve can be replaced by 
other substances that pose far fewer dangers to the health of 
consumers in both the short and long-term. The same may well 
be true of relatively less dangerous drugs, such as caffeine, 
which might well lose out in the competition to other 
psychoactive substances, such as low potency coca and 
amphetamine products, that may improve performance more 
effectively with even fewer negative side effects. 
<p>The possibility of dramatic substitution effects under a 
free market regime suggests that the most important issue in 
evaluating the consequences of such a model is neither the 
overall magnitude of drug consumption nor the number of drug 
users under such conditions, but rather the magnitude of the 
negative consequences that would result: the immediate 
effects of drug misuse on the health and behavior of the 
user; the debilitating effects of sustained misuse; and the 
deadly effects of sustained consumption. Each of these 
effects may also be of consequence for nonusers ranging from 
those who love or live with drug abusers to those who depend 
upon them in the workplace to those who encounter them on the 
roads. The evaluation of these consequences, and the 
assessment of which are more or less serious, inevitably 
involve ethical judgments. But it is important to recognize 
that public policy can seek to shift patterns of drug use and 
even abuse in safer directions by favoring drugs, sets, and 
settings that cause less harm to users and others. It is, in 
short, possible for the undesirable effects of drug use to 
decrease significantly even as the amount and diversity of 
drug consumption increase substantially. 
<p>Indeed, if we really seek to be truly objective in our 
assessments, what needs to be calculated are not just the 
cumulative negative consequences but the positive ones as 
well.(19)Proponents of the public health perspective as 
well as substantial segments of the American population are 
reluctant to speak of the positive benefits of psycho-active 
drug use except to the extent they conform with conventional 
notions of physical health and medical treatment. Alcohol's 
benefits, for instance, are defined primarily in terms of 
their potential to reduce heart disease, and those of 
prescription drugs entirely in terms of their capacity to 
alleviate pain, depression, anxiety, and feelings that 
disrupt normal functioning. Yet most people use drugs because 
they enjoy the effects and many perceive a variety of 
personal benefits that are rarely measured by physical, 
medical, or social scientists. Some of these resemble the 
effects approved by medical and public health criteria, but 
they typically are not interpreted as such either because 
they involve an informal form of self-medication or because 
they confront the common value judgment that one should not 
have to use psychoactive drugs to be or feel a certain way. 
The moderate consumption of alcohol as a social lubricant, 
and of coffee and other caffeinated beverages as a mild 
stimulant to increase alertness, are probably the most easily 
accepted and widely acknowledged non-medical benefits 
associated with nonprescribed psychoactive drug consumption. 
But it is also the case that millions of Americans justify 
their past use and/or explain their current use of marijuana, 
cocaine, hallucinogens, and a variety of other drugs in terms 
of the benefits that they have derived from their consumption 
of those substances. Such claims are easily belittled in a 
society that adopts the notion of "drug-free" as its motto, 
and are often dismissed by scientists who find such benefits 
particularly difficult to measure. Nonetheless, it seems 
inherently unreasonable to dismiss entirely the perceptions 
of consumers, especially when the negative consequences of 
their consumption are not apparent. We thus have no choice 
but to calculate the consequences of changes in drug 
consumption not just in negative terms but as a net 
calculation that incorporates both positive and negative 
consequences. 
<p>The second perspective suggested by the supermarket 
model is that the potential negative health consequences of a 
free market, or of any other substantial change in policy, 
are best assessed by considering the respective 
susceptibilities of different sectors of the population to 
such changes. I proceed from two assumptions: that it is 
possible to distinguish among sectors based upon their 
susceptibility to drug abuse and hence their vulnerability to 
changes in drug policy; and that close examination of both 
current and historical patterns of drug use and abuse, as 
well as other patterns of human behavior, provide important 
clues into the nature and degree of susceptibility under 
alternative regimes. Implicit in the second assumption is the 
recognition that Americans, and most other people, already 
live in a society in which powerful psychoactive substances 
are widely available to both adults and children. One need 
only consider the easy availability of alcohol, tobacco, and 
caffeine virtually throughout the country; the continued ease 
of obtaining marijuana and other illicit drugs in much of the 
country; the extensive presence of powerful psychoactive 
substances, generally prescribed by medical practitioners, in 
the medicine closets of American homes; and the entirely 
uncontrolled availability throughout the United States of 
many other psychoactive substances, ranging from gasoline and 
glue to the wide array of drugs available over-the-counter in 
pharmacies. 
<p>What conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the 
cumulative consumption of psychoactive drugs in this country? 
First, virtually all Americans consume psychoactive 
substances--and even the small minority who appear to abstain 
entirely, such as the Mormons, seem to compensate by 
consuming substances that are not traditionally viewed as 
psychoactive, such as sugar and caffeinated soft drinks. 
Second, a substantial majority of Americans consume these 
sub-stances only in moderation, suffering little or no harm as 
a result. Third, the drugs that prove most addictive to most 
Americans are those, such as cigarettes and caffeinated 
beverages, that can be easily integrated into everyday life 
with minimal hassle or disruption. Fourth, virtually all 
drugs, even heroin, cocaine, and other drugs most associated 
with destructive patterns of consumption, are consumed m 
moderation by most of those who use them.(20)Fifth, a 
substantial majority of those who enter into destructive 
patterns of drug consumption eventually pass on to either 
abstinence or moderate patterns of consumption.(21) 
<p>When we focus on those who appear most susceptible to 
destructive patterns of drug consumption, further conclusions 
are apparent. First, while certain types of drugs are more 
difficult to use in moderation than others, the principal 
determinants of destructive drug use patterns involve not the 
pharmacology of the drug but the set and setting in which the 
drug is consumed. That is why alcohol consumption among 
conquered aboriginal groups and cocaine consumption among 
some inner-city populations have more in common with one 
another than either does with patterns of alcohol or cocaine 
consumption among less vulnerable sectors of the population. 
In-deed, no set and setting is more conducive to extensive and 
severe drug abuse than the combination of poverty and 
maladjustment to a mainstream society. Second, those who 
engage in destructive patterns of consumption with one drug 
are the most likely to repeat that pattern with other drugs; 
conversely, those who demonstrate an ability to consume 
alcohol and common prescription drugs responsibly, or who 
have succeeded in either stopping or dramatically curtailing 
their consumption of tobacco, are much less likely to engage 
in destructive patterns of consumption with other drugs. 
<p>Consider the results of recent polls on drug use in the 
United States. Approximately one-third of Americans over the 
age of twelve claim that they have not used alcohol in the 
past year, and close to half report that they have not 
consumed any alcohol in the past month.(22)In a December 
1990 Gallup poll, 43 percent of those polled described 
themselves as abstainers from alcohol--up from 29 percent in 
the years 1976--1978.(23) Among African-Americans, the 
proportion who claim to abstain from alcohol is 58 
percent.(24) Of those Americans who did drink within the past 
month, only one in ten (or about 5 percent of the household 
population) reported that they had drunk heavily during that 
time.(25) Approximately 75 percent of all Americans over the 
age of twelve have smoked at least one cigarette; slightly 
less than 30 percent report that they smoked within the past 
month, of which half consume about a pack or more a day.(26) 
With respect to marijuana, about 33 percent of Americans have 
used it at least once, 11 percent in the past year, 6 percent 
in the past month, and about 1 percent on something 
resembling a daily basis.(27) There is reason to believe that 
there is substantial overlap not only between those who drink 
heavily and those who smoke heavily, but also between those 
two groups and those who use illicit drugs heavily-- although 
detailed cross-tabulations of available surveys are required 
to reach more exact estimates. Indeed, one also finds 
substantial overlap with those who engage in compulsive 
gambling and other harmful activities. The principal 
exception to this substantial overlap may involve the misuse 
of tranquilizers and other prescription drugs, especially 
among women. Even if we assume that self-reports of alcohol 
and tobacco consumption tend to underreport actual consumption by 30-50 percent, we still must conclude 
that at 
least 70 percent of Americans are resistant to the sorts of 
temptations and risks posed by the easy availability of 
cigarettes, and that more than 90 percent either refrain from 
powerful drugs altogether or else consume them responsibly 
and in moderation. This conclusion strongly suggests that a 
very substantial majority of Americans are immune to any far 
reaching liberalizations in drug availability for the simple 
reason that they do not really need drug laws to prevent them 
from entering into destructive relationships with drugs. 
<p>The important question is thus not whether or not 
millions of Americans would change their patterns of drug 
consumption under a radically different drug control regime-- 
since there is good reason to assume they would--but rather 
whether those patterns would be more (or less) destructive 
than their current patterns of drug consumption. Among the 
tens of millions of Americans who abstain from alcohol 
consumption, it seems reasonable to assume that they would 
have little interest in, and perhaps substantial moral 
reservations against, consuming other powerful psychoactive 
drugs. Among the even larger number of Americans who consume 
alcohol in moderation, despite the great potential for that 
drug to be consumed in a destructive fashion, it is also 
reasonable to assume that the same individual and societal 
restraints that protect them against alcohol's seductive 
powers would control their consumption of other sub-stances. 
For the vast majority of Americans, therefore, the principal 
danger posed by a free market in drugs has little to do with 
drugs like crack cocaine, since so few Americans would be 
likely either to try it in the first place or, if they did 
try it, to continue to use it. (Public opinion polls 
consistently reveal that few Americans believe they would 
consume cocaine, heroin or even marijuana if those drugs were 
legally available.)(28) 
<p>The greatest danger of a free market in drugs, I 
suspect, is the possibility that a drug, assumed at first to 
be relatively safe, becomes popular among millions of 
Americans and then is revealed to be far more harmful than 
initially believed. This danger is one that has proven 
commonplace in the annals of pharmaceutical innovation, 
medical prescription practice, and inebriation, from morphine 
and cocaine during the nineteenth century to cigarettes, 
barbiturates, amphetamine, tranquilizers, and many non- 
psychoactive drugs, including steroids, during the twentieth. 
It is one that has continued to frustrate the regulatory 
efforts of the Food and Drug Administration in recent 
decades, and that promises to persist into the future 
regardless of whether or not the drug laws change 
substantially. But it is fair to assume that the dangers 
would be greater if far more products were to become legally 
available. 
<p>The most common fear of legalization, however, is 
usually of a different sort, and it must be taken seriously. 
It is that there are millions of Americans for whom the drug 
prohibition system represents the principal bulwark between 
an abstemious relationship with drugs and a destructive one. 
Under a free market regime, it is feared, many of those who 
currently abstain from, or consume in moderation, alcohol and 
other powerful intoxicants would become drug abusers, and 
many of those who already have demonstrated either a 
potential for, or a pattern of, drug abuse would engage in 
even more destructive patterns of drug use. Underlying this 
fear are a variety of assumptions: that the only things which 
prevent many current users of illicit drugs from engaging in 
far more destructive patterns of drug use are the high price 
and lower availability of those drugs under the current 
prohibition regime; that at least some of the illicit drugs 
are more seductive than those that are currently legal and/or 
available; that a free market regime would inevitably invite 
greater levels of drug experimentation, which in turn would 
lead to higher levels of use and abuse; that many people 
would be more likely to complement their current drug use 
with newly available drugs than to substitute those for their 
current preferences; and that the heightened societal 
tolerance for more varied psychoactive drug use that would 
likely accompany a free market regime would lend itself to 
higher levels of drug misuse.Even if we assume that the 
vast majority of those who now consume psychoactive drugs 
safely would continue to do so under a free market regime, 
and further assume that a substantial proportion of those who 
currently misuse illicit drugs would be no worse and quite 
likely better off under a free market regime, the fact 
remains that there is a relatively small, but indeterminate, 
proportion of Americans for whom the drug prohibition system 
provides not just the image but the reality of security. 
Figuring out, with some measure of confidence, the magnitude 
and composition of this vulnerable population is among the 
most important intellectual challenges confronting those who 
take seriously the need to estimate the consequences of 
alternative regimes. And designing policies that minimize the 
magnitude of this at-risk group without resorting to criminal 
justice and other coercive measures is surely an even greater 
challenge. 
<p>Most of those who would suffer from the absence of the 
current drug prohibition regime can be found among those who 
currently smoke cigarettes and/or abuse alcohol. The first 
group includes both those adolescents and adults who have 
demonstrated a willingness or alibity to disregard the well 
known consequences of cigarette smoking, as well as those 
adults who have demonstrated an inability to abandon a 
dangerous habit. The second group, which overlaps 
substantially with the first, includes those adolescents and 
adults who have demonstrated an inability to control a 
powerful psychoactive substance, i.e., alcohol, despite the 
existence of increasingly strong social controls. There are 
certainly others who neither smoke cigarettes nor abuse 
alcohol who would enter into destructive relation-ships with 
other drugs if they were more readily available, but there is 
(as I already have suggested) good reason to doubt that their 
numbers would prove substantial. 
<p>In trying to predict which drugs will prove most popular 
in the future, who will use them responsibly and who will do 
so destructively, it is important to keep in mind why people 
use drugs and why they use the drugs they do. The choice of 
drugs for most members of most societies can barely be 
described as a choice at all. Dominant cultures strongly 
favor some drugs over others, hence the preferred position of 
alcohol throughout much of the world, with different societies 
evidencing a preference for beer, wine or distilled liquors, 
or of coffee in most Islamic societies and quat in some, or 
kava in some South Pacific islands and coca in the Andes. 
Alcohol's dominant position no doubt stems as well from the 
fact that its simple means of production was easily 
discovered millennia ago by a wide diversity of societies, so 
that it was not merely readily available in most societies 
but also provided with substantial opportunity to entrench 
itself.(29) Tobacco's secondary position somewhat similarly 
can be attributed to its great success in sweeping the globe 
and becoming entrenched in a great variety of societies 
before the emergence of any international capacity for its 
suppression--although its powerful addictive qualities must 
also be given credit for ensuring that markets once 
penetrated remained markets thereafter. As for substances 
such as kava, betel nut, coca, cannabis, opium, and various 
hallucinogens, each has benefited, not unlike alcohol, from 
being an indigenous product. 
<p>To the extent that drug consumption patterns and 
preferences can really be described as a choice, it is fair 
to say that people choose those drugs that give them what 
they want. Most people can in fact be described as rational 
consumers even in their choice of psychoactive drugs. They 
use drugs because they seek or like their effects, whether 
those involve relief from pain, reduction of stress and 
anxiety, release from inhibitions, stimulation of the senses 
and the intellect, enhancement of physical or mental 
performance, or any of the many other psychoactive effects of 
drugs. Most people, moreover, tend to limit their consumption 
in order to minimize the negative consequences, whether those 
involve hangovers, heart disease or cancer. The evidence from 
a broad variety of cultures suggests that the single most 
important determinant of a drug's popularity is its capacity 
to be integrated into ordinary lives with minimal disruption. 
<p>It is important to recognize that the same notion of 
rational drug consumption applies to some extent even to 
those who are engaged in highly destructive patterns of 
consumption. For many hard core drug users in the inner 
cities and among aboriginal populations, their intensive 
involvement with powerful drugs provides a powerful source of 
relief from emotional and other psychological pain, some 
excuse for isolating themselves both from mainstream society 
and difficult personal responsibilities, and (particularly 
for those most engaged in the day to day hustling for the 
means to procure their expensive drugs) a source of self- 
esteem and motivation to keep getting out of bed in the 
mornings despite the absence of any promising prospects in 
their lives. This is not to say, of course, that the 
destructive drug use patterns of those living on the edge of 
despair can be described as entirely rational. But it is to 
say that even hard core drug abusers tend to prefer drug 
consumption options that minimize the risks of death in both 
the long and the short-term; the growing evidence about the 
willingness of intravenous drug addicts to take modest steps 
to reduce the likelihood of contracting the HIV virus attests 
to this.(30) Relatively few hard core drug addicts can be 
described as truly committed to an early death. It is thus 
reasonable to assume that even most current and potential 
hard core drug users will, if given the choice, opt for drugs 
that are, at the very least, no more dangerous than those 
consumed today. 
One can supplement the notion of rational drug consumption, 
which focuses on the individuals' preferences, with another 
notion also drawn from libertarian philosophy. It is that 
societies, like individuals, generate non-legal social norms 
in the absence of govern-mental prohibitions and other 
restrictive laws. Societies, simply stated, are not entirely 
at the mercy of free markets, but retain the potential to 
create self-protective mechanisms designed to minimize the 
risks presented by such markets. Indeed, some libertarians 
argue, one of the more significant costs imposed by 
governmental prohibitions is the withering of societal norms 
that often operate more powerfully and effectively than 
governmental interventions. Evidence in support of this 
argument can be found in anthropological and sociological 
studies of traditional and modern cultures alike, wherever 
patterns of human intercourse are allowed to evolve in the 
absence of significant governmental prohibitions. 
Particularly reassuring in this regard are the many 
decriminalizations that one can point to throughout civilized 
human history that were opposed by those who feared for the 
civility and even the survival of society but that turned out 
to be far less destabilizing than was feared. Such fears 
impeded efforts to do away with restrictions on speech, 
press, religion and assembly, on relations between people of 
different classes and races, on sexual and familial 
relations, and on the availability of psychoactive drugs that 
are now integrated into modern society.(31) The same sorts of 
unjustified fears now stand in the way of efforts to do away 
with current drug prohibitions. 
<p>The arguments of the libertarians are both powerful and, 
at least with respect to the majority of society, quite 
convincing. They confront, however, three counterarguments 
that most Americans currently find compelling. The first is 
simply that drugs and drug consumption are fundamentally 
different than all other commodities and activities--so 
different that ordinary libertarian assumptions do not apply. 
The second, like the notion of rational drug consumption, 
derives from economic reasoning. It is the evidence that 
suggests that levels of consumption of desirable consumer 
items tend to increase as their availability increases and 
their price decreases. And the third is the epidemiological 
evidence suggesting that the negative consequences associated 
with the use of any drug in a society are a direct function 
of the overall level of use of that drug. Of these three 
arguments, the first represents the weakest in terms of 
logical analysis but the most powerful from an emotional and 
political viewpoint. It can be repudiated by reference to the 
many ways in which other commodities and activities generate 
the same sorts of behavior as do the consumption of drugs, be 
it the alteration of consciousness, the transformation of 
social behavior or the creation of dependent 
relationships.(32) But the belief in the unique power of 
psychoactive drugs is so entrenched in our society that even 
highly prominent liberal theorists, including those with 
strong libertarian inclinations, either avoid the subject 
altogether or else carve out awkward exceptions to their 
otherwise more coherent philosophies. The second and third 
arguments, by contrast, present far more powerful reasons to 
refrain from placing one's faith entirely in libertarian 
assumptions. 
<p>There are other reasons as well to put the purist 
libertarian assumptions and the supermarket model to the 
side. The more one speculates about the consequences of such 
a model, the more one realizes that all sorts of additional 
assumptions have to be made about the type of society that 
would favor such a model--and that these assumptions are even 
more speculative than anything we assume about the 
vulnerability of today's population to such a model. At the 
very least, the sets and settings that so powerfully shape 
the nature and consequences of drug use would inevitably 
differ dramatically from their contemporary formulations. 
Furthermore, as soon as one engages in the process of trying 
to think through the consequences of such a model, one 
encounters the inevitable tendency to begin framing 
restrictions on the supermarket. Whether one analogizes to 
alcohol and tobacco, or to the nineteenth-century model of 
widespread drug availability, one confronts the tendency both 
in the United States and elsewhere to impose restrictions on 
the distribution of psychoactive drugs.<br><p> 
 
<b>THE RIGHT OF ACCESS MODEL</b> 
 
<p>We thus return to the question: How can the risks and 
harms of the free market model be reduced without undermining 
the many benefits that such a model offers? And how far can 
the free market model be stretched without giving up its 
essential feature? That essential feature, it must be 
stressed, is the legal availability of drugs in the absence 
of any requirement that the permission of a government- 
sanctioned gatekeeper be obtained beforehand. It is that 
feature that distinguishes the legal status of alcohol, 
tobacco, caffeine, and aspirin from that of marijuana, 
cocaine, morphine, and Valium--and that accounts for the 
generally greater and easier availability of the legal drugs 
compared to the illegal drugs. Legal drugs are almost always 
available over-the-counter; illegal drugs are not. 
Government-sanctioned medical authorities and pharmacists, 
and sometimes additional barriers as well, stand between the 
illegal drug and the person who wishes to obtain it. 
<p>It is important to recognize that legal availability 
does not always connote easy availability, and that the 
restricted legal status of a drug does not always make it 
that difficult to obtain. Legal drugs may, for instance, be 
so expensive--either because of high costs of production or 
high taxes--that they are for all intents and purposes 
unavailable to many potential consumers. Distribution 
channels may be relatively undeveloped or otherwise 
circumscribed. And efforts by government to restrict severely 
the availability of a legal drug without depriving consumers 
entirely of the right to purchase it legally may prove 
successful. Powerful evidence in support of these 
propositions can be found in the alcohol control efforts of 
the United States, Australia, and much of Europe during the 
1920s and 1930s. Whereas the former initially favored 
Prohibition, the latter opted instead for tough, but 
nonprohibitionist, regulatory regimes. The results were more 
substantial, and more lasting, declines in alcohol 
consumption and alcohol-related ills in Europe and Australia 
than in the United States.(33) 
<p>Illegal drugs, by contrast, can occasionally prove to be 
highly available. Medical practitioners often write 
prescriptions for mild tranquilizers, sedatives, and other 
psychoactive drugs in response to their clients' plaints. 
They may do so because they believe that such drugs are a 
proper and effective way of medicating their clients, or 
because they believe that a client's satisfaction with a 
visit to her doctor depends in part upon the doctor's 
willingness to end the visit by writing a prescription. And 
even apart from such channels, illegal drugs can prove 
readily available wherever substantial markets generate high 
levels of supply--as was the case with marijuana in much of 
the country during the 1970s and 1980s. The same holds true 
of more localized markets, in particular the inner-city 
markets for cocaine since the mid-1980s as well as for other 
drugs that have attained high levels of popularity in 
particular neighborhoods or cities. In cases such as these, 
illegal drugs may prove more available than many legal drugs, 
such as alcohol, for which the hours of sale are often 
restricted by government. In many highly restricted environments, moreover, such as prisons, jails, and 
mental 
institutions, illegal drugs are often more available than 
alcohol because their smaller bulk makes them easier to 
smuggle past guards and other barriers. 
<p>The foregoing analysis suggests that it is possible to 
construct legal drug control regimes in which certain drugs 
may be less available than is the case under prohibition 
regimes. When we stretch as far as possible from the free 
market extreme of the drug policy continuum, but seek at the 
same time to retain the basic feature of nongatekeeper 
accessibility, the model that emerges is one that might be 
called the "right of access" or "mail-order" model. It is 
based on the notion that adults should be entitled not merely 
to the right to possess small amounts of any drug for 
personal consumption but also to the right to obtain any drug 
from a reliable, legally regulated source responsible (and 
liable) for the quality of its products. In identifying such 
a right, I must stress, I do not mean to suggest that it is 
on a par with the more privacy-based right of possession 
and/or consumption, but merely that it provides a useful 
parameter--both ethically and conceptually--for designing 
alternative drug control policies. Unlike the supermarket 
model, the right of access model is one that can be 
superimposed on the current drug prohibition system. 
<p>If such a right of access were legally acknowledged by 
Congress or the Supreme Court--a prospect, I recognize, with 
scant political or jurisprudential potential in the 
foreseeable future--those desirous of minimizing the 
potential threat to public health might well advocate the 
notion of a mail order system. In order to ensure a right of 
access to all residents of the United States no matter where 
they might live, at least one mail order source would have to 
be available in the United States from which any adult could 
order a modest amount of any drug at a reasonable price 
reflecting production costs and taxes. Most states, cities, 
and other communities might well continue to prohibit the 
sale and public consumption of most drugs within their 
jurisdictions as they do now, but would be obliged to 
acknowledge the basic right of access by mail order as well 
as the basic right of possession and consumption. Some 
localities might also adopt, if they had not already done so, 
the various sorts of harm reduction policies that are 
advisable under any regime. One might also imagine many other 
local variations by different states and municipalities to 
accommodate the particular health, criminal justice, and 
moral concerns of each. But the option of ordering one's 
drugs by mail would allow any adult to opt out, in effect, of 
the local control system insofar as private consumption was 
concerned. 
<p>The right of access notion offers us, I think, a more 
valuable, modest, and realistic alternative extreme than the 
supermarket model from which to stretch toward the optimal 
policy. As a model, it retains in skeletal form the essence 
of a legalization regime, which is the elimination of any 
sort of gatekeeper--policeman, doctor, pharmacist, etc.-- 
between the seller and consumer of drugs with the power to 
deny the latter access. It thus strikes at the heart of much 
of what is wrong with drug prohibition, in particular the 
creation of violent and powerful black market entrepreneurs, 
the harms that result from unregulated production of 
psychoactive drugs, and the many infringements on individual 
freedoms. But it also provides a skeletal framework that can 
be filled out with many of the sorts of antidrug abuse 
measures that we associate with both harm reduction 
approaches to illicit drug control policy and public health 
approaches to alcohol and tobacco control. It has the 
advantage of resembling actual models in other domains of 
public policy both today and in recent history, including the 
alcohol distribution system in Canada and Sweden during the 
early decades of this century as well in pre- and post- 
Prohibition United States, and the modification of FDA policy 
in recent years to allow individuals to import by mail small 
amounts of drugs that are legally available outside the 
United States but that have yet to be approved by the FDA for 
the treatment of AIDS or cancer.(34) Given the preference 
among critics of drug prohibition for a fairly high degree of 
"local option," it addresses the inevitable tensions among 
different state and local drug control policies, between 
those policies and federal policies, and even (albeit to a 
lesser extent) between domestic policies and international 
requirements. At the same time, it offers a paradigm for 
addressing and reconciling the tensions between individual 
rights and communitarian interests that lie at the heart of 
so many struggles over public policy in democratic societies. 
<p>This model is not, I must stress, a panacea, nor should 
it be misconstrued as a final proposal for an alternative 
drug control regime. It raises numerous questions such as how 
such a mail-order system would be established and maintained, 
who would run it and profit from it, who would oversee it, 
who would have access to its mailing lists and other 
information about consumers, how consumer privacy would be 
protected, how minors would be prevented from taking 
advantage of it, how new drugs would be made available, and 
so on. Most of these questions strike me as susceptible to 
fairly precise answers, in good part because there are so 
many close analogies to a mail-order system. More difficult 
to assess are the same sorts of questions raised by the 
supermarket model and all other alternative models, in 
particular those that focus on assessing changes in 
psychoactive drug consumption--although I assume that they 
are easier to answer with respect to a mail-order model since 
such a system is more readily integrated with the current 
prohibition model than is the case with the supermarket 
model. 
<p>One prominent difference between the right of access or 
mail-order model and the supermarket model is that the former 
fails to eliminate the black market. Just as some gun control 
laws rely on waiting periods between the time a person orders 
a firearm and the time he obtains possession, so a mail-order 
system imposes a sort of waiting period--presumably a minimum 
of one day. It is highly reasonable to assume that black 
markets would persist not only to supply minors--which is 
presently the case with most psychoactive substances, 
including alcohol and tobacco--but also to supply those who 
will not or cannot wait to obtain their drugs from the mail- 
order system, as well as those who want to obtain more at any 
one time than is allowed by law. 
<p>We typically assume that an important objective of 
legalizing drugs is to undercut the black markets and place 
them in the hands of either government or government-licensed 
and regulated distributors. This objective is tempered by the 
recognition that there are better and worse features of 
illicit markets, and that a preferable drug policy ideally 
would focus on eliminating the worst while tolerating the 
better features. It would, for instance, attempt to undermine 
the accumulation of power by organized criminals, reduce the 
violence that attends such markets and generally push large- 
scale production into the hands of regulated, tax paying, and 
collecting producers and distributors. But at the same time, 
it might well choose to ignore smaller scale illicit markets- 
-what are often referred to less disparagingly as informal or 
unregulated markets--which are of value not just because they 
often prove more innovative and enterprising in designing and 
offering new products but also because they provide an 
important source of income for many people who face 
substantial disadvantages in their efforts to penetrate and 
succeed in the more established legitimate markets. This 
holds true, for instance, of both rural producers of 
marijuana and inner-city entrepreneurs engaged in the low- 
level distribution of crack and other drugs. Two probable 
advantages of the right of access model are that it would 
effectively undercut efforts by organized criminals to create 
highly profitable national distribution systems, since any 
adult could purchase the drugs by mail. At the same time, it 
would not eliminate many illicit small scale, localized 
production and distribution systems that meet local demands 
for immediate availability, rapid delivery, and specialized 
products. Local authorities could choose, in effect, either 
to suppress such black markets vigorously or to manage them 
through conventional vice control methods. But the scale of 
such markets would probably bear a closer resemblance to 
illicit prostitution rings in cities that sanction regulated 
prostitution than to contemporary illicit drug markets.<br><p> 
 
<b>TRANSITION ISSUES</b><p> 
 
Few drug control regimes are static. Prohibitions, 
regulations, and decriminalizations tend to evolve as new 
drugs emerge, as drug use patterns shift, as other drug- 
related norms change, and as popular and elite perceptions of 
various drugs, drug consumers and drug problems shift. In 
contemplating alternatives to the current drug prohibition 
regime, we need to distinguish between transition phases, 
longer term consequences and equilibria, keeping in mind that 
there is no drug control regime that will suffice forever. 
The distinction is important with respect to issues of both 
drug consumption and black markets. It is safe to assume that 
illicit markets do not just shrivel up and die when 
confronted with competition from licit markets. Rather, 
illicit entrepreneurs may continue to compete with licit 
markets during the initial phase when licit producers and 
distributors are still gearing up, having the advantage of 
their previous investments in production and/or distribution 
as well as their expertise. The share of the market that is 
captured by legal producers and distributors in the long- 
term, however, probably would depend more on price, 
availability, competition, the intensity of continued law enforcement efforts to suppress the remaining 
black market, and 
changing tastes and fads among consumers. There are also 
important policy questions regarding the extent to which 
those involved in the illicit markets during prohibition 
should be allowed or encouraged to play a role in legal 
markets after prohibition. 
<p>Close examination of the aftermath of Prohibition in the 
United States, other post-prohibition periods elsewhere, and 
other decriminalizations, such as of gambling, prostitution, 
pornography as well as of nonvice markets in countries 
experiencing significant deregulations (such as the former 
Soviet bloc countries) can provide important insights into 
how drug markets are likely to evolve.(35) The impact of 
decriminalization on those involved in illicit drug dealing, 
as well as on those who would have become involved in drug 
dealing but for decriminalization, is especially important 
when we focus on African-American and Latino youth in the 
urban ghettos. Clearly the dramatic drop in the price of 
currently illicit drugs following decriminalization would 
greatly reduce one of the most powerful incentives for 
engaging in drug dealing and other criminal activities. 
According to a recent report by the Justice Department's 
Bureau of Justice Statistics, 13 percent of all convinced 
jail inmates, and 19 percent of those convicted of drug 
trafficking offenses, said they had committed their offense 
to obtain money to buy illicit drugs.(36) Dramatic reductions 
in the size and profitability of the illicit markets would 
also remove the powerful financial and social incentives that 
have lured so many urban youth into drug dealing activities 
even before they began to consume illicit drugs. 
Further insights into this question can be derived both from 
analyzing the response of bootleggers to the repeal of 
Prohibition and from observing how illicit drug dealers adapt 
when illicit drug markets decline, as seems to be the case 
today.(37) Illicit vice entrepreneurs seem to respond to 
decriminalizations and shrinkages in illicit markets in any 
of four ways. Some succeed in making the transition to legal 
entrepreneurship in the same line of work. Some seek to 
remain in the business illegally, whether by supplying 
products and services in competition with the legal market or 
by employing criminal means to take advantage of the legal 
markets. For instance, following Prohibition, some 
bootleggers continued to market their products by forging 
liquor tax stamps, by strong-arming bartenders into continuing 
to carry their moonshine and illegally imported liquors, and 
by muscling their way into the distribution of legal alcohol. 
Some also fought to retain their markets among those who had 
developed a taste for corn whiskey before and during Prohibition. The third response of bootleggers and 
drug dealers is 
to abandon their pursuits and branch out instead into other 
criminal activities involving both vice opportunities and 
other sorts of crime. Indeed, one potential negative 
consequence of decriminalization is that many committed 
criminals would adapt to the loss of drug dealing revenues by 
switching their energies to crimes of theft, thereby negating 
to some extent the reductions in such crimes that would 
result from drug addicts no longer needing to raise 
substantial amounts of money to pay the inflated prices of 
illicit drugs. The fourth response--one that has been and 
would be attractive to many past, current, and potential drug 
dealers--is to forego criminal activities altogether. 
Relatively few criminal pursuits can compare in terms of 
paying so well, requiring so few skills, remaining fairly 
accessible to newcomers, and presenting attractive capitalist 
opportunities to poorly educated and integrated inner-city 
youth. During Prohibition, tens if not hundreds of thousands 
of Americans with no particular interest in leading lives of 
crime were drawn into the business of illegally producing and 
distributing alcohol; following its repeal, many if not most 
of them abandoned their criminal pursuits altogether. There 
is every reason to believe that drug decriminalization would 
have the same impact on many involved in the drug dealing 
business who would not have been tempted into criminal 
pursuits but for the peculiar attractions of that business. 
The challenge for researchers, of course, is to estimate the 
relative proportions of current and potential drug dealers 
who would respond in any of these four ways. The even broader 
challenge is to determine the sorts of public policies that 
would maximize the proportion that forego criminal activities 
altogether. 
<p>The need to distinguish between transition phases and 
longer term consequences and equilibria also applies to the 
impact of decriminalization on potential and current illicit 
drug users. The initial liberalization of availability is 
likely to spark high levels of curiosity, stimulated both by 
the media and by the mere fact of legal access, and 
substantial experimentation with different drugs--but it is 
reasonable to assume that this would moderate over the long- 
term. At the same time, the initial reluctance of many 
Americans to try newly available drugs to which they are 
unaccustomed may fade over time. Those who have grown up 
under a prohibition system, moreover, and have thus been 
influenced to one degree or another by the many assumptions 
that prohibition conveys about drug use, are likely to 
experience a legal regime differently than succeeding 
generations for whom it will represent the norm.<br><p> 
 
<b>GATEKEEPERS, NORMS, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS</b><p> 
 
There is also the question of how a liberalization of legal 
availability will affect both the doctor-patient relationship 
and the role of pharmacists. It would be useful to know, for 
example, what proportion of visits to doctors are motivated 
principally by the desire or need to obtain a prescription 
for a controlled substance. Between one-half and two-thirds 
of all consultations with doctors result in the writing of a 
prescription.(38) A legal drug regime would negate the need 
for visits motivated solely by the need to obtain a 
prescription, with mixed results. Some people would suffer as 
a result of not being obliged to consult with a doctor, but 
many others who now must waste time and money on unnecessary 
doctor visits would surely benefit. The problem of 
undermedication, and particularly under-treatment of pain, 
would almost surely be less of a problem than it is now. But 
some people would surely be more likely to use inappropriate 
drugs and to develop unhealthy dependencies on drugs that are 
now available only by nonrenewable prescription. Better 
insights into these issues can be gained by analyzing the 
available evidence about why people go to doctors as well as 
patterns of self-medication and doctor visitation in other 
times and places in which there have been fewer controls on 
the availability of drugs.(39) 
<p>The role of doctors and pharmacists as gatekeepers for 
prescription drugs is of course part and parcel of a broader 
question about the basic need for creating and maintaining a 
distinction between over-the-counter and prescription drugs. 
This question has been addressed most sharply by economists, 
although the literature on the broader implications of the 
distinction remains quite limited.(40) The notion of 
requiring prescriptions for drugs other than cocaine and 
opiates is, as Peter Temin wrote in his historical study of 
drug regulation in the United States, a relatively recent 
notion--one that was not consonant with the 1938 Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act but that emerged in spite of a 
legislative intent to the contrary.(41) Implicit in the 
notion was the belief that many Americans would not act 
rationally in their choice and use of drugs and thus needed 
to be shielded from their own irresponsibility by 
governmental controls. One result was a significant 
constriction in the provision of information about drugs to 
consumers. The supposition that a mandatory drug prescription 
system plays an essential role in protecting the health of 
consumers has yet to be systematically tested. One study that 
employed a cross-national comparative perspective concluded 
that the prescription requirement did not yield a net benefit 
in health effects.(42) Another, by Peter Temin, suggested 
certain criteria that could be used to determine when a drug 
should be restricted or made available over-the-counter.(43) 
These studies provide valuable insights, but they represent 
only a small step in the direction of determining the likely 
consequences of severely restricting or eliminating the 
mandatory prescription system. 
<p>I should stress that these issues are at least as 
important with respect to the urban ghettos as they are in 
thinking about middle class drug usage. Much illicit drug 
abuse in urban ghettos can fairly be described as a form of 
self-medication for depression and other psychological pain 
among people who tend not to seek out psychiatrists and other 
doctors for such ills. The drugs they use to hide and forget 
their pains--alcohol, illegal heroin and cocaine, and other 
"street" drugs--are often more dangerous but no more 
effective than those prescribed to middle class patients by 
their doctors. At the same time, urban ghettos are full of 
poor people who might well benefit from access to the same 
sorts of antidepressants and other drugs that middle class 
Americans obtain from their doctors but who fail to obtain 
them both because they eschew the illicit markets and because 
financial and cultural limitations preclude visits to 
doctors. Here it is worth pointing out the patent absurdity 
of the claim that drug legalization would devastate inner- 
city populations. Both legal and illegal drugs are already so 
widely available in inner cities that virtually any resident 
can obtain them far more quickly than in suburban 
neighborhoods. But a liberalization of drug availability 
would make more easily available drugs that are safer than 
those now sold in urban liquor stores, crack houses, and 
street markets. At the same time, it would substantially 
reduce the negative consequences of prohibition--all of which 
are felt most severely in the urban ghettos. 
More broadly, there is good reason to think that a regime of 
legal availability would substantially, even radically, 
transform the ways in which Americans relate to psychoactive 
drugs. One might well imagine that pharmacological experts, 
certified perhaps by either government or professional 
agencies, would play an increasingly important role not so 
much as gatekeepers but as educators and consultants on the 
preferred uses of drugs for medicinal, psychotherapeutic, 
recreational, and other purposes. But even more importantly, 
nonlegal norms would undoubtedly emerge in the absence of 
current prohibitionist norms to shape the way people relate 
to drugs, the ways in which they use them, and the cautions 
they exercise. Here again, there is the question of 
determining which people are likely to prefer the least 
potent and least risky drugs and which are more likely to opt 
for the most potent, quickest acting, and so on. There is 
also the possibility that a world of widespread drug 
availability might be more likely to generate self-protective 
norms against all forms of drug taking. And it is fair to 
assume that far more people would assume greater 
responsibility for their relationship to drugs than is 
currently the case, since the gatekeeper role of doctors 
effectively transforms consumers into far more passive 
actors. 
<p>This in turn leads to the question of how information 
about psychoactive drugs could be better distributed to a 
population so that it is readily available and intelligible 
to typical consumers. The challenges here are fourfold. The 
first is to design an effective means of distinguishing among 
categories of drugs so that those who purchase either by mail 
or at retail outlets are properly informed of the risks and 
appropriate uses. This task could be performed by either a 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or a nongovernmental 
agency such as Consumer Reports, or both. The second is to 
design an information system separate from the distribution 
systems whereby consumers can obtain necessary information on 
their own at little or no cost. This might involve 
information distribution systems accessible by telephone or 
other easily accessed computer hookups. Current efforts by 
the FDA, and by consumer organizations such as those promoted 
by Ralph Nader, to ensure that consumers are provided with 
both more accurate and more accessible information may well 
provide something of a model in thinking about issues such as 
these. The third challenge is to create honest drug education 
programs that tell children the truth about drugs without 
stimulating premature desires to try them.(44) And the fourth 
is to design public health campaigns that effectively 
discourage drug misuse without resorting to lies, scare 
tactics, and the demonization of people who use drugs. The 
public service advertisements directed at discouraging 
tobacco consumption and drunken driving provide far better 
models in this respect than the "Fried Egg" ads, caricatures, 
and untruths promoted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free 
America.(45) 
<p>Most of what people know about drugs they have never 
used comes from the commercial media. It has repeatedly 
played a central role in transforming local fads and fashions 
into national and even international phenomena.(46) We can 
safely assume that it will play a crucial role in the 
distribution of information and the shaping of public 
perceptions about drugs, particularly those that are 
relatively unfamiliar to most Americans. One need only 
imagine what impact the news magazines' cover stories in late 
1989 and early 1990 on the new antidepressant, Prozac, would 
have had if Prozac were available over-the-counter or by 
mail; indeed, it would be interesting to know what impact 
those stories actually did have on potential consumers.(47) 
How many people, for instance, visited doctors thereafter 
with the intention of obtaining prescriptions for Prozac, how 
many succeeded, and--even more difficult to say--how many 
benefited or suffered as a consequence? Conversely, how many 
people who might benefit from Prozac have not yet tried it 
solely because they are unaccustomed to visiting a doctor to 
obtain assistance in alleviating depression? Certainly there 
is good reason to fear the media's impact on drug consumption 
preferences under a legal regime given its historic and 
persistent incapacity to provide accurate and balanced 
information about psychoactive drugs.(48) On the other hand, 
the media occasionally has demonstrated its capacity to shape 
preferences in healthier and otherwise better directions. It 
is certainly a loose cannon insofar as our efforts to 
evaluate the future direction of drug use are concerned. But 
there is good reason to devote at least some effort to 
considering how the media has shaped drug consumption 
patterns in the past. 
<p>The issue of advertising is a difficult one. In 1986, 
the Supreme Court ruled in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates 
vs. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico that strict restrictions 
on advertising casino gambling were constitutionally 
permissible.(49) There seems to be little question that 
comparable restrictions on advertising psychoactive drugs 
would also be regarded as legal.(50) The difficult issues 
thus involve balancing the costs and benefits of both 
specific types of advertising as well as the advertising of 
psychoactive products generally. There is good reason to 
fear, and to curtail, the mass promotion of psychoactive 
drugs that present the sorts of harm associated with alcohol 
and cigarettes.(51) There are also substantial incentives to 
avoid a revival of medical quackery and the mass marketing of 
patent medicines that once tricked millions of Americans into 
buying products that did them little good and occasionally 
much harm. On the other hand, advertising can play a valuable 
role in informing people of new and beneficial products, in 
luring consumers to switch from more dangerous to less 
dangerous drugs, and in promoting competition that saves 
consumers money.(52) This is true of both psychoactive and 
nonpsychoactive drugs as well as those used for both 
recreational and more traditional therapeutic purposes. The 
solution to the advertising dilemma--to the extent we are 
willing to put aside First Amendment concerns--may well lie 
in a combination of restrictions on the promotion of more 
harmful products with vigorous educational campaigns to 
discourage their consumption.<br><p> 
 
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p> 
 
Predicting human behavior remains, and shall always remain, 
an imprecise art. Social science can provide modest insights 
into the consequences of incremental changes in regulatory 
structures on human behavior. But when we try to envision the 
consequences of more far reaching changes in such structures, 
our confidence in social science insights falters. The 
variables are too numerous, the changes in individual and 
societal consciousness too unpredictable, and the tools too 
paltry to pretend that we can really know the future. Here 
history offers a more powerful guide--with its potential to 
shed light on both the accretion of incremental changes and 
the suddenness of revolutionary change. But even its lessons 
are limited by unanswerable questions regarding the potential 
of the future to evolve in unprecedented ways. Ultimately our 
predictions are bounded by theories of human behavior, and 
particularly of human and societal vulnerability and 
resilience, that have more to do with our visceral fears and 
confidences than any objective readings of the evidence. 
<p>When we switch from predicting the future to trying to 
plan it, our preferences are determined not only by our 
calculations of their consequences but also by our choices 
among competing ethical values. Such choices may be made 
implicitly, as when we accept without question conventional 
ethical values, or explicitly. They establish the parameters 
beyond which policy options will not be considered. They 
influence our calculations of the costs and benefits of 
various options. And they guide us in deciding who should 
benefit and who may be harmed by choosing one option over 
another. There are no objective standards by which to choose 
among ethical values. One can only appeal to conscience, 
principle, and empathy. 
<p>The challenges of evaluating radical alternatives to our 
current drug prohibition system are formidable. But so are 
the challenges of predicting the consequences of persisting 
with our current policies. In 1960, few Americans had ever 
heard of LSD, and the notion that sixty million Americans 
would smoke marijuana during the next three decades would 
have seemed bizarre to most Americans. In 1970, few Americans 
gave much thought to cocaine, and most would not have 
believed that twenty-five million Americans would try it 
during the next two decades. By the late 1970s, many 
Americans believed that marijuana would be sold legally 
within a few years. In 1980, no one had ever heard of "crack" 
cocaine; the notion of an AIDS epidemic among injecting drug 
users seemed inconceivable; and the prospect of a quarter- 
million Americans in jail or prison by 1990 for violating 
drug prohibition laws seemed preposterous. Clearly, retention 
of our drug prohibition system provides no guarantees about 
future patterns of drug use or the scale of future drug 
problems. Legalization may present a wider array of 
possibilities, but its uncertainties are not dramatically 
greater than those of persisting with prohibition. 
<p>There are powerful reasons for taking seriously the 
alternatives to drug prohibition. The first is simply that 
drug prohibition has proven relatively ineffective, 
increasingly costly, and highly counterproductive in all 
sorts of ways that many Americans are only beginning to 
appreciate. Nowhere is this more true than in the urban 
ghettos, where the war on drugs has failed to reduce the 
availability of illicit drugs or the incidence of drug abuse 
and offers no prospect of doing so in the future. At the same 
time, these neighborhoods and their residents have suffered 
the negative consequences of drug prohibition more severely 
than any others. Not unlike Chicago under Al Capone, they 
must live with the violence and corruption generated by 
prohibition, the diversion of law enforcement resources, the 
distortion of economic and social incentives for their youth, 
the overdoses that result from unregulated drugs, the AIDS 
that spreads more rapidly because clean syringes are not 
legally or readily available, and the incarceration of 
unprecedented numbers of young men and women. Those who 
contend that legalization would mean writing off impoverished 
inner-city neighborhoods ignore the remarkable extent to 
which drug prohibition has both failed and devastated the 
urban ghettos. Drug legalization offers no panacea, 
particularly if it is not accompanied by more fundamental 
changes in the norms and leadership of urban societies. But 
there is no question that it can alleviate many urban ills at 
relatively little risk. 
<p>Second, there are good reasons to believe that a 
nonprohibitionist regime would not result in dramatic 
increases in drug abuse. Public opinion polls reveal that few 
Americans believe they would use drugs that are now illicit 
if they were legally available. Important implications, 
moreover, can be derived from the observation that we already 
live in a society in which all sorts of psychoactive 
substances are cheaply and readily available to both adults 
and children. Legalizaton would make more drugs more 
available than they are today, but it would not present a 
situation dramatically different from that which currently 
exists. The same sorts of norms and interests that prevent 
most Americans from misusing drugs today would persist. And 
even many of those who do misuse illicit drugs would be no 
worse off, and in many ways better off, under an alternative 
regime. Some Americans would suffer from the abolition of 
drug prohibition, but all the evidence suggests that their 
numbers would be modest. We possess, in short, substantial 
evidence of a fundamental societal resilience in the face of 
widespread drug availability. 
<p>Third, there are also good reasons to anticipate 
positive shifts in drug consumption patterns if we move in 
the direction of nonprohibitionist controls. The current drug 
control regime favors certain legal and illegal drugs over 
others that may well present fewer dangers to both consumers 
and society generally. Under a legalization regime, alcohol 
and tobacco would no longer be artificially favored by their 
legal status. Crack cocaine would no longer benefit from the 
perverse dynamics of the illicit market. And traffickers and 
consumers would no longer be obliged to favor more compact 
and potent drugs over bulkier but more benign substances 
simply because the former were less detectable. Both illicit 
drug abusers and responsible consumers, particularly among 
the poor, would have better access to drugs that are safer 
than those that are most available now. Drug legalization 
might thus result in more consumption of a wider array of 
substances than is currently the case but with dramatically 
fewer negative consequences. 
<p>Fourth, those who take seriously such values as 
tolerance, privacy, individual freedom, and individual 
responsibility have little choice but to seek out 
alternatives to the current system. These values are 
fundamentally at odds with a prohibition regime that 
criminalizes the possession of small amounts of any drug for 
personal consumption. They are seriously threatened, 
moreover, by a war on drugs that promotes notions of zero 
tolerance toward drug users, that pursues its objective of a 
drug-free society with few restraints, that encourages 
neighbors and family members to inform on one another, and 
that incarcerates hundreds of thousands of Americans for 
engaging in vice activities that were entirely legal less 
than a century ago. 
<p>In proposing a mail-order distribution system based on a 
right of access, I have tried to offer a model that strikes 
at the heart of what is most problematic about drug 
prohibition. I realize that such a model is easily mocked by 
those with little interest in thinking seriously about 
alternatives to drug prohibition. My intended audience are 
the progressive prohibitionists and legalizers of all stripes 
interested in developing the discourse about alternatives to 
drug prohibition. I believe the model offers an effective 
means of eliminating or reducing the worst consequences of 
drug prohibition. It represents the best compromise I can 
envision between individual rights and communitarian 
interests. It provides for both a skeletal framework at the 
federal level and substantial flexibility for local option at 
the state and local level. It allows for substantial latitude 
in implementing public health measures and campaigns designed 
to reduce drug abuse. And it offers a system that can be 
fairly easily superimposed on the current prohibition system. 
The model does not, to be sure, represent a panacea. It 
raises as many questions as it answers. Like any other model, 
it has its vulnerabilities and it is susceptible to abuse by 
those determined to take advantage of it. Its potential 
effectiveness depends, moreover, on the extent to which it is 
filled out with sensible and humane drug control policies at 
state and local levels of government. But it does compare 
favorably, I believe, with both the American prohibition 
system and the supermarket model preferred by extreme 
libertarians. It presents greater risks than the 
conventional, prohibition-bound harm reduction model one 
finds in parts of Europe and Australia, but it also offers 
far more potential to transform drug consumption patterns in 
both the urban ghettos and the population at large in safer 
directions. 
<p>Intellectual ruminations about supermarket models, mail- 
order distribution systems, and a right of access to 
psychoactive drugs seem far removed from current political 
debates over drug control policy in the United States. There 
are, nonetheless, good reasons to develop the intellectual 
capital associated with the analysis of alternative drug 
control regimes. First, scholars are obliged to pursue their 
intellectual inquiries unencumbered by the blinders imposed 
by current prejudices and political realities. To limit the 
questions that one asks and the answers that one ventures to 
those sanctioned by officialdom is to forsake our moral and 
intellectual obligations to both our profession and our 
society. Future generations are ill served if today's 
scholars uniformly submit to the intellectual conservatism 
that so dominates social science and public policy analysis. 
Second, many of the assumptions that underlie both the 
current war on drugs and the prohibition system itself have 
not been systematically examined for a long time. Even those 
who desire no substantial revisions in drug control policies 
can benefit from such an appraisal. Third, no one knows what 
the future will bring. New drugs and new ways of altering 
one's state of consciousness will surely emerge. The challenges of regulating psychoactive drugs are certain 
to 
increase. And the pharmacological Calvinism that dominates 
contemporary American public opinion and policy analysis can 
only persist for so long. 
<p>Cost-benefit analysis can, and should, play an important 
role in the debate over the future of drug control policy, if 
only because it provides us with the closest thing to an 
objective framework of analysis for clarifying our objectives 
and assessing our options. Ultimately, however, the debate 
over drug policy is really a debate over competing moral 
visions of society. I see no merit, and much evil, in calls 
for zero tolerance and a drug-free society. I also see 
nothing immoral, I must admit, about the consumption of 
psycho-active drugs by those who do no harm to others and who 
fulfill the obligations they have assumed to others. The 
challenge, from my perspective, is one of designing and 
promoting a drug control policy that combines a healthy 
respect for individual freedom and responsibility with a 
strong sense of compassion. These values do not trump all 
others all of the time. But it is important that they be not 
forgotten or pushed to the side whenever the fearful specter 
of DRUGS is uttered.<p><hr>

number of those dependent upon cocaine merely doubled, we 
would arguably be well ahead of the game, considering the 
large costs imposed by treating those users as criminals. But 
what if there were a fiftyfold increase in the number of 
those dependent on cocaine? We simply cannot guarantee that 
such a situation would not come to pass; since we cannot do 
so, it is the height of irresponsibility to advocate risking 
the future of the nation." See John Kaplan, "Taking Drugs 
Senously," The Public Interest 92 (Summer 1988): 32-50. Avram 
Goldstein and Harold Kalant assert more confidently: "There 
is no reason to doubt that the increased costs to society [of 
drug legalization] would rival those now attributable to 
alcohol." See Avram Goldstein and Harold Kalant, "Drug

said that they would be "very likely" to try marijuana if it 
were legal, 6 percent said they would be "somewhat likely," 8 
percent said "not very likely," and 81 percent said "not at 
all likely." Asked the same question about the legalization 
of cocaine, 2 percent said they would be "very likely" or 
"somewhat likely," 4 percent said "not very likely," and 93 
percent said "not at all likely." Similarly, in the annual

73 percent of respondents said they would not use marijuana 
even if it were legal, 11 percent said they would use it

<center><h2>Should Some Illegal Drugs Be Legalized?</h2></center>   
<p>  
<font size=2><i>Nadelmann, Ethan A. "Should Some Drugs Be Legalized?"<br>  
<b>Issues in Science and Technology</b> 6 (1990):43-46.</i></font size><hr>   
   
<p>Legalization--I much prefer the term "decriminalization" or "normalization"--means different things to   
different people. To some it simply means taking the crime, and the profit, out of the drug business. For   
some, it's a rallying cry, in much the same way that "repeal prohibition" was used, 60 years ago, for   
bringing people together from across the political spectrum.  That's why one day my allies on a panel may   
be William F. Buckley, George Shultz, or economist Milton Friedman, and on the next day it may be Ira   
Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union.   
   
<p>Legalization also refers to a framework of analysis--in particular, cost-benefit analysis. If we look at   
the current drug prohibition policies and determine, as best we can, their costs and benefits, and then   
compare them with the costs and benefits of alternative options, it seems to many of us that the best mix   
ends up looking a lot more like legalization than it does like the current situation.   
   
<p>Finally, legalization implies degrees of emphasis rather than absolutes. For example, alcohol is legal,   
but it is not legal to drive under the influence of alcohol or to sell it to children. Conversely, we speak   
about cocaine and the opiates as illegal, but in fact doctors can prescribe these drugs.   
   
<p>Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke has suggested that if we are going to have a "War Against Drugs," it is   
a war that should be headed not by the Attorney General or even by a Drug Czar, but by the Surgeon   
General. In other words, drug policy should not rely first and foremost on criminal justice sanctions but on   
public health approaches, combined with some degree of respect for the rights of adult American citizens   
to make their own choices--even bad ones.<br>   
   
<p><b>THE DECENT THINGS TO DO</b>   
   
<p>Personally, when I talk about legalization, I mean three things: The first is to make drugs such as   
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin legal--under fairly restricted conditions, but not as restricted as today.   
Second is a convergence in our substance abuse policy. We need a policy that is tougher on alcohol and   
especially tougher on tobacco--not with criminal laws so much as with other measures that would make   
them less available and less attractive. And at the same time be tough on marijuana, cocaine, and heroin as   
well, but while relying far less on criminal sanctions.   
   
<p>And third is to more intelligently manage our resources--to stop pouring the billions of dollars that we   
are now spending on law enforcement approaches down the drain and put them into drug treatment and   
drug abuse prevention instead.   
   
<p>Drug treatment is certainly no panacea. Most people who go into it end up backsliding. But it does help   
some people: It makes them less likely to die from overdoses and less likely to steal or commit other   
crimes. The evidence shows that it is worth doing, both for society and for drug abusers themselves. Even   
without coercing people into treatment, there are already waiting lines for the available treatment facilities.   
   
<p>More important, though, than drug treatment is drug abuse prevention. And here I am talking not so   
much about K-12 drug education but about "nonspecific" services such as prenatal and postnatal care,   
Head Start programs, inner-city education, and job training. These approaches are not just things in which   
the United States lags behind most other advanced industrial democracies in providing, they also seem to   
be the best drug prevention approaches ever developed--if you evaluate them in terms of producing non-  
drug-abusing, productive, tax-paying citizens down the road.   
These are not just the decent and humane things to do. They also turn out to be, dollar for dollar, a lot more   
cost-effective than building more jails.<br>   
   
<p><b>THE SOLUTION BECOMES THE PROBLEM</b>   
   
<p>Fundamentally, we need to consider legalization because the criminal justice approaches of the past   
have failed, and those of the present and future are likewise largely doomed to failure. This has nothing to   
do with squabbles between law enforcement agencies, or corruption in Third World countries, or whether   
or not we have a Drug Czar, or whether or not his name is William Bennett. Rather, it reflects the nature of   
the commodity, the nature of the market, and the lucrativeness of it all.   
   
<p>Criminal justice approaches have not only failed to solve the problem, they have made matters far   
worse. Most of what people identify as part and parcel of the drug problem are in fact the results of drug   
prohibition, just as when people talked about the alcohol problem 60 years ago, most of what they   
identified were the results of alcohol prohibition.   
Let's look very quickly at some of these approaches: international enforcement, interdiction, and domestic   
enforcement (of high-level traffickers as well as their street-level sellers).   
   
<p>Can we keep drugs from being exported to the United States? No, we can't. These drugs can be grown   
virtually everywhere, and to try preventing export from any one place results in "push down, pop up."    
Push down heroin coming out of Turkey, and it pops up in Mexico.  Push it down in Mexico, and it pops   
up in Southeast Asia. We have pushed down in so many places that it pops up virtually everywhere now.   
The United States is a multi-source heroin importing country. The same is true with regard to marijuana   
and cocaine.   
   
<p>Another reason is that international law enforcement has but a tiny effect on the ultimate domestic   
price of drugs. Even if you double, triple, or quadruple the foreign price, it has almost no impact on the   
streets.   
And finally, this is a business from which hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in Latin   
America and Asia are earning a very good living. The rugs are usually indigenous to their areas--opium in   
parts of Asia, for example, cannabis in Jamaica and parts of Africa, and coca that goes back thousands of   
years in Latin America--and cause few local problems. Moreover, they appear to bring in much more   
money than any alternative would provide.   
   
<p>Thus if you spray Latin American peasants' drug crops and try to persuade them to grow macadamia   
nuts instead, they respond by hiding their crops. And if you go down there, as William Bennett's people   
have done, and say, "Don't you understand how immoral you are being? You are poisoning the youth of   
America," the peasants are unimpressed. "Don't lecture us about morality," they say. "Our moral obligation   
is to do the best we can for ourselves, our families, and our communities. If that means selling this drug,   
which is native to our country anyway, then so be it." And they might well add another point: "While you   
Nortamericanos are talking to us about morality, your trade representatives are going around the world   
shoving down tariff barriers so that your farmers can export more tobacco. Are you so much on a moral   
high ground?"<br>   
   
<p><b>COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT</b>   
   
<p>What about interdiction? I don't know anybody who believes anymore that it makes a difference.   
Drugs can come into the country in any which way, and in small amounts--arriving by boat, plane, and car,   
hidden in flowers, chocolates, and statues. Looking for drugs is like looking for a needle in a haystack.   
   
<p>Interdiction has worked somewhat with respect to marijuana. But the success has proven   
counterproductive. The Coast Guard found that as it realized a few successes in interdicting marijuana, the   
drug lords seemed to be switching to cocaine. And why not? It is less bulky, less smelly, more compact,   
and more lucrative. This pretty much parallels the responses of bootleggers during prohibition, who   
switched from beer to hard liquor.   
   
<p>The other consequence of the marijuana interdiction "success" was to transform the country into   
perhaps the number-one producer of marijuana in the world. Some people think that the United States now   
produces the world's best marijuana, in fact, and that if the dollar were to drop lower, we would become a   
major exporter of marijuana.   
   
<p>What about domestic enforcement? If you go after the big drug traffickers--the people who most   
profitably and egregiously violate the drug laws--it makes little difference. Every time you arrest Mr.   
Number One, there is Mr. Number Two to fill his shoes. Indeed, it is often from Number Two that the   
police get the information to arrest Number One.   
   
<p>Similarly, with street-level enforcement, you can clean up some neighborhoods--at least for a while--   
but can you, for very long, keep drugs out of the hands of people who really want them? You have the   
same push-down, pop-up effect on the streets as there is on the global scale. Push down on 102nd Street   
and guess what pops up on 104th Street?   
   
<p>Now, law enforcement does accomplish some things. It reduces availability a little, increases the price,   
and deters some people. But the costs and other negative consequences of continuing to focus on criminal   
justice end up making a lot of things much worse.   
   
<p>Consider the direct costs. In 1987, we spent something like 10 billion dollars just enforcing drug laws.   
It may be close to 20 billion this year. Drug-law violators--and here I am not talking about drug-related   
crimes but drug-law violations such as possession, dealing, distribution, and manufacturing--are the   
number-one cause of imprisonment in New York state prisons, in Florida prisons, and as far as I know, in   
other state prisons as well. They accounted for about 40 percent of all felony indictments in the New York   
City courts last year and for over 52 percent in Washington, D.C.--quadruple what it was four years ago.   
   
<p>When cops say that the urban criminal justice system is becoming synonymous with drug enforcement   
systems, they are increasingly correct. In the federal prisons, 40 percent of the people there are there on   
drug-law violations; between three-quarters of a million and a million people were arrested last year on   
drug charges. We now have one million people behind bars in the United States, practically double what   
the number was just 10 years ago. And a rapidly rising percentage of them are there for violating drug   
laws.<br>   
   
<p><b>LIVING DANGEROUSLY</b>   
   
<p>But although the direct costs are enormous, the indirect costs are far more severe. Drug prohibition is   
responsible for all sorts of violence and crime--from street-level theft to high-level corruption--that   
seemingly have little to do with drugs per se.   
   
<p>Consider this: Tobacco is at least as addictive as heroin and cocaine, but have you ever worried about   
being mugged by a tobacco addict? Of course not, because it is cheap--too cheap, in my view. Heroin and   
cocaine cost much more to buy, even though they don't cost much more to produce. They are expensive   
because they are illegal, and addicts are obliged to raise the income, typically illegally, to pay for them.   
That would change under a maintenance system, or other forms of drug legalization, in which the prices   
were lower.   
   
<p>And the systemic violence of the drug-crime connection would also change. There would be far less   
need for illicit drug traffickers, and thus far fewer occasions for them to settle disputes among themselves   
by shooting one another, shooting cops and innocent bystanders (including kids) along the way.   
   
<p>Another cost, not much talked about, is the impact of prohibition on drug quality. Simply stated, drugs   
are more dangerous because they are illegal. Just as tens of thousands of people died or were blinded or   
poisoned by bad bootleg liquor 60 years ago, perhaps the majority of overdose deaths today are the result   
of drug prohibition.   
   
<p>Ordinarily, heroin does not kill. It addicts people and makes them constipated. But people overdose   
because they don't know what they are getting; they don't know if the heroin is four percent or 40 percent,   
or if it is cut with bad stuff, or if it is heroin at all--it may be a synthetic opiate or an amphetamine-type   
substance.   
   
<p>Just imagine if every time you picked up a bottle of wine, you didn't know whether it was 8 percent   
alcohol or 80 percent alcohol, or whether it was ethyl alcohol or methyl alcohol. Imagine if every time you   
took an aspirin, you didn't know if it was 5 milligrams or 500 milligrams.   
   
<p>Life would be a little more interesting, and also a little more dangerous. Fewer people might take those   
drugs, but more would get sick and die. That is exactly what is happening today with the illicit drug   
market. Nothing resembling an underground Food and Drug Administration has emerged to regulate the   
quality of illicit drugs on the streets, and the results are much more deadly.   
   
<p>My strongest argument for legalization, though, is a moral one. Enforcement of drug laws makes a   
mockery of an essential principle of a free society--that those who do no harm to others should not be   
harmed by others, and particularly not by the state. The vast majority of the 60 to 70 million Americans   
who have violated the drug laws in recent years have done no harm to anybody else. In most cases, they   
have done little or no harm even to themselves. Saying to those people, "You lose your driver's license, you   
lose your job, you lose your freedom," is, to me, the greatest societal cost of our current drug prohibition   
system.

<font size=2><i>Nadelmann, Ethan A. "How to Legalize." Interview<br> 
with Emily Yoffe. <b>Mother Jones</b> Feb./Mar. 1990:18-19.</i></font size> 
<hr><br> 
<CITE>Princeton professor Ethan Nadelmann has been one of the 
earliest and most listened to voices in favor of drug legalization. 
His argument that the violent, outlaw economies created by drug 
prohibition are worse than drug use itself has attracted some 
strange bedfellows lately: George Shultz, Milton Friedman, and 
William F. Buckley. Suddenly, the political dividing line seems 
to be shifting from </i>should<i> drugs be legalized to </i>how?<i> Here is 
where the free marketeers on the Right clearly part ways with 
Dr. Nadelmann.</CITE><HR> 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE> Drug czar William Bennett is out and 
you're in. What's the first thing you do?</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>Nadelmann:</STRONG> The case for legalizing marijuana 
is an extremely powerful one. But my idea of legalization is not 
based on the tobacco model, in which we make a highly addictive 
and deadly substance available at seven cents apiece to be sold 
in vending machines in packages of twenty. What you do is make 
it available, more or less like alcohol is made available, in 
places where it is relatively strictly controlled, where you have 
to show proof of ID. With legal marijuana you would have the THC 
content and health warnings on the label. 
<P> 
But one thing we can't afford is to have tobacco companies come 
to dominate the marijuana business. We can't afford to have pharmaceutical 
companies come to dominate the cocaine business. Talk about pushing. 
Look at the tobacco industry internationally. Do they ever make 
an effort not to have it sold to children? Look at alcohol advertising. 
That's pushing. They outdo drug dealers any day of the week. I'd 
like to see the federal tax on tobacco and alcohol doubled or 
tripled. That would significantly reduce consumption, especially 
among new users, but would not raise the price so high it would encourage 
a black market. 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE>So marijuana is legal -- what 
next?</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>N:</STRONG>On a realistic level, we're going to 
have to go step by step. Foe example, legalizing marijuana is 
not going to change the situation in the inner cities. We have 
to do with economics what we know we can't do with law enforcement. Let's 
say we decide, okay, we're not going to legalize crack; what we 
will do is legalize 15-percent cocaine. About ten years ago the 
average potency of cocaine on the street level was 12 percent . Last year it was about 60 percent, and is 
going higher. When 
people said in the seventies that cocaine wasn't that dangerous, 
maybe that's because it was a lot less potent. So let's say the 
government will make available 15 percent-pure cocaine. What would 
happen? Clearly a lot of people using 60-percent cocaine would just be 
satisfied with 15 percent. They would be better off, in all likelihood, 
because they are using a weaker drug and not as much of it. 
<P> 
Yes, some people are still going to want to go to the black market 
and buy from people who are cooking up the 15-percent cocaine into crack. 
You won't be able to prevent that , But let's say that 70 percent 
of the market will be using the legal, less potent substance. 
That's good , because the government taxes it, regulates it, because 
people know what they're getting. The government has no control 
right now. 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE>What would you do about PCP, 
methamphetamine, heroin?</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>EN:</STRONG> I don't think it's a good idea to introduce 
particular types of drugs into places where there is no demand 
for them. If there is no market for PCP in Cleveland, I don't 
think the government should make it available there. But 
if there is a lot of PCP use in Washington, then the government 
comes in and regulates its sale. The object is to undercut the 
criminal element. 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE>In most of our cities there 
are six-month waiting lists for publicly funded drug treatment 
programs...</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>EN:</STRONG>It's one of the great hypocrisies of 
our policies. Drug treatment often turns out to have a lower recidivism 
rate than throwing people in prison. It costs $52,000 a year 
to keep someone on Riker's Island. A year's stay at Phoenix House 
in New York, for example, costs $15,000. The problem is, treatment 
sounds like a &quot;liberal&quot; solution. Politicians want to 
sound like they're tough on drugs. If something works better, but it doesn't 
sound tough , they can be hurt for advocating it. 
<P> 
Everything we know about addiction shows that people who come 
from stable, supportive environments, who have positive things 
going for them, have very low rates of addiction. You take people 
with none of those things, and exactly the same substances lead 
to much higher rates of addiction. 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE>Then isn't that a case against 
legalization? Shouldn't we be trying to protect the most vulnerable 
in our society? Why add another problem?</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>EN:</STRONG>That's exactly the reason <I>for</I> 
legalization. Because criminalization has totally failed to keep 
crack and other drugs out of the ghetto so far, and offers no 
promise to do so in the future. Legalization would help eliminate 
the worst effects of drugs on the community -- the rising violence, 
rising crime, little kids growing up with drug dealers as role 
models. 
<P> 
Right now the best and the brightest of the ghetto kids understand 
the economic incentive of drug dealing. It's the drug dealer that 
has the fancy cars, wads of money, beautiful women. Imagine that 
instead you have a government licensed crack outlet, where crack 
heads line up each day to get their fix. Which is going to send 
the message you want to send? It seems to me it's better for kids 
to see the addicts lining up at the crack outlet than to see how cool it is 
to be the guy who's selling drugs. 
<P> 
In the ghettos it's understandable why people want to obliterate 
reality. We can't really stop drug use until we address the underlying 
problems in the ghettos. That means, at least in part, more pre- 
and post-natal programs, more Head Start programs -- things that make a difference. 
But in the meantime, we can at least get rid of the screwed-up 
incentives our current drug policies provide. 
<P> 
<STRONG>MJ:</STRONG><CITE>What do you see when you look 
into the future of the drug situation?</CITE> 
<P> 
<STRONG>EN:</STRONG>You hear knowledgeable people in pharmaceuticals 
and biochemistry say that the knowledge to manufacture mind-altering 
substances at home is the type of knowledge that that anybody 
with a high school chemistry education will have. What are we going to 
do then -- ban high school chemistry courses? In ten or fifteen 
years, criminal measures may well be totally irrelevant; they 
won't have a hope of controlling drug use. 
<P> 
Almost every society that we know of in human history has found 
some form of chemical substance to alter one's state of consciousness. 
Some societies have been very successful at integrating this into 
their culture and using it in almost totally non-destructive ways. Somehow 
public policy has to find a way of encouraging people not to abuse 
drugs, or at least to use them more safely. Then we need to find 
the best ways to deal with those people who don't know how to 
use them safely. Not by throwing them in jail, but by finding ways 
to help them.<p>

<A NAME="intro">As frustrations with the drug problem and current 
drug policies rise daily, growing numbers of political leaders, 
law enforcement officials, drug abuse experts, and common citizens 
are insisting that a radical alternative to current policies be 
fairly considered: the controlled legalization (or decriminalization) 
of drugs </A><A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#note1">(1)</A>. 
<P> 
Just as &quot;Repeal Prohibition&quot; became a catchphrase that 
swept together the diverse objections to Prohibition, so &quot;Legalize 
(or Decriminalize) Drugs&quot; has become a catchphrase that means 
many things to many people. The policy analyst views legalization 
as a model for critically examining the costs and benefits of 
drug prohibition policies. Libertarians, both civil and economic, 
view it as a policy alternative that eliminates criminal sanctions 
on the use and sale of drugs that are costly in terms of both 
individual liberty and economic freedom. Others see it simply 
as a means to take the crime out of the drug business.&quot; In 
its broadest sense, however, legalization incorporates the many 
arguments and growing sentiment for de-emphasizing our traditional 
reliance on criminal justice resources to deal with drug abuse 
and for emphasizing instead drug abuse, prevention, treatment, 
and education, as well as noncriminal restrictions on the availability 
and use of psychoactive substances and positive inducements to 
abstain from drug abuse. 
<P> 
There is no one legalization option. At one extreme, some libertarians 
advocate the removal of all criminal sanctions and taxes on the 
production and sale of all psychoactive substances with the possible 
exception of restrictions on sales to children. The alternative 
extremes are more varied. Some would limit legalization to one 
of the safest (relatively speaking) of all illicit substances: 
marijuana. The author is an Assistant Professor of politics and 
public Affairs in the Department of Politics and the Woodrow Wilson 
School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, 
Princeton NJ 08544. Others prefer a &quot;medical&quot; oversight 
model similar to today's methadone maintenance programs. The middle 
ground combines legal availability of some or all illicit drugs 
with vigorous efforts to restrict consumption by means other than 
resort to criminal sanctions. Many supporters of this dual approach 
simultaneously advocate greater efforts to limit tobacco consumption 
and the abuse of alcohol as well as a transfer of government resources 
from anti-drug law enforcement to drug prevention and treatment. 
Indeed, the best model for this view of drug legalization is precisely 
the tobacco control model advocated by those who want to do everything 
possible to discourage tobacco consumption short of criminalizing 
the production, sale, and use of tobacco. 
<P> 
Clearly, neither drug legalization nor enforcement of anti-drug 
laws promises to &quot;solve&quot; the drug problem. Nor is there 
any question that legalization presents certain risks. Legalization 
would almost certainly increase the availability of drugs, decrease 
their prices and remove the deterrent power of the criminal sanction-all 
of which invite increases in drug use and abuse. There are at 
least three reasons, however, why these risks are worth taking. 
First, drug control strategies that rely primarily on criminal 
justice measures are significantly and inherently limited in their 
capacity to curtail drug abuse. Second, many law enforcement efforts 
are not only of limited value but also highly costly and counterproductive; 
indeed, many of the drug-related evils that most people identify 
as part and parcel of the drug problem&quot; are in fact the Costs 
of drug prohibition policies. Third, the risks of legalization 
may well be less than most people assume, particularly if intelligent 
alternative measures are implemented. 
<H3><A NAME="limits">The Limits of Drug Prohibition Policies</A> 
</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#top" >(Top of file)</A> 
<P> 
Few law enforcement officials any longer contend that their efforts 
can do much more than they are already doing to reduce drug abuse 
in the United States. This is one of international drug enforcement 
efforts, interdiction, and both high-level and street-level domestic 
drug enforcement efforts. 
<P> 
The United States seeks to limit the export of illicit drugs to 
this country by a combination of crop eradication and crop substitution 
programs, financial inducements to growers to abstain from the 
illicit business, and punitive measures against producers, traffickers, 
and others involved in the drug traffic. These efforts have met 
with scant success in the past and show few indications of succeeding 
in the future. The obstacles are many: marijuana and opium can 
be grown in a wide variety of locales and even the coca plant 
can be grown in virtually any subtropical region of the world 
which gets between 40 and 240 inches of rain per year, where it 
never freezes, and where the land is not so swampy as to be waterlogged. 
In South America this comes to [approximately] 2.500,000 square 
miles of which less than 700 square miles are currently being 
used to cultivate coca <A NAME="back2"></A><A HREF="#note2">(2)</A>. 
Producers in many countries have reacted to crop eradication programs 
by engaging in &quot;guerrilla&quot; farming methods, cultivating 
their crops in relatively inaccessible hinterlands, and camouflaging 
them with legitimate crops. Some illicit drug-producing regions 
are controlled not by the central government but by drug trafficking 
gangs or political insurgents, thereby rendering eradication efforts 
even more difficult and hazardous. 
<P> 
Even where eradication efforts prove relatively successful in 
an individual country, other countries will emerge as new producers, 
as has occurred with both the international marijuana and heroin 
markets during the past two decades and can be expected to follow 
from planned coca eradication programs. The foreign export price 
of illicit drugs is such a tiny fraction of the retail price in 
the United States [approximately 4% with cocaine, 1% with marijuana, 
and much less than 1% with heroin <A NAME="back3"></A><A HREF="#note3">(3)</A>] 
that international drug control efforts are not even successful 
in raising the cost of illicit drugs to U.S. consumers. 
<P> 
U.S. efforts to control drugs overseas also confront substantial 
and in some cases well-organized political opposition in foreign 
countries <A NAME="back4"></A><A HREF="#note4">(4)</A>. Major 
drug traffickers retain the power to bribe and intimidate government 
officials into ignoring or even cooperating with their enterprises 
<A NAME="back5"></A><A HREF="#note5">(5)</A>. Particularly in 
many Latin American and Asian countries, the illicit drug traffic 
is an important source of income and employment, bringing in billions 
of dollars in hard currency each year and providing livable wages 
for many hundreds of thousands. The illicit drug business has 
been deemed not entirely in jest as the best means ever devised 
by the United States for exporting the capitalist ethic to potentially 
revolutionary Third World peasants. By contrast, United States-sponsored 
eradication efforts risk depriving those same peasants of their 
livelihoods, thereby stimulating support for communist insurgencies 
ranging from Peru's Shining path <A NAME="back6"></A><A HREF="#note6">(6)</A> 
to the variety of ethnic and communist organizations active in 
drug-producing countries such as Colombia and Burma. Moreover, 
many of those involved in producing illicit drugs overseas do 
not perceive their moral obligation as preventing decadent gringos 
from consuming cocaine or heroin; rather it is to earn the best 
living possible for themselves and their families. In the final 
analysis, there is little the US government can do to change this 
perception. 
<P> 
Interdiction efforts have shown little success in stemming the 
flow of cocaine and heroin into the United States <A NAME="back7"></A><A HREF="#note7">(7)</A>. 
Indeed, during the past decade, the wholesale price of a kilo 
of cocaine has dropped by 80% even as the retail purity of a gram 
of cocaine has multiplied from 12 to about 60%; the trend with 
heroin over the past few years has been similar if less dramatic 
<A HREF="#note8">(8)</A>. Easily transported in a variety of large 
and small aircraft and sea vessels, carried across the Mexican 
border by legal and illegal border crossers, hidden in everything 
from furniture, flowers, and automobile to private body parts 
and cadavers, heroin and cocaine shipments are extraordinarily 
difficult to detect. Despite powerful congressional support for 
dramatically increasing the role of the military in drug interdiction, 
military leaders insist that they can do little to make a difference. 
The Coast Guard and U.S. Customs continue to expand their efforts 
in this area, but they too concede that they will never seize 
more than a small percentage of total shipments. Because cocaine 
and heroin are worth more than their weight in gold, the incentive 
to transport these drugs to the United States are so great that 
we can safety assume that there wilt never be a shortage of those 
willing to take the risk. 
<P> 
The one success that interdiction efforts can claim concerns marijuana. 
Because marijuana is far bulkier per dollar of value than either 
cocaine or heroin it is harder to conceal and easier to detect. 
Stepped-up interdiction from in recent years appear to have reduced 
the flow of marijuana into the United States and to have increased 
its price to the American consumer (S). The unintended consequences 
of this success are twofold: the United States has emerged as 
one of the world's leading producers of marijuana; indeed, U.S. 
producers are now believed to produce among the finest strains 
in the world <A HREF="#note8">(8)</A>; and many international 
drug traffickers appear to have redirected their efforts from 
marijuana to cocaine. The principal consequence of U.S. drug interdictions 
efforts, many would contend, has been a glut of increasingly potent 
cocaine and a shortage of comparatively benign marijuana. 
<P> 
Domestic law enforcement efforts have proven increasingly successful 
in apprehending and imprisoning rapidly growing numbers of illicit 
drug merchants, ranging from the most sophisticated international 
traffickers to the most common street-level drug dealers. The 
principal benefit of law enforcement directed at major drug trafficking 
organizations is probably the rapidly rising value of drug trafficker 
assets forfeited to the government. There is, however, little 
indication that such efforts have any significant impact on the 
price or availability of illicit drugs. Intensive and highly costly 
street-level law enforcement efforts such as those mounted by 
many urban police departments in recent years have resulted in 
the arrests of thousands of low-level drug dealers and users and 
helped improve the quality of life in targeted neighborhoods <A NAME="back9"></A><A 
HREF="#note9">(9)</A>. 
In most large urban centers, however, the efforts have had little 
impact on the overall availability of illicit drugs. 
<P> 
The logical conclusion of the foregoing analysis is not that criminal 
justice efforts to stop drug trafficking do not work; at all; 
rather, it is that even substantial fluctuations in those efforts 
have little effect on the price, availability, and consumption 
of illicit drugs. The mere existence of criminal laws combined 
with minimal levels of enforcement is sufficient to deter many 
potential users and to reduce the availability and increase the 
price of drugs. Law enforcement officials acknowledge that they 
alone cannot solve the drug problem but contend that their role 
is nonetheless essential to the overall effort to reduce illicit 
drug use and abuse. What they are less ready to acknowledge, however, 
is that the very criminalization of the drug market has proven 
highly costly and counterproductive in much the same way that 
the national prohibition of alcohol did 60 years ago.

<P> 
Total government expenditures devoted to expenditures of drug 
laws amounted to a minimum of $10 billion in 1987. Between 1981 
and 1987, federal expenditures on anti-drug law enforcement more 
than tripled, from less than $1 billion per year to about $3 billion 
<A NAME="back10"></A><A HREF="#note10">(10)</A>. State and local 
law enforcement agencies spent an estimated $5 billion, amounting 
to about one-fifth of their total investigative resources, on 
drug enforcement activities in 1986 <A NAME="back11"></A><A HREF="#note11">(11)</A>. 
Drug law violators currently account for approximately 10% of 
the toughly 550,000 inmates in state prisons, more than one-third 
of the 50,000 federal prison inmates, and a significant (albeit 
undetermined) proportion of the approximately 300,000 individual 
confined in municipal jails <A NAME="back12"></A><A HREF="#note12">(12)</A>. 
The U.S. Sentencing Commission has predicted that in 15 years 
the federal prison population will total 100,000 to 150,000 inmates, 
of whom one-half will be incarcerated for drug law violations 
<A NAME="back13"></A><A HREF="#note13">(13)</A>. Among the 40,000 
inmates in New York State prisons, drug law violations surpassed 
first-degree robbery in 1987 as the number one cause of incarceration 
accounting for 20% of the total prison population <A NAME="back14"></A><A 
HREF="#note14">(14)</A> 
In Florida, the 8,506 drug law violators admitted to state prisons 
in fiscal 1987-88 represented a 525% increase from fiscal 1983-84 
and 278% of all new admissions to prison in 1987-88 <A NAME="back15"></A><A 
HREF="#note15">(15)</A> 
Nationwide. Drug trafficking and drug possession offenses accounted 
for approximately 135,000 (23%) of the 583,000 individuals convicted 
of felonies in state courts in 1986 <A NAME="back16"></A><A HREF="#note16">(16)</A> 
State and local governments spent a minimum of $2 billion last 
year to incarcerate drug offenders. The direct costs of building 
and maintaining enough prisons to house this growing population 
are rising at an astronomical rate. The costs, in terms of alternative 
social expenditures foregone and other types of criminals not 
imprisoned. are perhaps even more severe <A NAME="back17"></A><A HREF="#note17">(17)</A>. 
<P> 
Police have made about 750,000 arrests for violations of the drug 
laws during each of the last few years <A NAME="back18"></A><A HREF="#note18">(18)</A> 
. Slightly more than three quarters of these have been not for 
manufacturing or dealing drugs but solely for possession of an 
illicit drug, typically marijuana <A NAME="back19"></A><A HREF="#note19">(19)</A>. 
[Those arrested, it is worth noting, represent less than 2% of 
the 35 to 40 million Americans estimated to have illegally consumed 
a drug during each of the past years <A HREF="#note20">(20)</A>.] 
On the one hand, these arrests have clogged many urban criminal 
justice systems: in New York City, drug law violations in 1987 
accounted for more than 4096 of all felony indictments, up from 
25% in 1985 <A NAME="back21"></A><A HREF="#note21">(21)</A>; in 
Washington, D.C. the figure was 52% in 1986, up from 13% in 1981 
<A NAME="back22"></A><A HREF="#note22">(22)</A>. On the other 
hand they have distracted criminal justice officials from concentrating 
greater resources on violent offenses and property crimes. In 
many cities, urban law enforcement has become virtually synonymous 
with drug enforcement. The greatest beneficiaries of the drug 
laws are organized are unorganized drug traffickers. The criminalization 
of the drug market effectively imposes a de facto value-added 
tax that is enforced and occasionally augmented by the law enforcement 
establishment and collected by the drug traffickers. More than 
half of all organized crime revenues are believed to derive from 
the illicit drug business; estimates of the dollar value range 
between S10 and $50 billion per year <A NAME="back23"></A><A HREF="#note23">(23)</A>. 
By contrast, annual revenues from cigarette bootlegging, which 
persists principally because of differences among states in their 
cigarette tax rates, are estimated at between $200 million and 
$400 million <A HREF="#note23">(23)</A>. If the marijuana, cocaine, 
and heroin markets were legal state and federal governments would 
collect billions of dollars annually in tax revenues. Instead, 
they expend billions in what amounts to a subsidy of organized 
criminals. 
<P> 
The connection between drugs and crime is one that continues to 
resist coherent analysis both because cause and effect are so 
difficult to distinguish and because the role of the drug prohibition 
laws in causing and labeling &quot;drug-related&quot; crime is 
so often ignored. There are five possible connections between 
drugs and crime, at least three of which would be much diminished 
if the drug prohibition laws were repealed. First, the production, 
sale, purchase, and possession of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, 
and other strictly controlled and banned substances are crimes 
in and of themselves, which occur billions of times each year 
in the United States alone. In the absence of drug prohibition 
laws, these activities would largely cease to be considered crimes, 
selling drugs to children would, of course, continue to be criminalized 
and other evasions of government regulation of a legal market 
would continue to be prosecuted, but by and large the connection 
between drugs and crime that now accounts for all of the criminal 
justice costs noted above would be severed. 
<P> 
Second. many illicit drug users commit crimes such as robbery 
and burglary, as well as other vice crimes such as drug dealing, 
prostitution, and numbers running, to earn enough money to purchase 
cocaine, heroin, and other illicit drugs -- drugs that cost far 
more than alcohol and tobacco not because they cost much more 
to produce but because they are illegal <A NAME="back24"></A><A HREF="#note24">(24)</A>. 
Because legalization would inevitably lead to a reduction in the 
cost of the drugs that are now illicit, it would also invite a 
significant reduction in this drug-crime connection. At the same 
time, current methadone maintenance programs represent a limited 
form of drug legalization that attempts to break this connection 
between drugs and crime by providing an addictive opiate at little 
or no cost to addicts who might otherwise steal to support their 
illicit heroin habits. Despite their many limitations such programs 
have proven effective in reducing the criminal behavior and improving 
the lives of thousands of illicit drug addicts <A NAME="back25"></A><A HREF="#note25">(25)</A>; 
they need to be made more available, in part by adapting the types 
of outreach programs for addicts devised in the Netherlands <A NAME="back26"></A><A 
HREF="#note26">(26)</A>. 
Another alternative, the British system of prescribing not just 
oral methadone but also injectable heroin and methadone to addicts 
who use drugs intravenously, persists on a small scale even today 
despite continuing pressures against prescribing injectables. 
This too merits adoption in the United States, particularly if 
one accepts the assumption that the primary objective of drug 
policy should be to minimize the harms that drug abusers do to 
others <A NAME="back27"></A><A HREF="#note27">(27)</A>. 
<P> 
The third connection between drugs and crime is more coincidental 
than causal in nature. Although most illicit drug users do not 
engage in crime aside from their drug use, and although many criminals 
do not use or abuse illicit drugs or alcohol substance abuse clearly 
is much higher among criminals than among noncriminals. A 1986 
survey of state prison inmates found that 43% were using illegal 
drugs on a daily or near daily basis in the month before the committed 
the crime for which the were incarcerated; it also found that 
<STRONG>roughly one-half</STRONG> of the inmates who had used 
an illicit drug did not do so until after their first arrest <A NAME="back28"></A><A 
HREF="#note28">(28)</A>. 
Perhaps many of the same factors that lead individuals into lives 
of crime also push them in the direction of substance abuse. It 
is possible that legalization would diminish this connection by 
removing from the criminal subculture the lucrative opportunities 
that now derive from the illegality of the drug market. But it 
is also safe to assume that the criminal milieu will continue 
to claim a disproportionately large share of drug abusers regardless 
of whether or not drugs are legalized. 
<P> 
The fourth link between drugs and crime is the commission of violent 
and other crimes by people under the influence of illicit drags. 
It is this connection that seems to most infect the popular imagination. 
Clearly, some drugs do &quot;cause&quot; some people to commit 
crimes by reducing normal inhibitions, unleashing aggressive and 
other asocial tendencies, and lessening senses of responsibility. 
Cocaine, particularly in the form of crack, has gained such a 
reputation in recent years, just as heroin did in the 1960s and 
1970s and marijuana did in the years before that. Crack cocaine's 
reputation for inspiring violent behavior may well be more deserved 
than were those of marijuana and heroin, although the evidence 
has yet to substantiate media depiction <A NAME="back29"></A><A HREF="#note29">(29)</A>. 
No illicit drug, however, is as strongly associated with violent 
behavior as is alcohol. According to Justice Department statistics, 
54% of all jail inmates convicted of violent crimes in 1983 reported 
having used alcohol just prior to committing their of offense 
<A NAME="back30"></A><A HREF="#note30">(30)</A>. A 1986 survey 
of state prison inmates similarly found that most of those convicted 
of arson as well as violent crimes such as murder, involuntary 
manslaughter, and rape were far more likely to be have been under 
the influence of alcohol or both alcohol and illicit drugs, than 
under the influence of illicit drugs alone <A NAME="back31"></A><A HREF="#note31">(31)</A>. 
The impact of drug legalization on this aspect of the drug-crime 
connection is the most difficult to assess, largely because changes 
in the overall level and nature of drug consumption are so difficult 
to predict. 
<P> 
The fifth connection is the violent, intimidating, and corrupting 
behavior of the drug traffickers. In many Latin American countries, 
most notably Colombia, this connection virtually defines the drug 
problem. But even within the United States, drug trafficker violence 
is rapidly becoming a major concern of criminal justice officials 
and the public at large. The connection is not difficult to explain. 
Illegal markets tend to breed violence, both because they attract 
criminally minded and violent individuals and because participants 
in the market have no resort to legal institutions to resolve 
their disputes <A NAME="back32"></A><A HREF="#note32">(32)</A>. 
During Prohibition, violent struggles between bootlegging gangs 
and hijackings of booze-laden trucks and sea vessels were frequent 
and notorious occurrences. Today's equivalents are the booby traps 
that surround some marijuana fields, the pirates of the Caribbean 
looking to rob drug-laden vessels en route to the shores of the 
United States, the machine gun battles and executions of the more 
sordid drug gangs, and the generally high levels of violence that 
attend many illicit drug relationships; the victims include not 
just drug dealers but witnesses, bystanders, and law enforcement 
officials. Most law enforcement authorities agree that the dramatic 
increases in urban murder rates during the past few years can 
be explained almost entirely by the rise in drug dealer killings, 
mostly of one another <A NAME="back33"></A><A HREF="#note33">(33)</A>. 
At the same time, the powerful allure of illicit drug dollars 
is responsible for rising levels of corruption not just in Latin 
America and the Caribbean but also in federal, state, and local 
criminal justice systems throughout the United States <A NAME="back34"></A><A 
HREF="#note34">(34)</A>. 
A drug legalization strategy would certainly deal a severe blow 
to this link between drugs and crime. 
<P> 
Perhaps the most unfortunate victims of the drug prohibition policies 
have been the poor and law-abiding residents of urban ghettos. 
Those policies have proven largely futile in deterring large numbers 
of ghetto dwellers from becoming drug abusers but they do account 
for much of what ghetto residents identify as the drug problem. 
In many neighborhoods, it often seems to be the aggressive gun-toting 
drug dealers who upset law-abiding residents far more than the 
addicts nodding out in doorways <A NAME="back35"></A><A HREF="#note35">(35)</A>. 
Other residents, however, perceive the drug dealers as heroes 
and successful role models. In impoverished neighborhoods from 
Medellin and Rio de Janeiro to many leading U.S. cities, they 
often stand out as symbols of success to children who see no other 
options. At the same time, the increasingly harsh criminal penalties 
imposed on adult drug dealers have led to the widespread recruiting 
of juveniles by drug traffickers <A NAME="back36"></A><A HREF="#note36">(36)</A>. 
Where once children started dealing drugs only after they had 
been using them for a few years, today the sequence is often reversed. 
Many children start to use illegal drugs now only after they have 
worked for older drug dealers for a while. And the juvenile justice 
system offers no realistic options for dealing with this growing 
problem. 
<P> 
Perhaps the most difficult costs to evaluate are those that relate 
to the widespread defiance of the drug prohibition laws: the effects 
of labeling as criminals the tens of millions of people who use 
drugs illicitly, subjecting them to the risks of criminal sanction, 
and obliging many of those same people to enter into relationships 
with drug dealers (who may be criminals in many more senses of 
the word) in order to purchase their drugs; the cynicism that 
such laws generate toward other laws and the law in general; and 
the sense of hostility and suspicion that many otherwise law-abiding 
individuals fed toward law enforcement officials. It was costs 
such as these that strongly influenced many of Prohibition's more 
conservative opponents. 
<P> 
Among the most dangerous consequences of the drug laws are the 
harms that stem from the unregulated nature of illicit drug production 
and sale <A NAME="back37"></A><A HREF="#note37">(37)</A>. Many 
marijuana smokers are worse off for having smoked cannabis that 
was grown with dangerous fertilizers, sprayed with the herbicide 
paraquat, or mixed with more dangerous substances. Consumers of 
heroin and the various synthetic substances sold on the street 
face even more severe consequences, including fatal overdoses 
and poisonings from unexpectedly potent or impure drug supplies. 
In short, nothing resembling an underground Food and Drug Administration 
has arisen to impose quality control on the illegal drug market 
and provide users with accurate information on the drugs they 
consume. More often than not, the quality of a drug addict's life 
depends greatly on his or her access to reliable supplies. Drug 
enforcement operations that succeed in temporarily disrupting 
supply networks are thus a double-edged sword: they encourage 
some addicts to seek admission into drug treatment programs! but 
the oblige others to seek out new and hence less reliable suppliers, 
with the result that more, not fewer, drug-related emergencies 
and deaths occur. 
<P> 
Today, about 25% of all acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
cases in the United States and Europe, as well as the huge majority 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected heterosexuals, 
children, and infants, are believed to have contracted the dreaded 
disease directly or indirectly from illegal intravenous (IV) drug 
use <A NAME="back38"></A><A HREF="#note38">(38)</A>. In the New 
York metropolitan area, the prevalence of a seropositive test 
for HIV among illicit IV drug users is over 50% <A NAME="back39"></A><A 
HREF="#note39">(39)</A>. 
Reports have emerged of drug dealers beginning to provide clean 
syringes together with their illegal drugs <A NAME="back40"></A><A HREF="#note40">(40)</A>. 
In England, recent increases in the number of HIV-infected drug 
users have led to renewed support among drug treatment clinicians 
for providing IV heroin addicts with free supplies of injectable 
methadone and heroin; this reversal of the strong preference among 
many drug treatment clinicians since the early 1970s for oral 
methadone maintenance has been spearheaded by Philip Connell chairman 
of the Home Office Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs <A NAME="back41"></A><A 
HREF="#note41">(41)</A>. 
But even as governments in England, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Australia, the Netherlands, and elsewhere actively attempt to 
limit the spread of AIDS by and among drug users by removing restrictions 
on the sale of syringes and instituting free syringe exchange 
programs <A NAME="back42"></A><A HREF="#note42">(42)</A>, state 
and municipal ~ in the United States have resisted following suit, 
arguing, despite mounting evidence to the contrary <A NAME="back43"></A><A 
HREF="#note43">(43)</A>, 
that to do so would &quot;encourage&quot; or &quot;condone&quot; 
the use of illegal drugs <A NAME="back44"></A><A HREF="#note44">(44)</A>. 
Only in late 1988 did needle exchange programs begin emerging 
in U.S. cities, typically at the initiative of nongovernmental 
organizations. By mid-1989, programs were under way or close to 
being implemented in New York City; Tacoma, Washington; Boulder, 
Colorado; and Portland, Oregon <A NAME="back45"></A><A HREF="#note45">(45)</A>. 
At the same time, drug treatment programs remain notoriously underfunded, 
turning away tens of thousands of addicts seeking help even as 
increasing billions of dollars are spent to arrest, prosecute, 
and imprison illegal drug sellers and users. 
<P> 
Other costs of current drug prohibition policies include the restrictions 
on using the illicit drugs for legitimate medical purposes <A NAME="back46"></A><A 
HREF="#note46">(46)</A>. 
Marijuana has proven useful in alleviating pain in some victims 
of multiple sclerosis, is particularly effective in reducing the 
nausea that accompanies chemotherapy, and may well prove effective 
in the treatment of glaucoma <A HREF="#note47">(47</A>, <A NAME="back48"></A><A 
HREF="#note48">48</A>, 
<A HREF="#note49">49)</A>; in September 1988, the administrative 
law judge of the Drug Enforcement Administration accordingly recommended 
that marijuana be made legally available for such purposes <A HREF="#note49">(49)</A>, 
although the agency head has yet to approve the change. Heroin 
has proven highly effective in helping patients to deal with severe 
pain; some researchers have found it more effective than morphine 
and other opiates in treating pain in some patients <A NAME="back50"></A><A 
HREF="#note50">(50)</A>. 
<P> 
It is legally prescribed for such purposes in Britain (SO) and 
Canada <A NAME="back51"></A><A HREF="#note51">(51)</A>. The same 
may be true of cocaine, which continues to be used by some doctors 
in the United States to treat pain despite recently imposed bans 
<A NAME="back52"></A><A HREF="#note52">(52)</A>. The psychedelic 
drugs, such as LSD (dlysergic acid dierhylamide), peyote, and 
MDMA (known as Ecstasy) have shown promise in aiding psychotherapy 
and in reducing tension, depression, pain, and fear of death in 
the terminally ill <A HREF="#note53">(53)</A>; the also have demonstrated 
some potential as yet unconfirmed, to aid in the treatment of 
alcoholism <A NAME="back47"></A><A HREF="#note47">(47</A>, <A HREF="#note53">53)</A>. 
Current drug laws and policies, however, greatly hamper the efforts 
of researchers to investigate these and other potential medical 
uses of illegal drugs; they make it virtually impossible for any 
of the illegal drugs, particularly those in Schedule I, to be 
legally provided to those who t would benefit from them; and they 
contribute strongly to the widely acknowledged undertreatment 
of pain by the medical profession in the United States <A NAME="back54"></A><A 
HREF="#note54">(54)</A>. 
<P> 
Among the strongest arguments in favor of legalization are the 
moral ones. On the one hand, the standard refrain regarding the 
immorality of drug use crumbles in the face of most Americans' 
tolerance for alcohol and tobacco use. Only the Mormons and a 
few other like-minded sects, who regard as immoral any intake 
of substances to alter one's state of consciousness or otherwise 
cause pleasure, are consistent in this respect; they eschew not 
just the illicit drugs but also alcohol tobacco, caffeinated coffee 
and tea, and even chocolate. &quot;Moral&quot; condemnation by 
the majority of Americans of some substances and not others is 
little more than a transient prejudice in favor of some drugs 
and against others. 
<P> 
On the other hand, drug enforcement involves its own immoralities. 
Because drug law violations do not create victims with an interest 
in notifying the police, drug enforcement agents must rely heavily 
on undercover operations, electronic surveillance, and information 
provided by informants. In 1986, almost half of the 754 court-authorized 
orders for wiretaps in the United States involved drug trafficking 
investigations <A NAME="back55"></A><A HREF="#note55">(55)</A>. 
These techniques are certainly indispensable to effective law 
enforcement, but they are also among the least desirable of the 
tools available to police. The same is true of drug testing. It 
may be useful and even necessary for determining liability in 
accidents, but it also threatens and undermines the right of privacy 
to which many Americans believe the are morally and constitutionally 
entitled. There are good reasons for requiring that such measures 
be used sparingly. 
<P> 
Equally disturbing are the increasingly vocal calls for people 
to inform not just on drug dealers but on neighbors, friends, 
and even family members who use illicit drugs. Intolerance of 
illicit drug use and users is heralded not merely as an indispensable 
ingredient in the war against drugs but as a mark of good citizenship. 
Certainly every society requires citizens to assist in the enforcement 
of criminal laws. But societies, particularly democratic and pluralist 
ones, also rely strongly on an ethic of tolerance toward those 
who are different but do no harm to others. Overzealous enforcement 
of the drug laws risks undermining that ethic and propagating 
in its place a society of informants. Indeed, enforcement of drug 
laws makes a mockery of an essential principle of a free society, 
that those who do no harm to others should not be harmed by others, 
and particularly not by the state. Most of the nearly 40 million 
Americans who illegally consume drugs each year do no direct harm 
to anyone else; indeed, most do relatively little harm even to 
themselves. Directing criminal and other sanctions at them, and 
rationalizing the justice of such sanctions, may well represent 
the greatest societal cost of our current drug prohibition system.

</H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#top" >(Top of file)</A> 
<P> 
Repealing the drug prohibition laws clearly promises tremendous 
advantages. Between reduced government expenditures on enforcing 
drug laws and new tax revenue from legal drug production and sales, 
public treasuries would enjoy a net benefit of at least $10 billion 
per year and possibly much more; thus billions in new revenues 
would be available, and ideally targeted, for funding much needed 
drug treatment programs as well as the types of social and educational 
programs that often prove most effective in creating incentives 
for children not to use drugs. The quality of urban life would 
rise significantly. Homicide rates would decline. So would robbery 
and burglary rates . Organized criminal groups, particularly the 
up and coming ones that have yet to diversify into nondrug areas, 
would be dealt a devastating setback. The police, prosecutors, 
would focus their resources on combating the types of crimes that 
people cannot walk away from. More ghetto residents would turn 
their backs on criminal careers and seek legitimate opportunities 
instead. And the health and quality of life users and even drug 
abusers would improve significantly. Internationally, U.S. foreign 
policymakers would get on with more important and realistic objectives, 
and foreign governments would reclaim the authority that they 
have lost to drug traffickers. 
<P> 
The impact of legalization on the nature and level of consumption 
of those drugs that are currently illegal is impossible to predict 
with any accuracy. On the one hand, legalization implies greater 
availability, lower prices, and the elimination (particularly 
for adults) of the deterrent power of the criminal sanction all 
of which would suggest higher levels of use. Indeed, some fear 
that the extent of drug abuse and its attendant costs would rise 
to those currently associated with alcohol and tobacco <A NAME="back59"></A><A 
HREF="#note59">(59)</A>. 
On the other hand, there are many reasons to doubt that a well-designed 
and implemented policy of controlled drug legalization would yield 
such costly consequences. 
<P> 
The logic of legalization depends in part upon two assumptions: 
that most illegal drugs are not as dangerous as is commonly believed; 
and that those types of drugs and methods of consumption that 
are most risky are unlikely to prove appealing to many people 
precisely because they are so obviously dangerous. Consider marijuana. 
Among the roughly 60 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, 
not one has died from a marijuana overdose <A NAME="back49"></A><A HREF="#note49">(49)</A>, 
a striking contrast with alcohol which is involved in approximately 
10,000 overdose deaths annually, half in combination with other 
drugs <A NAME="back57"></A><A HREF="#note57">(57)</A>. Although 
there are good health reasons for people not to smoke marijuana 
daily, and for children, pregnant women, and some others not to 
smoke at all, there still appears to be little evidence that occasional 
marijuana consumption does much harm at all. Certainly, it is 
not healthy to inhale marijuana smoke into one's lungs; indeed, 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has declared that 
marijuana smoke contains more cancer-causing agents than is found 
in tobacco smoke.&quot; <A NAME="back60"></A><A HREF="#note60">(60)</A>. 
On the other hand, the number of &quot;joints&quot; smoked by 
all but a very small percentage of marijuana smokers is a tiny 
traction of the 20 cigarettes a day smoked by the average cigarette 
smoker; indeed the average may be closer to one or two joints 
per week than one or two per day. Note that the NIDA defines a 
&quot;heavy&quot; marijuana smoker as one who consumes at least 
two joints &quot;daily.&quot; A heavy tobacco smoker, by contrast 
smokes about 40 cigarettes per day. 
<P> 
Nor is marijuana strongly identified as a dependence-causing substance. 
A 1982 survey of marijuana use by young adults (18 to 25 years) 
found that 64% had had marijuana at least once, that 42% had used 
it at least ten times, and that 27% had smoked in the last month. 
It also found that 21% had passed through a period during which 
they smoked &quot;daily&quot; (defined as 20 or more days per 
month) but that only one-third of those currently smoked daily 
and only one-fifth (or about 4% of all young adults) could be 
described as heavy daily users (averaging two or more joints per 
day) <A NAME="back61"></A><A HREF="#note61">(61)</A>. This suggests 
in part that daily marijuana use is typically a phase through 
which people pass, after which their use becomes more moderate. 
By contrast, almost 20% of high school seniors smoke cigarettes 
daily. 
<P> 
The dangers associated with cocaine, heroin, the hallucinogens, 
and other illicit substances are greater than those posed by marijuana 
but not nearly so great as many people seem to think. Consider 
the case of cocaine. In 1986 reported that over 20 million Americans 
had tried cocaine, that 12.2 million had consumed it at least 
once during 1985, and that nearly 5.8 million had used it within 
the past month. Among 18-to 25-year-olds, 8.2 million had tried 
cocaine; 5.3 million had used it within the past year; 2.5 million 
had used it within the past month; and 250,000 had used it on 
the average weekly <A NAME="back20"></A><A HREF="#note20">(20)</A>. 
One could extrapolate from these figures that a quarter of a million 
young Americans are potential problem users. But one could also 
conclude that only 3% of those 18- to 25 year-olds who had ever 
had the drug fell into that category, and that only 1096 of those 
who had used cocaine monthly were at risk (The NIDA survey did 
not, it should be noted, include persons residing in military 
or student dormitories, prison inmates, or the homeless). 
<P> 
All of this is not to say that cocaine is not a potentially dangerous 
drag, especially when it is injected, smoked in the form of &quot;crack,&quot; 
or consumed in tandem with other powerful substances. Clearly, 
many tens of thousands of Americans have suffered severely from 
their abuse of cocaine and a tiny fraction have died. But there 
is also overwhelming evidence that most users of cocaine do not 
get into trouble with the drag. So much of the media attention 
has focused on the relatively small percentage of cocaine users 
who become addicted that the popular perception of how most people 
use cocaine has become badly distorted. In one survey of high 
school seniors' drug use, the researchers questioned those who 
had used cocaine recently whether the had ever tried to stop using 
cocaine and found that the could not stop. Only 3.8% responded 
affirmatively, in contrast to the almost 7% of marijuana smokers 
who said the had tried to stop and found the could not, and the 
18% of cigarette smokers who answered similarly <A NAME="back62"></A><A 
HREF="#note62">(62)</A>. 
Although a survey of crack users and cocaine injectors surely 
would reveal a higher proportion of addicts, evidence such as 
this suggests that only a small percentage of people who snort 
cocaine end up having a problem with it. In this respect, most 
people differ from captive monkeys, who have demonstrated in tests 
that the will starve themselves to death if provided with unlimited 
cocaine <A NAME="back63"></A><A HREF="#note63">(63)</A>. 
<P> 
With respect to the hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybic mushrooms, 
their potential for addiction is virtually nil. The dangers arise 
primarily from using them irresponsibly on individual occasions 
<A NAME="back53"></A><A HREF="#note53">(53)</A>. Although many 
of those who have used hallucinogens have experienced 'bad trips,' 
far more have reported positive experiences and very few have 
suffered any long-term harm <A HREF="#note53">(53)</A>. As for 
the great assortment of stimulants, depressants, and tranquilizers 
produced illegally or diverted from licit channels, each evidences 
varying capacities to create addiction, harm the user, or be used 
safely. 
<P> 
Until recently, no drugs were regarded with as much horror as 
the opiates, and in particular heroin. As with most drugs, it 
can be eaten, snorted, smoked or injected. The custom among most 
Americans, unfortunately, is the last of these options, although 
the growing fear of AIDS appears to be causing a shift among younger 
addicts toward intranasal ingestion <A NAME="back64"></A><A HREF="#note64">(64)</A>. 
There is no question that heroin is potentially highly addictive, 
perhaps as addictive as nicotine. But despite the popular association 
of heroin use with the most down-and-out inhabitants of urban 
ghettos, heroin causes relatively little physical harm to the 
human body. Consumed on an occasional or regular basis under sanitary 
conditions, its worst side effect, apart from the fact of being 
addicted, is constipation <A NAME="back65"></A><A HREF="#note65">(65)</A>. 
That is one reason why many doctors in early 20th-century America 
saw opiate addiction as preferable to alcoholism and prescribed 
the former as treatment for the latter where abstinence did not 
seem a realistic option <A NAME="back66"></A><A HREF="#note66">(66)</A>, 
<A NAME="back67"></A><A HREF="#note67">(67)</A>. 
<P> 
It is both insightful and important to think about the illicit 
drugs as we do about alcohol and tobacco. Like tobacco, some illicit 
substances are highly addictive but can be consumed on a regular 
basis for decades without any demonstrable harm. Like alcohol, 
many of the substances can be, and are used by most consumers 
in moderation, with little in the wan of harmful effects; but 
like alcohol the also lend themselves to abuse by a minority of 
users who become addicted or otherwise harm themselves or others 
as a consequence. And like both the legal substances, the psychoactive 
effects of each of the illegal drugs vary greatly from one person 
to another. To be sure, the pharmacology of the substance is importance, 
as is its purity and the manner in which it is consumed. But much 
also depends upon not just the physiology and psychology of the 
consumer but his expectations regarding the drug, his social milieu, 
and the broader cultural environment, what Harvard University 
psychiatrist Norman Zinberg called the &quot;set and setting&quot; 
of the drug <A NAME="back68"></A><A HREF="#note68">(68)</A>. It 
is factors such as these that might change dramatically, albeit 
in indeterminate ways, use the illicit drugs made legally available. 
<P> 
It is thus impossible to predict whether or not legalization would 
lead to much greater levels of drug abuse. The lessons that can 
be drawn from other societies are missed. China's experience with 
the British opium pushers of the 19th century, when millions reportedly 
became addicted to the drug, offers one worst-case scenario. The 
devastation of many native American tribes <STRONG>by alcohol</STRONG> 
presents another. On the other hand, the decriminalization of 
marijuana by 11 states in the United States during the mid-1970s 
does not appear to have led to increases in marijuana consumption 
<A NAME="back69"></A><A HREF="#note69">(69)</A>. In the Netherlands, 
which went even further in decriminalizing cannabis during the 
1970s, consumption has actually declined significantly; in 1976, 
3% of 15- and 16-year-olds and 10% of 17- and 18-year olds used 
cannabis occasionally; by 1985, the percentages had declined to 
2 and 6%, respectively <A NAME="back70"></A><A HREF="#note70">(70)</A>. 
The policy has succeeded, as the government intended, in making 
drug use boring. Finally, Late 19th-century America is an example 
of a society in which there were almost no drug laws or even drug 
regulations but levels of drug use were about what the are today 
<A NAME="back71"></A><A HREF="#note71">(71)</A>. Drug abuse was 
regarded as a relatively serious problem, but the criminal justice 
system was not regarded as part of the solution <A NAME="back72"></A><A 
HREF="#note72">(72)</A>. 
<P> 
There are however, strong reasons to believe that none of the 
currently illicit substances would become as popular as alcohol 
or tobacco even if they were legalized. Alcohol has long been 
the principal intoxicant in most societies, including many in 
which other substances have been legally available. Presumably, 
its diverse properties account for its popularity: it quenches 
thirst, goes well with food, often pleases the palate, promotes 
appetite as well as sociability, and so on. The widespread use 
of tobacco probably stems not just from its powerful addictive 
qualities but from the fact that its psychoactive effects are 
sufficiently subtle that cigarettes can be integrated with most 
other human activities. None of the illicit substances now popular 
in the United States share either of these qualities to the same 
extent, nor is it likely that they would acquire them if they 
were legalized. Moreover, none of the illicit substances can compete 
with alcohol's special place in American culture and history, 
one that it retained even during Prohibition. 
<P> 
Much of the damage caused by illegal drugs today stems from their 
consumption in particularly potent and dangerous ways. There is 
good reason to doubt that many Americans would inject cocaine 
or heroin into their veins even if given the chance to do so legally. 
And just as the dramatic growth in the heroin-consuming population 
during the 1960s leveled off for reasons apparently having littleto 
do with law enforcement, so we can expect, if it has not already 
occurred, a leveling off in the number of people smoking crack. 
<P> 
Perhaps the most reassuring reason for believing that repeal of 
the drug prohibition laws will not lead to tremendous increases 
in drug abuse levels is the fact that we have learned something 
from our past experiences with alcohol and tobacco abuse. We now 
know, for instance, that consumption taxes are an effective method 
for limiting consumption rates and related costs, especially among 
young people <A NAME="back73"></A><A HREF="#note73">(73)</A>. 
Substantial evidence also suggests that restrictions and bans 
on advertising, as well as promotion of negative advertising, 
can make a difference <A NAME="back74"></A><A HREF="#note74">(74)</A>. 
The same seems to be true of other government measures, including 
restrictions on time and place of sale <A NAME="back75"></A><A HREF="#note75">(75)</A>, 
bans on vending machines, prohibitions of consumption in public 
places, packaging requirements, mandated adjustments in insurance 
polices, crackdowns on driving while under the influence <A NAME="back76"></A><A 
HREF="#note76">(76)</A>, 
and laws holding bartenders and hosts responsible for the drinking 
of customers and guests. There is even some evidence that some 
education programs about the dangers of cigarette smoking have 
deterred many children from beginning to smoke <A NAME="back77"></A><A 
HREF="#note77">(77)</A>. 
At the same time, we also have come to recognize the great harms 
that can result when drug control policies are undermined by powerful 
lobbies such as those that now block efforts to lessen the harms 
caused by abuse of alcohol and tobacco. 
<P> 
Legalization thus affords far greater opportunities to control 
drug use and abuse than do current criminalization policies. The 
current strategy is one in which the type, price, purity, and 
potency of illicit drugs, as well as the participants in the business, 
are largely estimated by drug dealers, the peculiar competitive 
dynamics of an illicit market, and the perverse interplay of drug 
enforcement strategies and drug trafficking tactics. During the 
past decade, for instance, the average retail purities of cocaine 
and heroin have increased dramatically, the wholesale prices have 
dropped greatly, the number of children involved in drug dealing 
has risen, and crack has become readily and cheaply available 
in a growing number of American cites <A HREF="#note8">(8)</A>. 
By contrast, marijuana has become relatively scarcer and more 
expensive, in part because it is far more vulnerable to drug enforcement 
efforts than are cocaine or heroin; the result has been to induce 
both dealers and users away from the relatively safer marijuana 
and toward the relatively more dangerous cocaine <A NAME="back8"></A><A 
HREF="#note8">(8)</A>. 
Also by contrast while the average potency of most illicit substances 
has increased during the 1980s, that of most legal psychoactive 
substances has been declining. Motivated in good part by health 
concerns , Americans are switching from hard liquor to beer and 
wine from high tar and nicotine cigarettes to lower tar and nicotine 
cigarettes as well as smokeless tobaccos and nicotine chewing 
gums, and even from caffeinated to decaffeinated coffees, teas 
and sodas. It is quite possible that these diverging trends are 
less a reflection of the nature of the drug than their legal status. 
<P> 
A drug control policy based predominantly on approaches other 
than criminal justice thus offers a number of significant advantages 
over the current criminal justice focus in controlling drug use 
and abuse. It shifts control of production, distribution, and, 
to a lesser extent, consumption out of the hands of criminals 
and into the hands of government and government licensees. It 
affords consumers the opportunity to make far more informed decisions 
about the drugs they buy than is currently the case. It dramatically 
lessens the likelihood that drug consumers will be harmed by impure, 
unexpectedly potent, or misidentified drugs. It corrects the hypocritical 
and dangerous message that alcohol and tobacco are somehow safer 
than many illicit drugs. It reduces by billions of dollars annually 
government expenditures on drug enforcement and simultaneously 
raises <STRONG>additional billions</STRONG> in tax revenues. And 
it allows government the opportunity to shape consumption patterns 
toward relatively safer psychoactive substances and modes of consumption. 
<P> 
Toward the end of the 1920s, when the debate over repealing Prohibition 
rapidly gained momentum. numerous scholars, journalists, and private 
and government commissions undertook thorough evaluations of Prohibition 
and the potential alternatives. Prominent among these were the 
Wickersham Commission appointed by President Herbert Hoover and 
the study of alcohol regulation abroad directed by the leading 
police scholar in the United States, Raymond Fosdick, and commissioned 
by John D. Rockefeller <A NAME="back78"></A><A HREF="#note78">(78)</A>. 
These efforts examined the successes and failings of Prohibition 
in the United States and evaluated the wide array of alternative 
regimes for controlling the distribution and use of beer, wine, 
and liquor. The played a major risk in stimulating the public 
reevaluation of Prohibition and in envisioning alternatives. Precisely 
the same sorts of efforts are required today. 
<P> 
The controlled drug legalization option is not an all-or-nothing 
alternative to current policies. Indeed, political realities ensure 
that any shift toward legalization will evolve gradually, with 
ample opportunity to halt, reevaluate, and redirect drug policies 
that begin to prove too costly or counterproductive. The federal 
government need not play the leading role in devising alternatives; 
it need only clear the way to allow state and local governments 
the legal power to implement their own drug legalization policies. 
The first steps are relatively risk-free: legalization of marijuana, 
easier availability of illegal and strictly controlled drugs for 
treatment of pain and other medical purposes, tougher tobacco 
and alcohol control policies, and a broader and more available 
array of drug treatment programs. 
<P> 
Remedying the drug-related ills of America's ghettos requires 
more radical steps. The risks of a more far-reaching policy of 
controlled drug legalization increased availability, lower prices, 
and removal of the deterrent power of the criminal sanction are 
relatively less in the ghettos than in most other parts of the 
United States in good part because drug availability is already 
so high, prices so low, and the criminal sanction so ineffective 
in deterring illicit drug use that legalization can hardly worsen 
the situation. On the other hand, legalization would yield its 
greatest benefits in the ghettos, where it would sever much of 
the drug-crime connection, seize the market away from criminals, 
deglorify involvement in the illicit drug business, help redirect 
the work ethic from illegitimate to legitimate employment opportunities, 
help stem the transmission of AIDS by IV drug users, and significantly 
improve the safety, health, and well-being of those who do use 
and abuse drugs. Simply stated, legalizing cocaine. heroin, and 
other relatively dangerous drugs may well be the only way to reverse 
the destructive impact of drugs and current drug policies in the 
ghettos. 
<P> 
There is no question that legalization is a risky policy, one 
that may indeed lead to an increase in the number of people who 
abuse drugs. But that risk is by no means a certainty. At the 
same time, current drug control policies are showing little progress 
and now proposals promise only to be more costly and more repressive. 
We know that repealing the drug prohibition laws would eliminate 
or greatly reduce many of the ills that people commonly identify 
as part and parcel of the &quot;drug problem.&quot; Yet that option 
is repeatedly and vociferously dismissed without any attempt to 
evaluate it openly and objectively. The past 20 years have demonstrated 
that a drug policy shaped by rhetoric and fear-mongering can only 
lead to our current disaster. Unless we are willing To honestly 
evaluate all our options, including various legalization strategies, 
there is a good chance that we will never identify the best solutions 
for our drug problems.<p>

United States--a must for the European reader."<br> 
	--Albin Eser, Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law, Freiburg</p> 
 
<p>"I am extremely impressed with Professor Nadelmann's work. This is a rich and detailed account of a 
neglected chapter in the history of criminal justice and in American history generally. I found it 
extraordinarily illuminating. I don't think any student of social history, diplomatic history, or legal history 
can ignore this book, which sheds so much light on a wide variety of important policy issues, including, 
very notably, drug enforcement policy. It deserves a wide readership."<br> 
	--Lawrence M. Friedman, Stanford Law School</p> 
 
<p>"Nadelmann's book, <i>Cops Across Borders</i>, opens broad new ground both in the study of 
policing and in the field of international relations. Combining the two, he provides for the first time a 
picture of the newest frontier of U.S. law enforcement. The book is a very valuable addition to two fields 
of study."<br> 
	--Philip B. Heymann, U.S. Deputy Attorney General</p> 
 
<p>"Nadelmann has produced a remarkable piece of scholarship. Blending the study of international 
relations and criminal justice within a long-term historical framework, <i>Cops Across Borders</i> casts 
important new light on U.S. foreign policy, the war on drugs, and likely claims to U.S. hegemony in the 
emerging post-Cold War international arena."<br> 
	--Peter H. Smith, University of California, San Diego</p> 
 
<p><i><b>Cops Across Borders</b></i> is the first book to examine the intersection of U.S. foreign 
policy and U.S. criminal justice. Drawing on interviews with nearly 300 U.S. and foreign law enforcement 
officials in nineteen countries as well as extensive historical and contemporary materials, Ethan Nadelmann 
examines how and why U.S. law enforcement officials have extended their efforts beyond American 
borders, how they have dealt with the challenges confronting them, and why their efforts have proved more 
or less successful.</p>

<p>Entry by Ethan A. Nadelmann</p><hr>   
<h2>DRUGS, PROHIBITION OF:</h2>   
   
<p>The desire of man to alter his state of consciousness is one of  the few constants in human history; so   
too is the use of psychoactive substances to accomplish this goal. Alcohol, tobacco, opium, cannabis,   
coffee, and coca each have been consumed in different societies, and in various forms, for many hundreds   
or even thousands of years. Each has been used for medicinal, ritual. and recreational purposes and has   
been perceived as both a great evil and a great good. Each has been subject to government controls and   
sanctions ranging from the death penalty to taxation, zoning, or other regulatory measures. And each has   
been widely available in entirely unregulated markets. Before the 20th century, no global patterns were   
discernible in the norms and legal sanctions governing the trade and use of any of these substances.

<B>I.  PROGRAM SUMMARY</B><BR>

<I>The International Science Foundation has established a substantial
logistical infrastructure in the former Soviet Union and the Baltic
countries (FSU) to safely distribute over $150 million worth of donated
funds and equipment.  Through the <B>Grant Assistance Program (GAP)</B>,
ISF is now offering its grant management services to the public. 
<B>GAP</B> can help facilitate non-commercial, civilian project, providing
donors with exemptions of up to 40% in taxes and duties.  ISF seeks to
eliminate the numerous roadblocks and prohibitive costs donors face when
implementing their charitable activities in the FSU.  Donors are now
benefiting from ISF's proven international banking, shipping, and
administrative network to ensure that charitable assistance from the West
will have the greatest possible impact.</I>

<P>

<B>II.  ABOUT THE <A HREF="isf.html">INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE
FOUNDATION</A></B><BR>

George Soros established the International Science Foundation (ISF) in 
December 1992 to help scientists of the FSU conduct basic research in the 
natural sciences during the current economic crisis and to encourage new 
approaches to funding and managing scientific research in the region.  
The ISF manages its own programs, which provide direct support to 
individual scientists, research institutes and organizations.  In 1993, 
ISF's Emergency Grants Program quickly delivered o ver $13 million to 
26,145 scientists in the form of $500 grants.  Under the Long Term 
Research Grants Program, ISF provided funding for 3,554 major research 
projects carried out by more than 15,000 scientists in 1994-95.  Current 
programs focus on infrastructural support, such as supplying libraries 
with scientific and technical journals, bringing Internet access to 
institutes, and providing travel grants to Russian participants at 
international conferences.  ISF operations in Russia are conducted 
through its Moscow office and branch offices in St. Petersburg, 
Novosibirsk, Vladivostok, and Yekaterinburg.<P>

<B>III.  PROGRAM CRITERIA</B><BR>
1.  Applications in support of military research, defense conversion or
commercial enterprise will not be accepted.<BR>
2.  Only third-party grants and donations of <B>$1,500 or more</B> in 
value.<BR>
3.  Geographical region covered: Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Lithuania, Russia, and Ukraine.<BR>
4.  ISF should receive applications <B>no later than six
(6) weeks prior to the desired starting date of the project.</B>

<P>

<B>IV.  WHAT TO SUBMIT:</B><BR>
a.  Sections I & II: <B>Signatures</B> are required from both the Donor and 
<I>each</I> FSU recipient institution (pages 1-2).<BR>
b.  Section III:  Attach a brief <B>background statement</B> and any 
<B>contracts</B> or <b>agreements</B> connected with your project (page 
3).<BR>
c.  Section IV: Enter transfer amounts for each GAP service
requested and calculate ISF's administrative fee (page 4).<BR>
d.  Sections V-VIII: Submit one form for each service you plan to use 
(pages 5-8).<P>

<B>V.  REVIEW AND ACTIVATION</B> 

Applications will be reviewed for conformance to program guidelines by an
in-house review committee.  Projects supporting activity in Russia will
also be subject to review by the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy
of the Russian Federation to confirm its tax-exempt status.  Donors will
be informed of the results by the ISF-New York office within six weeks
from the date the application was received by ISF. <P>

Upon approval, ISF staff in New York will assign a grant number to the
Donor and create a budget account.  Each FSU/Baltic Recipient will be
contacted by the closest ISF regional office and receive a grant award
package, which includes the following items:  a) award letter informing
the Recipient of the direct cost award; b) instruction sheet outlining
procedures for claiming the award; c) award contract describing the
relationship between the Recipient and the ISF grant administrator; d)
request forms for quarterly individual financial support (ISF Forms 200);
e) purchase requisitions for computer or laboratory (ISF Form 500);
f)instructions for local purchases (ISF Guarantee Letter).<P>

In addition, the Recipient will submit a budget form, which includes line
items for payroll, utility bills, equipment purchases, and travel
expenses.  This budget is kept on file at an ISF field office and is also
transferred electronically to the ISF's accounting office at the Public
Health Research Institute (PHRI) in New York, where it is associated with
the appropriate grant number.<P>

<B>V.  PROPER CREDIT GIVEN:</B> As a regular provider of services, ISF
does not claim any responsibility or credit for the projects it
administers.  The Public Relations division of ISF will make every effort
to see that proper credit is given for the scientific, educational and
charitable activities ISF handles.<P>

<B>VI.  WAIVER OF LIABILITY:</B>  ISF shall have no liability, at any 
time or for any reason, to any Donor Organization, any recipient or any 
other entity or person for any loss, damage or injury to such Donor 
Organization, recipient or other entity or person as a result of any act 
or omission of ISF or its agents, employees, successors and assigns 
pursuant to the Grant Assistance Program.  If any claim or award shall 
be made against ISF or its agents, employees, successors and assigns for 
any such loss, damage, or injury, the Donor Organization and the 
recipient agree to, and do, indemnify ISF and its agents, employees, 
successors and assigns against and hold them harmless from any liability 
with respect thereto (including attorneys' fees and costs incurred in 
connection with the defense of any such claim or award).<P>

The Regional Internet Program is a program of the Open Society 
Institute-New York (OSI-New York), a private foundation that promotes the 
development of open societies around the world by conducting its own 
programs and by awarding grants to individuals and others organizations. 
OSI-New York develops and implements a variety of domestic and 
international programs in the areas of educational, social, and legal 
reform, and encourages public debate and policy alternatives in complex 
and often controversial fields. 
<p>
OSI-New York is part of an informal network of autonomous foundations and 
other organizations in 25 countries, including Albania, Belarus, 
Bulgaria, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Georgia, Haiti, Hungary, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South 
Africa, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia, as well as the United States. 
<p>
Linked together in an informal network, these foundations, created by 
philanthropist George Soros, all share the common mission of supporting 
the development of open societies. To this end, they operate and support 
an array of programs in education, media, health care, Internet and 
e-mail communication, human rights, arts and culture, and economic and 
legal reform. OSI-NY assists these foundations by creating programs on 
common issues, such as the Regional Internet Program,  and by providing 
technical and administrative support. <p>

Open society is a form of social organization based on the recognition 
that nobody has a monopoly on the truth, that different people have 
different views and different interests, and that there is a need for 
institutions to protect the rights of all people to allow them to live 
together in peace. An open society is characterized by a reliance on the 
rule of law, the existence of a democratically elected government, a 
diverse and vigorous civil society, and respect for minorities and 
minority opinions.

The Regional Internet Program (RIP) supports projects that develop user 
demand for e-mail and Internet services in Central & Eastern Europe and 
the former Soviet Union. The Program identifies niche markets within a 
particular country where Internet access would be valuable to the public 
but is unavailable or not supported by any other entity. The 
beneficiaries of the Regional Internet Programs are public institutions 
which can reach a wide range of individuals: local academic and research 
institutions, libraries, museums, secondary schools, medical facilities, 
non-Governmental organizations , and the independent media. 
<p>
The time period from project inception to completion is usually three to 
four months. Projects costs an average of $100,000. Project funding may 
involve telecommunications equipment, loans, various telecommunication 
fees, and subsidies to cover the cost of data transmission.
<p>
The Regional Internet Program stimulates development of the entire local 
Internet market. Once users are exposed to the Internet other funding 
sources or government entities have been engaged to supply large scale 
infrastructure development. Additionally, the Regional Internet Program 
has successfully deployed many alternative technologies including 
satellite, microwave, cable TV, spread spectrum radio modems, and ham 
radio to provide users with Internet connectivity.

The University Internet Center program is part OSI's ongoing effort to 
support the intellectual community in Russia. The program has a budget of 
$130 million to be disbursed over five years. The program's objective is 
to provide Russian regional universities with resources to fulfill their 
role as independent centers of learning, creativity, and social activism 
in the local arena. The program will be carried out in collaboration with 
the government of the Russian Federation, which has pledged $30 million 
for Internet connectivity for the centers.  Participation in the projects 
by secondary schools, institutions of art and culture, independent media, 
and non-governmental organizations will also be encouraged. Thirty-two 
University Internet Centers will be included in the program. The program 
is also intended to foster relationships between the universities and 
local communities.  The first two centers opened June 10, 1996 at 
Yaroslavl State University, in Yaroslavl and Novosibirsk State 
University, in Novosibirsk.

The Advisory Board of the Internet Outreach Program will help define
program priorities within a given set of guidelines, influencing how the
<a href="ioprip.html">Regional Internet Program</a> allocates resources
and helping to review past and present projects. The size and composition
of the Board will vary over time, allowing for the creation of new
partnerships and changes in program emphasis. As a forum consisting of
representatives from various backgrounds with diverse experience, the
Board will encompass a range of expertise from the corporate, nonprofit,
policy making and networking spheres. Board members will create smaller
working groups to carry out specific tasks. The Advisory Board and working
groups can rely on the Regional Internet Program staff for support. 
<p>
The Advisory Board's most important functions will be:
<ul>
<li>To maintain a prominent public profile for the Internet Outreach 
Program and the projects it supports,

<li>To create opportunities for coordination of the Regional Internet 
Program's development efforts with the work of other groups, especially 
foundations and corporate donors. This coordination effort will lead to 
important initiatives that could not have been carried out by Internet 
Outreach Program participants acting independently,

<li>To communicate the Regional Internet Program's philosophy and 
characterize the projects the Internet Outreach Program wishes to assist,

<li>To recommend new categories of projects, identify specific problems or 
needs, and suggest solutions,

<li>To set clear rules on issues such as ownership of permanent 
infrastructure, funding procedures, and fee-for-service,

<li>To suggest regional priorities in order to strengthen collaboration 
within the foundation network.

<b>T</b>he OSI Regional Internet Program began in earnest in 1994.
Prior to that there were grants related to e-mail connectivity provided on
an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the local foundations. The
<a href="/isf.html"><b>ISF</b></a> also developed an Internet
connectivity  program for the NIS focusing on infrastructural development (i.e.
extending the network infrastructure that facilitates Internet connectivity in 
the region). The first official year of the OSI Internet program (1994) was
primarily spent funding local initiatives, developing strategy and making
contacts with funders and networking specialists throughout the world. In
1996, with a strategy and an abundance of contacts in place, the program
has matured and developed many avenues of funding opportunities.<p>
In 1995, the program extended its geographic reach to the non-Slavic
republics of the NIS and in 1996 all republics. Previously, these countries were
part of the ISF Internet project. However, ISF's need to concentrate on the four
infrastructural projects in which it was involved made it more practical for 
these countries to be administered through the OSI Regional Internet Program.
In 1996 the ISF telecommunications project was integrated into OSI's Regional Internet Program as well. 
Now both infrastructural and user-based projects are done in coordination.<p><p>

<b>T</b>he OSI-RIP program supports  relatively small scale projects that 
foster user demand for e-mail or Internet services. Each project  costs 
$100,000 on average and frequently incorporates training on use of the 
electronic services.  The OSI-RIP program encourages demand for e-mail/
Internet locally and engages other funding sources or government entities to 
supply larger scale infrastructure development once users have been exposed to 
the powers of e-mail and Internet.<p>           
The projects are usually implemented in phases: we may first introduce access 
to e-mail and, once demand has been created, we follow-up by providing access 
to the Internet. In cases where demand is facilitated and no other funding is 
forthcoming, the national foundations created and funded by George Soros may 
themselves become service providers and seek to subsidize their connections 
through fee-for-service activities. Our approach is heavily skewed towards 
fulfilling the connectivity objective of each foundation in their respective 
country. These relatively inexpensive projects have created tens of thousands 
of users in the countries they serve.<p>                
We hope that future initiatives (Internet Outreach Program, Nordic Internet 
Foundation) will be able to concentrate more on supply- and demand-side 
activities in areas where other funding sources are scarce. At the same time, 
they should share the philosophy of our regional program: connectivity projects 
must have as their core objective the exposure of more users to e-mail/Internet 
services and the provision of training to ensure their effective utilization.<p>
OSI-RIP is one of a number of connectivity efforts of the Soros-affiliated 
organizations.  Connectivity projects are also done by national foundation telecommunication programs. Some national foundations 
choose to subsidize their own telecommunication priorities and ask OSI-RIP for 
regional supplements to support coordination. OSI-RIP also provides advice to 
enhance national initiatives.<p><p>

<H3><A NAME="objectives">Objectives and Criteria</A></H3>                
<b>T</b>he objective of the OSI Regional Internet Program is to provide e-mail 
and full Internet access to individuals and organizations in Central & Eastern 
Europe as well as the republics of the NIS. The goal is to provide access to as
many as possible at the most reasonable cost. E-mail is a vital communications 
tool, and a source of first-hand news available when other communication options 
are not. The full Internet provides instant access for approximately 50 million users worldwide.<p> 
The program attempts to fund a broad array of pilot projects using different 
technologies to provide Internet/e-mail access.  The program's strategy is to 
have a number of proven options available when entering new countries with 
limited telecommunications abilities. Project funding may involve 
telecommunications-related equipment donations, loans, various telecommunication 
fees, and subsidies to cover the cost of data transmission (line and data access 
subsidies are limited to no more than two years).<p>
The OSI Regional Internet Program is "demand-driven." That is, it focuses  
on meeting user demands for connectivity as the primary objective, and builds 
infrastructure (leased lines, satellites, etc.) only when access to the current 
infrastructure proves unworkable for the users we support.<p> 
The program concentrates on identifying various 'niche markets' in each  
country where Internet access would greatly benefit society but is currently 
unavailable or unsupported by any entity. For example, while connectivity for 
the academic and research network in one particular country was government 
subsidized and relatively good compared to the rest of the region, little 
support for secondary school connectivity was provided.  Therefore, we 
concentrated our efforts on this niche. Major niche market categories include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> 	Academic and research institutions 
<li>	Secondary schools 
<li>	Media 
<li>  	NGOs 
<li>  	Libraries 
<li>	Medical institutions 
<li>	Museums 
<li>	Non-affiliated individuals 
</ul>
In addition to niche markets, the program has also supported projects  
that provide connectivity to the Internet through non-traditional as well as 
traditional means. In the West, traditional connectivity is provided through  
high-speed leased lines or optical fiber cabling. This involves installing cables
between different destinations, which is relatively costly in most of the areas 
we serve. However, Internet and e-mail service can also be provided through the
following transport mechanisms which our program has sought to develop in  
Eastern Europe:<p> 
<ul>
<li>	Satellites (dedicated or shared VSAT channels) 
<li>	Spread-spectrum radio modems 
<li>	Ham radio 
<li>	Cable television 
<li>	Microwave 
</ul>  
Wireless technologies, including those just mentioned, allow us to get  
around major obstacles in the local telecommunications infrastructure.<p> 
Both the niche market and non-traditional transport paradigms are  
designed to produce working models that can be transferred from country to  
country. For example, if a practical but non-traditional secondary school or  
medical connectivity project exists in one country, we seek to transplant it 
(with local modifications) to another with similar needs. If spread-spectrum 
radio links prove effective in one country, we encourage other countries with 
similar infrastructure problems to try that solution.<p>
 
Because of the degree of technical sophistication involved in the  
program and the widely varying telecommunication situations (both technical  
and political) existing in each country, the program is tailored to the 
budgeting and administration needs of each country. Some countries use only 
OSI-RIP's expertise and connections, but budget for the program locally. Others
have their own budgets but use the OSI-RIP budget as a supplement for specific 
telecommunication initiatives. Still others rely fully on OSI-RIP's  
telecommunications budget and expertise. The only requirement of the  Regional 
Internet Program is that a technical liason exist in each foundation to 
coordinate the Internet projects on the ground. As each office typically needs  
technical support for their own computers and networks as well, it is not  
unusual for these technicians to also coordinate the local Internet programs.<p>
A cornerstone of the program is working very closely with staff of  
foundations on the ground on any project supported by this program. The high 
cost of connectivity projects, their technical sophistication, and the need to 
deal with local telecommunication ministries and bureaus, require this close  
cooperation. It also is important to have a person locally who can determine, on  
a technical and user level, if the project is meeting its objectives and the  
objectives of the foundation.<p> 
 
In order to limit administrative overhead and concentrate on the  
broadest number of countries and projects, the Regional Internet Program  
operates almost exclusively as a third party grant giver rather than an  
implementer of projects. This is especially true of any infrastructure  
development projects where we require the grantee (or local foundation) to have
technical and management expertise available locally to ensure that projects are
successfully completed. Most Regional Internet Program grants are given to the  
local foundations, who then distribute them to third parties.<p>

descriptions contained on this site.</i><p>               
<H4>Project Header: </H4>Geographical region of activity.<p>
<H4>History: </H4>A summary of each project(s). Other telecommunications 
initiatives of either the ISF or foundation in that country are also briefly 
described where applicable.  <p>
<H4>Population Targeted: </H4>The OSI-RIP focuses on specific population segments 
required to foster open, civil societies: universities and related research 
institutions, secondary (and sometimes primary) schools, libraries, medical 
institutions, cultural centers (museums, galleries, etc.), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), independent media, environmental groups and unaffiliated 
individuals who may not have access to connectivity services otherwise.<p>
<H4>Training Sponsorship: </H4>Most projects have a training component built in.
Experience shows it is not enough simply to provide connectivity.  We also 
sponsor one coordinated effort annually to provide network administration and 
telecommunications training to service providers in the region of activity. In 
1993 and 1994, we sponsored the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/indextxt.html">
Internet Society </A>(ISOC) Internet Workshop for Developing Countries. To 
decrease costs and focus on issues and experiences in the major region we 
serve, we began to subsidize a regional workshop with the same objectives. This 
workshop is sponsored by the <A HREF="http://ceenet.nask.org.pl/">Central
and Eastern European Networking Association </a>(CEENET), a consortium of 
twenty Academic and Research Network providers in the region. The first session 
was held in 1995.<p>

<h4>Grantee Membership:</h4> This falls into three categories.
<br>
<OL>
	<LI>For most e-mail projects and some Internet projects, we work with 
the <A HREF="http://wn.apc.org/apc.html">Association of Progressive 
Communications</a> (APC). The APC is a consortium of electronic Bulletin Board 
Services (BBS) in 133 countries and is dedicated to providing connectivity, 
information and training to NGOs, independent media and unaffiliated individuals.
APC serves many of our target population segments and works very much like the
Soros network, however, with BBSs that serve local users, local decision making 
and a directorate to coordinate activities. We work primarily with individual 
nodes in the region to help them progress and serve their local user constituencies. 
Occasionally, however, we sponsor projects that promote regional topics such as 
increasing connectivity for eastern European women and their associated NGOs.
	<LI>The other organization we work with is the Central and Eastern 
European Academic and Research Network (CEENET). Aside from co-subsidizing their 
workshop training activities in the region, we cooperate with most of the 
individual members in their local countries because they provide much of the
Internet service to our target population segments.
	<LI> Finally, we have linked our secondary school connectivity projects 
with distance education.  The <A HREF="http://www.igc.apc.org/iearn/">I*EARN 
Program</a>, which has a number of pre-defined distance education courses for 
secondary schools that run internationally, is being sponsored in our 
efforts.

     AFP<p>
     
     MANILA: Burma does not need to democratize to join the Association of 
     south East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Philippine President Fidel Ramos 
     said late Monday.

"When the five founding members came in, no one was asked "Are you a 
     democracy? Do you have a constitutional system?," Ramos said in a 
     television talk show.

     "It's not for us to impose our system on other countries," he added.
     
     Ramos said the requirement for Asean membership were accession to a 
     treaty of amity and cooperation, and agreement to join the Asean Free 
     Trade Area which takes effect in 2003.
<p>     
     His remarks come amid a military crackdown in Burma on members of the 
     opposition National League for Democracy led by Nobel peace prize 
     winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
     
     Human rights activists and Western countries, led by the United states 
     have been urging Asean to hold off on admitting Burma as a member 
     because of human rights violations and the military junta's refusal to 
     allow democracy.
     <p>
     At an informal summit in Jakarta last month, leaders agreed to allow 
     Burma, Laos and Cambodia to join the Asean simultaneously but a date 
     has yet to be specified.
     
     Ramos and other Asean leaders said the three countries could join 
     before the turn of the century.
     <p>
     Asean was founded in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
     Singapore, and Thailand. Other members are Brunei and Vietnam.

     BANGKOK, Dec 17 (Reuter) - Burma's military government on  
Tuesday denied a U.S. charge that nearly 200 students were 
arrested late last week for their part in street protests 
earlier this month. <p>
  A government spokesman told Reuters that the U.S. claim was  
aimed at putting more pressure on the government and was based 
on rumours. 
  ``They are always trying to put pressure on us and their  
charges are based on rumours,'' the spokesman said by telephone. 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on  
Monday that Washington believed as many as 187 students and 
demonstrators were detained late last week. <p>
  The U.S. had protested strongly to the ruling State Law and  
Order Restoration Council (SLORC) against this and the continued 
restrictions on the movements of opposition leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi, Burns added. 
  The deputy secretary general of Suu Kyi's National League  
for Democracy (NLD) told Reuters that the U.S. estimate of 
students and demonstrators detained tallied with that of his 
party.
  ``This seems to tally with what (numbers) we have. As far as  
we know about 12 of them would be NLD members,'' he said. 
  The NLD has protested against the continued detention of its  
party members and restrictions placed on Suu Kyi. 
  Suu Kyi's aide said she was still inside her University  
Avenue lakeside residence to which public access has been barred 
by the government. <p>
  About 2,000 students from the Yangon University and the  
Yangon Institute of Technology launched anti-government protests 
early this month. 
  They were protesting against police brutality and demanding  
political freedom and rights. The SLORC broke up the 
demonstrations, detained over 860 students and later freed them. 
  The government also responded by closing institutions of  
higher learning in the capital. 
  Army tanks were stationed at Rangoon's city hall as a  
deterrent against any further demonstrations. The tanks were 
still being in position on Tuesday, witnesses said. <p>
  The government spokesman said Rangoon had been quiet in  
recent days with most of the students from the closed 
universities back in their home provinces.

December 19, 1996<br>
     By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok<br>
     
     Eight years ago, a group of students from the Rangoon Institute of 
     Technology got into a fight with some locals over what music to play 
     in a
     tea-shop. The argument turned into a brawl. The police reacted by 
     dragging
     the students away and beating them up. Student demonstrations against 
     police
     brutality the next day soon developed into a nationwide 
     anti-government
     uprising.     
     In October this year, RIT students once again had a quarrel with some 
     local
     people in a restaurant in Sawbwagyigong, north of Rangoon. The 
     incident
     caused another confrontation with the police - and once again the 
     students'
     protests quickly became political, leading to large street 
     demonstrations in
     early December.
     
     On both occasions, pent-up frustration with Burma's authoritarian 
     regime
     needed just a small park to light a bigger fire. But history never 
     repeats
     itself in exactly the same way. Indeed, the difference between the 
     events of
     1988 and the recent demonstrations in Rangoon is striking, says a 
     Burmese
     source who witnessed both. Besides the fact that the recent 
     disturbances
     have not led to as widespread a conflagration as in 1988, both the 
     students
     and the authorities have also been more cautious.
     <p>
     The students are more restrained now, says a Burmese exile in Bangkok, 
     "because they are divided between those who raise political demands 
     and
     those who want to depoliticize the whole thing." The latter group, he 
     adds,
     "just want the right to set up an independent student union to 
     safeguard
     their rights."
     
     On the other hand, eye-witnesses to the demonstrations, which seem to 
     have
     reached their peak on the night of December 6, assert that the initial 
     response of the authorities was also controlled. When the two sides 
     confronted each other at a major intersection in Rangoon, says an 
     observer,
     "the students shouted to the police: 'We want human rights and we're 
     Burmese
     like you, don't attack us!, whereupon the police actually retreated."
     <p>
     The 4,000-strong crowd dwindled as the evening went on, says a 
     Westerner who
     observed the demonstrations. By mid-night only a core group of 150 
     students
     remained. University teachers were then brought to persuade the 
     students to
     go home. "It was only when that failed that the riot police moved in 
     to
     
     break up the demonstration, using water cannons," the eyewitnesses 
     said.
     <p>
     Still, say sources in Rangoon, the demonstrations prove that Burma's 
     internal political situation remains volatile. Says one: "People are 
     fed up
     with the government's intransigence and they are frustrated with the 
     ongoing
     political statement. They want to see a dialogue between the 
     government and
     the opposition, but as yet there's no sign of that."
     <p>
     Will the latest outbursts change the generals' attitude towards the 
     opposition and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi? Not likely. Says as 
     Burmese
     dissident living abroad: "What the army fears the most is a split 
     within its
     ranks. Any dialogue with Suu Kyi would legitimize the opposition in 
     the eyes
     of the military - and that could mean the end of their precious unity. 
     For
     that reason, they won't talk to her."

     <p>
Rangoon, Dec 11  - Burma on Wednesday said the  
United States was attempting to use the military government's 
restrictions on opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's 
movements as an excuse to impose sanctions on Rangoon. 
  ``The U.S. embassy has tried to bring her outside, knowing  
that it will be refused. I can see the trend is definitely 
heading toward creating more pressure for sanctions (against 
Burma),'' a senior government official said. <p>
  The official, who declined to be named, repeated his earlier  
clarification that the government's request for Suu Kyi to 
temporarily confine herself to her house last week during 
student protests was made out of sincere concern for her safety. 
  ``They (the U.S. embassy) realise and appreciate the real  
situation outside,'' the official said. <p>
  U.S. President Bill Clinton in early October slapped a visa  
ban on senior officials of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC) after Rangoon arrested hundreds of pro-democracy 
activists in late September. 
  The U.S. Senate in July passed legislation allowing Clinton  
to impose economic sanctions if repression in Burma worsened or 
if Suu Kyi was rearrested. <p>
  The Nobel peace laureate last week was asked by the  
government not to leave her lakeside residence for two days 
after Rangoon last week saw its biggest student street protest 
since pro-democracy uprisings in 1988. <p>
  Suu Kyi's aides have said she had since largely remained in  
her compound partly to avoid being drawn into the unrest. 
  Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and  
the protesting students have denied any links. But Suu Kyi has 
said she shares student opposition against alleged police 
brutality and injustice. <p>
  The students, whose campuses were closed since Monday, said  
they took to the streets because of unfair police treatment of 
their colleagues involved in a brawl with restaurant owners in 
October. <p>
  Over 860 students taking part in protests were briefly  
detained last week. 
  Small pockets of students have shouted anti-government  
slogans in public in the past two days. Government roadblocks 
near campuses have prevented large groups of students from 
rallying. <p>
  The government official early this week charged that some  
NLD members, exiled Burmese students and the outlawed Communist 
Party of Burma had tried to instigate student protests.

  Rangoon  - Leader of the opposition Aung San Suu Kyi  
rejected government charges that her party was connected to 
fomenting student protests and called on Burma's government
Monday to look for novel solutions to the unrest. 
<p>
Suu Kyi was answering accusations by a spokesperson of the  
ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) that certain members 
of her National League for Democracy, Communists, 
and exiles were involved in the protests.
  ``We have evidence that not only some NLD members but also  
members of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) and 
underground elements of the Burma Communist Party (BCP) are 
deeply involved in this unrest,'' said a spokesman for the military 
government.<p>
  The Bangkok-based ABSDF's membership is made up of students  
who have quit Burma since an uprising in 1988. 
  The BCP is illegal in Burma.  <p>
  ``We are trying to flush out these elements as they come out  
to the front of unrests,'' the spokesman added. ``We expect 
after a short period of time, things will return to normal.'' <p>
  Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi rejected the charge that  
the NLD, barred from taking power after winning the 1990 general 
elections, was involved in the protests. <p>
  ``This is absolutely ridiculous. They should deal with their  
problems instead of trying to find someone else to blame,'' she 
said by telephone. 
  ``They are never prepared to accept their responsibility as  
a government. This theory of conspiracy is totally out of date. 
We want some more modern approach (to deal with the problems).'' 
<p>
  Witnesses said soldiers moved in Monday afternoon to  
disperse about 120 students who had staged a rally outside the 
gates of another university campus less than five miles from the 
main Yangon (Rangoon) University. <p>
  No one knew if there were any arrests.  
  Other witnesses said there was an increased police presence  
around the U.S. Embassy in downtown Rangoon. 
  Diplomatic sources said a number of students in Mandalay,  
430 miles north of Rangoon, also demonstrated over the weekend, 
shouting anti-government slogans. 
  They said students of the Mandalay Institute of Technology  
organized a rally Sunday while the Mandalay Institute of 
Medicine had been sealed off by security forces. <p>
  On Monday, the military tightened its control of Rangoon,  
sealing off all campuses of the troubled university and the 
nearby Yangon Institute of Technology. 
  Earlier in the day, classes were suspended at the two  
schools and more than half of their boarding students left for 
their homes in the provinces. <p>
  ``The situation looks definitely more tense with the  
stepped-up measures,'' a Western diplomat said. 
  Students from the two institutes last week staged some of  
the biggest protests since the 1988 pro-democracy uprising that 
the military crushed, leaving thousands dead or in jail. <p>
  The NLD and the student protesters have denied any links  
with each other during this latest unrest. Authorities briefly 
detained 860 students from two street protests in the past week. <p>
  The demonstrations were triggered by undergraduate  
complaints about police brutality in a brawl between institute 
students and the owners of a local restaurant in October. 
  The government has said two policemen involved in the case  
had been dismissed and given two-year jail terms, but students 
demanded the punishment be announced in newspapers.

    December 6, 1996 <p>
     
          Faced with the largest antigovernment protest since the junta
     seized power in 1988, it shut down some roads near a junction in 
     front of Yangon University, where the gathering was held, and 
     appeared ready to suppress the rally.<p>
          At about 2 p.m., students of the Yangon Institute of Technology
     began a demonstration at their campus 10 kilometers north of Yangon, 
     following similar marches Monday and Tuesday when 600 student 
     demonstrators were detained.<p>
          Students of Yangon University tried to join in, but the junta
     sent in more than 1,000 armed police and troops to block the roads, 
     leading to dispersal of the marchers.<p>
          After the demonstrators scattered, soldiers, policemen and some
     water-spraying vehicles remained in the city, but students of the two 
     universities continued sporadic protests before linking up for the 
     street rally at night.<p>
          Hoisting a picture of Gen. Aung San, founder of Myanmar and
     father of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, students delivered 
     one speech after another at the gathering, criticizing the junta.<p>
          The students are pressing the government to allow them to set up
     self-governing councils.  Such councils have been banned since 1962.

<b>     November 24, 1996</b>
     <p>
          UNITED NATIONS -- Washington will ask the UN General Assembly to 
     call
     for democratic change in Myanmar, the US envoy to the United Nations 
     said on
     Thursday in a speech listing rights violations in a number of 
     countries.
          <p>
          "Many governments continue to rely for their authority not on 
     popular
     consent but on coercion. Burma is one example," Ms Madeleine Albright 
     said
     in an address to a UN General Assembly committee that deals with human 
     rights.
          <p>
          "Today, there is in Burma a kind of rolling repression that ebbs 
     and
     flows. Each little opening is succeeded by a crackdown," she said. 
     Burma is
     the old name for Myanmar.
          <p>
          She said the US administration "will urge the General Assembly 
     this
     year to express its strongest support for democracy and human rights" 
     in
     Myanmar.
     
          "The Assembly should call for a genuine democratic dialogue, for 
     free
     assembly and free speech, for the release of political prisoners," she 
     said.
          <p>
          Besides Myanmar, she also spoke out against Afghanistan, Iraq, 
     Iran and
     Sudan, and expressed concern for the situation in China, Cuba and 
     Nigeria.
     
          She urged Iraq and Iran "to cease repressing their people, stop
     supporting international terrorism, and move towards more open and 
     free
     societies", and said that human rights in Afghanistan "have been 
     abused by
     virtually every
     party to the fighting". -- AFP.

     CHIANG MAI - Stressing that a country must look after its 
     citizens, US First Lady Hillary Clinton yesterday urged Burma's 
     military regime to start a serious dialogue with Nobel Peace 
     Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
     
     In a speech at Chiang Mai University, she said the situation in 
     Burma was having detrimental effects on the region as well as its 
     citizens.
     <p>
     She commended Thailand, Washington's strongest ally in Southeast 
     Asia, in a speech at Chiang Mai University for its "tolerance and 
     compassion" by offering a sanctuary for refugees from 
     neighbouring countries.
     
     "You provide a safe haven for students and minority groups 
     fleeing repression in Burma. We all hope the Burmese refugees 
     will be able to cross back to their homeland soon, but such an 
     outcome depends on real political dialogue in that country. That 
     dialogue must be serious and must commence between Aung San Suu 
     Kyi and the military regime in Burma."
     
     The first lady said a government must look after its citizens and 
     to fail to do so will lead to its own demise.
     
     "We have seen the cost to individuals and to society of our 
     failure to invest in our greatest resource - our people," she 
     said.
     <p>
     She stressed the importance of education as a tool to combat the 
     social problems that face the world today.
     
     Although it was good for countries to progress economically, they 
     must not ignore social development.
     
     "No country can move forward into the 21st century if half of its 
     population is left on the margins," she said.
     
     As the spokesperson for women and children, Hillary Clinton 
     emphasised education as a means of ensuring that these groups are 
     not forgotten when the economy of a nation booms.
     <p>
     She said worldwide investments in "people, especially women and 
     children, are not luxuries, they are the key to sustaining our 
     progress economically and socially."
     
     She added that "education is also a vital piece of  social 
     development". She said when Thailand raised the level of 
     compulsory education it created "opportunities for many 
     citizens", especially for the female population.
     
     "Investing in the education of girls in Thailand is doubly 
     beneficial: It will enable young women to plan for their own 
     futures, to seek and hold jobs that will give them decent and 
     higher incomes," she said.
     <p>
     She also said it will help deter families from selling girls into 
     prostitution for immediate economic gain.
     
     "It will give them [young women a chance to tell their families 
     and communities that the short-term economic benefit from the 
     sale of a young girl into prostitution is not as significant for 
     a family as an education that will continue to give a young woman 
     economic opportunities for a lifetime," she said.
     <p>
     The first lady stressed that educating women and girls was 
     advantageous, for they were an untapped workforce. When given the
     
     proper training and opportunities, women will help "lift 
     themselves and their families out of poverty and  contribute to 
     the prosperity of their communities as productive workers and 
     citizens".
     <p>
     She also applauded Thailand's efforts to combat HIV and Aids. 
     "Just as Thailand's successful population control programme 
     became a model for developing countries around the world and 
     contributed to [Thailand's] economic progress, the Thai 
     government's fight against Aids is equally critical to this 
     nation's economic and social stability."
     <p>
     She said the  partnership between Thailand and the US in 
     researching various vaccines and medicines had helped the fight 
     against Aids. The work of Thai nongovernmental organisations with 
     the US Agency for International Development to increase awareness 
     about the disease was another area where Thailand served as a role 
     model.
     <p>
     She commended Chiang Mai University for its part in the ongoing 
     work to find reliable treatments for the disease.

 The Asian Age, 21/11/96<p>
     
   
     Manila, Nov. 20: The Association of South-East Asian Nations decided 
     here on Wednesday that it would not rush into admitting Burma as a 
     member of the grouping, Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas said.
     <p>
     The seven-nation grouping made the decision at an informal meeting of 
     its foreign ministers here, ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic 
     Co-operation ministerial meeting.  Speaking after the meeting, Mr 
     Alatas said Burma had to go through the normal "technical" process 
     applicable for potential membership in the grouping, which comprises 
     seven members.
     <p>
     Asean has agreed to have a grouping of ten by the turn of the century 
     to incorporate Cambodia, Laos and Burma, all of whom enjoy observer 
     status in Asean.  Burma had applied to Kuala Lumpur for Asean colours.

     <br>

     November 15, 1996<br>
     By YINDEE LERTCHAROENCHOK, The Nation<p>
     
     THE Burmese junta has failed to recognise the decision of the UN Human 
     Rights Commission made in early 1992 and considers the recent 
     appointment of
     a new US special human rights rapporteur on Burma as "intrusive" and 
     "unwarranted interference" in the internal affairs of the country.
     
     Slorc's position was conveyed in a letter from the Burmese permanent 
     representative to the UN in Geneva to the commission, dated July 4, 
     1996.
     <p>
     The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) stressed 
     that the
     appointment of Judge Rajsoomer Lallah "is unacceptable", as was the 
     case
     with his predecessor, Professor Yozo Yokota.
     
     The commission appointed Lallah, an Oxford-educated judge from 
     Mauritius, to
     replace Yokota who resigned from the post on May 12, 1996 to protest 
     against
     his constant battle funds to carry out his work.
     
     <p>
     In his interim report to the current UN General Assembly in New York, 
     Lallah
     said that Burma "had disassociated itself from the decision" the UN 
     commission made at its 48th session in early 1992.
     
     It therefore refused to accept Lallah's appointment, stating in the 
     letter
     that such an exercise is "intrusive and constituted unwarranted 
     interference
     in our (Burmese) affairs".
     <p>
     Lallah informed the UN members that since his appointment he had tried 
     unsuccessfully to obtain Slorc's cooperation to implement his mandate 
     including visits to Burma to investigate its human rights situation.
     
     Slorc had not replied to his request, which was made in two letters 
     sent on
     July 9 and 26, he said.
     
     The judge expressed regret over Slorc's refusal to cooperate with him 
     and
     said the absence of a response was "in the circumstances, not 
     understandable."
     
     However, he said any procedures resulting from UN resolutions did not 
     require the express consent of the states concerned - in this case 
     Burma -
     to be implemented.
<p>     
     Lallah said Slorc's refusal to recognise his appointment did not 
     conform to
     the obligation it undertook when agreeing to Article 56 of the UN 
     charter.

     This article requires that the signatory extend all cooperation with 
     the UN
     and its various organs.
     
     A refusal "cannot relieve the relevant organs of the United nations 
     from the
     duty of performing their functions," he said.
     <p>
     Slorc's "attitude of non-cooperation" had made the task of the special 
     rapporteur much more difficult in determining the situation as it has 
     evolved since the last visit.
     
     The rapporteur had last visited Burma in October 1995.
     <p>
     Lallah said the absence of a response form Slorc meant that the UN 
     could not
     engage in a constructive dialogue with Rangoon during the 
     investigation and
     the writing of the report.
     
     The report traced the latest history of the political and human rights 
     situation in Burma.
     
     It touched on the various forms of alleged human rights violations in 
     the
     country, which included extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary 
     executions;
     torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; arbitrary 
     arrest
     and detention; prison conditions; freedom of opinion, assembly, 
     association
     and movement; forced relocation; and forced labour.
<p>     
     In his conclusion, Lallah noted that the absence of respect for 
     democratic
     rights is the root cause of all major human rights violations in Burma 
     and
     it s absence "implies a structure of power which is autocratic and 
     accountable only to itself".
     
     He said Slorc had not yet implemented its commitment to take all the 
     necessary steps towards the establishment of a democratic environment 
     in Burma.

     Detailed reports and photographs helped him to conclude that human 
     rights
     abuses "remain extremely serious" in Burma. (TN)

     (Fifth Column) By Robert S. Gelbard<br>
     November 21, 1996<p>
     
     For the past eight years, the world's attention has been focused on 
     the
     struggle of Burma's people to gain a say in their future. A more 
     fundamental
     problem is the collapse of the rule of law. The lawlessness of 
     authoritarian
     rule not only harms dissidents; it results in the corrupting and 
     criminalization of the state and the entrenchment of the drug trade in

     Burma's political and economic life. It has had tragic consequences 
     for the
     United States and for every Asian nation facing crisis in drug abuse.
<p>     
     Consider these facts: Rangoon's New Light of Myanmar reported on 
     August 3
     the purchase of part of a new Rangoon office tower by Pao Yu-Chiang, 
     head of
     the United Wa State Army, East Asian's largest heroin-trafficking 
     organisation. A photograph showed him shaking hands with Rangoon's 
     mayor U
     Ko Lay, a member of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council 
     (Slorc).
     <p>
     Eight Slorc cabinet ministers and numerous subordinates rubbed elbows 
     with
     the who's who of Burma's drug trade at the lavish wedding last March 
     of
     narco-trafficker Lo Hsing Han's son, who has taken over management of 
     his
     father's business. Slorc is protecting the drug trade and flaunting 
     its
     defiance of international concern, including that of its neighbours.
     <p>
     Before Burma's military took power in 1962, Burma played a relatively 
     minor
     role in the global drug trade. But by the 1980s, it had emerged as the 
     world's largest producer of opium and heroin. Burma's leading drug 
     traffickers than were warlords based in the hills of Shan State. The 
     military used these traffickers as a counterweight to anti-government 
     ethnic
     insurgents. At one point or another, it offered nearly every important 
     trafficking militia a simple deal: Help us maintain stability, and 
     we'll let
     you do business as you like.
     <p>
     Since the formation of Slorc in 1988, opium production in Burma has 
     doubled.
     And the nature of the drug trade has changed in an unmistakable way: 
     Burma's
     most important narco-traffickers are no longer holed up in jungle 
     hideaways.
     They are buying real estate in Rangoon and Mandalay, investing in 
     Burma's
     economy, and open courting military officials.
     <p>
     These days, Khun Sa, the most notorious of the old opium warlords, is 
     living
     comfortably in Rangoon, having "surrendered" his Shan United Army. 
     Slorc has
     refused to bring him to justice or to render him to the US to face 
     charges.
     He has evidently been granted immunity, encouraged to invest his drug 
     fortune in infrastructure projects, and accorded the status of an 
     honored
     elder - U Khun Sa.
     <p>
     Slorc has brazenly exploited drug trafficking money to finance 
     projects that
     do little to improve the lot of the Burmese. Drug traffickers ad their 
     families are among the leading backers of high-profile infrastructure 
     projects in Burma. They launder their money with impunity in banks 
     controlled by the military. Burma has few legal exports and its trade 
     imbalance last year was 15% of GDP, yet its cities have been flooded 
     by
     luxury imports - paid for in hard currency that could only be 
     generated by
     the drug trade. Meanwhile, in the opium-producing areas of Shan state, 
     trafficking continues largely unhindered. Several groups are branching 
     out
     into other drug activity, including production of methamphetamines 
     that find
     a ready market in the region.
     <p>
     Burma's citizens and neighbours pay the greatest price for Slorc's 
     defiance
     of international concern. The number of Burmese heroin addicts is 
     estimated
     at over 300,000, some 70% of whom have HIV, the human immunodeficiency 
     virus
     that leads to Aids. There are at least 500,000 heroin addicts in 
     Thailand;
     drug abuse and Aids are on the rise in Yunnan, China, and 14% of 
     Malaysian
     teenagers are now using hard drugs. Burmese heron traffic is 
     threatening
     Cambodian stability. Burmese methamphetamines are becoming the drug of 
     choice in Taiwan.
     <p>
     Though Slorc professes a commitment to international cooperation, it 
     is
     systematically destroying the potential effectiveness of its only 
     international anti-drug donor, the United Nations' Drug Control 
     Programme.
     Slorc has repeatedly attacked the programme's director in the state 
     press
     
     and used racist terms for foreign visitors who have dared suggest 
     Burma's
     drug-control performance is inadequate.
     <p>
     As the secretary of state's top adviser on law enforcement, my job is 
     to
     fight drugs and crime. I always prefer to do so in  partnership with 
     government and law enforcement officials in other nations. But US 
     anti-drug
     assistance to the Burmese has failed in the past, and in the last four 
     years
     Burmese authorities have made no discernible efforts to improve their 
     performance. From a hardheaded, drug-control point of view, I have to 
     conclude that Slorc has been part of the problem, not the solution.
     <p>
     The longer the political impasse in Burma continues, the more embedded 
     the
     drug trade will become in the economy - and the harder it will be for 
     any
     government in Burma, democratic or otherwise, to root out the problem. 
     The
     longer the transition to the rule of law drags on, the more harm will 
     be
     done to ordinary people in the US, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere, 
     especially as Burma's economy becomes more integrated with Asean's.
     <p>
     Every nation has an interest in pressing the Burmese authorities to 
     fight
     drugs. More fundamentally, every nation has an interest in encouraging 
     a
     swift resolution to Burma's political crisis, one that can make its 
     military
     more accountable to civilian and judicial authority, one that denies 
     legitimacy to narco-traffickers, one that leads to a real fight 
     against
     corruption and crime. That is the only way to protect the rights of 
     Burma's
     people and the safety of our citizens.

                                    November 11, 1996<p>

         EURO MP Mrs Glenys Kinnock was involved in a cloak-and-dagger 
     interview with
     Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, despite being banned 
     from seeing
     her, it emerged last night.
     
         Mrs Kinnock is planning to show a 20-minute video of the secret 
     meeting to
     the European Parliament which has championed Aung San Suu Kyi's 
     resistance to
     the Burmese military regime.
     <p>
         With fellow Labour Euro-MP Glyn Ford, Mrs Kinnock returned home 
     last night
     from Burma after entering the country covertly. She smuggled out a 
     tape of the
     meeting.  
     
         Only a few hours earlier, a mob which Mrs Kinnock described as 
     "thugs hired
     by the government" smashed the windows of a car in which Aung San Suu 
     Kyi, a
     Nobel prize winner, was travelling.
     <p>
         Mrs Kinnock will tell the Parliament, which begins its monthly 
     plenary in
     Strasbourg today, that the EU should impose economic sanctions on 
     Burma in a bid
     to democratise the state.
<p>     
         Aung San Suu Kyi calls for sanctions in her interview, pleading 
     with the
     international community to act now. "She is afraid that things could 
     become so
     bad that it will be too late to do anything," Mrs Kinnock said.
     
         She had told Mrs Kinnock that the Burmese people were "reaching 
     the end of
     their tolerance" and were now concerned for the safety of democracy 
     campaigners.
     <p>
         Aung San Suu Kyi also attacked the French oil company, Total, for 
     its
     business links with the Burmese regime and called on tourists to 
     boycott the
     country.
     
         Mrs Kinnock said: "She is excoriating in her comments on the 
     French
     government for blocking a straightforward decision by the European 
     Commission to
     withdraw preferential access for Burmese textiles and industrial 
     goods."
     <p>
         Mrs Kinnock said her first meeting was "in the ladies' loo - it 
     was the only
     place we could talk".
     
         She said it was a "threatening" experience and added: "We couldn't 
     speak
     openly and we always had to make sure we weren't being followed."

                               November 13, 1996, Wednesday<p>
A furious Glenys Kinnock this afternoon stepped up her campaign 
     for
     sanctions against Burma, after the military regime dismissed EU 
     inquiries into
     allegations of forced child labour as "futile".  The Labour Euro MP 
     released
     copies of a letter from Burma's EU office to the Brussels Commission, 
     flatly
     denying any forced labour practices in the country.  It says the 
     Burmese
     authorities have "amply explained" that such a thing does not exist, 
     and says of
     the Brussels inquiry: "It is futile and will not be necessary to send 
     a
     Commission mission to investigate the non-existing practices." 
<p>Mrs 
     Kinnock, who
     has just returned from a visit to Burma during which she secretly 
     filmed an
     interview with Opposition leader and democracy campaigner Aung San Suu 
     Kyi,
     insists the regime is smothering free speech and blatantly using 
     enforced
     child labour.  But the French Government is refusing to agree to EU 
     action
     against Burma, including the withdrawal of special market access to EU 
     member
     states for Burmese textiles and industrial goods.  

<p>Mrs Kinnock again 
     called on
     the French Government to lift the block - and urged EU citizens to 
     boycott the
     French oil company Total because of its involvement with the regime in 
     the
     construction of a major gas pipeline in Burma.  The interview recorded 
     by Mrs
     Kinnock was shown to Euro MPs in Strasbourg. In it, Aung San Suu Kyi 
     makes a
     plea for worldwide economic sanctions against Burma.  Mrs Kinnock 
     said: "Forced
     labour has certainly been used in the infrastructure associated with 
     the
     pipeline.   As the pipeline is being built, thousands of people are 
     being
     displaced from their homes." She said that Total is about to becom the 
     largest
     source of foreign currency for Burma, with a vast investment which 
     will produce
     400 million dollars for the coffers of the SLORC military regime.  "I 
     would urge
     the citizens of Europe to boycott Total until they withdraw from 
     Burma. They can
     return when the party that Aung San Suu Kyi leads, which won 80% of 
     the vote in
     elections, becomes the legitimate Government of that country."
     <p>
        Mrs Kinnock told the European Parliament this afternoon that she 
     had received
     word today from Rangoon of a major demonstration in the next few days 
     against
     the Opposition leader.  She appealed to Irish Foreign Minister Dick 
     Spring - in
     the EU Presidency - to warn the Burmese regime that any action against 
     Aung San
     Suu Kyi would not be tolerated in Europe.  Mrs Kinnock said the regime 
     had plans
     to send in up to 2,000 of its supporters to storm the compound in 
     Rangoon where
     the Opposition leader lives.  She said that the planned attack would 
     be carried
     out by many of the same people who launched an attack on the 
     Opposition leader's
     car last weekend.

                                    November 13, 1996<p>

         A band of 200 thugs attacked the opposition leader of Burma, Daw 
     Aung San
     Suu Kyi, on Saturday, pelting her car with stones and threatening her 
     with
     knives and crowbars. The attack, according to all reliable accounts, 
     was abetted
     and likely organized by the junta that misrules Burma and fears Daw 
     Aung San Suu
     Kyi and her unflappable courage above all else. This latest, most 
     brazen assault
     was not only barbaric, it was foolish - as if the apartheid regime of 
     South
     Africa, in its dying throes, had targeted Nelson Mandela instead of 
     working with
     him.  
     <p>
        Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is a unique figure in Burma, a fact that until 
     now has
     afforded her some protection - but that also puts her at some risk. In 
     1990 her
     pro-democracy party overwhelmingly won a free national election, even 
     though the
     ruling junta had put her under house arrest before the vote. The 
     regime's
     subsequent refusal to honor the election results did nothing to dim 
     her
     popularity at home; her receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize elevated her 
     reputation
     abroad. Despite every provocation - including the regime's constant 
     vilification
     of her on state radio and its ceaseless arrests and torture of her 
     supporters -
     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has continued to call, in the same measured yet 
     determined
     tones, for reconciliation and dialogue.
     <p>
        As the daughter of Burma's postcolonial independence leader, 
     himself an army
     officer, she is singularly placed to bring about such reconciliation 
     between the
     army and society and among Burma's long-warring tribes.
     
        She is also singularly placed to unite the pro-democracy movement 
     and attract
     international support for its cause, and it is this strength that may 
     tempt the
     brutal generals to contemplate another attack. The Clinton 
     administration,
     Burma's neighbors and the rest of the world need to make clear, 
     without
     ambiguity, that giving in to such a temptation would mark Burma's 
     generals as
     pariahs forever more.
     <p>
        President Bill Clinton will travel to Asia this month for meetings 
     with the
     region's leaders. Burma, and a strategy for supporting its democrats, 
     should be
     high on his agenda.

     November 11, 1996 
     <p>
         RANGOON, Nov. 11 (Reuters) - The weekend attacks on Burmese
     opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade may signal a 
     change or discord in the military government's efforts to 
     contain the democracy movement, diplomats said on Monday.
     
     They said the attacks appeared to be at odds with statements 
     earlier this month by officials in the State Law and Order 
     Restoration Council (SLORC), who said they were trying to 
     improve relations with Suu Kyi and the democracy movement.
     
     'What happened Saturday afternoon is a 180 degree switch 
     from what we saw earlier this month,' one diplomat said.
<p>     
         A senior government official said on Monday the attacks were
     acts of sabotage from which the government had nothing to gain.
     
     But diplomats said there was no doubt the government was 
     involved to some extent in the incident.
     
     'It's inconceivable that this could take place without the 
     knowledge of the government,' one diplomat said.
     
     He said that on Saturday there were about 2,00 young men in 
     well-organized groups milling about near the Nobel peace 
     laureate's house, outside barricades erected by the military 
     government to prevent her from giving weekend speeches to 
     supporters.
     
     Diplomats said the men were from townships near Rangoon and 
     were paid to come in and cause unrest.
     
     'The main point is they were brought in by the government. 
     And some of these men were those who attacked the convoy 
     containing Suu Kyi,' one diplomat said.
     <p>
     Other diplomats said they were not sure if the attacks were
     a sign of a change in tactics by the SLORC, or a signal there 
     was some disagreement in the government over how best to deal 
     with Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.
     
     
     'It seems like this could be a new tactic,' another diplomat 
     said. 'But it could also show there are conflicting signals 
     coming from the SLORC.'
     <p>
         The SLORC has been fighting a poor image abroad.
         It has been repeatedly condemned by Western nations and
     human rights groups for suppressing the democracy movement.
     
     Since May it has arrested and released nearly 1,000 NLD 
     members or supporters in a crackdown against the movement.
     
         'Why would they want to put all this effort into improving
     things then let this happen?' one diplomat asked.

ASIA-BURMA: NGOS URGE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO PRESSURE

By Teena Gill<br>
     
BANGKOK, Nov. 4<br>
     <p>
        South-east Asian governments that have adopted a "constructive 
     engagement"
     policy with Rangoon's military regime, are coming under renewed 
     pressure from
     non-government groups determined to see democracy restored in Burma.
     
        Last week in Bangkok and over the weekend in Manila, pro-democracy
     campaigners have held separate meetings pressing regional governments 
     to take a
     more aggressive stance against a Burmese military regime that has 
     become ever
     more repressive in the past few weeks.
     
        In Manila yesterday, former Philippine president Corazon Aquino 
     joined with
     about 100 pro-democracy activists from the region to urge Rangoon's 
     military
     rulers to defuse the increasingly tense situation in Burma, by holding 
     talks
     with popular opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San 
     Suu Kyi.
     
        "The stubborn refusal of the (ruling) Council to unblock avenues 
     for peaceful
     self-expression is bottling up fumes of discontent that may soon turn 
     noxious
     and burst violently across the land," said Aquino, who in 1986 was 
     swept to
     power by a people's power movement that deposed former Philippine 
     dictator, the
     late Ferdinand Marcos.  
     
        She warned that regional governments should sit up and take notice 
     of the
     outcry of the oppressed Burmese population rather than wait for a 
     "violent
     revolution", against the regime which calls itself the State Law and 
     Order
     Restoration Council (SLORC).
     <p>
        Since 1988, when the Burmese military brutally put down a popular
     pro-democracy uprising and was roundly condemned internationally, the 
     Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been among the 
     Rangoon
     regime's few supporters in various international fora.
     
        ASEAN -- comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
     Thailand, the
     Philippines and Vietnam -- has steadfastly stuck to the policy that 
     developments
     in Burma are the internal affairs of the country, and do not warrant 
     outside
     interference.
     
        This stance has been maintained despite the regime's refusal to 
     recognize the
     outcome of elections held in 1990 that were convincingly won by Suu 
     Kyi's
     National League for Democracy (NLD), and in the face of gross human 
     rights
     abuses, as reported by various international rights groups.
     <p>
        More recently, the regime has even been preventing Suu Kyi, held 
     under house
     arrest for nearly six years ending in July 1995, from holding 
     political meetings
     outside her Rangoon home. NLD members and supporters have also been 
     detained.
     
        Against this background, pro-democracy activists have been pressing 
     ASEAN
     governments to turn down Burma's application to become a member of the 
     regional
     grouping.
     
        Indonesia and Malaysia are keen to embrace the Rangoon regime's 
     entry, but
     more recently, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, have expressed 
     reservations and this may in part be attributed to the pressure coming 
     from
     pro-democracy groups.
     <p>
        In Thailand in particular, dozens of non-governmental organizations 
     (NGOs)
     are actively engaged in relief work among Burmese refugees and have 
     offered
     platforms for dissident political activists to publicly voice their 
     opinions.
     
        "We should not leave matters totally in the hands of governments," 
     says Dr
     Gotham Arya, chairperson of the Program for the Promotion of 
     Non-Violence in
     Thai Society.
     
        Last week, he joined with other Thai academics and politicians, 
     Burmese
     citizens and activists in strongly condemning ASEAN's policy of 
     "constructive
     engagement" with Burma and resolved to lobby against Rangoon's entry 
     into the
     regional grouping.
     <p>
        At a two-day "Alternative ASEAN Meeting on Burma," activists 
     demanded the
     right to a say in ASEAN's engagements with Burma, and that they be 
     allowed to
     help develop an alternative to the present policy.
     
        "Constructive engagement means that human rights can take a hike 
     and that the
     ASEAN mafia is here to stay," said Augusto Miclat Jr., executive 
     director of the
     Philippines-based Initiative for International Dialogue.
     
        It is not new for pro-democracy groups in the more politically open 
     countries
     like Thailand and Philippines to speak out against Burma's military 
     rulers,
     however, human rights activists in the more controlled political 
     climates of
     Indonesia and Malaysia, too have been speaking out against ASEAN's 
     policy.
     <p>
        In July this year, when riots broke out in Jakarta in support of 
     ousted
     opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, some protesters carried 
     posters of Suu
     Kyi, apparently drawing comparisons between their struggles.
     
        And in September, when senior Burmese ministers visited Kuala 
     Lumpur for
     talks with the Mahathir Mohamad government, they were  greeted by 
     hostile NGOs
     and a critical press.
     <p>
        Even in Cambodia, which is yet to become a full fledged ASEAN 
     member, the
     Burmese generals got a poor reception from activist groups. In 
     mid-October in
     Phnom Penh demonstrators protested against a state visit to the 
     country by
     Burmese military leader Than Shwe. Some of the placards at the 
     demonstration
     read "Democracy in Cambodia and Burma" and "Suu Kyi, model for Asia."
     
        "The people of Cambodia have had enough experiences of human rights
     violations and dictators. We neither need nor want such actions to 
     occur among our neighbors," said Kem Sokha, Deputy Secretary-General 
     of the Buddhist Liberal
     Democratic Party who attended the Bangkok meeting.
     
        Sokha, who is also chairman of the Human Rights Committee of 
     Cambodia's
     National Assembly, described the Cambodian government's hosting of 
     Than Shwe's
     visit as shameful.
     
        It is significant that political opposition in countries around the 
     region is
     showing solidarity with Nobel laureate Suu Kyi. Analysts say they 
     identify Suu
     Kyi's struggles with their own efforts to democratically end what has 
     effectively been decades of single-party rule in their countries.
     <p>
        In Indonesia where the military is closely linked to the political
     leadership, Suharto has been president for 29 years and is expected to 
     be elect
     for a seventh consecutive term in 1998.
     
        In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia has been led by the National Front 
     coalition since
     independence in 1957. Mahathir Mohamad, head of the United Malays 
     National
     Organization (UMNO) that leads the Front, has been premier since 1981.
     
        In Singapore, it has been five years since Lee Kuan Yew turned over 
     the
     premiership to Goh Chok Tong though he retains influence as senior 
     minister. In
     any case, Goh also belongs to the People's Action Party, which has 
     governed
     Singapore since 1959.
     
        Said a political activist from Indonesia now in Bangkok: "Burma is 
     a rallying
     point for all of us to remind our own leaders how frighteningly 
     similar they are
     to the generals in Rangoon."

                           November 4, 1996 <p>

Pro-democracy advocates from some 20 countries joined Burmese 
     dissidents in
     calling for an international arms embargo and stronger international 
     pressure
     against Burma as they concluded a two-day conference in the 
     Philippines Monday.
     
         Delegates to the Manila conference also called for the immediate 
     restoration
     of democracy in Burma, which is ruled by the military through its 
     State Law and
     Order Restoration Council (SLORC).
     <p>
         The conference was sponsored by the Forum for Democratic Leaders 
     in Asia
     Pacific, a non-government organization headed by former Philippine 
     President
     Corazon Aquino and former South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jong. 
     
     
         Burmese dissidents attending the conference appealed specifically 
     to the
     Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to delay any plan to 
     include
     Burma as a member and to re-think its policy of "constructive 
     engagement" with
     the country's military rulers.
     
         "It is not yet time for Burma to join the ASEAN until it has fixed 
     its human
     rights record," said Sein Win, "prime minister" of the self-proclaimed 
     Burmese
     "government-in-exile" and a cousin of Burmese opposition leader Aung 
     San Suu
     Kyi.
     <p>
         Sein Win also urged the international community to withdraw 
     investment from
     Burma at the conference, entitled "Transitions from Dictatorship to 
     Democracy:
     Lesson for Burma and Asia".
     
         "We are not against investment," said Sein Win, who joined some 
     160 other
     delegates at the forum. "We only want democracy back in our door 
     before
     accepting much-needed investments."
     
         Sein Win fled Burma with other members of Aung San Suu Kyi's 
     National League
     for Democracy after the Burmese military blocked the political party 
     from taking
     power when it won an election in 1990.
     
         U Thet Buri, "foreign affairs minister" for the U.S.-based
     "government-in-exile", claimed that business ties with ASEAN had done 
     little to
     bring economic reform and development to Burma.
     <p>
         Sein Win argued that ASEAN's constructive engagement policy had 
     helped to
     legitimize SLORC and left country's military rulers with the 
     impression that
     there is no need to change the present political set-up in Burma.
     <p>
         ASEAN currently includes the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, 
     Malaysia,
     Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei but the economic group has discussed 
     allowing
     Burma to become a member.

                                     November 4, 1996<br>

        BANGKOK, Oct. 31 Kyodo<p>
     
        Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay Viravan has urged Myanmar to finalize 
     a new
     constitution and hold elections in order to earn international 
     acceptance and
     facilitate its entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
     (ASEAN),
     according to remarks made available Thursday.
     
        "It is Thailand's view, supported by many ASEAN members, to see 
     Myanmar with
     its own constitution, which will lead to a national election and 
     political
     development," Amnuay was quoted by the Thai Foreign Ministry as 
     telling
     reporters Tuesday.  
     
        He noted that Myanmar has assured ASEAN of its intention to finish 
     drafting
     of a constitution, which is said to be at least 75% completed. "We 
     (Thailand)
     therefore want to push for it," he said.
     <p>
        Foreign Ministry sources clarified, however, that Amnuay was not 
     setting any
     absolute condition for Myanmar's membership in ASEAN.
     
        Amnuay, who is also deputy prime minister, said that having a 
     constitution in
     place would mollify criticism from the international community over 
     Myanmar's
     human rights record and help in the resolution of its internal 
     conflicts.
     <p>
        Myanmar, which was granted ASEAN observer status in July, has 
     officially
     applied to join ASEAN in 1997, the same year Cambodia and Laos are 
     expected to
     be accepted as full members.
     <p>
        But prospects for Myanmar's early admission have dimmed since ASEAN 
     foreign
     ministers, meeting informally in September on the occasion of a U.N. 
     General
     Assembly session, decided to forward the matter to their leaders for 
     determination at their informal summit, scheduled for Nov. 30 in 
     Indonesia.
 <p>    
        ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
     Singapore,
     Thailand and Vietnam.<br>

                            November 2, 1996, Weekend Edition
     <br>
By PM Goh
     <p>
         Myanmar will join Asean when it is ready. It must be willing to assume obligations like Free Trade Area
     
         WHETHER Myanmar joins Asean depends on whether it is ready to 
     assume
     obligations like those that come with the Asean Free Trade Area, Prime 
     Minister
     Goh Chok Tong said.
     
        He was replying to questions in an interview with Finland's MTV3 on 
     Thursday
     during which he was asked whether Myanmar, given its human rights 
     record, will
     join Asean in the near future.
     <p>
        Mr Goh's reply was that whether Myanmar joins Asean depends instead 
     on
     whether the country is ready to join Asean. "When you join Asean, you 
     have to
     assume certain obligations like the Asean Free Trade Area," he said.  
     
        "You can't just join and not abide by the regulations and 
     obligations of the
     several arrangements that we have for Asean. My own view is I don't 
     think
     Myanmar is quite ready in the near future to adopt all the obligations 
     of being
     a member of Asean."
     <p>
        On whether Myanmar's human rights record raised concerns in this 
     region, Mr
     Goh said: "Our basic principle in dealing with our neighbours is not 
     to
     interfere in their domestic problems. We will accept the countries for 
     what they
     are, their virtues as well as their faults.
     
        "We don't try to change them, we only try to do things better for 
     ourselves
     and hope that as a result of our success, others will also begin to 
     emulate our
     examples."
     <p>
        Mr Goh added that although Myanmar's human rights record is not the 
     same as
     Singapore's, "we don't openly criticise them".
     
        "But in private, though, we have told them if they aspire to be a 
     member of
     Asean, they want more investments from Singapore, they would have to 
     move to
     what we call a more normal form of government," he said. That is how 
     Singapore
     is able to have a good dialogue with Myanmar leaders, he added.
<p>     
        Meanwhile, a statement from the Asean Secretariat said Asean
     Secretary-General Ajit Singh is making a week-long official visit to 
     Myanmar
     from today at the invitation of Myanmar's Foreign Minister, U Ohn 
     Gyaw.

                              The Straits Times (Singapore)<br>
     <br>
                                     November 1, 1996<br>
     

<p>:
         SINGAPORE Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan yesterday called 
     on the
     Government to address allegations, made in an Australian current 
     affairs
     programme, that it had links with a Myanmar drug lord.
     
        Speaking at a press conference, he said the TV show had "suggested 
     Singapore
     was linked with Myanmar drug lord Lo Hsin Han through its investments 
     there".
     
        He added that the programme, Dateline, had made "serious 
     allegations" linking
     Singapore's Government Investment Corporation (GIC) and a company, 
     Asia World,
     headed by him.  
     
        The edition was aired in the middle of last month by Australia's 
     Special
     Broadcasting Service (SBS).
     <p>
        In a joint statement, the SDP and the Singapore Malay National 
     Organisation
     (PKMS) asked the Government to state if there was any truth to the 
     allegations.
     
        Dr Chee said if the report was untrue, SBS had cast a "terrible 
     slur on
     Singapore's integrity and the scandalous and scurrilous aspersions 
     must be
     refuted rigorously".
     
        The Government should lodge an official protest against the 
     Australian
     government and demand a public apology from the station, he added.
     <p>
        It is understood the Singapore High Commission in Canberra filed a 
     protest
     with SBS over the show on Saturday.
     
        SBS was set up in 1978 and broadcasts multilingual TV and radio 
     programmes to
     Australian cities and several regional countries. It is funded mainly 
     by the
     Australian government.
     <p>
        Asked why he was raising the matter now, Dr Chee told reporters at 
     the Golden
     Landmark Hotel: "The SDP and PKMS would be derelict in our duty to 
     uphold the
     good name of our country if we did any less."
     
        He denied suggestions that he was trying to distract Singaporeans 
     from the
     impending verdict by the Privileges Committee on the SDP's contempt of 
     Parliament case.
     
        Asked if he was worried that he could be accused of disloyalty to 
     Singapore
     by raising the allegations of the TV station, he replied: "How can 
     bringing up a
     situation where our nation's integrity has been questioned lead to 
     disloyalty to
     our own country?"
     <p>
     
        Dr Chee, who also issued a written summary of the documentary, 
     asked the
     Government to state clearly that Myanmar's military rulers, the State 
     Law and
     Order Restoration Council (Slorc), with which it was doing business, 
     was not
     involved in drug trafficking.
     
        He also wanted to know if it was true that, despite being described 
     as "one
     of the major drug producers and traffickers" by the Australian Federal 
     Police,
     Lo Hsin Han was allowed to move freely in and out of Singapore.
     
        Another question he posed: Had the Government investigated the 
     background of
     Lo's son who, according to the programme, had set up a business in 
     Singapore and
     had been denied entry to the United States because of suspected 
     drug-related
     activities?
     
        Asked repeatedly how he had come to know about the documentary, 
     which was not
     aired here, Mr Chee said several of his Singaporean friends in 
     Australia had
     called to inform him of it.
     
        Pressed for details, he added he had received a video-tape of the 
     programme,
     but refused to disclose the source. He stressed the SDP "had never 
     requested" a
     copy.
     
        On whether his party had tried to verify any of the programme's 
     allegations
     before calling the press conference, he said it was "not here to 
     verify any of
     the facts", but just wanted the Government to deny the allegations 
     categorically.
     
        Noting it was important to bring issues of such a magnitude to the 
     attention
     of Singaporeans, he added he would be sending the video to the Board 
     of Film
     Censors for it to be approved for public viewing.

<h2>
More New Refugees in Payaw Camp
</h2>
     
<P>
        Since last month, 9 households from loh Thaing village
and 5
<P>
households (total about 100 people) from Rah-Pu village, Yebyu
township in 
<P>
Tenassarim Division have fled to Payaw camp on the Thai-Burma
border due 
<P>
to the harassment and threats by the Slorc troops.  Many more
are on the 
<P>
way to the refugee camp said San Nhan Si, 52 year old Karen -Christian

<P>
refugee who arrived last week to the refugee camp.
<P>
        The villagers especially from the Loh Thaing Karen village
have
<P>
been subjected to human rights abuses by the Slorcs IB 104, stationed
at 
<P>
Kyauk Kadin village commanded by Major Htaung Zar Lian.  After
the 
<P>
fighting of Slorc troops and KNU troops led by Dah Ley on December
2 
<P>
between the Loh Thaing and Rah-Phu village, the harassment towards
Karen 
<P>
local villagers has been intensified.  On December 18, 1995, about
40-60 
<P>
soldiers from IB 104 led by Capt Myint kyaw entered Loh Thaing
village and 
<P>
searched for the people in their lists.  They all searched one
house to 
<P>
house for the suspects who were accused of having contact with
Dah Leys 
<P>
group from KNU or relatives of Dah Ley.  Pe Shwe (male over 50
years old) 
<P>
Pho Kel (male, 30-year-old), Pho Khe (male 50-year-old), Yea Shu
(male, 
<P>
24-year-old), Pe Yeo (a) Saw htoo Khe (male, 42-year-old), Pha
Pe (male, 
<P>
21-year-old), Paw Lwe (male, 35-year-old) Cha Na (male, 45-year-old)
Bli 
<P>
Na (male, 35), Hel Wah (male, 24), Baw Tho (male, 24-year-old)
, Naw Kyel 
<P>
(female, 39-year-old) with her 8-month-old baby, Naw Aye Lo (female,

<P>
42-year-old) Naw Phaw Chel (female, over-30-year-old), Naw Deeje
(female, 
<P>
over-30-year-old), Saw Htoo Tha (male, 67-yar-old) Naw Khlo (female,

<P>
29-year-old), Naw Phaw Pla (female, 21-year-old) with her 2-year-old
baby, 
<P>
Naw Daw The (female 30-year-old), Naw Lu Phaw (female, 20 year-old)
and 
<P>
Kyaw Pho Kho (male, over-30-year-old) were arrested in their house.
Some 
<P>
of them were relatives of Dah ley but some were arrested while
they were 
<P>
visiting their friends houses.
<P>
        Pe Shwe was dragged out of his house and beaten up with
the rifle
<P>
butt into his head. The soldiers asked him whereabouts of Dah
Ley and his 
<P>
family. At least three time, he was beaten up. All men were tied
up with 
<P>
the rope in their waist and all were taken to Kyauk Ka Din village
where 
<P>
the military stationed.
<P>
         &quot;They tied up and tortured us. All the men were
forced to stand in
<P>
the scorching sun for all day long and they were tied both in
their hands 
<P>
and legs.  The women were forced to strip off their clothes before

<P>
standing in the sun and interrogated for all day long without
giving any 
<P>
food nor water&quot; said Naw Kyel, Karen mother of one child
who also fled to 
<P>
Payaw camp last week while she was breeding her child in the refugee
camp.
<P>
        They were kept in the hut and interrogated for four days.
Naw Kyel
<P>
told her nightmare of interrogation.  &quot;There were about three
soldiers and 
<P>
one captain ( Captain Myint Kyaw) interrogated me.  They asked
whether my 
<P>
husband (Pe Yeo who also got arrested with her) had a gun or not.
I said 
<P>
no. The captain pointed out gun into my head and threatened if
I did not 
<P>
say truth, he would have shot right away.  I was scare. He slashed
into my 
<P>
face several time.&quot;
<P>
        After four-day-long interrogation and torture one by one,
all were
<P>
released except Pe Yeo, Pho Khel and Baw Lwe. The release were
ordered to 
<P>
get the information whereabouts of Dah Ley.  Pe Yeo managed to
escape the 
<P>
next day at night but he stepped on booby traps planted around
the army 
<P>
camp and seriously wounded. He could manage to returned back to
his 
<P>
village was given a secret treatment at the hut outside his village.
He 
<P>
died three days later, according to his wife, Naw Kyel.
<P>
        On January 12, 1996, a group of soldiers from IB 401 led
by Major
<P>
Htaung Zar Lian again came to Loh Thaing village. They ordered
the 
<P>
villagers not to go to the east river side of Ye stream where
most of them 
<P>
had the farm. Anybody would be shot with any questioning if found
in that 
<P>
area.  Major Htaung Zar Lian told the villagers that those who
failed to 
<P>
comply with the order of the military in this village would be
punished. 
<P>
we cannot bear any more arrest or torture by the military. Moreover,
the 
<P>
army ordered us to work on the extension of Ye-Tavoy motor road.
Our 
<P>
village was assigned to work between 71 and 74 miles. Villagers
are 
<P>
required to cut and burn the trees and make the ground level of
150 ft for 
<P>
each side of the motor road. How can we work for our survivals.
We cannot 
<P>
go and work to our farm and furthermore we have to work without
any pay 
<P>
for many forced labor projects. Thats why we fled to the refugee
camp. 
<P>
told Saw Htoo Thar.
<P>
        The villagers from Rah- Phu village also faced that fate.
The
<P>
soldiers from 401 also came to the village and threatened to the
village 
<P>
on the same day. They also were not allowed to go and work their
farms in 
<P>
the east side of Ye stream. According to the San Nhan Si from
Ra Phu 
<P>
village, Major Htaung Zar Lian said &quot;You Christian Karen
are 
<P>
trouble-makers. Only you have left to make the destructive things
to the 
<P>
State. All other ethnic have returned to legal-fold even the Buddhist

<P>
Karen. You Christian and students are minion of colony. I will
kill all 
<P>
Christians and students for the sake of our state.&quot;
<P>
        Many refugees are on the way to the Payaw camp or in the
another
<P>
camp right on the border.  Payaw camp is under order or relocation
deeper 
<P>
inside Burma by the Thai authorities.  The food and medical supplies
to 
<P>
the refugee in the Pa Yaw camp will be cut off in the future and
all will 
<P>
be relocated into Burma. The future of refugees is unknown. But
the 
<P>
increasing number of new arrivals indicates the ongoing human
rights 
<P>
violations inside Burma. There are many human rights violations
again the 
<P>
Mon local people although New Mon State Party has reached cease-fire

<P>
agreement with Slorc. Karen villagers are particularly targeted
for giving 
<P>
more pressure towards KNU to sign ceasefire.

<h2>
STATEMENT OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN BURMA, NEW DELHI, 4 - 6 JANUARY, 1996.
</h2>
<P>
 The international Convention for the Restoration of Democracy in
<P>
Burma meeting in New Delhi from 4-6 January, 1996 declare that: - The 
<P>
total denial of democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the will 
<P>
of the people of Burma as expressed in the 1990 general elections, - The
<P>
continuation of an illegal military dictatorship and the expending
<P>
domination of the military over all aspects of Burmese society, - The lack of a
<P>
comprehensive political situation to the civil war, and - The continuing 
<P>
gross human rights violations against the people of Burma- 
<P>
   constitute a serious threat to regional and international security and
<P>
stability. 
<P>
     
<P>
I. Constitutional Issues:
<P>
 The convention believes (a) that a tripartite dialogue involving
<P>
the Burmese democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the
ethnic 
<P>
nationalities, and the military, is the best way to achieve national

<P>
reconciliation and restoration of democracy in Burma, (b) that
the current 
<P>
National Convention to draft a new Constitution to legitimize
military 
<P>
rule in Burma is an illegal and unrepresentative body with no
mandate 
<P>
whatsoever from the people of Burma, (c) that a federal system
of 
<P>
government is the best long-term solution to Burmas long running
civil 
<P>
war. 
<P>
  The International Convention for the Restoration of Democracy
in Burma,
<P>
therefore, strongly supports the National League for Democracys
withdrawal 
<P>
from the sham National Convention in Rangoon, and urge all governments
to 
<P>
not recognize any conclusions adopted by the National Convention.

<P>
     
<P>
II. Human Rights
<P>
 The Convention strongly condemns the continued human rights abuses
<P>
in Burma, including the free flow of information, forced labour,

<P>
particularly of women and children, forced conscription and violation
of 
<P>
cultural and religious rights. we especially condemn the denial
of labour 
<P>
rights and the violations of the rights of women.
<P>
 We demand of SLORC to immediately release all political prisoners.

<P>
 Recognising that thousands of Burmese are forced to leave their
<P>
homes, we call for the recognition, support and protection for
these 
<P>
refugees according to international established principles. This
appeal is 
<P>
particularly directed to Burmas neighbours.
<P>
 We call on the UNHCR to exercise its mandate to protect and
<P>
provide safe havens to refugees from Burma.
<P>
 The international community must have access to Burmese refugees.

<P>
     
<P>
III. Constructive engagement
<P>
 Recognizing that the policy of constructive engagement in its
<P>
various forms actually strengthen the State Law and Order Restoration

<P>
Council and allows it to continue its repressive policies, the
Convention 
<P>
calls for
<P>
     
<P>
(a) an end to international investments and trade with Burma,
(b) all 
<P>
supporters of freedom and democracy to boycott products of companies

<P>
investing and trading with Burma,
<P>
(c) a total boycott of Visit Myanmar Year 1996.
<P>
(d) governments and international financial institutions to refrain
from 
<P>
assisting the illegal military junta in Burma,
<P>
(e) As the worlds largest democracy, the Government of India should

<P>
desist from cooperating with the military regime in Burma and
respond positively
<P>
     
<P>
to Aung San Suu Kyis appeal to India to support the democracy
movement.
<P>
     
<P>
IV. China-Burma Axis
<P>
 The Convention calls upon countries in the region, particularly
<P>
India, to recognise that a democratic Burma with a strong civil
society is 
<P>
the best means to ensure stability and guard against the possibility
of 
<P>
the domination by regional super powers.
<P>
 We are deeply disturbed by the threat to regional and
<P>
international health and security represented by the rapid and

<P>
uncontrolled spread of HIV/AIDS, heroin and opium from Burma,
<P>
 and we do not believe that any military regime can effectively
<P>
implement policies to solve these problems.
<P>
 In conclusion, the Convention calls on all governments and freedom
<P>
loving people to find practical ways to support the Burmese democracy

<P>
movement and help restore genuine democracy to Burma. 
<P>

<h2>
AFP: JAPAN SHOULD WITHDRAW AID TO BURMESE JUNTA: SOROS  
</h2>
<P>
January 17, 1996  
  
<P>
TOKYO--Japan should withdraw aid to Burma until the ruling military
junta  
<P>
proves it is serious about pursuing economic progress free of
political ideology,  
<P>
international investment guru George Soros said Wednesday. Soros
told foreign  
<P>
correspondents that Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration
Council  
<P>
(SLORC) was only interested in self-preservation rather than economic
 
<P>
prosperity for the country, and Japan was helping it stay in power.
&quot;To have  
<P>
Burma, which is a very closed society both externally and internally,
open up is  
<P>
a worthy objective,&quot; said Soros, head of one of the world's
most powerful  
<P>
investment funds. &quot;But the present regime is not   
<P>
interested in that, it is only interested in preserving itself,&quot;
said Soros,  
<P>
who also heads a philanthropic foundation.  
<P>
He said SLORC was &quot;not a viable regime, because it has not
brought economic  
<P>
prosperity&quot; to Burma since seizing power in 1988.  
<P>
&quot;Giving aid can make it (the regime) viable, so it can survive
on this  
<P>
supposedly well meant aid that it is getting from Japan.&quot;
 
<P>
Japan said last October it would resume grants to Burma following
the  
<P>
release by SLORC of Nobel Peace Prize winner and prodemocracy
campaigner  
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi in July from six years of house arrest.  
<P>
Though it began with a first grant-in-aid of $1.6 billion yen
($16  
<P>
million), Tokyo has been cautious about resuming large-scale official
loans  
<P>
for major projects in Burma, and has said the resumption of lending
depended  
<P>
on progress of democratic reforms.  
<P>
Soros said the release of Aung San Suu Kyi was a first step. 

<P>
&quot;But that was the end of what the SLORC was willing to do,
and  
<P>
therefore it ought to be the end of what Japan is willing to do,
but that was  
<P>
only the beginning and Japan is not ending it -- that is where
it is wrong.&quot;  
<P>
&quot;It was wonderful to start, because if you don't give something
you  
<P>
can't take it away,&quot; Soros said. &quot;Now it is time to
take it away, because clearly  
<P>
SLORC is not serious about it wanting to see economic progress.&quot;
 
<P>
  
<P>
The DAILY YOMIYURI added in Soros Raps Myanmar  Aid 
<P>
(January 18, 1996): 
<P>
  
<P>
&quot; I'm involved in trying to help establish open societies
in the countries where they don't exist....and  
<P>
( Myanmar ) is one of the places that qualifies as an oppressive
and closed society, &quot; Soros said.

<h2>
BURMA GAS PIPELINE ROUSES OPPOSITION 
</h2>
 
<P>
Oil groups distance themselves from forced labor. Ted Bardacke
report. 
 
Burma's narrow southern peninsula, once a virtual no mans land,
has become a battlefield. The 
construction of a $ lbn (pound 662m), 409 km pipeline to transport
offshore natural gas across the peninsula 
to Thailand, by an international consortium led by Total of France
and Unocal of the US, has brought deaths 
in the jungle and denunciations in the west. Late March five Total
workers were killed and 11 injured by 
ethnic Karen rebels extracting revenge for the uncompensated expulsion
of villagers along the pipeline 
route. Just last month security forces guarding the pipeline area
came under attack again resulting in a least 
one death. the systematic use of forced labor by Burmese military
units charged with protecting the pipeline 
and its employees, and the projects acute strategic importance
to the Burmese military junta, have made the 
pipeline a target of western human rights activists initiating
consumer boycotts of companies doing business 
in Burma. The forced labor surrounding the project is being trumpeted
loudly by proponents of a recently 
introduced US bill that would outlaw further US investment in
Burma. 
 
<P>
By all account, workers on the pipeline itself are being paid,
and pain well by Burmese standards, 
although kickbacks by workers to the local military officers who
have some power over who gets hired have 
been widely reported. Workers in military camps being set up to
secure the pipeline area are not so lucky. 
Last May the township military authorities ordered us to go to
Heize island. Two hundred of us were there 
for two weeks, clearing grounds, constructing a helicopter pad,
building bamboo barracks and a wooden 
guest house,. We were not paid .... and when we left, more workers
were forced to go to replace us. they 
were not paid either, say Mr. Ohn Thaw, a villager from Kanbauk
who is now a construction worker in 
Bangkok after escaping from Burma late last year. 
 
<P>
Previously uninhabited, the island in question s important for
both construction and operation of the 
pipeline. It is located in the shipping lane through which Total
will transport material and equipment to 
build the pipeline, and near from the Andaman Sea on to Burmese
soil. Mr. Ohn Thaw and other Burmese 
refugees say that as well as getting no wages, they were forced
to pay for the petrol used in the boat which 
took them to the island and were ordered to take their own food.
As soon as we got there, the military 
confiscated our food and then rationed it out to us. It wasn't
enough, only two tins of rice per day; we usually 
eat three, say Mr. Ohn Thaw, who adds that villagers in Kanbauk
who refused to go were either fined 3,000 
kyat (about a months wages) or arrested and sent to zones of conflict
to at as porters for the military. 
 
<P>
Total and Unocal say no operation under their control uses forced
labor. Yet the security situation in 
the area is precarious and one Total executive involved in the
project acknowledges that unless the area is 
pacified, the pipeline wont last the duration of the 30-year gas
purchase agreement signed with their 
Petroleum Authority of Thailand. Mr. John Imle, president of Unocal,
said last year that if you threaten the 
pipeline, there's going to be more military. If forced labor goes
hand in glove with the military, yes, there 
will be more forced labor. For every threat to the pipeline there
will be a reaction. That reaction is apparent 
to Mr. Ohn Thaw. Forced labor shifts in the area around his village
used to be once a year he says. Now its 
three times a year and the time (spend working) is double or triple
what it used o be. 
 
<P>
Citing these allegations among other things, this month US senators
introduced legislation that would 
ban US investment in Burma-which, depending on its legal interpretation,
could force Unocal to pull out of 
the project- until an elected government has taken power in Burma
and international labor standards are 
being adhered to. US campaigning groups, playing up instances
of forced labor, have, 
 
<P>
meanwhile, succeeded in several American cities in enacting selective
purchase legislation prohibiting 
local government purchases from companies investing in Burma.
This year they will seek to push this 
campaign to the state level, which could deny Unocal millions
of dollars in state government contracts. 
 
<P>
These groups are also introducing shareholder resolutions aimed
at prohibiting companies from 
carrying out operations there. In some cases this pressure has
been effective. In 1994 Hong Kong -based 
Victoria Garment Manufacturing Company, which has four factories
in Burma, exported $32m worth of 
textiles to US customers such as Macys, Eddie Bauer and Liz Claiborne.
Under threat of picketing in front 
of stores and disruption of annual meetings, these companies stopped
buying clothes made in Burma. 
Victoria Garments US exports fell to around $10m in 1995 and this
year the company expects it will be 
forced to sack half its 3,300 workers in Burma. 
 
<P>
While such redundancies in mainly hurt workers, disruption of
the pipeline would be disastrous for 
the military regime. Huge reserves of natural gas exist in the
Andaman Sea, and both Texaco and Arco are 
poised to begin production if Total and Unocal can show that delivering
the gas to energy-hungry Thailand 
is feasible. 
 
<P>
Burmese official shave indicated that the hard currency they will
earn from selling the gas may 
eventually allow them to devalue the kyat, the most important
obstacle to, permanently reviving the 
struggling Burmese economy. 
 
<P>
On top of the revenue, some of the gas will be transported by
another pipeline to Rangoon, where it 
will generate electricity and be used to produce fertilizer, things
the Burmese government desperately 
needs. The pipeline is a key to so many projects, says Mr. Set
Maung, economic adviser to the Burmese 
generals. 
 
<P>
Total and Unocal have been at pains publicly to distance themselves
from he Burmese junta. But as 
the pipeline progresses, the relationship is deepening, as the
companies recognize that the military is the 
only real administrative authority in the country, according to
a Total executive. 
 
<P>
Signs of this collaboration turn up in the oddest places. At Ban
I Thong, where the pipeline will cross 
into Thailand, Burmese government troops have taken up strategic
positions on a ridge which is nominally 
in Thailand. In the shirt pocket of a young private, who has tied
a bunch of bananas to his belt laden with 
hand grenades, is a ball-point pen sporting the logo of Total.

5.1.97 <p>

     
     Hong Kong: A Hong Kong investment bank announced yesterday it has 
     decided to stop its operations in Burma, where a privatisation 
     programme has "not materialised" and its operations have been 
     dogged by controversy.
<p>     
     Peregrine Capital Myanmar Ltd (PCM), a subsidiary of Peregrine 
     Investment Holdings Ltd, will close down its office in Rangoon 
     this month, the company said in a statement from its Hong Kong 
     headquarters.
     <p>
     "Unlike other Asian countries, particularly China, a 
     privatisation programme has not materialised in Myanmar (the 
     official name for Burma) and there is little evidence to suggest 
     when it will take place," the company said.
     
     "Furthermore, the anticipated establishment of a securities 
     market has not taken place."
     <p>
     The Burma company was also dogged with problems relating to its 
     former executive chairman Miriam Segal.
     
     Segal was ousted on July 10 after the Hong Kong based investment 
     bank accused her of trying to set up a competing venture in 
     Burma.
     
     She was sued for breach of contract and Peregrine was awarded 4.1 
     million dollars in New York on October 10.<p>

Doing Business in Myanmar

</table>      
December 16, 1996<p>
     
             Politics should not be an issue for international 
     corporations, says a spokesman for the California-based energy compay Unocal, the 
     single largest American investor in the Southease Asian nation of Myanmar. He 
     was replying to suggestions that Unocal pull out of Myanmar.  Business 
     executives as they like to point out, are not social workers.  But at 
     times a government is so repressive and a company's support of it so 
     significat that its presence cannot help but political. South Africa 
     under apartheid was such a country. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is 
     another, and Unocal should not be doing Business there.
     <p>
             For sheer nastiness, few governments can compete with 
     Myanmar's. It winks at heroin trafficking. It forces citizens to provide slave 
     labor  to build bridges and railroads. In 1990 the Government lost elections, 
     then imprisoned and harassed activistes of the victorious party, led 
     by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Last week the Government confined her to her 
     house, detained more of her colleagues and shut down secondary schools to 
     stop student protests. She has called for sanctions on her country.
     <p>
             Myanmar, which has hard-currency reserves that can sustain the
     country for less than three weeks, is vulnerable. Hence the importance 
     of Unocal's 28 percent interest in a pipleline that will pump gas from an 
     off-shore field through Myanmar to Thailand. The French company Total 
     will build the pipeline, and the Thai and Myanmar Government energy 
     companies also have stakes. Texaco and Arco also recently signed deals to drill 
     nearby.
     <p>
             As of last year, Unocal had paid the Government  $6.6 million 
     in signing bonuses. Such fees are normal, but what is not normal was the 
     bailout Unocal gave Myanar in November. The company provided $7 
     million worth of fertilizer on credit to be paid back when the pipeline is 
     runing -- a small but important lifeline for the Government.
     <p>
             Unocal may also be indirectly making profits from 
     reprehensible labour practices. The railroad that will transport Government troops 
     to protect the pipeline was built by thousands of forced laborers. Human 
     rights groups have charged that the Government relocated villages 
     around the pipeline and used forced labour to clear the land. Unocal denies 
     those charges. The Government has not yet permitted an independent 
     investigation.
     <p>
             Unocal is spending $1.6 million to build projects such as 
     schools, animal-breeding farms and a hospital, and has brought 12 doctors to 
     the area. These projects are welcome, but their good does not outweigh the 
     harm of Unocal's support for a government that does not do them on its 
     own.
     <p>
             Unocal argues that an Asian company would simply pick up its 
     share of the project if it pulled out. That is plausible, and underscores 
     that need for the United States to do more to lobby Japan and the 
     Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has said it will admit Myannmar.
     <p>
             But even this does not justify Unocal's continued engagement 
     with Myanmar's Government. Other American corporations, including Macy's 
     and a Disney clothing subsidiary, have already pulled out, responding to 
     publicity and laws approved by Massachusetts and eight cities that bar 
     contracts with companies doing business in Myanmar. Congress has 
     passed a law banning new investment if the crackdown intensifies, but the 
     Clinton Administration has not yet invoked it.
     <p>
             The $200 million in annual revenues expected to flow to 
     Myanmar's Government when the pipeline is runing will dwarf the benefits 
     produced by other American investments. The pipeline's importance, and Unocal's 
     apparent willingness to help sustain the Government, undercut the 
     argument that constructive engagement can change the policies of the Burmese 
     leadership. Unocal may make a handsome profit in Myanmar, but it 
     cannot claim it is bringing change to this blighted nation.

     11/23<p>
     
     NEW YORK (AP) -- In a reprise of the movement that isolated 
     white-ruled South Africa, a growing number of state and local 
     governments now penalize
     companies that do business in Burma -- and the pressure appears to be 
     working.
     
     Motorola and Philips Electronics quietly have joined a corporate 
     pullout from Burma, a Southeast Asian nation where a military junta 
     has crushed dissent.
     <p>
     Next week, Massachusetts steps up the public pressure by releasing a 
     list of companies that will be at a disadvantage when bidding for 
     state contracts because of ties to Burma, which calls itself Myanmar.
     
     Activists say the recent corporate defections are signs of headway in 
     the budding economic protest against the Burmese government.
     
     The Massachusetts law adopted in June is the first such state sanction 
     targeting Burma, but eight cities have approved similar measures -- 
     two of them last month. The movement resembles the attack on 
     businesses dealing with South Africa in the apartheid protests of the 
     1980s.
     <p>
     In the first high-profile case stemming from the latest ``selective 
     contracting'' laws, anti-Burma activists this week were trying to 
     knock Mitsubishi Heavy Industries out of contention for $136 million 
     people-mover project at San Francisco's city-owned airport. Mitsubishi 
     has interests in a Burma pipeline.
     
     ``These laws are now hitting companies where it hurts -- in the bottom 
     line -- and they're beginning to respond,'' said Simon Billenness, 
     senior analyst for the Franklin Research and Development Group, a 
     Boston-based firm that manages investments it considers socially 
     responsible.
     <p>
     But activists are far from declaring victory.
     
     For one thing, many of the businesses that are leaving have little 
     more than a beachhead in Burma. Motorola has a single manager in 
     Rangoon, who is to be transferred by year's end.
     
     For another, Burma's economy is relatively small. Its attraction is 
     mostly to oil companies. Burma's imports from the entire world totaled 
     $1.6 billion in 1995; Indonesia, also criticized by human rights 
     groups, bought twice as much that year from the United States alone.
     
     Also, some companies -- most notably, PepsiCo -- have been criticized 
     for jettisoning their Burmese holdings but continuing sales in Burma 
     through outside distributors.
     <p>
     Philips, the Dutch electronics company, said it stopped limited direct 
     sales in Burma, but will continue to deal with importers serving the 
     country.
     
     In addition, it takes time to wage such protests.
     
     ``We know from our work on South Africa that this may be something 
     that's in process for 20 years or so,'' said Brenda Bateman, who 
     directs the Burma Project for the Investor Responsibility Research 
     Center in Washington.
     <p>
     The IRRC was formed 20 years ago to track corporate affiliations in 
     South Africa. Its latest report lists 234 companies with ties to 
     Burma, 58 of them based in the United States.
     
     The IRRC list is a major source for Massachusetts and the cities with 
     Burma laws: Ann Arbor, Mich., Carrboro, N.C., Madison, Wis., Tacoma 
     Park, Md., and Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco and Santa Monica, 
     Calif.
     <p>
     Massachusetts has advised companies listed by the IRRC about the law, 
     which assesses a 10 percent penalty on new bids from businesses with 
     Burma links.
     
     While companies currently doing business with Massachusetts are on the 
     list, none has a contract bid pending, said Philmore Anderson, the 
     state's purchasing agent. The businesses had until Friday to challenge 
     being on the state's bidding sanctions list, which is due out next 
     week.
     
     Companies are taking the law seriously.
     
     ``Their actions have not gone unnoticed,'' said an official at a 
     company that had received a letter from the state and spoke on 
     condition of anonymity. ``I think every company on that list is 
     addressing the issue one way or another.''
     <p>
     Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola says the Burma pullout is part of a 
     series of cutbacks forecast earlier this month.
     
     ``It's not a political decision. It's a cost-cutting decision,'' 
     spokeswoman Margot Brown said.
     
     Philips cites the ``difficult situation and general uncertainties'' in 
     Burma as a reason for its move.
     <p>
     Companies that already had left Burma include Carlsberg, Heineken, 
     London Fog, Eddie Bauer, Levi Strauss, Petro-Canada, Amoco, Liz 
     Claiborne and Columbia Sportswear, Bateman said. Those resisting 
     pressure include Unocal Corp. and Total SA of France, both oil 
     businesses.
     <p>
     Even when a law passes, there's no guarantee it will be carried out as 
     backers wish. In San Francisco, draft regulations appear to exempt 
     construction firms, like Mitsubishi.
     
     ``Now the struggle will be not to allow anyone to worm out of it,'' 
     said city Supervisor Tom Ammiano, one of the law's sponsors.

Burmese internal affairs affect logging business
</h1></center> 
<i>Thailand Times</i><br>
     December 30, 1996<br>
     by Assawin Pinitwong<p>
     
Recent protests against the Burmese government in Rangoon 
     have adversely affected the logging business along the Thai- 
     Burmese border, according to Thai businessmen in the border area.
     <p>
     The demonstrations have prompted the State Law and Order 
     Restoration Council (Slorc) to suspend the export of logs, 
     particularly from the Kayah and Karen states. More than 10,000 
     teak logs due to be exported still remain on the Burmese side, 
     the businessmen said.
     <p>
     The junta were afraid that the protests could spark off 
     anti-SLORC offensives led by ethnic minority groups in the border 
     areas, which in turn could provide an opportunity for the groups 
     to benefit from the lucrative logging trade.
     <p>
     The Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), whose stronghold
     is at the border area opposite the Thai province of Mae Hong Son, has 
     reportedly issued a statement calling for assistance from democratic 
     countries.
     <p>
     The statement, made by the group led by Kayah Prime Minister Gen Aung 
     Than
     Lay, also indicated that they will support any moves against the 
     SLORC.
     <p>
     The KNPP condemned the SLORC, which it considers to be an unlawful 
     government, and its use of military force against pro-democracy 
     campaigners.
     <p>
     The latest student protests started early this month when a large 
     number of
     students took to the streets in Rangoon. Hundreds of protesters were 
     reportedly detained by the junta, although some of them have since 
     been
     released.
     <p>
     A meeting among eight anti-SLORC ethnic minority groups (Karen 
     National
     Union (KNU), KNPP, Mon. Pao, Arakan, Wah, and Chin) will be held next 
     month.
     Representatives from the Shan minority, some of whom defected from 
     drug
     warlord Khun Sa, will observe the gathering as well.
     <p>
     Khun Sa, leader of the Mong Tai Army, surrendered to the military  
     regime in
     January.  However, many of MTA soldiers fled the troops before the 
     surrender
     in order to continue the struggle for independence.

Marubeni commits to work for Burmese Military Regime
</h1></center> 

     December 25, 1996
<p>     
     Tokyo, Dec. 25 (Jiji Press)--Marubeni Corp. has agreed with the 
     Myanmar
     government to jointly produce rice for livestock feed in the country, 
     company officials said Wednesday.
     <p>
     The major trading firm, together with Myanmar's Ministry of 
     Agriculture 
     and Forests, will set up a joint venture there in the spring of 1997 
     to 
     propel the project.
     <p>
     Marubeni will put up the majority of the new company's capital, which 
     is 
     expected to total around 1.5 million dollars. Using the seeds and 
     technical skills developed by an Indian company which is in a business 
     tie-up with Marubeni, the joint venture will aim to produce 3 million 
     tons of livestock feed rice annually in the future, according to 
     company 
     officials.
     <p>
     Marubeni's move came in response to growing demand for livestock grain 
     in 
     line with a rise in meat consumption, the officials said.
     <p>
     The company will export the products to Asian countries from the year 
     2000, and plans an annual output of 150,000 tons in the year 2004, 
     they said.

UNOCAL has reason to worry

<i>Business Times</i>
January 1, 1997<p>
     
     IF I were Unocal, the Los Angeles-based giant that is a partner in the 
     controversial gas pipeline project in Burma (officially known as 
     Myanmar),
     I'd be worried sick. 
     
     The Clinton administration, sullied by the sordid picture of a stream 
     of
     exceptionally generous Asian businessmen sauntering by the White House 
     for
     little policy chats, may soon have to take a high-minded moral stand 
     somewhere in Asia. China is obviously too important to mess with, so 
     Burma
     may just fit the bill. 
     
     I think it'll be a bumpy road at best for any US company still doing 
     business there. 
     <p>
     Almost no one outside Asia can abide Slorc, the odd acronym for the 
     State
     Law and Order Restoration Council, the ruling junta's official name. 
     
     Pointedly, US Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright heaps 
     public
     praise on Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, the 
     internationally
     acclaimed internal opponent of SLORC.  Protests are popping up on US 
     college
     campuses, and some localities have already voted to spurn contracts 
     with US
     businesses involved with Burma. 
     <p>
     Major US newspapers, including the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>and <i>The New York 
     Times</i>,
     have published editorials critical of Unocal. 
     
     The pressure mounts on the world's 12th largest oil company to head 
     gracefully for the exit, as have companies like Apple Computers and 
     Levi
     Strauss. It's easy to envision US economic sanctions, or at least 
     selective
     boycotts, in Burma's star-crossed future. <p>

     December 19, 1996
<br>     
     Retired Union Member Submits Resolution for 1997 Shareholders Meeting<br>
     
     LAKEWOOD, Colo., Dec. 19  -- Robert E. Wages, president of the 
     90,000-member
     Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union (OCAW), today 
     called on
     Unocal Corporation to "clean up its dirty international business" and 
     to
     investigate the allegation that Unocal's major partner in a joint 
     venture in
     Burma is serving as a conduit for laundering money obtained from the 
     illegal
     production and sale of heroin.
     <p>
     This week a retired OCAW member and former local union officer filed a 
     shareholders' resolution to be voted on by shareholders at Unocal's 
     1997
     annual meeting, calling for the outside company board members to 
     investigate
     the drug laundering allegation; determine if company officials had any 
     knowledge of it; and recommend a course of action based on the 
     findings.
     <p>
     The allegation was made public in the December 16, 1996 issue of The 
     Nation,
     which reported on findings from a four-year investigation by the 
     Geopolitical Drugwatch in Paris that the Myanmar Oil and Gas 
     Enterprise
     (MOGE), a partner with Unocal in the construction of a natural gas 
     line
     across the southern peninsula of Burma, was the major channel for 
     laundering
     the revenues of heroin produced and exported by the Burmese Army.
     <p>
     According to the State Department, Burma is currently the largest 
     producer
     of illegal heroin in the world, and 60 percent of the heroin seized by 
     law
     enforcement officials in the U.S. comes from Burma.
     
     "If the drug laundering allegation is true, it is very unlikely that 
     this
     could have occurred without the knowledge of Unocal officials," said 
     Wages.
     "Uncovering the truth may mean that Unocal bears direct responsibility 
     for
     the rise in heroin use in the U.S.," he added.
     <p>
     He termed the drug laundering allegation "deeply disturbing, which, if 
     substantiated and coming on the heels of widespread condemnation of 
     Unocal's
     links to the use of child and slave labor in Burma, will expose the 
     crucial
     connection between the company's dirty deeds in Burma and the 
     destruction of
     our communities in the U.S."
     
     "It appears that Unocal, by abandoning its U.S. operations to take 
     advantage
     of low wage and slave labor in Asia, is leaving us with a bitter 
     legacy," 
     said Wages.
     
     "It's ironic," he added, "that in the search for higher profits, 
     Unocal
     management has placed its shareholders, many of whom are OCAW members, 
     at
     great risk since it is clear that the democratic forces in Burma will 
     prevail, and Unocal will eventually be held accountable for crimes 
     against
     the Burmese people."
     <p>
     Wages said his union is becoming more active in the movement to hold 
     Unocal
     accountable for its actions in Burma.  "We have a lot at stake in this 
   our jobs, our communities, and the right of people everywhere to live 
     with
     fairness, dignity and respect," he said.
  <p>   
     OCAW currently represents oil workers at Unocal refineries in 
     California and
     at the Uno-Ven refinery in Lemont, I11. (near Chicago), owned jointly 
     by
     Unocal and PDVSA, the government-owned oil company of Venezuela.  In 
     November, Unocal announced its intent to sell its West Coast refining, 
     marketing and transportation assets to Tosco Corporation.

<p>
December 10, 1996<p>
     
     Your December 8th article about the Total/Unocal/SLORC gas pipeline 
     through Burma was extremely one-sided in its portrayal of Unocal as 
     a humanitarian corporate good-guy. This is far from the truth. 
     Unocal stands to make billions from the pipeline over the ensuing 
     years. By its very nature, the deal is immersed in politics, contrary 
     to Unocal's statements. 
     <p>
     Unocal is wrong when it says "they are simply oilmen_and should not 
     be held accountable for the behavior of their host country." It is 
     this claim, based not on reality, but fantasy, that has attempted to 
     cover the stink of corporations while they wipe out lives, cultures 
     <p>
     and the environment in other, less industrialized countries. At 
     this very moment weapons purchased with money from US investments 
     are being used to squash pro-democracy demonstrators.
     <p>
     Missing from your report were any comments by those opposed to the 
     project. The National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma 
     (NCGUB) is made up of elected representatives of the 1990 general 
     elections, democratically chosen by the people of Burma. After the 
     National League for Democracy, led by Aung SanSuu Kyi, won more 
     than 82% of the seats in Parliament, the State Law and Order 
     Restoration Council (SLORC) refused to yield power.
     <p>
     The SLORC uses forced labor, torture and rape to get what it wants, 
     kills dissenters at will and has created a country where the citizens 
     are in constant fear. Opposition brings quick reprisal. The only 
     reason Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is still alive is that she has become 
     an international figure. Others who have opposed the SLORC are not 
     so fortunate.
     <p>
     Because of Unocal's refusal to abide by the demands of the elected 
     government, the SLORC stands to reap billions from its part in the 
     pipeline deal. None of this income will help the people of Burma, 
     since the SLORC spends almost half of its budget on weapons, while 
     spending less than 20% on social programs. The government is at war 
     with no one except its own people.
     <p>
     Unocal is also not being responsible to its shareholders, since any 
     contracts made during the reign of the illegitimate military 
     government 
     will need to be reviewed by the democratic government when it regains 
     control. Since the social and environmental impacts of the pipeline 
     are enormous, it is likely that the project will not continue in its 
     current form. The pipeline has already had a devastating impact on 
     Burma's rainforests, and future impacts on marine life are certain. 
     Unocal is being loose with its shareholders' money.
     <p>
     SLORC-guided tours for journalists do not include visits with any 
     opposed to the project, such as those forced into labor for roads and 
     other infrastructure and those who were forcefully relocated and/or 
     fled to Thailand as refugees. Showpieces such as a few schoolhouses 
     are far outweighed by the impact the pipeline will have on the 
     countryside and its people, and are crumbs compared to the billions 
     Unocal stands to make.
     <p>
     Big international corporations are immersed in politics, whether they 
     would like us to think so or not. Simply claiming that "politics 
     should not be an issue" for them does not make the truth go away. 
     Unocal is funding the SLORC. They are involved in politics.
     <p>
     Unocal has chosen to deal with thugs and hide behind false statements 
     of non-interference.
     <p>
     The people of Burma who elected Aung San Suu Kyi's party to lead the 
     country know better. The democratically-elected Prime Minister has 
     called for companies to cease investments in Burma until democracy 
     is restored. If Unocal was truly apolitical, it would abide by the 
     wishes of the Burmese people and do just that.
     <p>
     Sincerely,
     <p>
     Dr. Thaung Htun, Representative for UN Affairs <br>
     National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma<br>

     The Reuter Asia-Pacific Business Report<br>

Rangoon, December 2<br>
     
        Spie Capag Co of France has 
     started laying a 64-km onshore pipeline that will carry natural 
     gas from Burma's Yadana offshore gas field to the western Thai 
     border, official media reported on Monday.
     
        State-run newspapers said the pipe-laying began at a village 
     in the southeastern coastal region of Taninthayi on Sunday.  
     
        Spie Capag is due to finish laying the pipeline by late 
     1997.
<p>     
        The 36-inch onshore pipeline, together with a separate 
     360-km offshore pipeline, will carry about 650 million cubic 
     feet a day of natural gas from Yadana from 1998. About 525 
     million cubic feet a day of that will be exported to Thailand.
     
        Early last year the Myanmar Oil and Natural Gas Enterprise 
     signed a 30-year contract to supply the Petroleum Authority of 
     Thailand (PTT) with Yadana natural gas through the pipeline.
     <p>
        Statistics of the energy ministry said the Yadana field in 
     the Bay of Mottama has 5.7 trillion cubic feet commercial 
     reserves of natural gas.

Agence France Presse<br>
     
                               December 02, 1996 <br>
          
 Matthew Pennington, Rangoon<p>
     
Amid international calls for an economic boycott of Burma, a 
     prominent
     Japanese government MP is paving the way for companies from Japan to 
     invest in
     joint ventures here with businesses backed by the military junta.
     
        Kazuo Tanikawa, a former director-general of defence services, 
     visited
     Rangoon at the weekend as chairman of Japan Trans-Techno Company 
     (JTT), which on
     December 12 will launch a new "business association" to open up 
     investment
     opportunities in Burma.
     
        Tanikawa, an MP for Japan's ruling Liberal Democrat Party, says in 
     the
     association's brochure that Burma is "the final frontier in southeast 
     Asia ...
     just now rising as an open country."
     <p>
        About 30 small and medium-sized Japanese companies have become 
     members of the
     Japan-Myanmar Technology Transfer Enterprise Association, to be 
     operated by JTT
     for planning and financing technology-based enterprises across the 
     country.  
     
        JTT president Etsuo Takai told AFP the association aims to 
     establish a fund
     of two billion yen (20 million dollars) to promote ventures. So far 
     about one
     quarter of this has been gathered from member companies.
     
        The first project is to build a two million dollar car repair plant 
     on the
     outskirts of Rangoon early next year, with technical expertise and 
     training for
     local mechanics supplied by the Takikawa Group (Sapporo).
     <p>
        The Burmese partner, which has supplied the two-acre (one hectare) 
     site for
     the plant, will be the new Myan Gon Myint Company, which includes at 
     least four
     government ministers on its board of directors, he said.
     <p>
        According to Rangoon-based analysts, the Burmese company is a 
     business
     concern of the government's civilian mass organisation, the Union 
     Solidarity
     Development Association (USDA).
     USDA was recently accused by Burma's opposition of involvement in a 
     mob attack on a motorcade carrying Aung San Suu Kyi and senior aides from 
     her National League for Democracy (NLD).
     <p>
        The NLD, which won the last general elections to be held in Burma 
     but has been prevented by the military from taking power, advocates 
     international economic sanctions against Burma, saying foreign investment only 
     benefits the junta and its associates. Takai denied any direct link between the new venture and USDA, 
     playing down reports in state media that implied otherwise.
     <p>
        The New Light of Myanmar daily reported Sunday that former minister 
     Tanikawa-- who was heading a delegation including the directors of 16 Japanese 
     member companies in the association -- hosted a dinner Saturday for top 
     members of USDA. Among the guests was Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of 
     the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), as the junta 
     is officially known, and Than Aung, the secretary-general of USDA, who is 
     also minister for cooperatives. Also attending was Yoichi Yamaguchi, Japan's ambassador to Burma.
     <p>
        Asked to comment on the joint venture with the Myan Gon Myint 
     Company, a Japanese embassy official said the mission was not in any position to 
     interfere in the operations of private businesses.  "We can only explain to them the political and economic situation  in Myanmar  (Burma), which we have done," said the official.
     Takai said it was important for the mission to make high-level 
     contacts, in what JTT hopes will smooth the way for further projects involving 
     private and public Burmese companies in sectors such as food-processing, 
     timber-processing and concrete production.
     <p>
        Each project will be a venture, between the association, a 
     specialist Japanese company supplying the technology and training and a Burmese 
     enterprise,
     with the association likely to hold a majority share.
     <p>
        For its services as operator and business-matchmaker, JTT will 
     receive a 20
     percent dividend from the association's investment in each project, 
     with the
     other 80 percent going to the association's member companies in 
     proportion to
     the investment shares they hold.

December 4, 1996, <p>

    A Singaporean company has signed a contract with the state-run 
     Myanmar farms enterprise making investment in agriculture in Myanmar.  the company 
     --Kee Aun (tong san) pte ltd. is to reclaim low-lying areas in Pantanaw 
     township, cultivate high quality paddy and establish a rice mill for milling and 
     marketing under the contract signed here tuesday, the official paper the new 
     light of Myanmar reported today.  Since Myanmar opened its doors to foreign 
     investment, there had been only one project in agriculture with an investment of 
     2.69 million US dollars by the end of October this year, according to the 
     official statistics.  More investment in this sector, both local and foreign, 
     is being encouraged for Myanmar is rich in agricultural land resources and 
     agricultural labor is relatively cheap.

     November 15, 1996<br>
     MICHELE COOPER<br>
     AFP<p>
     
     KANBAUK, Burma - Total's controversial natural gas pipeline route 
     across
     
     southeastern Burma traces a red gash through the otherwise green 
     countryside, and is changing forever the lives of local residents.
     
     Critics link the billion-dollar project to human rights abuses and 
     environmental damage and say it is financing the ruling junta's 
     efforts top
     tighten its grip on power.
     <p>
     Total says there are no human rights abuses on the project, that 
     environmental damage is insignificant as the pipeline traverses 
     already
     degraded forests and that it is not a political actor on the Burma 
     stage.
     <p>
     Intent on seeing through the lucrative 30-year contract and signing 
     more
     based on new gas finds in the Andaman Sea, Total executives have 
     mounted a
     campaign to win the hearts and minds of local residents.
     
     And while they say it is not the primary goal of the program, they 
     acknowledge campaign will probably help ease security concerns in a 
     volatile
     area.
     
     "We plan to be here for 30 years," Herve Madeo, general manager of 
     Total
     Myanmar Exploration and Production, told foreign correspondents flown 
     in
     this week for a whirlwind tour of construction sites and neighbouring 
     villages.
     
     "The most important point is to integrate the project into this area. 
     Obviously a consequence of that is the security of the pipeline," he 
     acknowledged.
     <p>
     The only incident to date, Madeo said, was on March 8, 1995, when 
     unidentified, heavily-armed attackers ambushed a survey team near the 
     Kanbauk base camp, killing five Burmese nations.
     <p>
     To integrate the project into the area, Total has given jobs to people 
     who
     previously had few sources of income aside from subsistence 
     agriculture and
     fishing.
     
     Wages for unskilled labor start at 200 kyats, or about 1.35 dollars, a 
     day
     at the prevailing market rate. An entry-level civil servant earns, in 
     comparison, a basic salary of 17.50 kyats a day.
     <p>
     Total has also built classrooms and clinics, and started pig-, 
     poultry- and
     goat-farming projects in order to give villagers new economic options.
     
     Projects will, it is hoped, become self-sustaining in short order. "We 
     don't
     want to create a situation of eternal dependency," said Joseph Daniel, 
     Total's Paris-based vice-president for public affairs.
     <p>
     Already they point to the small independent food stalls and tea shops 
     that
     have sprung up around construction sites, and to the thriving business 
     one
     Kanbuak merchant has established in importing shiny new bicycles.
     <p>
     Critics of the project, from pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi 
     to
     political exiles abroad, object that such things, and the fat that gas 
     revenues are likely to become a major source of funds for the 
     government,
     serve only to prolong junta rule.
     
     The Paris-based International Human Rights Federation last month 
     alleged
     "massive and systematic human rights violations" in connection with 
     the
     pipeline project which, it said, constitutes "moral and economic 
     support for
     the ruling junta.
     
     The allegations are, in fact, aimed mostly at the government and the 
     army,
     inextricably linked in the State law and Order Restoration Council 
     (Slorc),
     as the junta is officially known.
     <p>
     But critics say that Total and its foreign partners - US-based Unocal 
     and
     Thailand's PTT - are at the very least guilty by association.
     
     In a report entitled "Total Denial" and issued in July, Earth Rights 
     International and Southeast Asian Information Network warned it might 
     not be
     possible to determine in time "whether the sale of Burma's natural gas 
     under
     Slorc has helped the country develop or simply enriched the generals."
     <p>
     Daniel said Total had no political agenda - "in the oil business, you 
     can
     begin working with one regime and finish with another" - but was 
     convinced
     he 30-year project would benefit the country as a whole.
     
     
     Total executives have shrugged off calls to halt foreign investment in 
     Burma, saying economic sanctions are the purview of countries, not 
     companies. (TN)

                                     November 3, 1996<br>

 Frederic Bobin<p>

        THE French oil company, Total says it is scandalised by allegations 
     made in a
     report published on October 23 by the French-based International 
     Federation of
     Human Rights Leagues (FIDH). The report contains what it describes as 
     "damning
     evidence" that human rights have been violated in the course of work 
     on a
     colossal gas pipeline project in Burma. Total is the main company 
     involved,
     along with the US corporation Unocal.
     <p>
        The 400km pipeline, which will run from the Gulf of Martaban across 
     the
     region of south Tenasserim to the border with Thailand, is the biggest 
     investment project to be carried out in Burma.
     
        Total has regularly been criticised for the pipeline. It offers 
     three lines
     of defence: the project does not in any way provide support for the 
     Burmese
     ruling junta, since the gas deposits will not begin to generate 
     revenues until
     2001-02; the company has not used any forced labour on the site; and 
     the project
     is of benefit to the local population because Total has been promoting 
     smallscale development projects.
     <p>
        It is precisely that argument which the FIDH report sets out to 
     refute. It
     contends that the pipeline project constitutes a form of "economic 
     support" for
     the Burmese junta, which "is already profiting financially from the 
     pipeline
     through loans secured on future revenues".
     
        The report also claims the pipeline project has been responsible 
     for blatant
     human rights violations by the regime. "Whether with the aim of 
     assuring
     security" in a region subject to an endemic rebellion by certain 
     ethnic
     minorities (the Karen and the Mon), or of "clearing the area with a 
     view to
     building infrastructure necessary for the pipeline", Burmese troops 
     have carried
     out "massive population transfers".
     <p>
        The report claims 30,000 people have been moved since 1901. On the 
     issue of
     forced labour, while the FIDH accepts that Total has imposed a code of 
     good
     behaviour on itself when hiring personnel, it denounces the army's 
     forced
     recruitment of villagers for the purpose of carrying out tasks 
     "directly
     connected with the pipeline site".
     
        All this evidence leads the FIDH to conclude that "had it not been 
     for the
     pipeline, all or some of those violations would not have taken place". 
     In that
     respect, it says, Total is morally accountable.

        With some success, activists opposing Burma's ruling junta have 

     leaned on

     U.S. companies doing business in Burma, pushing boycotts, shareholder 

     resolutions and legislation.

     

        Now, loosely knit groups are taking their case to court.  They have 

     trained

     their sights on Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp.

     
<p>
        The lawsuits represent a nexus of two points of international 

     social

     pressure.  One is to target nondemocratic regimes by leaning on 

     specific

     multinational companies.  The other is to use American courts to hold 

     those

     multinational firms responsible for actions overseas.  

     <p>

        "Different tactics, different pressure points are coming together," 

     said

     Simon Billenness, a stock analyst with Franklin Research & Development 

     of Boston

     and one of the coordinators of the get-business-out-of-Burma movement.

     

        "The question is: How much pressure needs to be put on Unocal 

     before they

     crack?"

     
<p>
        Since September, two lawsuits have been filed in Los Angeles courts 

     against

     Unocal's joint venture in Burma.  The lawsuits allege human-rights 

     violations

     and seek damages and a halt to a billion-dollar pipeline that will 

     bring

     offshore natural gas through Burma to Thailand.

     

        Unocal's joint-venture partners are the French oil company Total 

     and the

     state-controlled Myanma Oil & Gas Enterprise.

     
<p>
        U.S. pressure working consumer pressure has been particularly 

     effective with

     business related to Burma, where a repressive military dictatorship 

     rules and

     where only a limited number of U.S. companies operate.

     

        Apple Computer just announced it would no longer do business in 

     Burma. It

     reacted to recent Massachusetts legislation, which prohibits state 

     contracts

     with companies operating in Burma.  A number of cities, including San 

     Francisco,

     Oakland and Santa Monica, have passed similar ordinances.



        The ordinances bar public-sector entities under city or state 

     control from

     buying, say, Pepsi or Unocal gasoline.
<p>        In the past year, garment manufacturers London Fog, Oshkosh B'Gosh 

     and

     Columbia Sportswear have pulled out of Burma, citing consumer 

     pressures. These

     followed withdrawals in 1995 by Eddie Bauer and Macy's.

     

        As high-profile as these withdrawals may be, they represent small 

     change

     compared to Unocal's operation.  According to Unocal's own estimates, 

     the

     pipeline will cost $1.2 billion and could bring as much as $200 

     million a year

     in revenue.  Unocal holds 28.26 percent of the joint venture.

     

        It is, by far, the biggest single foreign investment in Burma.  The 

     project

     is due to be completed in mid-1998.
<p>
     

        In the past, oil companies have shown little willingness to change 

     in the

     face of public expressions of displeasure when it comes to overseas 

     investment.

     Unocal is no exception.

     

        "We remain firmly committed to this project," said David Garcia, a 

     Unocal

     spokesman.  The pipeline, he added, "will bring tangible longterm 

     benefits to

     this country."

     

        Garcia also said his company refuses to get "sucked into political

     gamesmanship" when it comes to taking sides on Burma's government.

     
<p>


     

        Burma's junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or 

     SLORC, seized

     control of the Southeast Asian country in 1988 in a bloody takeover.  

     The

     military regime repeatedly has been condemned as brutal and repressive 

     by a

     number of international human-rights organizations, including the 

     United Nations

     Commission on Human Rights.

     

        At issue, though, is whether the pipeline project itself 

     exacerbates the

     repression in Burma.  The plaintiffs believe so.

     

        "In connection with this joint venture, thousands of citizens of 

     Burma

     represented by plaintiffs have been subjected to serious human-rights 

     abuses,"

     reads one of the lawsuits.

<p>     
Specifically, the two lawsuits allege that the project has resulted 

     in slave

     labor, forced relocation of entire villages and, in some cases, 

     torture, rape

     and murder by Burmese soldiers.

     

        "Conscripted labor has been used in the physical preparation of the 

     route of

     the pipeline," said one of the plaintiffs, Luisa Benson.

     

        The plaintiffs blame Burma's junta. But the two groups of 

     plaintiffs, led by

     exiled Burmese in the United States, allege that under a number of 

     U.S. and

     California laws, Unocal must assume responsibility for the actions of 

     one of its

     partners.

   <p>  

        "Unocal is engaged with a joint-venture partner.  The partner is 

     ordering

     forced labor.  The partner is conspiring to violate human rights," 

     said John

     Bonifaz, the lead attorney for the National Coalition Government of 

     the Union of

     Burma.

        "We don't think it is necessary to prove that Unocal directly 

     ordered the

     forced labor in order for them to be held liable."

     
<p>
        Unocal responds that the lawsuits are "politically motivated." 

     Garcia said

     that Unocal "continues to believe that the suits are without merit.  

     We will

     defend ourselves vigorously."

     

        The company termed "false, irresponsible and frivolous" the 

     accusation that

     there are human rights abuses on the pipeline.  Garcia said that all 

     laborers

     employed on the project are being paid and that the company has 

     detailed records

     proving payment.

     

        Garcia declined to comment further on the suits, saying the company 

     has yet

     to be served with one of the two lawsuits.  He also said his company 

     "will

     respond in the appropriate forum at the appropriate time." (The 

     company won't be

     required by the courts to make a written response until at least 

     mid-December.)

     <p>

        Garcia also objected to calling Burma's junta a joint-venture 

     partner and

     made the distinction between the military junta and Myanma Oil & Gas.

     
<p>
        Jurisdiction an issue
<p>
     

        That will be one issue the court must sort through.  Other issues 

     include

     whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction over human-rights abuses 

     inflicted by

     foreign nationals in other countries and whether ancillary work done 

     in

     conjunction with the project is the responsibility of the project 

     partners.

     
<p>
        Legal authorities believe this kind of lawsuit has precedence.  

     They point to

     a number of successful U.S. civil suits dealing with human-rights 

     violations

     abroad, such as those inflicted by the Marcos dictatorship in the 

     Philippines.

     For such victims, using American courts is becoming an accepted 

     practice.

     

        In addition, two pending cases attempt to hold American 

     corporations

     responsible for actions overseas.

     <p>

        "There's growing recognition of the inter-connectiveness of all 

     this, of

     corporate decisions made here with results happening a long ways 

     away," said

     Naomi Roht-Arriaza, a professor at University of California Hastings 

     College of

     Law and an authority on international law.

     

        "Slowly but surely there's a willingness among lawyers and judges 

     in the U.S.

     to listen to this and take it seriously."

     
<p>
        Still, one activist said he holds little hope of an immediate 

     victory.

     Instead, the head of the Free Burma Coalition in Madison, Wis., known 

     only as

     Zarni, said the movement's overall aim is for legislated sanctions.  

     The Senate

     has been working on legislation that would make it illegal for 

     American

     companies to invest in Burma, but no action was taken before this 

     session ended.

     

        Sanctions on hold administration has so far resisted such a move, 

     saying that

     it wouldn't be effective and that Asian-led projects would replace 

     American

     investment. Several Southeast Asian nations, as well as business 

     interests such

     as Unocal, maintain "constructive engagement" -- what now is being 

     applied to

     China -- would lead to democratic reform, rather than cutting off 

     Burma's junta

     entirely.

<p>        The demand for sanctions has been gaining some ground recently.  In 

     July,

     Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who was imprisoned for several 

     years for

     nonviolent opposition to the junta, called for international 

     sanctions.

     

        Activists say her stand bolsters their belief that Burma is more 

     akin to

     South Africa under apartheid than to other repressive countries in 

     Asia such as

     China.  Chinese dissidents are divided about trade sanctions.

     

        In South Africa, then-opposition leader Nelson Mandela led the 

     fight for

     international trade sanctions.  Mandela is now president.
